		PREFACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The following Synopsis was originally written and published in French, at the desire and more immediately for the use of Christians speaking that language.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A few words only are needed to introduce the reader to the present publication.<a name=1:2></a> He is not to expect a commentary, nor, on the other hand, to suppose that he has a book which he can read without referring continually to the Word itself in the part treated of.<a name=1:3></a> The object of the book is to help a Christian, desirous of reading the Word of God with profit, in seizing the scope and connection of that which it contains.<a name=1:4></a> Though a commentary may doubtless aid the reader in many passages in which God has given to the commentator to understand in the main the intention of the Spirit of God, or to furnish philological principles and information, which facilitate to another the discovery of that intention; yet if it pretend to give the contents of Scripture, or if he who uses it seeks this in its remarks, such commentary can only mislead and impoverish the soul.<a name=1:5></a> A commentary, even if always right, can at most give what the commentator has himself learned from the passage.<a name=1:6></a> The fullest and wisest must be very far indeed from the living fulness of the divine Word.<a name=1:7></a> The Synopsis now presented has no pretension of the kind.<a name=1:8></a> Deeply convinced of the divine inspiration of the Scriptures, given to us of God, and confirmed in this conviction by daily and growing discoveries of their fulness, depth, and perfectness; ever more sensible, through grace, of the admirable perfection of the parts, and the wonderful connection of the whole, the writer only hopes to help the reader in the study of them.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Scriptures have a living source, and living power has pervaded their composition: hence their infiniteness of bearing, and the impossibility of separating any one part from its connection with the whole, because one God is the living centre from which all flows; one Christ, the living centre round which all its truth circles, and to which it refers, though in various glory; and one Spirit, the divine sap which carries its power from its source in God to the minutest branches of the all-united truth, testifying of the glory, the grace, and the truth of Him whom God sets forth as the object and centre and head of all that is in connection with Himself, of Him who is, withal, God over all.<a name=1:10></a> blessed for evermore.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To give all this as a whole and perfectly would require the Giver Himself.<a name=1:12></a> Even in learning it, we know in part, and we prophesy in part.<a name=1:13></a> The more -- beginning from the utmost leaves and branches of this revelation of the mind of God, by which we have been reached when far from Him -- we have traced it up towards its centre, and thence looked down again towards its extent and diversity, the more we learn its infiniteness and our own feebleness of apprehension.<a name=1:14></a> We learn, blessed be God, this, that the love which is its source is found in unmingled perfectness and fullest display in those manifestations of it which have reached us even in our ruined state.<a name=1:15></a> The same perfect God of love is in it all.<a name=1:16></a> But the unfoldings of divine wisdom in the counsels in which God has displayed Himself remain ever to us a subject of research in which every new discovery, by increasing our spiritual intelligence, makes the infiniteness of the whole, and the way in which it surpasses all our thoughts, only more and more clear to us.<a name=1:17></a> But there are great leading principles and truths, the pointing out of which in the various books which compose the Scriptures, may assist in the intelligence of the various parts of Scripture.<a name=1:18></a> It is attempted to do this here.<a name=1:19></a> What the reader is to expect, consequently, in this Synopsis, is nothing more than an attempt to help him in studying Scripture for himself.<a name=1:20></a> All that would turn him aside from this would be mischievous to him; what helps him in it may be useful.<a name=1:21></a> He cannot even profit much by the following pages otherwise than in using them as an accompaniment to the study of the text itself.<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From what has been said it will easily be understood that the writer can readily feel the imperfection of what he has written.<a name=1:23></a> Often he would have liked to have introduced the developments which he has enjoyed, when unfolding particular passages in detail and applying them to the hearts and consciences of others; but this would have turned him aside from the object of the work.<a name=1:24></a> He trusts, however, that the right direction is given to the scriptural researches of the reader: grace alone can make those researches effectual.<a name=1:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He cannot close this short introduction to the book without expressing the effect which the discovery of the perfectness and divinely ordered connection of the Scriptures produces in his mind as respects what is called Rationalism.<a name=1:26></a> Nothing is proved by the system so denominated but the total absence of all divine intelligence, a poverty associated with intellectual pretension, an absence of moral judgment, a pettiness of observation on what is external, with a blindness to divine and infinite fulness in the substance, which would be contemptible through its false pretensions, if it were not a subject of pity, because of those in whom these pretensions are found.<a name=1:27></a> None but God can deliver from the pride of human pretension.<a name=1:28></a> But the haughtiness which excludes God, because it is incompetent to discover Him, and then talks of His work, and meddles with His weapons, according to the measure of its own strength, can prove nothing but its own contemptible folly.<a name=1:29></a> Ignorance is generally confident, because it is ignorant; and such is the mind of man in dealing with the things of God.<a name=1:30></a> The writer must be forgiven for speaking plainly in these days on this point.<a name=1:31></a> The pretensions of infidel reason infect even Christians.<a name=1:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He would add that it has not been his object to unfold the blessed fruits the Word produces in the mind and ways of him who receives it, nor the feelings produced in his own mind in reading it, but to help the reader in the discovery of that which has produced them.<a name=1:33></a> May the Lord only make the Word as divinely precious to him as it has been to the writer; to both ever still more so!<a name=1:34></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Reader,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I present to you in these pages the beginning of a work which I trust will be of use to you in the study of the precious Word of God.<a name=1:39></a> I also desire that the outlines you will find therein, giving you a glimpse of part of the wealth contained in the Word, may induce you to study it more carefully.<a name=1:40></a> I feel conscious, even more conscious than you could be, of the great and numerous imperfections that are found in this outline.<a name=1:41></a> However small one's value of the Word may be; however little one may have felt its divine character, any work of man referring to it will be, in the eyes of a believer, quite colourless and poor.<a name=1:42></a> I feel this, and wish to say a few words to explain to you my object in publishing these thoughts, and to let you know what to expect in perusing them.<a name=1:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A few years ago a brother suggested that I should undertake this work, but until now, I have shrunk from the task, more because of a sense of my inability for such an undertaking, than because of my being occupied in the Lord's service, although the latter may have accounted somewhat for the delay.<a name=1:44></a> The feeling that the Lord is near inclined me to devote myself to service rather than to undertake work in my study.<a name=1:45></a> The needs of brothers who are also in the Lord's field, and most of them in a more useful way than I am, caused me to decide to set about this work, without, I hope forsaking a fitting humility, which I would rather maintain than accomplish any kind of work whatsoever.<a name=1:46></a> Several matters, however, weighed in the balance to hinder my commencing this task.<a name=1:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, the immense responsibility, which, when it is a question of the Word of God, attaches to the one who would give guidance to the thoughts of Christians; and however modestly it might be, to present ideas as being the intention of the Spirit of God.<a name=1:48></a> How grave an error to wrongly direct the dear children of God in the understanding of His thoughts and of His will; or to present as the purpose of His precious communications, that which may not be it!<a name=1:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another consideration also checked me; it was the fear that anyone might assume to find in this work, the whole contents of the Word.<a name=1:50></a> The grave and serious harm of all commentaries is that they make room for this thought, lending themselves thus to the slothfulness of heart and the lack of spirituality which are satisfied with a few explanations, good, perhaps, in themselves, but which only give a few thoughts suggested by the Word and fall infinitely short of communicating its life, its power and its wealth.<a name=1:51></a> Nothing is more harmful than this laziness which prefers to dwell on a few thoughts rather than fathom the divine Word itself, which latter is denied to the soul who does not earnestly seek of the Lord, with diligence, spirituality and devotion, the knowledge which He alone can give.<a name=1:52></a> The reader therefore, will not find here any pretension to give him the whole contents of the Word.<a name=1:53></a> He will find -- at least, such has been my desire and the object of my work -- a few indications which will help him in the study of the Bible, but which will be useless to him without this study.<a name=1:54></a> I should have rendered him an injurious service had I helped him to gather up ideas, at the same time diverting him from the living and true Word which puts us in touch with God Himself, places our hearts beneath that eye which sees all, which judges all; but which sees it in order to heal us and bless us.<a name=1:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A further and more personal consideration weighed with me a little -- the fact that the task truly was very great.<a name=1:56></a> The influence of this thought vanished in the hope of being of service to my brethren; and, in the great joy I anticipated in performing the work, which joy indeed, I have not failed to experience.<a name=1:57></a> Even if my reader does not derive any great gain from it, I, at any rate, have the consolation that it has been of immense gain to me.<a name=1:58></a> Whatever may be, I do not regret having undertaken it.<a name=1:59></a> I beseech the reader not to read these pages without accompanying them with those of the Word, and to use them only for the study of the Word.<a name=1:60></a> My purpose is that the Word should be studied, and I even hope that it will be impossible to use these writings otherwise than in the study of the Word.<a name=1:61></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, I did not propose to speak of the result the truth has produced in myself, nor give utterance to the godly emotions which gush up in the heart when the Word is rightly read.<a name=1:62></a> I intended to help my reader to understand that which should produce these feelings.<a name=1:63></a> I prefer to let them spring up through grace in his heart, rather than to impart to him much of what has taken place in mine.<a name=1:64></a> I simply express the desire that the effect may be not only the joy of knowledge, but of true communion with God.<a name=1:65></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have only one word to add.<a name=1:66></a> I intended to publish a summary of all the books of the Bible, indicating as far as it may be given to me the intent and thought of the Holy Spirit in each book.<a name=1:67></a> As it is a great undertaking it seemed that the work could very well be published in parts.<a name=1:68></a> The Pentateuch suggests itself naturally as a group which could appear separately.<a name=1:69></a> My work on the other books is well advanced, so that I hope to be able, God willing, to resume shortly the publication of this work.<a name=1:70></a> It is sweet to think that my brethren will help me with their prayers that I may have guidance from God in this work, and that His Spirit may preside over it, and that thus it may be a blessing to us all.<a name=1:71></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must not finish this Preface without informing my reader that if he finds that which edifies in these pages, he will be largely indebted to the care and affectionate interest brought in by our brother M.<a name=1:72></a> H.<a name=1:73></a> Parlier, who has greatly helped me in editing.<a name=1:74></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May the teaching of the Holy Spirit Himself be granted to you, dear reader; may the Word become always more precious in these last days, and may an obedient spirit, mingled with love for all that belongs to Christ, be with you.<a name=1:75></a> This is the desire of your affectionate brother in Him.<a name=1:76></a><br>J.<a name=1:77></a> N.<a name=1:78></a> DARBY.<a name=1:79></a>

	<div class="heading">
		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I propose giving in this work, of which Genesis is the commencement, a short synopsis of the principal subjects of each book of the Bible, to aid in the study of this precious volume that our God has given to us.<a name=1:80></a> I do not at all pretend to give the full contents of each book, but only (as God shall grant to me) a sort of index of the subjects, the divisions of the books by subjects, and (as far as I am enabled) the object of the Spirit of God in each part, hoping that it may aid others in reading the book of God.<a name=1:81></a> The Bible, in its object, is a whole, which presents to us God coming forth from His essential fulness to manifest all that He is, and to bring back into the enjoyment of this fulness with Himself those who, having been made partakers of His nature, have become capable of comprehending and loving His counsels and Himself.<a name=1:82></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before this purpose is fully revealed, man is brought upon the scene as a responsible being, and his history, as such, given to us in the various phases through which he has passed, up to the cross, where his enmity against God was manifested, and the foundation laid for the full revelation of that purpose, and the accomplishment of God's good pleasure in man, and laid by that in which the whole divine character in love and righteousness was revealed and glorified, and God perfectly glorified in every respect in bringing man into glory.<a name=1:83></a> The creation has served as a sphere to this manifestation of God; but as a manifestation it would have been in itself altogether imperfect, though in a measure it declared His glory.<a name=1:84></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sin moreover having entered, the state of the creation and the effects of providence, which regulated its order and details here below, tended, in the state in which man was, to give a false idea of God.<a name=1:85></a> For if he referred this creation and this government to God, he saw a power which belonged to Him alone; while there existed at the same time evil which overthrew
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		every idea he could form of powerful goodness.<a name=2:1></a> The mind of man was lost in the effort to explain it, and superstitions and philosophy came in to complete the confusion in which he found himself.<a name=2:2></a> On the one hand, superstitions made falser still the false ideas that man had formed for himself of God; and on the other hand, philosophy, by the efforts which man's natural intelligence made to get rid of the difficulty, plunged him into such obscurity and such uncertainty that he finished by rejecting every idea of God whatever, save the need which had made him seek one.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These superstitions were in truth nothing more than that Satan had possessed himself of the idea of God in the heart, in order to nourish, under this name, its lusts, and degrade it in consecrating them by the name of a god, who was in truth a demon; and philosophy was but the useless effort of the mind of man to rise to the idea of God -- a height which he was incapable of attaining, and which in consequence he abandoned, making it a subject of pride to do without it.<a name=2:4></a> Even the law of God, while declaring the responsibility of man to God, and thus asserting His authority, only revealed Him in the exercise of judgment, requiring from man what he ought to be, without revealing what God was, save in justice; and in no way in relationship with the scene of misery and ignorance which sin had brought upon the human race.<a name=2:5></a> It did not shew what God was in the midst of that misery, nor could do so; for its office was to require from man consistency with a certain line of conduct, of which the Legislator constituted Himself judge, at the end of the career of him who was subjected to it.<a name=2:6></a> The Son of God is God Himself in the midst of all this scene, the faithful Witness of all that He is in His relationship with it.<a name=2:7></a> In a word, it is the Son of God who reveals God Himself, and who becomes thus necessarily the centre of all His counsels, and of all the manifestation of His glory, as well as the object of all His ways.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall find then three great subjects in the Bible -- the creation (now under the effect of the fall); (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:2">footnote</a></i>) the law, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		gave to man, such as he is now, a rule -- to man in the midst of this creation to see if he could live there according to God, and be there blessed; and the Son of God.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first two, namely, the creation and the law, are bound up with the responsibility of the creature.<a name=3:2></a> We shall find all that is connected with these two either guilty or corrupted.<a name=3:3></a> The Son, on the contrary -- the manifestation of the grace and love of the Father, and of God's love to the world, when this guilt was already there in lawless sin and lawbreaking; the express image of the subsistence of God, in whom the Father was seen -- we shall see suffering in love in the midst of this fallen creation and the contradictions of a rebellious people, and when God had been perfectly glorified in respect of sin, accomplishing all the counsels of God in uniting all things in blessing by His power and under His authority, those even who with hatred had rejected Him being forced to own Him Lord to the glory of God the Father, and at last, when He shall have subjected all things, giving up to God the Father the kingdom of His glory as Son of man, that God may be all in all.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides all this, there are in the counsels of God those with whom the God whom we know in Jesus surrounds Himself, who are to be brought into the likeness of Him with whom they are associated as sons, He the firstborn among many brethren who are to enjoy eternally with God His favour and blessing, as it rests on Him with whom and through whom they enjoy it.<a name=3:5></a> There is also an earthly people in whom God manifests the principles of His government here below and His unfailing faithfulness; it is to this last, consequently, that the law was given.<a name=3:6></a> Finally, in the purpose of God before the world was (but hidden until the fit moment when, its redemption being accomplished, the Holy Spirit could, by dwelling in it, consequent on the accomplishment of the work of redemption and the glorifying of Christ, reveal to it all the efficacy of its redemption and the whole extent of its blessing), there was a church, chosen in Christ, His bride, to be presented to Himself without spot or wrinkle, His body too, the fulness of Him who filleth all in all, united to Him by the Spirit with which all the members are baptised, and soon to be manifested in glory when He takes that headship.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cross is the centre of all this in every respect.<a name=3:8></a> There the history of man in responsibility, as the child of Adam ends,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and there begins anew in grace reigning through righteousness.<a name=4:1></a> There good and evil are fully brought to an issue, hatred in man and love in God, sin and the righteousness of God against it.<a name=4:2></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:4">footnote</a></i>) There God is perfectly glorified morally, and man judged in sin and redeemed in righteousness, the dominion of evil destroyed, and that of man established in righteousness as God willed it should be, death and he that had the power of it set aside, and this by an act of love which set the Son of God as man at the head of all things in righteousness.<a name=4:3></a> All, through the cross, rests secure and immutable in result on the ground of redemption: what shall the end of the despisers of it be?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence we shall find, not only the creation, the law, and the Son of God, but the dealings by which God has prepared the way for, and led men to expect, His manifestation; the development of all the principles on which He entered into relationship with men; the consequences of the violation of the law; and lastly, in its place, the manifestation of the church upon the earth, and the directions He has given to it, together with the course of events which are connected with its existence and its unfaithfulness on the earth; with that of the earthly people of God; and with man himself, responsible to God and clothed with authority by Him on the earth: the whole closing with the glory of Jesus, Son of man, maintaining the blessing and union of all things under the reign of God; and, in fine, God all in all.<a name=4:5></a> The history of Jesus; the position granted to the church in glory according to the counsels of God, the mystery hidden from the ages; her participation in the sufferings of Jesus, and her union with Him; and in general the testimony of the Holy Ghost given from on high, are clearly revealed in the New Testament.<a name=4:6></a> That of which we have spoken previously forms the course of the ages; the church forms no part of them.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This separates the Bible naturally into two parts: -- that which speaks of the first two subjects, the creation and man in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		his relationship with God without law, and His people under law; and that which speaks of the Son come upon the earth, and all that relates to the church and its glory -- that is, in general, the Old and New Testament.<a name=5:1></a> We shall see, however, that, in the Old, promise and prophecy referred always to the Son, eternal object of the counsels of God: as, in the New, there were prophecies of the future dealings of God with the earth, and so far connected with the Old; and, further, the rejection of the Son gave occasion to the presence of the Holy Spirit on earth -- a fact which modified the whole state of the people of God, and introduced special subjects which depended on this presence.<a name=5:2></a> For there is this peculiar in the historical part of the New, that the Son was presented first to the world, and to the people under the law, to put them anew to the test.<a name=5:3></a> The bearing of His coming at first was not the accomplishment of the counsels of God, but to present to man, still placed under the old order of things, the faithful testimony of what God was, if the heart of man had any capacity to receive it, or to discern Him who returned in grace into the midst of a fallen creation, and did so in the very form and nature of him in whom the fall had taken place; and to the Jews, if they had been willing to receive Him, the Lord of Glory, the object of all the prophecies and of all the promises; and, in fine (the world not having known Him, and His own not having received Him), to accomplish the sacrifice, which could lay the foundation of a new world before God, and place the redeemed in joy before the face of His Father, heirs of all that was established in Him the second Adam to make the church His body and His bride.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From all that I have said, it results also that the Old Testament contains two very distinct parts -- often united, it is true, in the same book, and even in a single passage, still distinct in their nature -- the history of man as he was, and God's way with him, or the historical part, whether before the law or under the law; and the revelation of the thoughts and intentions of God as to the future, which are always connected with Christ.<a name=5:5></a> This revelation sometimes takes the character of a positive prophecy, sometimes the form of a typical event which prefigures what God would afterwards accomplish.<a name=5:6></a> I may cite, as an example of this last way of expressing the thoughts of God, the sacrifice of Isaac.<a name=5:7></a> Evidently there is an historical instruction of the utmost importance in the touching example of Abraham's
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		obedience; but every one easily recognises in it the type of a sacrifice, for which God prepared for Himself a Lamb, of which Isaac, the beloved of his father, was but a feeble figure; and where resurrection, not in figure but in power, is the source of life and hope to every believer.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But perhaps I anticipate too much the details.<a name=6:2></a> Let us proceed to the general character of the books of scripture.<a name=6:3></a>

		GENESIS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Genesis has a character of its own; and, as the beginning of the Holy Book, presents to us all the great elementary principles which find their development in the history of the relationships of God with man, which is recorded in the following books.<a name=7:1></a> The germ of each of these principles will be found here, unless we except the law.<a name=7:2></a> There was however a law given to Adam in his innocence; and Hagar, we know, prefigures at least Sinai.<a name=7:3></a> There is scarce anything afterwards accomplished of which the expression is not found in this book in one form or another.<a name=7:4></a> There is found also in it, though the sad history of man's fall be there, a freshness in the relationship of men with God, which is scarce met with afterwards in men accustomed to abuse it and to live in a society full of itself.<a name=7:5></a> But whether it be the creation, man and his fall, sin, the power of Satan, the promises, the call of God, His judgment of the world, redemption, the covenants, the separation of the people of God, their condition of strangers on the earth, the resurrection, the establishment of Israel in the land of Canaan, the blessing of the nations, the seed of promise, the exaltation of a rejected Lord to the throne of the world, all are found here in fact or in figure -- in figure, now that we have the key, even the church itself.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us examine then the contents of this book in order.<a name=7:7></a> First, we have the creation -- creation in which man is found placed on earth as centre and head.<a name=7:8></a> We have first the work of God, and then the rest of God: at the close of His work, rest from labour, without presenting the idea that any one participated in it.<a name=7:9></a> God Himself rested from His work.<a name=7:10></a> Man comes in to take his place then in happiness at its head.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here some brief general remarks deserve a place.<a name=7:12></a> This revelation from God is not a history by Him of all that He has done, but what has been given to man for his profit, the truth as to what he has to say to.<a name=7:13></a> Its object is to communicate to man all that regards his own relationship with God.<a name=7:14></a> In connection with the second Adam he will know as he is known; and already, by means of the work of Christ, he has that unction of the Holy One by which he knows all things.<a name=7:15></a> But historically the revelation is partial.<a name=7:16></a> It communicates what is for the conscience and spiritual affections of man.<a name=7:17></a> The created world

	<div class="paragraph">

		From out of this state of chaos and darkness in which the earth then lay God brought it, first introducing light into it by His word, and then formed seas and dry land, and furnished it with plants and living creatures.<a name=8:11></a> In this earth, thus prepared and furnished, man, made after the image of God, is placed as lord of all that was in it.<a name=8:12></a> Its fruits are given him for food; and God rests from His work, and distinguishes with His blessing the day which saw His labours closed.<a name=8:13></a> Man enjoyed the fruit of God's work rather than entered into the rest; for in nothing had he taken part in the work.<a name=8:14></a>

		In chapter 9 begins the history of the new earth.<a name=18:13></a> God blesses the earth more than before; and the answer to the sweet savour of the sacrifice assures the world that a universal deluge will never recur.<a name=18:14></a> God makes a covenant (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:18">footnote</a></i>[a]) with the creation to this effect.<a name=18:15></a> Government is established in the hand of man, and death begins to furnish him with nourishment.<a name=18:16></a> It does not appear to me that, before this, there had been either government or idolatry.<a name=18:17></a> There had been sin against God, violence without restraint against one another, and corruption; the two perpetual characters of sin, amongst men, and even in Satan as far as may be.<a name=18:18></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:18">footnote</a></i>[b]) God cared for His creation in mercy; but with Noah new principles were brought out.<a name=18:19></a> The sacrifice of Christ (in figure) becomes a ground of dealing with the earth, not alone of accepting man, as in Abel; and on this a covenant is founded.<a name=18:20></a> That is, God binds Himself in grace, so that faith has a sure ground to go upon, that on which it can count.<a name=18:21></a>

		But it is well to dwell a moment on what was really a most important epoch in the history of God's ways with the world, where the proper history of faith begins, though of course there were believers individually before.<a name=23:2></a> But as Adam was the head of the ruined race, so Abraham was the father of the faithful, the head of the race of God on the earth, both after the flesh and after the Spirit.<a name=23:3></a> Christ the fulness of all blessing we know, in whom we have far higher blessings than those revealed in Abraham.<a name=23:4></a> Still in God's ways upon the earth Abraham was the head of the accepted race.<a name=23:5></a> Idolatry, as we have seen, had at this time gained a footing in the family of Shem himself.<a name=23:6></a> "Your fathers", says Joshua (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24:2">Joshua  24:2</a>), "dwelt in old time beyond the flood, Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods".<a name=23:7></a> Now these gods were demons (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:20">1 Corinthians  10:20</a>; it is a citation of <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:17">Deuteronomy  32:17</a>).<a name=23:8></a> That is (now that God had interfered in judgment (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:23">footnote</a></i>) and in power), these demons had possessed themselves of this position in the spirit of man, and taken the place in his mind of the sources of the authority displayed and of blessing still bestowed.<a name=23:9></a> They presented themselves to him as authors of those judgments, of all which drew forth the worship, the gratitude, and the terror of the natural heart of corrupted man, expressed in his worship according to the principles on which he was, on which he alone could be, in relationship with those superior beings, to whom he attributed the power to answer his desires or to avert the things which he feared.<a name=23:10></a> It was not merely man corrupted and in rebellion against God, it was his religion itself which corrupted him; and he made of his corruption a religion.<a name=23:11></a> The demons had taken the place of God in his mind, and having the ascendency over his conscience, if man did not forget it, hardened or misled it.<a name=23:12></a> He was religiously bad; and there is no degradation like that.<a name=23:13></a> What a state!<a name=23:14></a> What folly!<a name=23:15></a> How long, O Lord?<a name=23:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if the human race plunge thus into darkness, taking demons for their god, and, incapable of self-sustainment, substitute for their own rebellion against God servitude to what is more elevated in rebellion, placing themselves in miserable dependence upon it, God raises and lifts us up above all this evil, and by His calling introduces us into His own thoughts -- thoughts far more precious than the restoration of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From chapter 12 then there is developed altogether a new order of events, which refer to the call of God, to His covenants, to His promises, to the manifestation of His people as a distinct people on the earth, to the counsels of God.<a name=24:5></a> Before the deluge, it was man such as he was -- fallen before God; and though there was a testimony from the beginning, still no dispensational intervention of God in His own ways, but man, with that testimony as to divine institutions, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:24">footnote</a></i>) left to himself, resulting in such violence and corruption as brought on the deluge in judgment on the world.<a name=24:6></a> Afterwards, God having interposed in judgment and begun the world that now is, there was the government of that world and its failure and the consequences of this failure; but, the nations being established and having submitted themselves to the power of demons, the call of God, the deposit of promise in him who was chosen of God, His elect ones (seed of the depositary of the promises), and subsequently His people, rise up to our view.<a name=24:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence we find them at once called upon to separate themselves entirely from all that connected them with their position in nature on the earth, and to belong to God on the ground of promise and confidence in His word.<a name=24:8></a> "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee".<a name=24:9></a> This was a solemn event.<a name=24:10></a> It was in principle the judgment of the world, though in the way of grace to those called out if it.<a name=24:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That we may fully understand this, we must remember that the world had been constituted by the judgment of God passed upon the enterprise of building the tower.<a name=24:12></a> Countries and nations had been formed, as it is to this day.<a name=24:13></a> That was the world.<a name=24:14></a> Satan had full hold of it, and the very world which

		In the outset however, Abram still held to his family; or at least, if it held to him, he did not break with it; and though he quitted his country on the call of God, he stops as far from the land of promise as before.<a name=25:8></a> For, thus called, man must belong wholly to God on a new principle.<a name=25:9></a> In fine, he sets out as God had said to him.<a name=25:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then here Abram called by the manifestation of the glory of God (compare <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>) for the journey of faith.<a name=25:11></a> The promises are given to him, whether of a numerous posterity, or of the blessing of all the families on the earth in him.<a name=25:12></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:25">footnote</a></i>) He sets out, he arrives.<a name=25:13></a> There are not many experiences, though there will be deeper knowledge of God, in a path which is purely of faith: power is there, and man walks with God.<a name=25:14></a> In the history of Jacob we have many.<a name=25:15></a> Arrived in Canaan, Abraham enters into possession of nothing, for his life must still be of faith.<a name=25:16></a> And here we see, by comparing this passage with <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>, the effect of being left as pilgrims and strangers on the earth, not yet in possession of what is promised.<a name=25:17></a> Abraham goes in the obedience of faith to the promised land, and there has not so much as to set foot upon; but in virtue of this -- as God, though He could prove, could not leave faith without an answer; nor, indeed, where tried, without leading it on to the knowledge of further blessing, for He never does -- he has before him the city which hath foundations, and the yet better country.<a name=25:18></a> The energy of faith through grace put him in a position which, as it was not possession, necessarily set

	<div class="paragraph">
		But then there is a second revelation of the Lord to him in the land, in the place into which he had been called.<a name=26:6></a> The first was to call him out of the place he was in, and make him walk in the path of promise.<a name=26:7></a> Now the Lord reveals Himself to him for communion, where he is; speaks with him; unfolds to him how the promise will be accomplished, and Abraham thereon worships Him.<a name=26:8></a> He has in the land his tent and his altar.<a name=26:9></a> This is the second part of the life of faith.<a name=26:10></a> The revelation of God, when far from Him, sets us out on the journey of faith, inspires the walk toward heaven.<a name=26:11></a> When in the heavenly position, God reveals Himself for communion and worship and a full revelation of His ways.<a name=26:12></a> The Canaanite is in the land; the heir of promise has no possession of the thing promised.<a name=26:13></a> We have to do with spiritual wickedness in heavenly places, but the Lord reveals Himself, shews the heir and inheritance when the Canaanite will be gone; and so Abram worships by faith, as before he walked by faith.<a name=26:14></a> This is the full double function of faith.<a name=26:15></a>

		After this (chapter 13) we have, in the conduct of Abram and Lot, the disinterestedness and self-renunciation of true faith on the one hand, and, on the other, him, who, though a believer, had, as regards the walk of faith, only followed that of another, and was now put to the test by circumstances which arise: and this, remark, is when they have together left their unbelieving connection with the world as an outward refuge.<a name=27:3></a> Lot had done so with Abram, but his inward heart and will clung to the ease of it.<a name=27:4></a> Abram had returned in spirit genuinely, perhaps with a deeper experience, to his pilgrim portion in Canaan.<a name=27:5></a> Yet the advantages he possessed in it led to the difficulty, for treasure here is not heaven, even if the possessor of it be heavenly-minded: an important lesson.<a name=27:6></a> Still Abram behaves beautifully.<a name=27:7></a> Lot chooses the world, fair in appearance, not as Egypt, the world as such, but as self-ease, and what did not seem, was not outwardly, separated from, Canaan; but which was soon after the scene and object of what did not appear -- the sure judgments of God.<a name=27:8></a> The renunciation of a present portion down here, and of self in it, by Abram, is the occasion for him of a much clearer knowledge of the extent, and a still firmer assurance of the certainty, of the promise.<a name=27:9></a> It is when he gives up all to Lot as he might choose it, that the Lord says to Abram to look north, south, east, west, from where he was, adding he would give if to him and to his seed for ever.<a name=27:10></a> In a word, we have the believer acting in the spirit of the heavenly calling -- the faithful believer, and the worldly-minded believer.<a name=27:11></a>

		Lot, in the following chapter, because of his connection with the heavenly man, depositary of God's counsels and wisdom, and intercessor, himself down in the plain of this world, which he had chosen, as the Jews have, is delivered by providential power; but he passes through the tribulation, and suffers the loss of all that for which he had refused the heavenly condition, and sought the earth, as ignorant of the judgment as he was of the heavenly treasure.<a name=35:9></a> Such is the position of the people of faith when sunk into the world of judgment.<a name=35:10></a> Soon abandoned to the uncertainty of unbelief in the presence of visible judgment, he seeks his refuge in that place of Abraham's blessing to which he had previously been afraid to flee, and which he had earlier abandoned for the ease of the well-watered plain; but he is in miserable darkness, the parent of a perpetual thorn to the people of God.<a name=35:11></a> But this last part is only historically given, that Israel might know the origin of Moab and Ammon; and furnishes a general principle for all times.<a name=35:12></a>

		In chapters 20, 21 we have the question of the heir and of the path of faith in another point of view.<a name=35:15></a> Abraham denies his relationship with his wife, and is reproved by the world itself, which knows better than he what she should be.<a name=35:16></a> God, however,

		But these two chapters must be somewhat more developed.<a name=36:4></a> Like Abram's going down to Egypt, we have unbelief working in respect of the path into which he had been called by grace, shewn, as it ever is, in reference to walking in the intimacy of the relationship in which God had set him, of which woman is the expression in the types.<a name=36:5></a> Here Sarah is the mother of the heir of the world, the wife of Abraham, according to promise, and, for Abraham, according to the church's hope, as we have seen (though Israel were the vessel according to flesh).<a name=36:6></a> This position he denies.<a name=36:7></a> Sarah is again his sister.<a name=36:8></a> This was worse than before, for she is, to faith, mother of the heir of the world.<a name=36:9></a> Abimelech was wrong, and acted to please himself, but acted unconscious of it.<a name=36:10></a> Abraham before God was in the falser position of the two.<a name=36:11></a> God warns Abimelech, and preserves Sarah by His own power, whom Abraham's want of faith had connected with the world; and Abimelech returns her, with the cutting reproof to the church, as here typified, that she at least ought to have known her own relationship to Christ.<a name=36:12></a> Still, in the main, Abraham was in the place of faith and blessing; and, as God's prophet, to whom none should do harm, intercedes for the faulty Abimelech, for here all is grace.<a name=36:13></a> There is another point to notice here, that this was an arrangement of unbelief when first he started from his father's house (chapter 20: 13), so soon was the germ of unbelief at work in the called of promise.<a name=36:14></a> But God maintains the divine title to the allegiance of the church at all times.<a name=36:15></a> But now the heir is born, the heir of promise.<a name=36:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of this is, that not only is the difference known to faith, but the heir of the bondwoman is utterly cast out as to the inheritance.<a name=36:17></a> Historically he is preserved according to God's promise, a figure of legal Israel; but, as regards any portion of the inheritance, wholly cast out.<a name=36:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here, further, Abraham fears no longer before the prince of this world, but reproves him.<a name=36:19></a> He has the world, as well as the heavenly communion, now that the heir is come; and the .<a name=36:20></a> world owns that God is with him in all things.<a name=36:21></a> Hence the well

		It seems to me that there is this difference between the prophecies of Jacob and Moses as to the tribes.<a name=48:3></a> Here the prophecy refers to the responsibility of the first parent-source of the tribe, as Reuben, Simeon, Levi; and to the counsels of God, which put forward Judah (the stock from which the Lord sprang as regards the royalty), and Joseph (type of Christ as Nazarene, separated from his brethren, and afterwards exalted).<a name=48:4></a> The rest, if we except Benjamin who ravages with power, gives the general characters of the position and conduct of the tribes of Israel; Dan, of his wickedness, and even of his character of traitor.<a name=48:5></a> I may add that besides the royal place of Judah maintained as a distinct tribe till Christ came, up to the end of Issachar, it is the sad history of Israel in its responsibility and what befell them.<a name=48:6></a> Dan adds to this traitorous unfaithfulness, as indeed he set up, we may say, tribal idolatry.<a name=48:7></a> This casts the faith of Jacob on waiting for God's salvation, and grace comes in.<a name=48:8></a> All that follows is blessing, and Christ the shepherd and stone of Israel.<a name=48:9></a> Moses gives rather the history of the people as entering into the country on leaving the wilderness; and we find the priesthood and people to be the two points brought into prominence, although power and a special blessing be given to Judah.<a name=48:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I add a few details as to this prophetic blessing, hoping to make it more clear.<a name=48:11></a> We may remark, in the tribes, responsibility and the future of Israel as firstborn according to nature.<a name=48:12></a> Reuben represents Israel in this character; Simeon and Levi, who come after and will maintain their right by nature's force, are no better.<a name=48:13></a> Then we have the purpose of God in the king and the whole of the royal tribe till Christ come, to whom the gathering of the peoples shall be.<a name=48:14></a> Joseph comes with Benjamin at the end, the representative of Christ personally glorified, as Benjamin of Christ in judgment on earth.<a name=48:15></a> Joseph is a personal representative of Christ, separated from His brethren, glorious and blessed as the heir of all the resources of God.<a name=48:16></a> Dan, before this, though owned as a judging tribe and so Israel in him, yet marks out that apostasy and power of Satan in Israel which led the remnant to look beyond the portion of the people,

		I rather think, as already noticed, that in the other tribes we have a distinct contrast of what Israel is as oppressed, before Christ -- who has taken the full Joseph character in glory, and has answered the faith of the remnant expressed in verse 18 and after; and that thus, in these characters of the tribes, we have the whole history of Israel.<a name=49:2></a> Judah and Joseph have been already marked out and distinguished in the history -- Judah as surety for and connected with Benjamin, and Joseph in all his history.<a name=49:3></a> Thus, after Judah, in Zebulun and Issachar we have Israel mixed with the world, busied in its waters to seek profit, and a slave to it for rest and quiet; but this ends in Dan and apostasy, so that the remnant, in the spirit of prophecy, wait for the salvation which is to come with the true Joseph.<a name=49:4></a> All is prosperity when this is looked to.<a name=49:5></a> Once overcome, he overcomes at the last: his bread is fat and yields royal dainties in his own land, not seeking them by mixture with, and subjection to, the world.<a name=49:6></a> And Naphtali is in the liberty of God, and full of goodly words.<a name=49:7></a> In Joseph and Benjamin we have the crowning of all blessing in the double character of Christ, the heavenly Heir of all, and power and strength upon the earth that subdues all.<a name=49:8></a>

		Next, the state of Israel being such, intercourse with nations (which, when not in the power of God, is corruption), subjection to their yoke for ease, and apostasy: still owned as a people, however; and then the remnant looking to the only source, and waiting, not for good in Israel, but salvation from Jehovah Elohim.<a name=49:13></a> Thereon deliverance and blessing for Israel; and finally (what we have already seen as the double character of Christ -- separated from His brethren, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:49">footnote</a></i>) and then glorified) Joseph and Benjamin present Him to us as the heavenly glorified Man to whom all is entrusted, and the all-conquering Lord on the earth.<a name=49:14></a>

		EXODUS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Book of Exodus we have, as the general and characteristic subject, the deliverance and redemption of the people of God, and their establishment as a people before Him, whether under the law, or under the government of God in longsuffering -- of a God who, having so brought them to Himself, provided for His unfaithful people; not indeed entrance into His own presence, but a way of approaching Him, at least at a distance, although they had failed.<a name=51:1></a> But the veil was unrent: God did not come out to them, nor could they go in to God.<a name=51:2></a> And this is of all possible importance, and characteristic of the difference of Christianity.<a name=51:3></a> God did come amongst sinful men in love in Christ, and man is gone in to God, in righteousness, and withal the veil is rent from top to bottom.<a name=51:4></a> The law required from man what man ought to be as a child of Adam; life was put as the consequence of keeping it, and there was a curse for him if it was not kept.<a name=51:5></a> God's relationship with the people had at first been in grace; but this did not continue, and the people never entered thereinto with intelligence, nor understood this grace like persons who stood in need of it as sinners.<a name=51:6></a> Let us examine the course of these divine instructions.<a name=51:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, we have the historical circumstances which relate to the captivity of Israel -- the persecutions which this people had to endure, and the providential superintendence of God answering the faith of the parents of the infant Moses, and thus accomplishing the counsels of His grace, which not only preserved the child's life, but placed him in an elevated position in the court of Pharaoh.<a name=51:8></a> The things that are done on the earth He doeth them Himself.<a name=51:9></a> He prepares all beforehand when nothing is as yet apparent to man.<a name=51:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, although providence responds to faith, and acts in order to accomplish God's purposes, and control the walk of His children, it is not the guide of faith, although it is made so sometimes by believers who are wanting in clearness of light.<a name=51:11></a> Moses's faith is seen in his giving up, when grown to age, all the advantages of the position in which God had set him by His providence.<a name=51:12></a> Providence may, and often does, give that which forms, in many respects, the servants of God for their work, as vessels; but cannot be their power in the work.<a name=51:13></a> These two things must not be confounded.<a name=51:14></a> It gives that, the giving up of
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		which is a testimony of the reality of faith and of the power of God which operates in the soul.<a name=52:1></a> It is given that it may be given up.<a name=52:2></a> This is part of the preparation.<a name=52:3></a> This faith acted through affections which attached him to God, and consequently to the people of God in their distress, and manifested itself, not in the helps or reliefs which his position could well have enabled him to give to them, but in inducing him to identify himself with that people because it was God's people.<a name=52:4></a> Faith attaches itself to God, and appreciates, and would have part in the bond that exists between God and His people; and thus it thinks not of patronising from above, as if the world had authority over the people of God, or was able to be a blessing to them.<a name=52:5></a> It feels (because it is faith) that God loves His people; that His people are precious to Him -- His own on the earth; and faith sets itself thus, through very affection, in the position where His people find themselves.<a name=52:6></a> This is what Christ did.<a name=52:7></a> Faith does but follow Him in His career of love, however great the distance at which it walks.<a name=52:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How many reasons might have induced Moses to remain in the position where he was; and this even under the pretext of being able to do more for the people; but this would have been leaning on the power of Pharaoh, instead of recognising the bond between the people and God: it might have resulted in a relief which the world would have granted, but not in a deliverance by God, accomplished in His love and in His power.<a name=52:9></a> Moses would have been spared much affliction, but lost his true glory; Pharaoh flattered, and his authority over the people of God recognised; and Israel would have remained in captivity, leaning on Pharaoh, instead of recognising God in the precious and even glorious relationship of His people with Him.<a name=52:10></a> God would not have been glorified.<a name=52:11></a> Yet all human reasoning, and all reasoning connected with providential ways, would have induced Moses to remain in his position: faith made him give it up.<a name=52:12></a> All would really have been spoiled.<a name=52:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses, then, identifies himself with the people of God.<a name=52:14></a> A certain natural activity, and the unconscious habits of a strength which was not purely from on high, accompanied him, perhaps; however, it is the first devotedness which is pointed out by the Holy Ghost (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:52">footnote</a></i>) as the good and acceptable

		But it was all over with the covenant of the law; the first and fundamental link -- that of having no other gods -- was broken on the part of the people.<a name=88:2></a> The tables of the covenant never even came into the camp on the simple ground of law.<a name=88:3></a> The people had made a complete separation between themselves and God.<a name=88:4></a> Moses, who had not asked God what was to be done with the law, comes down.<a name=88:5></a> His exercised ear, quick to discern how matters stood with the people, hears their light and profane joy.<a name=88:6></a> Soon after he sees the golden calf, which had even preceded the tabernacle of God in the camp, and he breaks the tables at the foot of the mount; and, zealous on high for the people towards God because of His glory, he is below on earth zealous for God towards the people because of that same glory.<a name=88:7></a> For faith does more than see that God is glorious (every reasonable person would own that); it connects the glory of God and His people, and hence counts on God to bless them in every state of things, as in the interest of His glory, and insists on holiness in them, at all cost, in conformity with that glory, that it may not be blasphemed in those who are identified with it.<a name=88:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Levi, responding to Moses's call, says to his brethren, the children of his mother, "I have not known you;" and consecrates himself to Jehovah.<a name=88:9></a> Moses now, full of zeal though not according to knowledge, but which was permitted of God for our instruction, proposes to the people his going up, and "peradventure" he shall make an atonement for this sin.<a name=88:10></a> And he asks God to blot him out of His book rather than that the people should not be forgiven.<a name=88:11></a> God refuses him; and, while sparing them through his mediation, and placing them under the government of His patience and long-suffering, puts each one of them under responsibility to Himself -- that is, under the law, declaring that the soul that sinned He would blot out of His book.<a name=88:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the mediation of Moses was available for forgiveness, as regards government, and to put them under a government, the principles of which we shall see by-and-by; but it was useless as regards any atonement which would protect them

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a contrast do we here remark, in passing, with the work of our precious Saviour!<a name=89:3></a> He comes down from above -- from His dwelling-place in the glory of the Father -- to do His will, and did it perfectly; and (instead of destroying the tables, the signs of this covenant, the requirements of which man was unable to meet), He Himself bears the penalty of its infringement, bearing its curse; and, having accomplished the atonement before returning above, instead of going up with a cheerless "peradventure" in His mouth, which the holiness of God instantly nullified, He ascends, with the sign of the accomplishment of the atonement, and of the confirmation of the new covenant, with His precious blood, the value of which was anything but doubtful to that God before whom He presented it.<a name=89:4></a> Alas!<a name=89:5></a> the church has but too faithfully reflected the conduct of Israel during the absence of the true Moses, and attributed to providence what she had fashioned with her own hands, because she would see something.<a name=89:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now to examine a little what was taking place among the people, and on Moses's part, the faithful and zealous witness, as a servant of God in His house; for we shall find a new mediation going on peacefully, if one may so speak, and holily, weighing by faith, these relationships where the mercy and the justice of God meet in their application to His government.<a name=89:7></a> It is not the indignation of holy wrath, which had indeed its place at the sight of the evil, while it knew not what to do -- for how put the law of God beside the golden calf?<a name=89:8></a> Jehovah says that He will send an angel, and that He will not go in the midst of the people, seeing it is stiff-necked, lest He should destroy them by the way.<a name=89:9></a> But I will state succinctly the facts connected with this new intercession, which are of touching interest.<a name=89:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, God does not forsake the people.<a name=90:4></a> Moses enters holily, and by the just judgment of conscience, into the mind of God by the Spirit; and, before the tabernacle of the congregation was pitched, he entirely leaves the camp, and makes a place for God outside the camp, afar off from the camp, which had put a false god in His place, and changed their glory into the similitude of an ox which eateth grass.<a name=90:5></a> He calls it the tabernacle of the congregation -- the meeting-place between God and those who sought Him.<a name=90:6></a> This name is in itself important, because it is no longer simply God in the midst of a recognised assembly, which was one of the characters we have already observed connected with the tabernacle.<a name=90:7></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:90">footnote</a></i>) Moses being outside the camp, God now declares that He will not go up in the midst of them, lest He should destroy them by the way, as He had threatened.<a name=90:8></a> Moses begins his intercession, having taken an individual position, the only one now of faithfulness to God; but his connection with the people being so much the stronger by his being nearer to God, more separated unto Him.<a name=90:9></a> This is the effect of faithful separation when it is for God's glory, and one is brought near to God in it.<a name=90:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It must be remarked here, that God had taken the people at their word.<a name=90:11></a> They had said, acting according to their faith, or rather to their want of faith, "This Moses that brought us up out of Egypt".<a name=90:12></a> God says, "Thy people, which thou

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses having taken his place outside the camp, God reveals Himself to him as He never had done before.<a name=91:7></a> The people see God standing at the door of the tabernacle which Moses had pitched; and they worship, every man at his tent door.<a name=91:8></a> Jehovah speaks unto Moses face to face, as a man speaks unto his friend.<a name=91:9></a> We shall see that it is to these communications that God alludes when He speaks of the glory of Moses (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:8">Numbers  12:8</a>), and not to those on Mount Sinai.<a name=91:10></a> Moses, as mediator in the way of testimony, goes into the camp; but Joshua, the spiritual chief of the people (Christ in Spirit), does not depart out of the tabernacle (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:91">footnote</a></i>) Moses now recognises what God had told him, that he has to bring up the people; he is there as the mediator on whom everything depends.<a name=91:11></a> But he dares not entertain the thought of going up alone, of going up without knowing who would be with him.<a name=91:12></a> God has fully acknowledged him in grace, and he desires to know who will go before him.<a name=91:13></a> He therefore asks, since he has found grace (for so God had told him), that he may know His way, the way of God; not only to have a way for him (Moses) to get to Canaan, but "thy way;" thus will he know God, and in His path and conduct, will find grace in His sight.<a name=91:14></a> God replies that His presence shall go, and He will give rest to Moses: the two things he perfectly needed as crossing the wilderness.<a name=91:15></a> Moses then brings in the people, and says, "Carry us not up hence", and that "we have found grace, I and thy people".<a name=91:16></a> This also is granted of Jehovah; and now he desires for himself to see the glory of Jehovah; but that face which is to go and lead Moses and the people, God cannot shew unto Moses.<a name=91:17></a> He will hide him while He

		God then lays down two principles: His sovereignty, which allows Him to act in goodness towards the wicked -- into this He retreats that any may be saved -- for in justice He would have cut off the whole people: and the conditions of His government under which He was putting the people, His character such as it is manifested in His ways towards them.<a name=92:6></a> Hid whilst He passes by, Moses bows down at the voice of God, who proclaims His name and reveals what He is as JEHOVAH.<a name=92:7></a> These words give the principles contained in the character of God Himself in connection with the Jewish people -- principles which form the basis of His government.<a name=92:8></a> It is not at all the name of His relationship with the sinner for his justification, but with Israel for His government.<a name=92:9></a> Mercy, holiness, and patience, mark His ways with them; but He does not clear the guilty.<a name=92:10></a> Moses, ever bearing the people of God on his heart, beseeches God, according to the favour in which he stands as mediator, that the Lord Himself, thus revealed, may go up in their midst; and this, because they were a stiff-necked people.<a name=92:11></a> How should he bring such a people safe through without Him?<a name=92:12></a>

		The relationship between Moses personally and God was fully established, so that he could present the people such as they were, because of his (Moses's own) position; and, consequently, make of the difficulty and sin of the people a reason for the presence of God, according to the character He had revealed.<a name=92:13></a> It is the proper effect of mediation; but it is exceedingly beautiful to see, grace having thus come in, the reason God had given for the destruction of the people, or at the very least for His absence, becoming the motive for His presence.<a name=92:14></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:92">footnote</a></i>)

		I have rather enlarged upon these conversations of Moses with the people, because (and it is very important to remark it) Israel never entered the land under the Sinai covenant, that is, under simple law (for all this passed under Mount Sinai); it had been immediately broken.<a name=94:3></a> It is under the mediation of Moses that they were able to find again the way of entering it.<a name=94:4></a> However, they are placed again under the law, but the government of patience and grace is added to it.<a name=94:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#10:1">Deuteronomy  10:1</a>, we see there is no longer question of introducing the law openly into the camp where God had been dishonoured.<a name=94:6></a> It was to be put into the ark, according to the predetermined plans of God, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:94">footnote</a></i>[a]) arranged to enable the people, miserable as they were, to draw near unto Him, though only outside unto the brazen altar.<a name=94:7></a> Moses abides there with Jehovah.<a name=94:8></a> There was enough in the contemplation of what God was, as He had revealed Himself, to occupy him.<a name=94:9></a> He had not now to be occupied with the instructions (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:94">footnote</a></i>[b]) God was giving him on the details of the tabernacle, but with God according to the revelation He had made of Himself; he neither ate nor drank; he was in a state above nature, where the flesh could not intermeddle, in some sort apart from humanity.<a name=94:10></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:94">footnote</a></i>[c]) The Lord writes His law anew on the tables which Moses had prepared.<a name=94:11></a>

		LEVITICUS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Leviticus is the way of drawing near to God, viewed as dwelling in the sanctuary, whether in respect of the means of doing so, or of the state in which men could; and therewith, consequently, especially the subject of the priesthood; that is, the means established of God for those outside the sanctuary drawing near unto Him; and the discernment of the defilements unbecoming those who were thus brought into relationship with God; the function of discerning these being, in any case that rendered it necessary, a part of the service of the priesthood.<a name=97:1></a> There are also in Leviticus the several convocations of the people in the feasts of Jehovah, which presented the special circumstances under which they drew near unto Him; and, lastly, the fatal consequences of infringing the principles established by God as the condition of these relationships with Him.<a name=97:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the communications of God are consequent upon His presence in His tabernacle, which is the basis of all the relationships we are speaking of.<a name=97:3></a> It is no longer the lawgiver giving regulations from above, to constitute a state of things, but one in the midst (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:97">footnote</a></i>) of the people, prescribing the conditions of their relationship with Him.<a name=97:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		the book begins with the sacrifices which represented His one perfect sacrifice.<a name=98:1></a> As presenting the work of Christ in its various characters and diverse application to us, these typical sacrifices have an interest that nothing can surpass.<a name=98:2></a> We will consider them with some little detail.<a name=98:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The types which are presented to us in the scriptures are of different characters; partly, of some great principle of God's dealings, as Sarah and Hagar of the two covenants; partly, they are of the Lord Jesus Himself, in different characters, as sacrifice, priest, etc.<a name=98:4></a>; partly, of certain dealings of God, or conduct of men, in other dispensations; partly, of some great future acts of God's government.<a name=98:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though no strict rule can be given, we can say in general that Genesis furnishes us with the chief examples of the first class; Leviticus, of the second, though some remarkable ones are found in Exodus; Numbers, of the third: those of the fourth class are more dispersed.<a name=98:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The employment of types in the word of God is a feature in this blessed revelation not to be passed by.<a name=98:7></a> There is peculiar grace in it.<a name=98:8></a> That which is most highly elevated in our relationship with God almost surpasses, in the reality of it, our capacities and our ken, though we learn to know God Himself in it and enjoy this by the Holy Ghost.<a name=98:9></a> In itself, indeed, it is needful that it should surpass infinitely our capacities, because, if I may so speak, it is adapted to those of God, in respect of whom the

		reality takes place, and before whom it must be effectual, if profitable for us.<a name=99:1></a> All these profound and infinite objects of our faith, infinite in their value before God or in the demonstration of the principles on which He deals with us, become, by means of types, palpable and near to us.<a name=99:2></a> The detail of all the mercies and excellencies which are found in the reality or antitype are, in the type, presented close to the eye, with the accuracy of Him who judges of them as they are presented to His, but in a manner suited to ours, which meets our capacity; but for the purpose of elevating us to the thoughts which occupy Him Christ, according to the mind of God, in all His glory, is the picture presented.<a name=99:3></a> But we have all the lines and explanations of what is contained in it, in that which we hold in our hand -- of Him who composed the great reality.<a name=99:4></a> Blessed be His name!<a name=99:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To apply this to the sacrifices in the beginning of Leviticus, the establishment of the tabernacle embraces two points quite distinct, -- the display of the plans of God in grace, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:99">footnote</a></i>) and the place of access to Him, and also the means of meeting the necessity and sin which gave occasion for its present exercise.<a name=99:6></a> All its structure was according to a pattern given in the mount -- a pattern of heavenly things including the intercourse between heaven and earth, and shews forth the order which finds its accomplishment in the better tabernacle not made with hands.<a name=99:7></a> But the economy of the tabernacle was only actually set up after the sin of the golden calf, when the jealousy of God against sin had already broken forth; and His grace was ministered from the throne in the sanctuary by offerings which met transgression, and transgression which in result barred the entrance of the priests at all times into the sanctuary, but supplied in grace all that met the need of a sinful people.<a name=99:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence also it is that the first mention we have of the tabernacle is upon the occasion of the sin of the golden calf, when Moses's

		<a name=100>[Page 100]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		anger waxed hot against the mad impiety which had rejected God, before they had received the details and ordinances of the law of Moses, or even the ten words from the mountain.<a name=100:1></a> Moses took the tent, and pitched it without the camp, far off from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of the congregation, though that really was not yet erected; and all that sought Jehovah went forth to the tabernacle of the congregation without the camp.<a name=100:2></a> It was a place of meeting for God and those among the people who sought Him.<a name=100:3></a> In the law there was no question of seeking God.<a name=100:4></a> It was the communication of God's will to a people already assembled, in the midst of whom God manifested Himself, according to certain demands of His holiness.<a name=100:5></a> But when evil had come in, and the people as a body had apostatised and broken the covenant, then the place of assembly, where God was to be sought, was set up.<a name=100:6></a> This was before the tabernacle, as regulated according to the pattern shewn in the mount, was set up; but it established the principle on which it was founded in the most striking manner.<a name=100:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The order of the tabernacle as originally instituted was never carried out, as the law in its original character never was brought in.<a name=100:8></a> Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire the first day, and Aaron was forbidden the holiest save on the great day of atonement in another way.<a name=100:9></a> The tabernacle itself was set up according to the pattern, but the entrance to the inner sanctuary was closed.<a name=100:10></a> What was done referred to the state of sin, and was provisional, but a provision for sin, only not a finished work as we have it.<a name=100:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This meeting of Jehovah with the people, or the mediator, was twofold: apostolic, or sacrificial; that is, for the purpose of communicating His will; or of receiving the people in their worship, their failures, or their need, even as Christ Himself is the Apostle and High Priest of our profession -- expressions which allude to the circumstances of which we treat.<a name=100:12></a> Jehovah's presence in the tabernacle, for the communication of His will (with which we have to do only inasmuch as what occupies us is an example of it (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:100">footnote</a></i>[a])), is thus spoken of in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, 29.<a name=100:13></a> In chapter 25, after describing the structure of the ark and its appendages in the most holy place, it is said, "And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony which I will give thee.<a name=100:14></a> And there I will

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On this ground Leviticus commences.<a name=101:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God speaks not from Sinai, but out of the tabernacle, where He is sought; where, according to the pattern of His glory, but according also to the need of those who seek His presence, He is in relationship with the people by mediation and sacrifice.<a name=101:7></a> In Sinai, in terrible glory, He demanded, and proposed terms of, obedience, and thereupon promised His favour.<a name=101:8></a> In this the communication was direct, but the people could not bear it.<a name=101:9></a> Here He is accessible to the sinner and to the saint, but by a provided mediation and priesthood.<a name=101:10></a> But then the centre and ground of our access to God thus is Christ's obedience and offering.<a name=101:11></a> This therefore is first presented to us when God speaks in the tabernacle.<a name=101:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The order of these sacrifices is first to be remarked.<a name=101:13></a> The order of their application is uniformly opposed to the order of their institution.<a name=101:14></a> There are four great classes of offerings: 1, The burnt-offering; 2, The meat-offering; 3, The peace-offering; and 4, The sin-offering.<a name=101:15></a> I name them in the order of their institution, but, in their application, when offered together, the sin-offerings always come first, for there it is restoration to God; (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:101">footnote</a></i>) and, in approaching God by sacrifice,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=102>[Page 102]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		man must approach by the efficacy of that which takes away his sins, in that they have been borne by another.<a name=102:1></a> But in presenting the Lord Jesus Himself as the great sacrifice, His being made sin is a consequence of His offering Himself in perfectness to God, and though as made sin for us, still in His own perfectness, and for the divine glory, we say, His Father's glory; this is a great but blessed mystery.<a name=102:2></a> He gives Himself up, coming to do His Father's will, and is made for us sin, Him who knew no sin, and undergoes death.<a name=102:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Furthermore, our sins being put away, the source of communion is thus in the excellency of Christ Himself, and in His offering, who offers Himself to God, without spot; glorifying God by death inasmuch as sin was there before Him and death by sin; and He gives Himself wholly up to God's glory in respect of this state, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:102">footnote</a></i>) and then our presentation according to the preciousness of this on high, though the actual bearing of our sins be of absolute necessity to introduce us into this communion.<a name=102:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=103>[Page 103]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this is the difference of the great day of atonement.<a name=103:1></a> Then the blood was put on the mercy-seat in the holiest; but this, while giving access there on the ground of perfect cleansing through an offering of infinite value, was in respect of actual sins and defilement, not the pure sweet savour of the offering in itself to God.<a name=103:2></a> Yet it supposed sin.<a name=103:3></a> The offering would not have had its own character nor value if it had not.<a name=103:4></a> Hence, as presenting Christ, and our approach to God when sin has been fully dealt with and holiness tested, the burnt-offering, meat-offering, and peace-offering (in which latter our communion with God is presented to us), come first, and then the sin-offerings apart; needful, primarily needful to us, but not the expression of the personal perfectness of Christ, but of His sin-bearing, though perfectness were needed for that.<a name=103:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident, from what I have said, that it is Christ we are to consider in the sacrifices which are about to engage our attention: the various forms of value and efficacy which attach to that one all-perfect sacrifice.<a name=103:6></a> It is true, we may consider the Christian in a subordinate point of view as presented to us here, for he should present his body a living sacrifice.<a name=103:7></a> He, by the fruits of charity, should present sacrifices of sweet savour, acceptable to our God by Jesus Christ; but our object now is to consider Christ in them.<a name=103:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said that there are four great classes presented to us -- burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, peace-offerings, and offerings for sin.<a name=103:9></a> These may be seen thus classed in chapter 10 of the Epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=103:10></a> But then there is a very essential distinction which divides these four into two separate classes -- the sin-offerings, and all the others.<a name=103:11></a> The sin-offerings, as such, were not characterised as offerings made by fire, of a sweet savour unto Jehovah (although the fat was in most of them burnt on the altar, and in this respect the sweet savour was there, and so it is once said, chapter 4: 31; for indeed the perfection of Christ was there though bearing our sins), the others were distinctly so characterised.<a name=103:12></a> Positive sins were seen in the sin-offerings: they were charged with sins.<a name=103:13></a> He that touched those of them which fully bore this character, as being for the whole people (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:103">footnote</a></i>) (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>, <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#19">Numbers  19</a>), was defiled.<a name=103:14></a> But in the case of the burnt-offering, though not brought for positive sins,

	<div class="paragraph">
		sin is supposed; there blood was shed, and it was for propitiation, but burnt on the altar, and all was a sweet savour to God.<a name=104:1></a> It was Christ's whole sacrifice of Himself to God, and perfect as an offering in every respect, though sin, as such, was the occasion of it.<a name=104:2></a> By this sacrifice, in result, sin will be put away out of God's sight for ever -- what joy!<a name=104:3></a> see <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:29">John  1:29</a> and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:26">Hebrews  9:26</a>.<a name=104:4></a> But then we brought to the consciousness of our state of sin say, He was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=104:5></a> This is a consequence, but the basis is that, besides bearing our sins, He glorified God perfectly there where He was made sin.<a name=104:6></a> It was as in the place of sin that His obedience was perfect and God perfectly glorified in all He is (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>and 17).<a name=104:7></a> Indeed there is but one word for sin and sin-offering in the original.<a name=104:8></a> They were burnt, but not on the altar; the fat, save in one case, of which we may speak hereafter, was (chapter 4).<a name=104:9></a> The other offerings were offerings made by fire of a sweet savour unto Jehovah -- they present Christ's perfect offering of Himself to God, not the imposition of sins on the substitute by the Holy One, the Judge.<a name=104:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two points in the sacrifice of Christ are very distinct and very precious.<a name=104:11></a> God has made Him to be sin for us, Him who knew no sin: but also is it true, that through the eternal Spirit He offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=104:12></a> Let us consider this latter, as first in the order presented in Leviticus, and naturally so.<a name=104:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first sort of sacrifice, the most complete and characteristic of those characterised by being offerings made by fire of a sweet savour, was the burnt-offering.<a name=104:14></a> The offerer was to bring his offering, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:104">footnote</a></i>) in order to his acceptance with God, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and to kill it before Jehovah.<a name=104:15></a>

		First, of the place, the whole scene of the tabernacle ritual consisted of three parts: first, the holiest of all, the innermost part of the boarded space covered with tents, separated from the rest by a veil which hung before it, and within which was the ark of the covenant and the cherubim overshadowing the

		This devotedness to the Father's glory could, and indeed did, shew itself in two ways: it might be in service, and of every faculty of a living man here, in absolute devotedness to God, tested by fire even unto death; or in the giving up of life itself, giving up Himself -- His life unto death, for the divine glory, sin being there.<a name=107:4></a> Of this latter the burnt-offering speaks; of the former, I judge, the meat-offering: while both are the same in principle as entire devotedness of human existence to God -- one of the living acting man, the other the giving up of life unto death.<a name=107:5></a>

		But this faultlessness of the human nature of our Lord attaches itself to deeper and more important sources, which are presented to us in this type negatively and positively.<a name=118:12></a> If every faculty thus obeyed and were the instrument of the divine impulse in its place, it is evident that the will must be right -- that the spirit and principle of obedience must be its spring; for it is the action of an independent will which is the principle of sin.<a name=118:13></a> Christ, as a divine Person, had the title of an independent will.<a name=118:14></a> "The Son quickens whom he will;" but He came to do His Father's will.<a name=118:15></a> His will was obedience, sinless therefore, and perfect.<a name=118:16></a> Leaven, in the word, is the symbol of corruption -- "the leaven of malice and wickedness".<a name=118:17></a> In the cake, therefore, which was to be offered as a sweet savour to God, there was no leaven: where leaven was, it could not be

		When the firstfruits were offered, two cakes were offered baked with leaven, but not for an offering for a sweet savour.<a name=119:4></a> Burnt-offerings and meat-offerings were also offered, and for a sweet savour; but the offering of the firstfruits -- not (see verse 12 of this chapter, and <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>).<a name=119:5></a> And what were these firstfruits?<a name=119:6></a> The church, sanctified by the Holy Ghost.<a name=119:7></a> For this feast and offering of the firstfruits was the acknowledged and known type of the day of Pentecost -- in fact was the day of Pentecost.<a name=119:8></a> We are, says the Apostle James, a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.<a name=119:9></a> It will be seen (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>) that, the day of Christ's resurrection, the first of the fruits was offered, ears of corn unbroken, unbruised.<a name=119:10></a> Clearly there was no leaven there.<a name=119:11></a> He rose, too, without seeing corruption.<a name=119:12></a> With this no sin-offering was offered, but with the leavened cakes (which represented the assembly sanctified by the Holy Ghost to God, but still living in corrupted human nature) a sin-offering was offered; for the sacrifice of Christ for us, answered for and puts away in God's sight the leaven of our corrupted nature, overcome (but not ceasing to exist) by the operation of the Holy Ghost; by reason of which nature, in itself corrupt, we could not, in the trial of God's judgment, be a sweet savour, an offering made by fire; but, by means of Christ's sacrifice, which met and answered the evil, could be offered to God, as is said in Romans, a living sacrifice.<a name=119:13></a> Hence it is said, not merely that Christ has answered for our sins, but that "what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=119:14></a> God has condemned sin in the flesh, but it was in Christ as for, that is as a sacrifice for, sin, making atonement, undergoing the judgment due to it, being made sin for us because of it, but dying in doing so, so that we reckon ourselves dead.<a name=119:15></a> The condemnation of the sin is passed in His death, but death to it is therein come to us.<a name=119:16></a>

		As the cakes then, which represent the church, were baked with leaven, and could not be offered for a sweet savour, so the cake, which represented Christ, was without leaven, a sweet savour, and offering made by fire unto Jehovah.<a name=120:2></a> The trial of the Lord's judgment found a perfect will, and the absence of all evil, or spirit of independence.<a name=120:3></a> It was "thy will be done" which characterised the human nature of the Lord, filled with and animated by the fulness of the Godhead, but the man Jesus, the offering of God.<a name=120:4></a>

		There is another example of the converse of this which I may notice in passing -- the peace-offerings.<a name=120:5></a> There Christ had His part, man also.<a name=120:6></a> Hence in this were found cakes made with leaven along with the others which were without it.<a name=120:7></a> That offering, which represented the communion of the assembly connected with the sacrifice of Christ, necessarily brought in man, and the leaven was there -- ordained symbol of that leaven which is ever found in us.<a name=120:8></a> The assembly is called to holiness; the life of Christ in us is holiness to the Lord; but it remains ever true that in us, that is, in our flesh, dwells no good thing.<a name=120:9></a>

		There is a certain analogy in our case.<a name=122:3></a> It is a different thing to be born of God, and sealed and anointed with the Holy Ghost.<a name=122:4></a> The day of Pentecost, Cornelius, the believers of Samaria on whom the apostle laid their hands -- all prove this, as also many passages on the subject.<a name=122:5></a> We are all "the sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=122:6></a> But "because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts".<a name=122:7></a> "In whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession".<a name=122:8></a> "This spake he", says John, "of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive".<a name=122:9></a> The Holy Ghost may have produced, by a new nature, holy desires, and the love of Jesus, without the consciousness of deliverance and power -- the joy of His presence in the knowledge of the finished work of Christ.<a name=122:10></a> As to the Lord Jesus, we know that this second act, of anointing, was accomplished in connection with the perfectness of His Person, as it could, because He was righteous in Himself, when, after His baptism by John (in which He who knew no sin placed Himself with His people, then the remnant of Israel, in the first movement of grace in their hearts, shewn in going to John, to be with them in all the path of that grace from beginning to end, its trials and its sorrows), He, sinless, was anointed by the Holy Ghost, descending in a bodily shape like a dove, and was led of the Spirit into the conflict for us, and returned conqueror in its power, in the power of the Spirit, into Galilee.<a name=122:11></a> I say conqueror in its power; for if Jesus had repulsed Satan simply by divine power as such, firstly, there evidently could have been no conflict; and secondly, no example or encouragement for us.<a name=122:12></a> But the Lord repulsed him by a principle which is our duty every day -- obedience, intelligent obedience; employing the word of God, and repulsing Satan with indignation the moment he openly shews himself such.<a name=122:13></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:122">footnote</a></i>) If Christ entered into His course with the testimony and joy of a Son, He entered into a course of conflict

		Christians then, whose hearts are purified by faith, having received the word with joy, alone can worship really before God, having part in the communion of saints; and if the heart is defiled, that communion is interrupted.<a name=133:16></a> No person apparently defiled has title to share in the worship and communion of the church of God.<a name=133:17></a> It was a different thing, remark, to be not an Israelite, and not clean.<a name=133:18></a> He who was not an Israelite had never any part in the peace-offerings; he could not come nigh the tabernacle.<a name=133:19></a> Uncleanness did not prove he was no Israelite (on the contrary, this discipline was exercised on Israelites only); but the uncleanness incapacitated him from partaking, with those that were clean, in the privileges of this communion; for these peace-offerings, though enjoyed by the worshippers, belonged to the Lord (chapter 7: 20, 21).<a name=133:20></a> The unclean had no title there.<a name=133:21></a> True worshippers must worship the Father in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet there was another part of this type which seemed to contradict this, but which indeed throws additional light on it.<a name=134:3></a> With the offerings which accompanied this sacrifice, it was ordered (chapter 7: 13) that leavened cakes should be offered.<a name=134:4></a> For though that which is unclean is to be excluded (that which can be recognised as unclean), there is always a mixture of evil in us, and so far in our worship itself.<a name=134:5></a> The leaven is there (man cannot be without it); it may be a very small part of the matter, not come in to the mind, as it will be when the Spirit is not grieved, but it is there where man is.<a name=134:6></a> Unleavened bread was there also, for Christ is there, and the Spirit of Christ in us who are leavened, for man is there.<a name=134:7></a>

		When the Holy Spirit leads us into real spiritual worship, it leads us into communion with God, into the presence of God; and then, necessarily, all the infinite acceptability to Him of the offering of Christ is present to our spirit.<a name=135:1></a> We are associated with it: it forms an integral and necessary part of our communion and worship.<a name=135:2></a> We cannot be in the presence of God in communion without finding it there.<a name=135:3></a> It is indeed the ground of our acceptance, as of our communion.<a name=135:4></a>

		There was a difference in the value of the various kinds of this offering: in the case of a vow it might be eaten the second day; in the case of thanksgiving only the first.<a name=135:7></a> This typified a different degree of spiritual energy.<a name=135:8></a> When our worship is the fruit of unfeigned and single-eyed devotedness, it can sustain itself longer, through our being filled with the Spirit, in the reality of communion, and our worship be acceptable -- the savour of that sacrifice being thus longer maintained before God, who has fellowship with the joy of His people.<a name=135:9></a> For the energy of the Spirit maintains His joy in His people in communion acceptable to God.<a name=135:10></a> When, on the other hand, it is the natural consequence of blessing already conferred, it is surely acceptable as due to God, but there is not the same energy of communion.<a name=135:11></a> -- The thanks are rendered thus in communion with the Lord, but the communion passes away with the thanksgiving really offered.<a name=135:12></a>

		It is good to bear strongly in mind this expression, "which pertain to Jehovah" (chapter 7: 20); the worship, what passes in our hearts in it, is not ours -- it is God's.<a name=136:3></a> God has put it there for our joy, that we may participate in the offering of Christ, His joy in Christ; but the moment we make it ours, we desecrate it.<a name=136:4></a> Hence what remained was burnt in the fire; hence what was unclean must have nothing to do with it; hence the necessity of associating it with the fat burnt to Jehovah, that it may be really Christ in us, and so true communion, the giving forth of Christ, on whom our souls feed, towards God.<a name=136:5></a>

		Let us remember that all our worship pertains to God, that it is the expression of the excellency of Christ in us, and so our joy, as by one Spirit, with God.<a name=136:6></a> He in the Father, we in Him, and He in us, is the marvellous chain of union which exists in grace as well as in glory: our worship is the outgoings and joy of heart founded on this, towards God, by Christ.<a name=136:7></a> So, as Himself ministering in this, the Lord says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee".<a name=136:8></a> He surely is in joy and knows redemption is accomplished.<a name=136:9></a> May we be in tune with our heavenly Guide!<a name=136:10></a> He shall well conduct our praises, and agreeably to the Father.<a name=136:11></a> His ear shall be attentive when He hears this voice lead us.<a name=136:12></a> What perfect and deep experience of what is acceptable before God must He have, who, in redemption, has presented all according to God's mind!<a name=136:13></a> His mind is the expression of all that is agreeable to the Father, and He leads us, taught by Himself, though imperfect and feeble in it, in the same acceptableness.<a name=136:14></a> We have the mind of Christ.<a name=136:15></a>

		We come now to the sacrifices which were not sacrifices of sweet savour -- the sin and trespass-offerings, alike in the great principle, though differing in character and detail: this difference we will notice.<a name=137:9></a> But first a very important principle must be noticed.<a name=137:10></a> The sacrifices of which we have spoken, the sacrifices of sweet savour, presented the identity of the offerer and the victim: this identity was signified by the laying on of the hands of the worshippers.<a name=137:11></a> But in those sacrifices the worshipper came as an offerer, whether Christ or one led by the Spirit of Christ, and so identified with Him in presenting himself to God -- came of his own voluntary will, and was identified as a worshipper with the acceptability and acceptance of his victim.<a name=137:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case of the sin-offering, there was the same principle of identity with the victim by laying on of hands; but he who came, came not as a worshipper, but as a sinner; not as clean for communion with the Lord, but as having guilt upon him; and instead of his being identified with the acceptability of the victim, though that became subsequently true, the victim became identified with his guilt and unacceptableness, bore his sins and was treated accordingly.<a name=137:13></a> This was completely the case where the sin-offering was purely such.<a name=137:14></a> I have added, "though that became subsequently true", because in many of

		the sin-offerings a certain part identified them with the acceptableness of Christ, which, in Him who united in His Person the virtue of all the sacrifices, could never be lost sight of.<a name=138:1></a> The distinction between the identity of the victim with the sin of the guilty, and the identity of the worshipper with the acceptance of the victim, marks the difference of these sacrifices and of the double aspect of the work of Christ very clearly.<a name=138:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now come to the details.<a name=138:3></a> There were four ordinary classes of sin and trespass-offerings, besides two very important special offerings, of which we may speak hereafter: sins where natural conscience was violated; that which became evil by the ordinance of the Lord, as uncleannesses which made the worshipper inadmissible, and other things (this had a mixed character of sin and trespass, and is called by both names); wrongs done to the Lord in His holy things; and wrongs done to the neighbour by breaches of confidence and the like.<a name=138:4></a> The first class is in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4">Leviticus  4</a>; the second, attached to it, down to verse 13 of chapter 5; the third, from verse 14 to the end; the fourth, in the first seven verses of chapter 6.<a name=138:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two other remarkable examples of sin-offering were the day of expiation, and the red heifer, which demand an examination apart.<a name=138:6></a> The circumstances of the offering were simple.<a name=138:7></a> In the case of the high priest and the body of the people sinning, it is evident that all communion was interrupted.<a name=138:8></a> It was not merely the restoration of the individual to communion which was needed, but the restoration of communion between God and the whole people; not the forming a relation (the day of atonement effected that), but the re-establishment of interrupted communion.<a name=138:9></a> Hence the blood was sprinkled before the veil seven times for the perfect restoration of this communion, and the blood also put on the horns of the altar of incense.<a name=138:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the sin was individual, the communion of the people in general was not interrupted, but the individual had lost his enjoyment of the blessing.<a name=138:11></a> The blood was sprinkled therefore, not where the priest approached -- at the altar of incense; but where the individual did -- at the altar of burnt-offering.<a name=138:12></a> The efficacy of the sin-offering of Christ is needed, but has been once for all accomplished, for every fault; but the communion of the worshipping body of the church, though lamed and hindered, is not cut off by the individual sin; but when this is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indeed it appears to me very clear, in the case alluded to, that, though the occasion of the chastening is evident in the sin of Achan, Israel had shewn a confidence in human strength which was chastised and shewn vain in the result, as divine strength was shewn all-sufficient in Jericho.<a name=139:7></a> However that is, it is evident from the detail of these sin-offerings that God can let nothing pass; He can forgive all and cleanse from all, but let nothing pass.<a name=139:8></a> The sin hidden to a man's self is not hidden to God; and why is it hidden to himself, but that negligence, the fruit of sin, has stupified his spiritual intelligence and attention?<a name=139:9></a>

		The bodies of those in which the whole people, or the high priest (which came to the same thing, for the communion of the whole body was interrupted), were concerned, were burnt without the camp; not those for individuals, nor those which were for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire, though the whole were burnt.<a name=140:15></a> But those for the high priest, or the whole people were: they had been made sin, and were carried out of the camp as such.<a name=140:16></a> The sacrifice itself was without blemish, and the fat was burnt on the altar; but, the offender having confessed his sins on its head, it was viewed as bearing these sins, and made sin of God, was taken without the camp; as Jesus (as the epistle to the Hebrews applies it) suffered without the gate, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood.<a name=140:17></a> This was always the case when the blood was brought into the sanctuary for sin.<a name=140:18></a>

		One of the sacrifices, of which I do not enter into the details here, was abstractedly and altogether viewed in this light of sin, and was slain and burnt, fat and blood (part of the blood having been first sprinkled at the door of the tabernacle), and every part of it, without the camp.<a name=141:1></a> This was the red heifer.<a name=141:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the three other sacrifices, which concerned the whole people, the bodies were burnt indeed without the camp, but the connection with the perfect acceptance of Christ in His work, as offering Himself, was preserved, in the burning of the fat on the altar of burnt-offering, and thus gave us the full sense of how He had been made sin indeed, but that it was He who knew no sin, and whose offering in His most inmost thoughts and nature was in the trial of God's judgment perfectly agreeable.<a name=141:3></a> But though the fat was burnt on the altar to maintain this association and the unity of the sacrifice of Christ, yet, maintaining the general character and purpose of the diversity, it is not habitually called (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:141">footnote</a></i>) a sweet savour to Jehovah.<a name=141:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was a difference, however, between one of the three last-mentioned sacrifices, the sacrifice of the great day of atonement, and the two others mentioned in the beginning of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4">Leviticus  4</a>.<a name=141:5></a> In the sacrifice of the great day of expiation the blood was carried within the veil; for this was the foundation of all other sacrifices, of all relationship between God and Israel, and enabled God to dwell among them so as to receive the others.<a name=141:6></a> Its efficacy lasted throughout the year -- for us, for ever -- as the apostle reasons in the Hebrews; and on it was based all the intercourse between God and the people.<a name=141:7></a> Hence the blood of it was sprinkled on the mercy-seat, to be for ever before the eyes of Him, whose throne of grace, as of righteousness, that mercy-seat was thus to be.<a name=141:8></a> And God, by virtue of it, dwelt among the people, careless and rebellious as they were.<a name=141:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such also is the efficacy of the blood of Jesus.<a name=141:10></a> It is for ever on the mercy-seat, efficacious as the ground of the relationship between us and God.<a name=141:11></a> The other sin-offerings referred to were to restore the communion of those who were in this relationship.<a name=141:12></a> Hence, in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4:1">Leviticus  4:1</a> - 21, the blood was sprinkled on the altar of incense, which was the symbol of the exercise of this communion; the residue poured out, as habitually in the sacrifices, at the altar of burnt-offering -- the place of accepted sacrifice; the body, as we have seen, was burnt.<a name=141:13></a> In the case of the offerings for the sin and trespass of an individual the

	<div class="paragraph">
		communion of the body was not directly in question or interrupted, but the individual was deprived of the enjoyment of it.<a name=142:1></a> Hence the altar of incense was not defiled or incapacitated, as it were, in its use; on the contrary it was continually used.<a name=142:2></a> The blood of these sacrifices, therefore, was put on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, which was always the place of individual approach.<a name=142:3></a> Here, by Christ and the efficacy of the sacrifice of Christ once offered, every individual soul approaches; and, being thus accepted, enjoys all the blessing and the privileges of which the church at large is continually in possession.<a name=142:4></a> But for us the veil is rent, and as to conscience of guilt we are perfected for ever.<a name=142:5></a> If our walk be defiled, water by the word restores the communion of our souls, and that with the Father and with His Son.<a name=142:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To speak of resprinkling of blood consequently upsets the real position of the Christian, and throws him back on his own imperfect state as to acceptance and righteousness.<a name=142:7></a> There may be a repeated remedy, but one who is on that ground drops the question of holiness, and makes continuous righteousness in Christ uncertain.<a name=142:8></a> "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity", is unknown in such cases; as is also that the worshipper once purged should have no more conscience of sins.<a name=142:9></a> Were it so, as the apostle urges, Christ must have suffered often.<a name=142:10></a> Without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=142:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was another circumstance in these sin-offerings for the individual.<a name=142:12></a> The priest who offered the blood ate the victim.<a name=142:13></a> Thus there was the most perfect identity between the priest, and the victim which represented the sin of the offerer.<a name=142:14></a> As Christ is both, the eating by the priest shews how He did thus make it His own.<a name=142:15></a> Only, in Christ, what was thus typified was first effected when victim, and the priesthood, as exercised for us now in heaven, comes after.<a name=142:16></a> Still this eating shews the heart of Christ taking it up as He does for us when we fail, not merely its being laid vicariously on Him, though then His heart took up our cause.<a name=142:17></a> But He cared for the sheep.<a name=142:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The priest had not committed the sin; on the contrary, he had made atonement for it by the blood which he had sprinkled, but he identified himself completely with it.<a name=142:19></a> Thus Christ, giving us the most complete consolation -- Himself spotless, and who has made the atonement, yet identified Himself with all our faults and sins, as the worshipper in the peace-offering was identified with the acceptance of the sacrifice.<a name=142:20></a> Only that now,

		In the other cases, perfect acceptance, a sweet savour, and in some cases our leavened cakes, are found therewith in the use of them; but all passed in the natural delight, so to speak, which God took in what was perfect and infinitely excellent, though it supposed sin and judgment to be there; but here the most remarkable and exact sanctions of its holiness were enjoined (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#6:26">Leviticus  6:26</a> - 28).<a name=144:1></a> There was nothing in the whole work of Jesus which so marked His entire and perfect separation to God His positive holiness, as His bearing sin.<a name=144:2></a> He who knew no sin alone could be made sin, and the act itself was the most utter separation to God conceivable, yea, an act which no thought of ours can fathom, to bear all, and to His glory.<a name=144:3></a> It was a total consecration of Himself, at all cost, to God's glory; as God, indeed, could accept nothing else.<a name=144:4></a> And the victim must have been as perfect as the self-offering was.<a name=144:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a sacrifice then for sins, and as made sin, Christ is specially holy; as indeed, now in the power of this sacrifice, a Priest present before God, making intercession, He is "holy, harmless, separate from sinners, made higher than the heavens".<a name=144:6></a> Yet, so truly was it a bearing of sins, and viewed as made sin, that he who carried the goat before his letting loose, and he that gathered the ashes of the red heifer, and sprinkled the water of separation, were unclean until even, and must wash to come into the camp.<a name=144:7></a> Thus are these two great truths in the sin-offering of Christ distinctly presented to us in these sacrifices.<a name=144:8></a> For, indeed, how can we conceive a greater separation to God, in Christ, than His offering Himself as a victim for sin?<a name=144:9></a> And, on the other hand, had He not really borne our sins in all their evil, He could not have put them away really in the judgment.<a name=144:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thus man is consecrated.<a name=152:4></a> The heart is first purified in the conscience.<a name=152:5></a> The things to which he had given way are, as it were, brought to the conscience, which takes a painful knowledge of them, according to the value of the blood of the precious Lamb of God, who, without spot, and perfect in obedience, had to suffer the agony caused by the sin from which we have to be cleansed -- wretched creatures that we are.<a name=152:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		provision for the purification of the sanctuary which was in the midst of a people who defiled it, and secondly, for the atonement of the sins of the people themselves.<a name=156:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In general, there are two great ideas; first, that the atonement was made, so that the relationship of the people with God was maintained notwithstanding their sins; and then, in the second place, in the difficulties which surrounded the entrance of Aaron into the holy place, there was the testimony (according to the Epistle to the Hebrews itself) that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest during that dispensation.<a name=156:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to examine this chapter under these two points of view.<a name=156:3></a> It stands alone.<a name=156:4></a> No mention is made anywhere else of what took place on that solemn day.<a name=156:5></a> The sacrifice of Christ, as meeting God's righteousness against sin as the ground of redemption, was typified by the passover.<a name=156:6></a> It was a question of drawing near unto God who revealed Himself on His throne -- of cleansing defilements -- of taking away the sins of those who would draw near, and of purifying their conscience.<a name=156:7></a> Now, while presenting to us in figure God's means of doing this, it signified indeed that the thing was not done.<a name=156:8></a> As to the general idea of its efficacy, the high priest drew near personally, and filled the most holy place with incense.<a name=156:9></a> So Christ goes in personally in the perfect savour of what He is for God.<a name=156:10></a> The place of God's presence was full of it.<a name=156:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The expression "that he die not" expresses the absolutely obligatory nature of anything which was fulfilled in Christ.<a name=156:12></a> Personally he appears before God, being as ointment poured forth, a sweet savour, connected with fire from the altar, that is, based on judgment and death, but only bringing out a perfect sweet odour to God: not blood for others, but fire for the testing of his perfectness; not in this case to cleanse, but to bring out the odour of this good ointment.<a name=156:13></a> Then he took some blood, which he put on the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat.<a name=156:14></a> Atonement or propitiation was made according to the requirement of the nature and majesty of the throne of God Himself, so that the full satisfaction made to His majesty rendered the throne of justice favourable, a place of acceptance; grace had free course, and the worshipper found the blood there before him when he drew near, and even as a testimony before the throne.<a name=156:15></a> Then, secondly, the high priest cleansed the tabernacle, the altar of incense, and all that was found there.<a name=156:16></a> But it was only that which was within.<a name=156:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=157>[Page 157]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were thus two things; the blood presented to God, the throne was a throne of grace according to righteousness -- the conscience being purified, so that we enter with boldness now; and then the place was cleansed, with all that belonged to it, according to the nature and presence of God, who dwelt there.<a name=157:1></a> In virtue of the sprinkling of His blood, Christ will reconcile all things in heaven and earth -- but here this is only shewn as to the heavenly part -- having made peace through the blood of His cross.<a name=157:2></a> There could be no guiltiness in the tabernacle, but it was the place of God's dwelling, and God would cleanse away the defilements, that they might not appear before Him.<a name=157:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third place (but this as a distinct service) there was no cleansing of that which was outside, but the high priest confessed the sins of the people over the scape-goat, which, sent away unto a land not inhabited, bore all the sins away from God, never to be found again.<a name=157:4></a> It is here that the idea of substitution is presented most clearly.<a name=157:5></a> There are three things: the blood on the mercy-seat, the reconciliation of the sanctuary, and the sins confessed and borne by another.<a name=157:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that, though the scape-goat was sent away alive, he was identified as to the efficacy of the work with the death of the other.<a name=157:7></a> The idea of the eternal sending away of sins out of remembrance is only added to the thought of death.<a name=157:8></a> The glory of God was established, on one side, in the putting of the blood on the mercy-seat; and, on the other, there was the substitution of the scape-goat, of the Lord Jesus, in His precious grace, for the guilty persons whose cause He had undertaken; and, the sins of these having been borne, their deliverance was full, entire, and final.<a name=157:9></a> The first goat was Jehovah's lot -- it was a question of His character and His majesty.<a name=157:10></a> The other was the lot of the people, which definitively represented the people in their sins.<a name=157:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two aspects of the death of Jesus must be carefully distinguished in the atoning sacrifice He has accomplished.<a name=157:12></a> He has glorified God, and God acts according to the value of that blood towards all.<a name=157:13></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:157">footnote</a></i>) He has borne the sins of His people; and the salvation of His people is complete.<a name=157:14></a> And, in a certain sense, the first part is the most important.<a name=157:15></a> Sin having come in, the justice of God might, it is true, have got rid of the sinner;

		but where would then have been His love and His counsels of grace, pardon, and even the maintenance of His glory according to His true nature as love, while righteous and holy too?<a name=158:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not speaking here of the persons who were to be saved, but of the glory of God Himself.<a name=158:2></a> But the perfect death of Jesus -- His blood put on the throne of God -- has established and brought into evidence all that God is, all His glory, as no creation could have done it; His truth (for He had passed sentence of death) is made good in the highest way in Jesus; His majesty, for His Son submits to all for His glory; His justice against sin; His infinite love.<a name=158:3></a> God found means therein to accomplish His counsels of grace, in maintaining all the majesty of His justice and of His divine dignity; for what, like the death of Jesus, could have glorified them?<a name=158:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore this devotedness of Jesus, God's Son, to His glory -- His submission, even unto death, that God might be maintained in the full glory of His rights, has given its outlet to the love of God, freedom to its action; wherefore Jesus says, "I have a baptism to be baptised with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!<a name=158:5></a>" His heart, full of love, was driven back, in its personal manifestation, by the sin of man, who would not have it; but through the atonement it could flow forth to the sinner, in the accomplishment of God's grace and of His counsels, unhindered; and Jesus Himself had, so to speak, rights upon that love -- a position we are brought into through grace, and which has none like it.<a name=158:6></a> "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again".<a name=158:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We speak with reverence of such things, but it is good to speak of them; for the glory of our God, and of Him whom He has sent, is found therein established and manifested.<a name=158:8></a> There is not one attribute, one trait of the divine character, which has not been manifested in all its perfection, and fully glorified in that which took place between God and Jesus Himself.<a name=158:9></a> That we have been saved and redeemed, and that our sins have been atoned for in that same sacrifice, according to the counsels of the grace of God, is (I presume to say it, precious and important as it is for us) the inferior part of that work, if anything whatever may be called inferior where everything is perfect: its object at least -- we sinners -- is inferior, if the work is equally perfect in every point of view.<a name=158:10></a> Nor can they indeed be separated; for if sin had not been there, where
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=159>[Page 159]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		would that in God have been displayed, which has been in putting it away?<a name=159:1></a> Nor is it here only, though we know it here; we shall be eternally in glory, the proof and living witness as to the efficacy of Christ's work.<a name=159:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having considered a little the grand principles, we may now examine the particular circumstances.<a name=159:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will have been observed that there were two sacrifices; one for Aaron and his family, the other for the people.<a name=159:4></a> Aaron and his sons always represent the church, not in the sense of one body, but as a company of priests.<a name=159:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have, even in the day of atonement, the distinction between those who form the church, and the earthly people who form the camp of God on the earth.<a name=159:6></a> Believers have their place outside the camp, where their Head has suffered as sacrifice for sin; but, in consequence, they have their place in the presence of God in the heavens, where their Head has entered.<a name=159:7></a> Outside the camp, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:159">footnote</a></i>) here below, answers to a heavenly portion above: they are the two positions of the ever blessed Christ.<a name=159:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the professing church takes the position of the camp here below, the place of the believer is always outside.<a name=159:9></a> It is, indeed, what she has done; she boasts of it -- but it is Jewish.<a name=159:10></a> Israel must indeed recognise themselves outside at last, in order to be saved and to be brought in again, through grace; because the Saviour, whom they despised in a day of blindness, has in grace borne all their sins as a nation, owned in the remnant, for He died for that nation.<a name=159:11></a> We anticipate that position whilst Christ is in heaven.<a name=159:12></a> The heart of the remnant of Israel will indeed be brought back to Jehovah before that time; they will only enter into the power of the sacrifice when they shall look upon Him whom they pierced, and mourn for Him.<a name=159:13></a> Therefore was it prescribed that it should be a day to afflict their souls, and that he who did not should be cut off.<a name=159:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The day of atonement supposes, moreover, according to the state of things found in the wilderness, that the people were in a state of incapacity for the enjoyment of the relations with God fully manifested.<a name=159:15></a> God had redeemed them, had spoken to them; but the heart of Israel, of man however favoured,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=160>[Page 160]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was incapable of it in its natural state.<a name=160:1></a> Israel had made the golden calf, and Moses put a veil over his face; Nadab and Abihu had offered strange fire upon the altar of God -- fire which had not been taken from the altar of burnt-offering.<a name=160:2></a> The way into the holiest is closed; Aaron is forbidden to enter there at all times.<a name=160:3></a> He never went in in his garments of glory and beauty.<a name=160:4></a> When he went in, it was not for communion, but for the cleansing of the sanctuary defiled by the iniquities of a people among whom God dwelt; and the day of atonement is only introduced with a prohibition of entering at all times into the holy place, and is conspicuous as taking place after the death of the sons of Aaron.<a name=160:5></a> He does it with a cloud of incense, lest he die.<a name=160:6></a> It was truly a gracious provision, in order that the people should not perish on account of their defilements; but the Holy Ghost was signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest.<a name=160:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what, then, is our position changed?<a name=160:8></a> The veil is rent; and we enter, as priests, with boldness into the holiest, by a new and living way through the veil, that is to say, the flesh of Christ.<a name=160:9></a> We enter in without conscience of sins, because the blow which rent the veil, to shew all the glory and the majesty of the throne, and the holiness of Him who sits thereon, has taken away the sins which would have incapacitated us from entering in, or from looking within.<a name=160:10></a> We are even seated there in Christ our Head -- the Head of His body the church.<a name=160:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the meantime, Israel is outside.<a name=160:12></a> The church is seen in the Person of Christ, the High Priest, and the whole of this dispensation is the day of atonement, during which Israel's High Priest is hid within the veil.<a name=160:13></a> The veil which hid the import of all these figures is indeed done away in Christ, so that we have full liberty by the Spirit, but it is upon their hearts.<a name=160:14></a> He maintains there within, it is true, their cause through the blood which He presents; but the testimony to it is not yet presented to them outside, nor their consciences freed by the knowledge that their sins are lost for ever in a land not inhabited, where they will never be found again.<a name=160:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now our position is, properly speaking, inside, in the person of Aaron, the blood being on the mercy-seat.<a name=160:16></a> We are not only justified by the scape-goat, as being without; that is done, it is clear, and once for all, for the veil is only on the heart of Israel, it is no longer between us and God.<a name=160:17></a> But we have gone in with the High Priest, as united to Him; we are not waiting

		<a name=161>[Page 161]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		for reconciliation till He comes out.<a name=161:1></a> Israel, though the forgiveness be the same, will receive these things, when the true Aaron comes out of the tabernacle.<a name=161:2></a> This is why that which characterised the sacrifice of Aaron and his sons was the blood put inside on the mercy-seat, and the going in of Aaron in person.<a name=161:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the church is composed of persons who are here below, who have committed sins.<a name=161:4></a> Thus seen in the world, they are, as to their conscience, in the rank of the outside people, as well as Aaron himself, not viewed as a typical individual; and the conscience is purified by the certainty that Christ has borne all our sins in His body on the tree.<a name=161:5></a> Our position is within according to the value of the blood of Christ, and the perfect acceptance of His Person.<a name=161:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the same with regard to the expectation of Christ.<a name=161:7></a> If I consider myself as a man responsible upon earth, I expect Him for the deliverance of all things, and to put an end to all suffering, and to all the power of evil; and so individually myself, as a servant, I look to receive, at His appearing here, the testimony of His approval, as a Master, before the whole world, though if we had done all that was commanded us we have only to say we are unprofitable servants, we have done that which it is our duty to do -- I speak merely of the principle.<a name=161:8></a> But if I think of my privileges, as a member of His body, I think of my union with Him above, and that I shall come back with Him when He shall come to appear in His glory.<a name=161:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well we should know how to make this distinction; without it there will be confusion in our thoughts, and in our use of many passages.<a name=161:10></a> The same thing is true in the personal religion of every day.<a name=161:11></a> I can consider myself as in Christ, and united to Him, seated in Him in heavenly places, enjoying all the privileges which He enjoys before God, His Father, and also as united to Him as Head of the body.<a name=161:12></a> I may also look upon myself as a poor weak being, walking individually upon the earth, having wants, faults, and temptations to overcome; and I see Christ above, whilst I am here below, Christ appearing alone for me before the throne -- for me, happy in having, in the presence of God, Him who is perfect, but who has gone through the experiences of my sorrows; who is no longer in the circumstances in which I find myself -- but with God for me who am in them.<a name=161:13></a> This is the doctrine of the Epistle to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=162>[Page 162]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hebrews; (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:162">footnote</a></i>) whilst the union of the church with Christ is more particularly taught in that to the Ephesians; in John's writings we are taught that the individual is in Him.<a name=162:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After this quite special instruction of the day of atonement come some directions, not to purify from defilements, but to preserve from them either the people or the service of the priests (chapter 17).<a name=162:2></a> It is to maintain them as a people holy to God, and keep them from all that would dishonour Him in their relations with Him, and themselves in their relations with others.<a name=162:3></a> Life belongs to God.<a name=162:4></a> And where it is taken, it must be offered in sacrifice and in sacrifice of course to God.<a name=162:5></a> The blood must be sprinkled, and the fat burned on the altar.<a name=162:6></a> Thus the danger of secret departure of the heart to demons was guarded against, and God's title to life, and the truth of sacrifice were maintained -- all vital truths.<a name=162:7></a> Thus God was owned and honoured, and man's relationship with Him.<a name=162:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 18 keeps them from dishonouring themselves in the things which belong to nature itself -- to what man ought to be in his natural relations, that he might not dishonour himself.<a name=162:9></a> Man ought not to do it; but, not having honoured God, he has been left to dishonour himself (compare <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1">Romans  1</a>).<a name=162:10></a> The people of God, being brought into nearness to Him, are taught on this subject.<a name=162:11></a> They were separated from the evil of the world they were called out of, and the reckless profligacy into which Satan had driven degraded man as his sport.<a name=162:12></a> Verse 6 is the great principle which is insisted on in the chapter -- not to confound the intimacies of marriage with the confidence of natural relationship.<a name=162:13></a> Those things are forbidden into which, in the satanic and unnatural indulgence of flesh, Satan plunged man, and to which God had given them up to work all uncleanness with greediness.<a name=162:14></a> The comeliness of nature is maintained; what is defiling forbidden.<a name=162:15></a> Jehovah's statutes and judgments were to guide them: man in probation walking in them would live.<a name=162:16></a>

		side of good, though keeping themselves from all that was profane, or profaning what was holy; but we find what is good and kind and comely, what ought to be their conduct, in various details, in the relationship they sustain one with the other, either with regard to various dangers to which they were exposed in their walk, in their every-day circumstances: for they had to do with God, and Jehovah was their God.<a name=163:1></a> The people of God were, in all their ways, to walk in a manner worthy of this relationship, and even to understand what was suitable to man, to every relationship in which they were found, according to God.<a name=163:2></a> Thus, though it was not here priesthood, it was the practical maintenance of this relationship with Him who dwelt among them, and to whom they drew nigh, by guarding against defilements unsuited to those who were in it.<a name=163:3></a> It is here we find the precept to love our neighbour as ourselves.<a name=163:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 20 guards more against the evil and corruption which was found amongst the nations.<a name=163:5></a> In both they are called to be holy, in chapter 19 more in conformity to the character of God, in chapter 20 to keep apart from idols and evil because Jehovah had sanctified them to Himself.<a name=163:6></a> It insists upon purity in every respect.<a name=163:7></a>

		After that comes power, the firstfruits; that is, the resurrection of Christ on the morrow after the sabbath -- the first day of the week.<a name=169:2></a> It was the beginning of the true harvest -- harvest gathered, by power, outside and beyond the natural life of the world.<a name=169:3></a> According to the Jewish law nothing of the harvest could be touched before: Christ was the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.<a name=169:4></a> With this first of the firstfruits were offered sacrifices for a sweet savour, but not for sin.<a name=169:5></a> It is clear there was no need for it.<a name=169:6></a> It is Christ who has been offered to God, quite pure, and waved before God -- placed fully before His eyes for us, as raised from the dead, the beginning of a new crop before God -- man in a condition which not even innocent Adam was in, the Man of God's counsels, the second Man, the last Adam: not, all hanging on obedience which might fail, and did, but after God had been perfectly glorified in the place of sin, past death, past sin (for He died unto sin?<a name=169:7></a>, past Satan's power, past judgment, and consequently by thus wholly out of the scene where responsible man had stood, on a totally new footing with God after His finished work, and God perfectly glorified; such a work too as gave Him title to say, therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again, and made it God's righteousness to set Him at His right hand in glory.<a name=169:8></a>

		Connected with that comes the meat-offering at the end of the seven weeks.<a name=169:9></a> It is no longer Christ here, but those who are His, the firstfruits of His creatures; they are considered as being upon earth, and leaven is found in them.<a name=169:10></a> Therefore, though offered to God, they were not burned as a sweet savour (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#2:12">Leviticus  2:12</a>); but with the loaves was offered a sin-offering, which answered by its efficacy to the leaven found in them.<a name=169:11></a> They are the saints of which Pentecost commenced the ingathering.<a name=169:12></a>

		Pentecostal work being ended, another series of events begins (verse 23) with the words referred to, "And Jehovah spake unto Moses".<a name=170:3></a> They blow up the trumpet in the new moon (compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#81">Psalm  81</a>; <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10:3">Numbers  10:3</a>, 10).<a name=170:4></a> It was the renewal of the blessing and the splendour of the people -- Israel gathered as an assembly before Jehovah.<a name=170:5></a> It is not yet the restoration of joy and gladness, but at least the renewal of the light and reflected glory which had disappeared takes place, and enlightens their expectant eyes; and they gather the assembly to re-establish the glory.<a name=170:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Israel must at least feel their sin; and in the solemn feast which follows, the affliction of the people is connected with the sacrifice of the day of atonement: Israel shall look on Him whom they have pierced, and mourn.<a name=170:7></a> The nation (at least the spared remnant who become the nation) will participate in the efficacy of the sacrifice of Christ, and that in their state here below, repenting, and recognised of God, so that the times of refreshing will be come.<a name=170:8></a> This is then the repentance of the people, but in connection with the atoning sacrifice.<a name=170:9></a> The efficacy is in the sacrifice; their participation in it is connected with the affliction of their souls (compare <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#12">Zechariah  12</a>).<a name=170:10></a> But Israel did nothing -- it was a sabbath -- they were assembled in humiliation in the presence of God.<a name=170:11></a> They accept the pierced One under the sense of the sin of which they have been guilty in rejecting Him.<a name=170:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then follows the feast of tabernacles.<a name=170:13></a> They offered, during seven days, offerings made by fire unto Jehovah; and on the eighth day there was again a holy convocation -- an extraordinary day of a new week which went beyond the full time -- including, I doubt not, the resurrection; that is, the participation of those who are raised in that joy.<a name=170:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was a solemn assembly -- that eighth day, the great day of the feast, on which the Lord (having declared of the then time that His hour was not yet come to shew Himself to the world -- His brethren [the Jews] not believing in Him either) announced that for him who believed in Him there would be, in the meanwhile, rivers of living water which would flow from his belly; that is, the Holy Spirit, who would be a living power working in, and flowing forth from the heart, and in the expression of its intimate affections.<a name=170:15></a> Israel had indeed drunk of the living

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, the feast of tabernacles is the joy of the millennium, when Israel have come out of the wilderness where their sins have placed them; but to which will be added this first day of another week -- the resurrection joy of those who are raised with the Lord Jesus, to which the presence of the Holy Ghost answers meanwhile.<a name=171:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Consequently, we find that the feast of tabernacles took place after the increase of the earth had been gathered in, and, as we learn elsewhere, not only after the harvest but after the vintage also; that is, after separation by judgment, and the final execution of judgment on the earth, when heavenly and earthly saints should be all gathered in.<a name=171:4></a> Israel was to rejoice seven days before Jehovah.<a name=171:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passover has had its antitype, Pentecost its also; but this day of joy is yet awaiting Him who is to be the centre and spring of it all, the Lord Jesus, who will rejoice in the great congregation, and whose praise will begin with Jehovah in the great assembly (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>).<a name=171:6></a> He had already done it in the midst of the assembly of His brethren; but now the whole race of Jacob is called to glorify Him, and all the ends of the world shall remember themselves.<a name=171:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The expression, solemn assembly, is not found applied to any of the feasts but this, except to the seventh day of the passover (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#16">Deuteronomy  16</a>), as it seems to me somewhat in the same sense.<a name=171:8></a> The feast of tabernacles could not be kept in the wilderness.<a name=171:9></a> In order to observe it, the people were to be in possession of the land, as is plain.<a name=171:10></a> It is also to be observed, that it never was kept according to the prescriptions of the law from Joshua till Nehemiah (<a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#8:17">Nehemiah  8:17</a>).<a name=171:11></a> Israel had forgotten that they had been strangers in the wilderness.<a name=171:12></a> Joy, without the remembrance of this, tends to ruin; the very enjoyment of the blessing leads to it.<a name=171:13></a>

		It will be remarked that, properly speaking, all the feasts are types of what is done on earth and in connection with Israel, unless we except the eighth day of tabernacles.<a name=172:1></a> The church period, as such, is the lapse of time from Pentecost to the seventh month.<a name=172:2></a> We may, and of course do, get the benefit of, at any rate, the two first; but historically the type refers to Israel.<a name=172:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The remaining chapters of this book appear to me to have a special bearing.<a name=172:4></a> The Spirit of God has presented, in chapter 23, the history of the ways of God towards His people upon earth from beginning to end, from Christ to the millennial rest.<a name=172:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 24 presents first the internal work, so to speak, which related to priesthood alone on the one hand, and the public sin of an apostate on the other -- the fruit of the alliance with an Egyptian who blasphemed Jehovah.<a name=172:6></a> Through the care of priesthood (whatever might be God's public ways, and the state of Israel) the gracious light of the Spirit would be maintained, and that particularly from the evening until the morning -- the time during which darkness brooded over Israel.<a name=172:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, the incense which was on the memorial of the bread, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, was burned as a sweet smell to Jehovah, and the priests identified themselves with the tribes by eating this bread -- the action of eating having the significance of continued identification.<a name=172:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus priesthood maintained the light with respect to Israel, when all was darkness in the midst of them, and the memorial of Israel was in sweet savour before God, the priesthood identifying itself with them; although the people were in the eyes of man as lost, they exist through the priesthood of Jesus on high, as a memorial before God.<a name=172:9></a> There is a certain sense in which the church participates in this, as is explained doctrinally in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>.<a name=172:10></a> This is only as far as promise goes, and the being children of Abraham, not the mystery in which we are taken up as lost sinners, without promise, and placed by sovereign grace in the same glory as the Lord Jesus.<a name=172:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#54">Isaiah  54</a>we see that believers are reckoned to Jerusalem, in grace, though she were a widow.<a name=172:12></a>

		The last chapter (27) treats of the rights and the appointments of God in all that relates to things which are devoted to Him through the medium of priesthood.<a name=173:12></a> This necessarily finds its place in that which treats of priesthood; but it has, I doubt not, a much wider meaning.<a name=173:13></a> The subject treated is that of him who devotes himself to God, and that of the lands belonging to Him -- of the rights of Israel, whose possession it was not, and of their selling it to others.<a name=173:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Christ, He offered Himself without spot to God; He was valued at a low price.<a name=173:15></a> Israel by right belonged to Jehovah.<a name=173:16></a> As Emmanuel's land, the Israelites only enjoyed the land without being proprietors, and they could only pledge it till jubilee; it would then return to its possessor as Emmanuel's land.<a name=173:17></a> Israel (looked at as the possessor of the gift of God) not having redeemed it when sold to the stranger, when the jubilee comes the land will be absolutely the Lord's; the priest will

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only point out the principle presented in the chapter, without pretending to enter into all the details of application which may suggest themselves.<a name=174:3></a> The principle is the important thing to enable one to understand the purpose of God; in the case of any vow, whether it be redeemed or not; or of land, whether it shall return in the day of jubilee, when God shall take possession again of His rights in the land of Israel, and cause to enter those whose right it is.<a name=174:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the government of God, resulting in His return in grace to His unconditional promise and [earthly] purpose are given to us in chapter 26, and the absolute title of Jehovah in chapter 27.<a name=174:5></a> Chapter 26 is in fact a parenthesis shewing God's ways, with return to His promise in grace; chapter 25 man's redeeming, if he could, or his kinsman; chapter 27 God's absolute title.<a name=174:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be observed also, that the judgment is according to the judgment of the priest.<a name=174:7></a> But although this be attributed to the priest, it is to the king in Jeshurun (the upright) that the appreciation is entrusted.<a name=174:8></a> This shews plainly who is to do it, and under what character, though being according to the discernment, the grace, and the rights of priesthood.<a name=174:9></a> It is Christ as Priest, but Christ as King in Israel, who will order all that.<a name=174:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Leviticus contains the revelation of God sitting upon the throne, where He places Himself that He may be approached by the people, as far as they could come; that of the priesthood brought into proximity to the throne, as far as men could have access to it; and then the promulgation of the commandments relative to these two great facts, in that which concerned the generality of the people.<a name=175:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Numbers we have the service and walk of the people, figuratively of the saints through this world: and, consequently, that which relates to the Levites, and the journey through the wilderness.<a name=175:2></a> Now, as Leviticus ended with regulations and warnings respecting the possession of the land, and that with regard to the rights of God, and consequently to the rights of His people, the Book of Numbers brings us through the wilderness to the moment before the entrance of the people into the land at the end of the wilderness journey, and speaks of that grace which justifies the people at the close, notwithstanding all their unfaithfulness.<a name=175:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to keep in mind that as to the efficacy of redemption the people were brought to God at Sinai (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:13">Exodus  15:13</a> and 19: 4).<a name=175:4></a> All in this respect was complete (compare the thief on the cross and <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:12">Colossians  1:12</a>).<a name=175:5></a> The wilderness journey is a distinct thing; no part of the purpose of God, but of His ways with us.<a name=175:6></a> Hence it is here "if" comes in and the time of testing.<a name=175:7></a> Jordan coalescing with the Red Sea, coming out and going in (only the ark was in Jordan), there was no question of judgment or enemies.<a name=175:8></a> It is the experimental realisation of our death and resurrection with Christ.<a name=175:9></a> But as to the journey we must reach the goal to get in.<a name=175:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing to be noticed is, that God numbers His people exactly, and arranges them, once thus recognised, around His tabernacle: sweet thought, to be thus recognised and placed around God Himself!<a name=175:11></a> But here it had no reference to calling by faith, but to families, and households, and tribes.<a name=175:12></a> That order was carefully maintained when encamped at rest, or on their march; but it was the order of a nation and its tribes.<a name=175:13></a> God dwelt there, but the unity of the body, or of the Spirit -- union in any sense -- had no place.<a name=175:14></a>

		Three tribes on each side of the court kept the tabernacle of Jehovah.<a name=176:1></a> Levi alone was excepted, in order to be consecrated to the service of God: therefore the tribe of Levi encamped according to their families immediately around the court.<a name=176:2></a> Moses, Aaron, and the priests were placed opposite the entrance whereby God was approached.<a name=176:3></a> The least things in the word deserve to be noticed.<a name=176:4></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#80">Psalm  80</a>is entirely opened by the position of the tribes.<a name=176:5></a> The spirit of the psalmist asks, in the last days of the desolation of Israel, for God to lead them and to manifest His power as He did when He led them through the wilderness; he asks for the power of His presence on the ark of testimony, as God manifested it when it was said, at the moment when Israel set forward, "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered".<a name=176:6></a> Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh were the three tribes nearest the ark in the camp of Israel; that is why it is said, in verse 2 of the Psalm, "before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh".<a name=176:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the setting forward of the camp, the order given was that the tabernacle, surrounded by the Levites, should be in the midst of the tribes, as it was when the camp was at rest (chapter 2: 17).<a name=176:8></a> It was in the midst of them as of an army that was its guard, as the rallying-point of worship and approach when the camp was at rest.<a name=176:9></a> They kept the charge of the Lord.<a name=176:10></a>

		In chapter 10 we shall find that another arrangement took place as a matter of fact: of this, in its place.<a name=176:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 we have the Levites set apart, according to the thoughts of God, for service.<a name=176:12></a> They are a figure of the church, or rather of the members of the church in their service, even as the priests are the figure of Christians drawing near to the throne of God, though both be a shadow, not a perfect image.<a name=176:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Levites were firstfruits offered to God, for they were instead of the firstborn in whom God had taken Israel to Himself, when He smote the firstborn of the Egyptians.<a name=176:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is that the church (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:176">footnote</a></i>) is, as the firstfruits of the creatures of God, holy to the Lord.<a name=176:15></a> The number of the firstborn being greater than that of the Levites, those that were over were redeemed, as a sign that they belonged to God, and the Levites became God's possession for His service (verses 12, 13).<a name=176:16></a> It is the same with regard to the church: it belongs wholly to God to serve Him down here.<a name=176:17></a>

		But, besides, the Levites were entirely given to Aaron the high priest; for the service of the church, or of its members, is wholly dependent on Christ in the presence of God, and has no other object but that which concerns Him, and that which is connected with, and flows from the place and service which He Himself renders to God in the true tabernacle, carrying out in service here the ends for which He is in the holy place up there; but directly connected with the sanctuary -- that is for us heaven, for we belong to heaven, and our walk and all our service is referred to, and characterised by our connection with it.<a name=177:1></a> Our conversation (living association) is in heaven; we purify ourselves as He is pure, and are called to walk worthy of God, who has called to His own kingdom and glory, -- worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.<a name=177:2></a> Only, the veil being rent, we are much more fully connected with that than the Levites were even in figure.<a name=177:3></a> The service of the saints has no value (on the contrary, it is sin), except as it is united to the priesthood (that is to Christ on high, in the presence of God for us, with whom we, indeed, are also associated in this nearness, priests by grace); and hence all is accomplished in direct reference to Him in that heavenly character.<a name=177:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all its details, consequently, our service is absolutely good for nothing, if it be not linked with our communion with the Lord and with the priesthood of Christ.<a name=177:5></a> Christ is "a Son over his own house".<a name=177:6></a> "There are differences of administrations, but the same Lord".<a name=177:7></a> The Holy Ghost gives the capacity and the gift for service; but in the exercise of this capacity and of this gift, we are the servants of Christ.<a name=177:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, as regards our service, we have these three principles: 1, we are redeemed, delivered from the judgments, under which are the enemies of God, being taken from the midst of those enemies; 2, as a consequence of this first fact, we belong absolutely to God; bought with a price, we are no longer our own, but God's, to glorify Him in our bodies which are His; 3, we are entirely given to Christ, who is the Head of the house of God, the Priest, for the service of His tabernacle.<a name=177:9></a> Blessed bondage, happy self-renunciation, true deliverance from a world of sin!<a name=177:10></a> Service is rendered in dependence on Christ, and in the communion of the Lord: it is linked to the priesthood and flows from and is connected with Himself, and the place where He is, and with which He has connected our hopes, our lives,

		After the instructions intended to teach us how it is given to us to draw near God, the connection between the manifestations of God in Christ, and our walk here below, are for us what is most essential.<a name=179:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this last subject is the one treated of in type, in the arrangements made for the carriage of the chief utensils destined for the service of God.<a name=179:4></a> When they were in their place, while the camp rested, they were uncovered.<a name=179:5></a> Those which were shut up within the tabernacle had reference to heaven; the altar and the laver were outside, before coming to it.<a name=179:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the wilderness, these utensils put on certain characters, one of them especially; but others also, in certain cases.<a name=179:7></a> I consider them, therefore, as the manifestation of certain relationships existing between the walk of the Christian, and various manifestations of God in Christ.<a name=179:8></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:179">footnote</a></i>[a])

		Next to the table of shewbread came the candlestick, covered with a cloth of blue and badgers' skins.<a name=181:6></a> It was the spiritual perfection of the light of the Spirit; that which covered it was simply heavenly, with the covering of badgers' skins, the guard against the injuries which the entrusted grace might receive in the wilderness.<a name=181:7></a> All its utensils bore the same character.<a name=181:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, that which was divine in the act, was divine in the sense of the eternal Spirit acting in man, while the Godhead Itself was the source of it, and on that title it would claim the glory of the Godhead.<a name=182:2></a> The circumstances of the death of Jesus were consequent upon His humanity -- a truth most precious to us.<a name=182:3></a> He was crucified through weakness; He was delivered into the hands of the Gentiles; His throat was dried up, whilst He waited on His God.<a name=182:4></a> He was perfect in all these things.<a name=182:5></a> They were manifested outwardly, seen of men: it was man.<a name=182:6></a> He who could look within saw Him who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=182:7></a>

		The power of the Holy Spirit judging thus (according to the sentence of death against the flesh), the state of unfaithfulness -- which was thought to be hidden from the true husband of the people, makes the sin manifest, and brings down the chastening and the curse upon the unfaithful one, and that evidently by the just judgment of God.<a name=183:4></a> Drinking death, according to the power of the Spirit, is life to the soul.<a name=183:5></a> "By these things", says Hezekiah, "men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit"; even when they are the effect of chastening, which is not always necessarily the case.<a name=183:6></a> But if any of the accursed things be hidden -- if there be unfaithfulness towards Jesus, undetected, it may be, by man, and God puts it to the test; if we have allowed ourselves to be enticed by him who has the power of death, and the holy power of God is occupied with death, and comes to deal with this power of the enemy -- the concealed evil is laid bare, the flesh is reached; its rottenness and its powerlessness are made manifest, however fair its appearances may be.<a name=183:7></a> But if we be free from unfaithfulness, the result of the trial is only negative; it shews that the Spirit of holiness finds nothing to judge, when He applies death according to the holiness of God.<a name=183:8></a>

		In the offering without either oil or frankincense, the woman is set before God, according to the judgment of God displayed against sin, in His holiness and majesty, when Christ was made sin for us.<a name=183:9></a> Sin which is confessed has never that effect; for the conscience is purified from it by Christ.<a name=183:10></a> The unfaithfulness here spoken of, is that of the heart of Israel -- of the church to Christ.<a name=183:11></a> All these things apply, not to the acceptance of the believer, or of the church as to righteousness -- that is treated of where drawing near to God is in question -- but to the judgment of our ways in the wilderness journey, inasmuch as God is in our midst.<a name=183:12></a>

		The Nazarite presents to us another character connected with the walk of the Spirit down here -- special separation and devotedness to God.<a name=184:4></a> They separated themselves unto Him.<a name=184:5></a> Christ is the perfect example of this.<a name=184:6></a> The church ought to tread in His footsteps.<a name=184:7></a> Cases of special call to devote oneself to the Lord come under this class.<a name=184:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There were three things connected with this separation The Nazarite was to drink no wine; he was to let his hair grow; and he was not to make himself unclean for the dead.<a name=184:9></a> Wine designated the joy derived from the pleasures of society, which rejoice the heart of those who give themselves up to them.<a name=184:10></a> "Wine which cheereth God and man".<a name=184:11></a> From the moment Christ began His public service, He was separated from all that nature had its just part in.<a name=184:12></a> Invited with His disciples to a marriage, He says to His mother, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=184:13></a>" But in fact even His disciples knew Him "after the flesh".<a name=184:14></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:184">footnote</a></i>) His intercourse with them was, as to the capacity of their fellowship in it, on the ground of the presenting of the kingdom then as come in the flesh.<a name=184:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to this too, however, He must take His separate and Nazarite character, and, true as His affection was for His disciples, even in that human sphere where He, who saw through weakness, delighted in the true "excellent of the earth", the poor of the flock that waited on Him, yet He must be separated from this joy too.<a name=184:16></a> "I will not drink henceforth

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, the Nazarite let his hair grow: it was neglecting self in yielding oneself to the will of God, renouncing one's dignity and rights as a man; for a long head of hair marked, on the one hand, in a man, the neglect of his person; and on the other, subjection -- power on the head.<a name=185:8></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:185">footnote</a></i>) It was consecration to God in the giving up of the joy, the dignity, and the natural rights of man (man considered as the centre of the affections proper to him), and that to be wholly God's.<a name=185:9></a>

		Consequently, when there is a renewal of the temptation, he says that he cannot transgress the commandment of Jehovah his God: he puts on piety, and, in reality, he was not entirely without sincerity, for God held him close, and, indeed, allowed all this.<a name=210:11></a> But, at the same time, Balaam induces the messengers of Balak to tarry and see what God would say further.<a name=210:12></a> What did he want to know more about an invitation to curse that people, who, God had told him, were blessed?<a name=210:13></a> He had no sympathy whatever with the thoughts of the heart of God, none with Himself; he was governed by the fear of consequences.<a name=210:14></a> Otherwise, he would have been so happy in the blessing of the people, that he would have shuddered at the idea of cursing what God had blessed.<a name=210:15></a> God, however, will use him, to give a glorious testimony on behalf of His people, whilst, at the same time, condemning the crooked ways of the prophet, for they were indeed crooked.<a name=210:16></a> He shews him his perverseness, his folly, to be more stupid than the ass he was riding; but, at the same time, He makes him go on his way.<a name=210:17></a>

		Balaam, seeing at last that God was bent upon blessing, yields to the power of God, goes no longer to the meeting of enchantments, and the Spirit of God comes upon him.<a name=211:11></a> The justification of the people being now declared, the Spirit of God can bear testimony to them, instead of confining His testimony to the thoughts and intentions of God.<a name=211:12></a> Balaam sees them from above; seeing the vision of the Almighty, he sees the people according to the thoughts of the Spirit of God, as seen in the mind of God from above.<a name=211:13></a> The eyes of the prophet are open.<a name=211:14></a> And remark, here, that it is neither the anticipation of Canaan, nor Israel in their permanent habitations: Balaam turns his face towards the wilderness and sees Israel abiding in their tents.<a name=211:15></a> There the Spirit sees them, and declares the beauty and the order of the people in the eyes of God.<a name=211:16></a> The water of the refreshing of God was also always with them there; they were as trees that Jehovah had planted, therefore will they be great amongst the nations, a source of power and joy.<a name=211:17></a> They drink from the sources of God, and pour out from them abundantly for others.<a name=211:18></a> God had brought them out of Egypt, they were the work of God?<a name=211:19></a> and the power of God was to go with them against their enemies.<a name=211:20></a>

		At the end of a dispensation based on any knowledge whatever of God, when faith is lost and profession retained, this last obtains a renown of which men glory (as now, of the name of Christianity).<a name=212:19></a> Satan uses it: power is sought from him.<a name=212:20></a> They go to meet enchantments; because, whilst glorying in the revealed name of God, they seek to satisfy their own lusts; and the importance of the name of God is tacked on to the work of the devil.<a name=212:21></a> However, God is acknowledged up to a certain point.<a name=212:22></a> They fear Him, and He may interfere; but the system is diabolical, under the name of the Lord, with a partial fear of the Lord, and a dread which recognises Him as an object of fear.<a name=212:23></a>

		At last, the unhappy Balaam, whose heart was in the bond of iniquity, seeing that he cannot curse by the power of Satan, seeks to frustrate the blessing of God by leading the people into sin and idolatry.<a name=213:2></a> As regards the people, he is but too successful.<a name=213:3></a> God sends chastisement; and, while the people are humbling themselves, the enormity of the evil excites the indignation of Phinehas, who, acting with an energy suitable to the circumstances, stops the plague and acquires a perpetual priesthood in his family.<a name=213:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The journey being now ended, God numbers afresh His people, and counts them by name, as heirs ready to take possession of the inheritance.<a name=213:5></a> He has kept them through everything, and brought them as far as Canaan; their raiment even did not wax old.<a name=213:6></a> He settles the details of the inheritance, and appoints a leader in the room of Moses to introduce them into the land of promise.<a name=213:7></a> Chapter 26 presents us with the numbering.<a name=213:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning of chapter 27 are details upon the order according to which they were to inherit.<a name=213:9></a> Moses is favoured with a view of the land, and the people are placed under the conduct of Joshua to enter therein.<a name=213:10></a> Moses and Aaron had led them through the wilderness; but here it is a new scene, and Joshua (as to the assembly, Christ in the power of His Spirit) is appointed to conquer the land.<a name=213:11></a> But he is dependent on the priesthood in his progress onward; as effectively the presence and the operations of the Holy Spirit are dependent on the presence of Christ in the holy place.<a name=213:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapters 28 and 29 we have the worship of the people, the sacrifices which are the meat of God.<a name=213:13></a> We shall dwell a little on these chapters.<a name=213:14></a> They are not the ways of God, and the gathering together the people to Himself, as in chapter 23 of Leviticus, but the offerings themselves as offered to God and especially those of sweet savour, made by fire, except that which was purely accessory.<a name=213:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, there are lambs for the regular daily service; that is, for that of the morning and evening, and, for that of the sabbath, two lambs; then, bullocks and goats also for the extraordinary feasts.<a name=213:16></a> The lamb has the most simple meaning; it is the constant presentation of the value of Christ and so of believers in Him, the true Lamb of God -- the sweet savour of His

		sacrifice ascending continually, by day and by night; and when the true sabbath is come, its efficacy will only ascend more abundantly, as a matter of intelligence and application.<a name=214:1></a> This can be said as regards God Himself, as to the increased display of the fruit of the travail of the Saviour's soul.<a name=214:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The bullocks seem to me to represent rather the energy of the devotedness of persons in their estimate of that sacrifice.<a name=214:3></a> It was the largest thing that could be offered: still having regard to the sacrifice of Christ and the price set upon it.<a name=214:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ram was always a victim of consecration, or of amends for some violation of the rights of consecration.<a name=214:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the number of these two last kinds, there were in general two bullocks, a ram, and seven lambs; an additional bullock and ram the first day of the seventh month; one bullock, one ram, seven lambs the tenth of that month; and the decreasing number of the feast of tabernacles.<a name=214:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that all this gives the testimony of the worship rendered to God upon the earth.<a name=214:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, when the testimony is renewed, when God revives the light which produces it, the first feast noticed here, the answer on the part of man is simple and perfect -- the two bullocks (as there were two lambs on the sabbath day), the full and complete testimony to the devotedness of man, for two gave a valid testimony.<a name=214:8></a> The ram of consecration is the estimate of the sacrifice of Christ fully developed.<a name=214:9></a> Man being still down here, and sin not out of question, the goat was added as an offering for sin.<a name=214:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the worship of the people was in connection with the resurrection of Christ (chapter 28: 17), it was the same thing; so in the case of the work of the Spirit in gathering together (verse 26).<a name=214:11></a> It was the exercise of power on the part of God which made an opportunity for worship; the answer on the part of the people was the same.<a name=214:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first day of the seventh month had reference to the recall of Israel, which was a speciality, the renewal, according to the value of Christ's work, of God's connection with the earth, and especially with Israel.<a name=214:13></a> Hence besides the regular recognition of grace on the first of the month, an additional bullock, ram, and seven lambs were offered.<a name=214:14></a> The general testimony or answer to Christ's work was offered, but a special and partial one besides, for the earthly restoration of Israel.<a name=214:15></a> So on the day of atonement, when Israel, seeing the Lord, will be fully

		<a name=215>[Page 215]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		restored in grace.<a name=215:1></a> The general and complete testimony, when the resurrection of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit, which allowed the Gentiles also to come in and thus extended to the, perfect testimony of the relations between God and man, produced, as thus witnessed in the offerings, an answer from below which fully recognised the good which God had done, and the relations established thereupon, in being to Him according to the sweet savour of Christ, either in consecration or in the intelligent estimate of the offering of Christ.<a name=215:2></a> The unction of the Spirit and joy accompanied it.<a name=215:3></a> And the offering took place all the seven days of the feast, a testimony to its completeness.<a name=215:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the former case, then, that is at the feast of the first day of the seventh month, there was one bullock added as witness of a special and peculiar (but at the same time partial) work, but the general testimony to the value of Christ's sacrifice on which it depended was maintained.<a name=215:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that the same principle applies to the tenth day of the seventh month.<a name=215:6></a> It is the application of the atonement of Christ to Israel on earth.<a name=215:7></a> But it was the simple apprehension of the worth of Christ's sacrifice; its proper value before God.<a name=215:8></a> The principle of consecration and the intrinsic value of the sacrifice remained the same.<a name=215:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The feast of tabernacles introduced another order of ideas, at least a new development of those ideas; it is the coming dispensation.<a name=215:10></a> There is no perfection in that which is offered joyfully of one's own free will to God; but that is nearly realised -- thirteen bullocks are offered.<a name=215:11></a> The millennium will bring upon earth a joy of worship and thanksgiving, which (Satan being bound, and the blessing of the reign of Christ being spread everywhere) will be, externally at least, almost perfect.<a name=215:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two rams manifest the testimony of abundant consecration, and perhaps outwardly the introduction of Jews and Gentiles (not consecrated in one body, but) adequate witnesses upon earth in a distinct manner of this consecration to God.<a name=215:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the testimony of the perfectness of the work of Christ being full, upon earth, either for Israel or for the blessing of the Gentiles, its complete efficacy was manifested upon earth; and the question here is only about this manifestation upon earth (understood by faith, however).<a name=215:14></a> There were fourteen lambs.<a name=215:15></a>

		There is, however, declension in this devotedness of joy and testimony towards God; it does not cease from being complete, it is true; but its abundance gradually ceases to manifest itself as it did at the beginning.<a name=216:1></a> The thing, as established of God, remains in its perfection (verse 32).<a name=216:2></a> This was found in the seventh day, which completed the part purely earthly.<a name=216:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the eighth day, we have only one bullock, one ram, and seven lambs.<a name=216:4></a> It was the counterpart of what was special to the day of atonement, and the first day of the seventh month: for, if this last designated Israel alone brought back to God, the eighth day, on the other hand, designates that which was outside earthly perfection, and the heavenly people apart.<a name=216:5></a> This, it seems to me, is the general idea of what the Spirit of God gives us in this passage.<a name=216:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 30 is the case of the vows of women, which has reference also to the fate of Israel, who have indeed taken these vows upon themselves, in the hearing of God, and He has not disannulled them in His government here below; and Israel have continued responsible to the vow wherewith they have bound themselves, and of which, on the other hand, the precious Saviour has been obliged to take the burden upon Himself.<a name=216:7></a>

		DEUTERONOMY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now come to the book of Deuteronomy, a book full of interest in its moral warnings as to testimony, but presenting fewer subjects for interpretation and exegesis than those, the summary of which we have hitherto sought to give.<a name=220:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This book takes up Israel just on the borders of Canaan, and insists upon the faithful maintenance of their relationship with God, and on obedience to His commandments, as the only ground on which Israel can enter and continue therein, adding warnings as to the consequence of failure in obedience.<a name=220:2></a> It takes, in the main, the ground of their historical state (not of typical forms, presenting the thoughts of God, as the books we have just been considering do).<a name=220:3></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:220">footnote</a></i>) The body of it, after recalling the history of the wilderness, deals with the ordering of Israel in the land under God without a head on earth.<a name=220:4></a> The people are under responsibility to walk in obedience, with only God as their king and ruler.<a name=220:5></a> In immediate reference, the people are in enjoyment of the promised land under condition of obedience; but feasts, and such like ordinances, look forward to millennial times.<a name=220:6></a> At the end the distinction between possessing the land under condition of legal obedience, and by the grace which accomplishes its purpose in spite of failure is definitely brought out.<a name=220:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book may be divided into three parts.<a name=220:8></a> The first eleven chapters insist upon obedience, presenting various motives to lead the people to it.<a name=220:9></a> Then come, as far as the end of the twenty-ninth?<a name=220:10></a> divers commandments; to which are added, by way of sanction, the consequences of obedience and the curse upon disobedience.<a name=220:11></a> From the thirtieth to the end we have things to come, the blessing of the people, and the death of Moses.<a name=220:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=221>[Page 221]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this division requires more development, which will much aid our understanding of the book.<a name=221:1></a> The first part recounts their history, and this as insisting on the unity of an invisible God, their obligation to Jehovah who has called them, through redemption, to be with Him.<a name=221:2></a> This closes with chapter 4, where three cities are secured for the two tribes and a half.<a name=221:3></a> Moses cannot enter into the land; Jehovah their God is a jealous God.<a name=221:4></a> They are placed under the covenant of Sinai, but He is a merciful God, and in their tribulation they can look to the God of their fathers.<a name=221:5></a> In chapter 5 all Israel are called to hear as to their present place, and put upon the basis of the covenant of Sinai -- to observe it in the land into which they were going to possess it.<a name=221:6></a> The land had been promised, but they held it under the covenant of legal obedience, but on the basis of deliverance wrought by Jehovah out of Egypt.<a name=221:7></a> Him they were exclusively to serve, and He was a jealous God.<a name=221:8></a> They were to have no kind of connection with the nations found in the land.<a name=221:9></a> Further, we have the terms of the government of mercy, still of righteousness, established in Moses's second ascent of Sinai.<a name=221:10></a> Thus we have the government of God -- His ways taken into account; and so the character of their ways and their object (chapter 8).<a name=221:11></a> If they did not give heed they would perish.<a name=221:12></a> This leads to recalling, in order to humble them, how they had failed all through in the desert.<a name=221:13></a> The second governmental covenant is referred to, and the Lord's love that had chosen them in pure grace, and that in spite of their failures, had already so largely blessed them.<a name=221:14></a> They must circumcise their hearts to serve Him and Him only: one only exclusive God, and a God of government.<a name=221:15></a> All is summed up hortatively in chapter 11.<a name=221:16></a> Over Jordan they were going, there they were to keep all that was commanded.<a name=221:17></a> Here Ebal and Gerizim are brought in.<a name=221:18></a> To the end of chapter 4 it is Israel outside Jordan; chapter 5 inside the land.<a name=221:19></a> The first part presents the one invisible Jehovah of Horeb, jealous but merciful, though His ways in general with the people are there too; the second, the covenant of the ten words with Jehovah, and His government on the ground of their responsibility.<a name=221:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the first eleven chapters, the first four form thus a rather distinct part.<a name=221:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which strikes one in the first chapters is, the pains that Jehovah takes to present all possible motives to that poor people to lead them to obedience, in order that they may be blessed.<a name=221:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=222>[Page 222]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things, which ought at least to have touched the heart, served, alas!<a name=222:1></a> only to prove its hardness, and to shew that, if man is to be blessed, God must give him a new heart, as it is written in the chapter which closes the second part of His exhortations to obedience: "Yet Jehovah hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day" (chapter 29: 4).<a name=222:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Deuteronomy is, then, of all the books of Moses, that which is the most essentially conditional -- that is to say, the first two divisions which I have pointed out.<a name=222:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 29, which is the last of the second division, ends, consequently, by saying, "The secret things belong unto Jehovah our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law".<a name=222:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapters which follow throw this into greater prominence, by unfolding the secret things which were to happen after the people had completely failed in the fulfilment of the law, as chapter 30, and, still more strikingly, chapter 32, by speaking of righteousness by faith.<a name=222:5></a> For the discussion as to righteousness by the law ended with chapter 29; and chapter 30 supposes the people in a position in which the securing of righteousness by the law was impossible, and where there could only be question of the spirit and end of the law, in the counsels of God.<a name=222:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Christ was the end of it, and it is thus the apostle applies the passage (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10">Romans  10</a>).<a name=222:7></a> It is interesting also to see that the Lord always quotes Deuteronomy in answering Satan.<a name=222:8></a> He put Himself on the true ground where Israel stood, in order to possess and keep the land; being not only the faithful man, but the Jew, the true Son called out of Egypt, put to the test as to His faithfulness, in the conditions under which the people were placed by Deuteronomy.<a name=222:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us examine a little more closely these chapters, which shew the pains the Spirit took, to set before the eyes of the people all the motives which could induce them to walk faithfully in the career which now lay before them.<a name=222:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He begins with the narrative of what had occurred since the sojourn of the children of Israel at Sinai; and Moses reminds them of the commandment to leave that place and to go to the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We learn too here that, though sanctioned by God, the sending the spies was the effect of unbelief among the people -- an instructive lesson.<a name=223:4></a> God may allow, and so far sanction a course, wise humanly, in His ways -- His government, which yet bears the fruit of the unbelief which is at the root of it.<a name=223:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, Moses recalls to them, in general, what had taken place in the journey which led to their entrance into the land of which they are to take possession -- the patience and the goodness of God.<a name=223:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reminding them of Horeb, he insists on the privilege they had enjoyed in nearness to God, who Himself had spoken to them out of the midst of the fire, when they saw no similitude; on the authority of the word -- its majesty -- excluding thus all thought of idolatry.<a name=223:7></a> He shews them that all that were of full age had perished, as a consequence of their unbelief; that he himself could not enter into that good land; that God is a jealous God, a consuming fire; and that, if they made any graven image, they would utterly perish from off the land they were about to enter, and would be scattered amongst the nations and -- left to serve the gods they had loved; that, nevertheless, they should find God if they sought Him with all their heart, for He is a merciful God, who would not forsake them; that if Sinai had been the brightness of His majesty, it was also true that such a God of majesty had never vouchsafed to come so near to a people, elect and chosen for their fathers' sakes.<a name=223:8></a> Such is the basis of the government of this people.<a name=223:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses sets apart three cities of refuge, as a token of possession, on the part of God, of what was on this side Jordan.<a name=223:10></a> These four chapters are introductory.<a name=223:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He reminds them of their fear in the presence of the Lord engages them, in chapter 6, to love God with all their heart, and exhorts them to remember His words in every way, and to keep them, when they should enjoy the land, having nothing to do with other gods.<a name=224:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When they should have cast out their enemies, as Jehovah had spoken, and when their children should ask the meaning of the ordinances, they were to tell them of the deliverances and of the signs wrought in Egypt.<a name=224:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were to destroy every vestige of false gods, being a people holy to Jehovah.<a name=224:8></a> Nor did God set His love upon them on account of their own importance, but because of the election and love of God.<a name=224:9></a> He assures them that their faithfulness would also be the channel of blessing, for God would recompense them according to their ways.<a name=224:10></a> Neither ought they to fear, after all the signs they had seen.<a name=224:11></a> Thus they were a people separate to Jehovah.<a name=224:12></a> As to Him all was sovereign grace, but sure faithfulness.<a name=224:13></a> As to them the ground they were on was the government of God; hence all then depended on their holding fast to Jehovah, and faithful obedience.<a name=224:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 8, in the most instructive and touching language as to the care God had taken of them, while keeping them in dependence, and His object in doing so, he also brings to mind the dealings of God with them by the way, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:224">footnote</a></i>) as a motive; and how God had humbled and had exercised them, lest, through the enjoyment of the blessings of the good land into which He was bringing them, they should be puffed up (for it was God who gave them the needed strength); that otherwise God would destroy them, as He had destroyed the nations.<a name=224:15></a> On the other hand (chapter 9), He reminds them of their continual perverseness, in order to shew them that it was not on account of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This he applies to them (chapter 10), reminding them that God had renewed the tables of the law, urging them to circumcise their hearts, to care for the stranger, remembering how God had enlarged them since they went down as strangers to Egypt.<a name=225:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in chapter 11, he brings to their remembrance the judgments upon the Egyptians, and those upon Dathan and Abiram; and declares to them the beauty and excellency of the land into which they are about to enter, a land upon which the eyes of Jehovah ever rested; (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:225">footnote</a></i>) and, lastly, he puts before them the blessing and the curse which there awaited them, according to their conduct, when brought in; charging them to keep carefully the commandments of the Lord, and to teach them to their children.<a name=225:3></a> And it is added, that, by keeping the commandments of God, they would be able to take possession, according to the full extent of the promise.<a name=225:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here all depends on their obedience to this conditional covenant which made them Jehovah's, whose exclusively they were to be; sovereign restoring grace does not come till chapter 30.<a name=225:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second division begins with chapter 12, and contains the statutes and ordinances they were bound to observe.<a name=225:6></a> It is not a repetition of the old ordinances, but what specially referred to their conduct in the land, that they might keep it and be blessed in it.<a name=225:7></a> It is a covenant, or the conditions of their relationship with God, and of the enjoyment of His promises, added to what had been said before (see chapter 29: 1).<a name=225:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ordinances tended in general to this, that they were a people belonging to Jehovah, and that they were to give up every other relationship in order to be His; and keep themselves from all that could seduce them to form such relationships, or defile them in those which they had with Jehovah.<a name=225:9></a> At the same time, directions are given as to the details of the maintenance of those relationships.<a name=225:10></a> One thing specially characterises this part: a fixed place where Jehovah would put His name to which they were to go up to worship.<a name=225:11></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=226>[Page 226]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in all this, and in the whole book, this point is treated as a question of a direct relationship of the people itself with God.<a name=226:1></a> The priests are, in general, mentioned, more as being the objects of the care of the people when in the land, according to ordinances already given.<a name=226:2></a> The people were to behave in such-and-such a way towards them; but the relationship is immediate between the people and God.<a name=226:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first principle laid down to confirm these relationships is the choice of a place as the centre of their exercise.<a name=226:4></a> They were to go thither with all their offerings; they might eat flesh elsewhere -- without the blood; but the consecrated things could only be eaten in the place chosen of God.<a name=226:5></a> They were not to forget the Levites.<a name=226:6></a> They were not even to inquire about the ways of those who had been driven out of the land.<a name=226:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the signs of a prophet, who would entice them to serve other gods, came to pass, or if a relative, or the beloved of their souls, enticed them, such were to be put to death; if any of a city, the whole city was to be reduced to a heap of stones.<a name=226:8></a> No relationship with any but with the true God was to be allowed -- no forbearance toward that which ensnared them to follow another.<a name=226:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 14 forbids that the people, as being the children of the living God, should imitate the profane customs which indicated the devotedness of idolaters to the impure beings they worshipped.<a name=226:10></a> God had chosen Israel for Himself.<a name=226:11></a> Neither were they to defile themselves by eating abominable things.<a name=226:12></a> They were a holy people.<a name=226:13></a> The tithes and all the firstfruits were to be offered to God.<a name=226:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here everything was sanctified, as having been presented to Jehovah.<a name=227:3></a> There was thus the recognition, on the one hand, that the people were His, on the other, that all they had was of Him; but in giving Him back what He had given them, they enjoyed, in fellowship with Him, and their families, the things common to God and the people, given by Him, offered to Him, and enjoyed in His presence in communion one with another, God Himself partaking of them, for the whole was offered to Him.<a name=227:4></a>

		Chapter 15 teaches each one among the people to consider with liberality and grace their poor brethren (this consideration being besides made sure to them by the year of release, which applied to debts and to the Hebrew slaves).<a name=228:3></a> The dependence of him, who thus respected Jehovah in His poor, was to be placed in God, who would bless him in thus acting according to His commandment; for the poor were His poor.<a name=228:4></a>

		It gives us three solemn feasts -- the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles.<a name=228:6></a> The spirit of each of these feasts suggests a few remarks.<a name=228:7></a> The Passover recalled deliverance, deliverance from bondage in Egypt (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:228">footnote</a></i>) -- for us under sin and Satan.<a name=228:8></a> The unleavened bread, truth in the inward parts, was here the bread of affliction.<a name=228:9></a> The knowledge of Christ, or the application of Christ to the heart, though coupled with deliverance and salvation, when it takes the form of repentance (and this is the case, when the question is of remembering one's deliverance), has always something bitter in it.<a name=228:10></a> Joy is not the point here.<a name=228:11></a> One has gone out in haste, by the mighty arm of God; and if one is happy, it is only as having escaped, feeling that it is through the power of God alone, and conscious of the state which required it all.<a name=228:12></a> They ate it during the night, and every one returned in the morning to his tent.<a name=228:13></a> They went home with the sense of the goodness of God, with the sense that it was a deliverance from the evil under which they had been by their own fault and to their own ruin.<a name=228:14></a>

		That which first of all characterised this feast was, that every one offered a free-will-offering, according to the blessing wherewith Jehovah his God had blessed him.<a name=229:6></a> It is the Holy Spirit, and the blessing flowing from Him, which this type presents to us.<a name=229:7></a> It is not only redemption, but the power of the things which are the result of it -- not in full, however; they were only firstfruits offered to God.<a name=229:8></a> The presentation of these firstfruits to God is the effect of the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=229:9></a> They are the remnant of Israel, historically in the beginning of Christianity, on the principle of redemption and of the new covenant; but, in fact, Christians themselves become the firstfruits of the creation of God.<a name=229:10></a> But the effect produced by the Holy Spirit, the effect of His presence in general, is that which characterises this feast.<a name=229:11></a>

		The priests are introduced here in connection with that which was necessary to the enjoyment of the land, not as a means of drawing near to God.<a name=232:4></a> Consequently, they were there to fulfil their ministry before God, and a certain portion belonged to them.<a name=232:5></a>

		The king was only thought of in the case when the people would ask one, in order to be like the nations; and in that case he was to remain, as much as possible, simple in the midst of Israel, that the law of God might have its full authority.<a name=232:6></a> The people are always accounted to be themselves responsible before God, and enjoying the land under this responsibility, though for that reason subject to the decisions of the priests.<a name=232:7></a> They had the land from God.<a name=232:8></a> The position spoken of here is not that of drawing near to Him, but acknowledging His deliverance and His goodness, as in the feasts which we have considered.<a name=232:9></a>

		We may remark here the difference between that which was in this case for the priests, and that which in Deuteronomy the people are to eat of before the Lord, and in the other books what is given to the priests.<a name=233:2></a> We have already pointed out the difference of position.<a name=233:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the three preceding books, what is brought before the mind is drawing near to God, and the priests alone are looked upon as able to do this; and thus, in the relationship of priests, they ate in the holy place all that was offered.<a name=233:4></a> They alone were near God, and that which was offered to God (according to the force of the word, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:233">footnote</a></i>) that which was brought near to God) was theirs, as being near.<a name=233:5></a> They were all as one company in the camp, and the whole was essentially typical.<a name=233:6></a>

		Thus all the arrangements of the tabernacle were made for a people who found themselves in the wilderness -- strangers there; and it is to be observed that Paul, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, never speaks of anything but the tabernacle, never of the temple.<a name=233:7></a> The relationship he speaks of is that of pilgrims with God.<a name=233:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is no longer thus in Deuteronomy.<a name=233:9></a> There the dwelling of the people in the land of promise is considered; and, consequently, the people are accounted, not as needing to learn how to draw near to God, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:233">footnote</a></i>) but as enjoying, from God, the effect of His promise in His presence and before Him, so that the people are directly concerned in the sacrifices.<a name=233:10></a> They are in the enjoyment of the promises, in the presence of God, and they realise, in the communion of Jehovah, all the means through which it is enjoyed, and they partake, in communion, of all that is devoted to Him, as a sign of the redemption through which this enjoyment was procured for them.<a name=233:11></a>

		Three cities of refuge are appointed, and he who kills his neighbour, without hating him, is distinguished from the murderer: an important principle, as to the fate of the Jewish nation, which makes a distinction between those who have taken a voluntary part in the death of the Lord, or who afterwards heartily approve the deed, and those who have done it ignorantly.<a name=234:6></a> The regulations of righteousness also against false witnesses are given here.<a name=234:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 20 we have the ordinances relative to war.<a name=234:8></a>

		In chapter 21 we have three interesting cases, because of the principles which apply to the ways of God with Israel: the case of the man found slain; that of the child of the hated wife; and that of the rebellious son.<a name=234:9></a> The land of Jehovah must be kept pure.<a name=234:10></a> Israel will have to make this confession in the latter days, and to clear themselves of the blood of Messiah.<a name=234:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If the case of the two wives applies to Israel upon earth, it applies still more closely to Christ (Head of the Gentiles) and the assembly with whom He will inherit all things, although upon earth Israel be the wife beloved.<a name=234:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		However, Israel, as a rebellious son under the old covenant, is condemned and cut off; as regards the redeemed, the curse of the law has fallen upon another.<a name=234:13></a> Those who read the Bible are too well acquainted with the application of the end of this chapter to make it needful for me to dwell upon it.<a name=234:14></a> The point here under consideration is the defiling of the land, which Jehovah had given for an inheritance to the people; the hardness of heart of the priests in applying the precept under the circumstances is appalling, yet natural.<a name=234:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Directions are given for those Levites who should devote themselves to the service of Jehovah, in the place chosen by Him as His dwelling-place.<a name=235:5></a> The people, seeking to know the will of God, were not to consult diviners.<a name=235:6></a> Jehovah would raise up a prophet.<a name=235:7></a> Afterwards there is provision made to keep the land from being polluted with blood; the elders of the city were to take knowledge of the deed, whether the slayer had killed without set purpose.<a name=235:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cities of refuge present a beautiful type of the state of Israel, as to their sin, in having killed the Lord Jesus, whether ignorantly (as the grace of God looks upon it with regard to those who repent), or knowingly (as perseverance in rejecting Him would be the proof of): this is the principle upon which God will judge them.<a name=235:9></a> So, in this last point of view, the people were placed under the searching severity of the law.<a name=235:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 20 provision is made to reconcile any war that might arise with the enjoyment of the land and the blessing of God, either individually or in case of conquest; and directions are given to secure the presence of the power of God, and to shew how the enemies were to be treated according to the mind of God; all mercy towards the nations of Canaan being prohibited, in order that Israel might not learn the abominations they were guilty of.<a name=235:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 21 gives another provision for preventing the land from defilement by blood, while declaring (as elsewhere) that life belongs to God -- that, when His rights are infringed, He will not wink at it.<a name=235:12></a> We cannot fail to see that the blood of Christ is, above all, that of which Israel is here (chapter 21) guilty (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>), and the blood of Jesus is the only atonement for the sin which shed it.<a name=235:13></a> The elders excuse themselves by pleading their ignorance of what had been done.<a name=235:14></a> The same thing will take place with regard to Israel.<a name=235:15></a> So pleads also Paul.<a name=235:16></a> However, there is nothing but the blood of the heifer which never bore the yoke that can wipe away sin.<a name=235:17></a> Thus will the guilt of innocent blood be taken from off the people.<a name=235:18></a>

		The following directions are indeed practical directions for Israel; but they seem to me to contain, at the same time, some of God's principles towards His people.<a name=236:1></a> Thus Israel upon earth, and the assembly in heaven, have both been the true firstborn, whom God will not disinherit.<a name=236:2></a> And the rebellious son presents also Israel in final disobedience to God.<a name=236:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 22 appears to contain ordinances to guard the people from want of benevolence and mercy, and of that which would offend the sensibilities of nature, either with regard to tenderness or purity.<a name=236:4></a> So also all mixture was forbidden in ploughing or sowing.<a name=236:5></a> We find the same with regard to women: they were protected against the dishonour done to them by a brutish, inconsiderate husband; whilst impurity was punished with death.<a name=236:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus (chapter 23) the people are taught what sentiments became them, according to God, with reference to the nations (taking the ways and doings of those nations into consideration) in case of war.<a name=236:7></a> They are also instructed in what was proper, as to the purity of the camp in case of war, seeing God was there.<a name=236:8></a> So with regard to all sorts of things, such as the slave that was escaped from his master; things morally impure; even the neighbour's vineyard; and (chapter 24) a more serious thing, divorce, and everything relative to it; delicacy towards the poor, the hire of labourers, the gleaning for the poor.<a name=236:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spirit of all these ordinances is very instructive, and the goodness and the tenderness of God, who deigns to take knowledge of all these things, and to teach His people delicacy, propriety, consideration for others, sensitiveness, and those feelings which, by removing brutality, and softening the hardness of the heart of man, fashion his ways according to that love with which the Spirit of God clothes Himself when He acts in the heart of man.<a name=236:10></a> Here, it is true, everything is imperfect.<a name=236:11></a> There are things taken for granted here, which form the basis of these ordinances, which the full operation of the Spirit of Christ would entirely take away; divorce, for instance, and other things endured; owing their existence to the hardness of man's heart.<a name=236:12></a> But the limitations and conditions, assigned by the law of God, keep in check the wickedness of that will which hardens itself, while it oppresses others.<a name=236:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 25 adds ordinances which are a continuation of what we have already read; taking care that none of their brethren

		As to the inveterate enemies of God and His people, Israel was never to seek peace with them.<a name=237:2></a> Human amiability is often enmity with God.<a name=237:3></a> This ordinance is so much the more remarkable, because it follows so many others which made provision for kindness, even to a bird.<a name=237:4></a>

		Jehovah had taken care that an Egyptian should find the entrance into the assembly of God; but those affections were to be in exercise towards the Egyptians for the good of the souls of the Israelites themselves.<a name=237:5></a> They were not to harden their hearts against those in whose midst they had sojourned.<a name=237:6></a> But to spare the Amalekites (who came to meet Israel to shut up their way and destroy the feeble ones among them) was to forget what was due to God, who brought them back; and, as regarded the people, it would have proved indifference of heart to evil, and not the effusion of a natural affection; neither was it yielding to remembrances, with which charity might mingle for good, by a becoming forgetfulness of wrongs formerly received.<a name=237:7></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:237">footnote</a></i>) Where there is nobleness of sentiment, men who know (though they have injured) each other, still will own one another when the evil is over.<a name=237:8></a>

		But there is a spirit which claims nothing but disgust: to tolerate it is only sparing oneself, and admitting that very spirit into one's heart so as to partake of it.<a name=237:9></a> What is in question is not judging, but the state of one's own heart.<a name=237:10></a> The distance of an Egyptian from God was recognised; but if he were in relationship with Him during three generations, why should he be kept at a distance?<a name=237:11></a> why should he remain a stranger?<a name=237:12></a> But Amalek did not fear God -- did not recognise Him.<a name=237:13></a> What then could be recognised in such a nation?<a name=237:14></a> We must bring God into our affairs -- our relationships; and charity, firmness, justness in our judgments, will each find its place, and be reproduced in all our ways.<a name=237:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as to worship, it is not looked at here in the light of drawing near to God in the holy place, by means of sacrifices which, supposing sin, opened the way for the people into the presence of Jehovah.<a name=238:3></a> This characterises the whole book.<a name=238:4></a> Then the question was, could they, or how far could they, or how near could they or the priests -- draw near to Jehovah in the sanctuary of His holiness.<a name=238:5></a> What Deuteronomy presents is, while acknowledging their previous state, the festal enjoyment of the effect of all the promises, only as coming from, and they themselves identified with Jehovah.<a name=238:6></a> (So in chapters 12 and 14).<a name=238:7></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:238">footnote</a></i>) They enjoy the promise, and present themselves as worshippers, giving thanks as enjoying it.<a name=238:8></a> In presenting the firstfruits of the land of promise, they were to go up to the place where the Lord had placed His name.<a name=238:9></a> What then was the spirit of that worship?<a name=238:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, it was based on the open confession that they were in the full enjoyment of the effect of the promise of God.<a name=238:11></a> "I profess this day unto Jehovah that I am come unto the country which Jehovah sware unto our fathers to give us".<a name=238:12></a> That is the first feature of that worship -- the full profession of being in the enjoyment of the effect of the promise.<a name=238:13></a> It was the acknowledgment of the faithfulness of God in the present communion of His goodness.<a name=238:14></a> Thereupon the offering was presented.<a name=238:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in the presence of Jehovah, the worshipper made confession of the redemption and deliverance of the people.<a name=238:16></a> A Syrian, ready to perish, was his father; and afterwards, when his children, oppressed by the Egyptians, cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah had heard and delivered them with an outstretched

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		arm, and had, by a display of His power, brought them up into the land they were enjoying.<a name=239:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second feature, then, is the confession of what their misery had been, of their impotency in time past, and that their redemption has been accomplished by Jehovah alone, to whom they were indebted for all these blessings.<a name=239:2></a> Thereupon the worshipper directly addresses Jehovah, presenting Him with the firstfruits of those blessings.<a name=239:3></a> It was the recognition of God in the blessings (the infallible effect of a work of God in the heart), and the only means of truly enjoying them; for God's blessings turn the heart away from Him, if their first effect is not to turn it to Him.<a name=239:4></a> That is the history of Israel, and a thousand times alas!<a name=239:5></a> in the details of life, that of our own hearts.<a name=239:6></a> A pious heart acknowledges God Himself in the blessing, before enjoying it.<a name=239:7></a> See a beautiful example in the conduct of Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, sent to fetch a wife for Isaac.<a name=239:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it is added, "And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which Jehovah thy God hath given unto thee".<a name=239:9></a> They were to enjoy them with God; and, consequently, observe here, that in this the spirit of grace manifests itself at once: "Thou, the Levite, and the stranger that is within thy gate".<a name=239:10></a> It is impossible truly to rejoice in the blessing of God before Him, without the spirit of grace being present -- without returning blessing for cursing, knowing that we are called to inherit His blessing.<a name=239:11></a> The same truth is found again in the tithes of the third year, given to the poor, the Levite, &c.<a name=239:12></a>, according to the spirit which we have just spoken of.<a name=239:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature of the state of heart of the true worshipper was holiness in consecrating to Jehovah, with uprightness of heart, that which was due to Him according to grace.<a name=239:14></a> He was not to be robbed in anything for appropriation to oneself: nothing was to be profaned by applying it to self -- to defiled or interested uses.<a name=239:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, the conscience was good as regarded consecration to Jehovah, in the things by which the worshipper acknowledged Him as the true and sole Author of all the blessings.<a name=239:16></a> And if Jehovah was the Author of them, communion with Him, in acknowledging Him, was enjoyed in the spirit of holiness, of consecration to Him, and in the spirit of goodness and grace that was in Him towards His poor and forsaken ones.<a name=239:17></a> The character of God is introduced again and again, and His name

	<div class="paragraph">
		brought in, in that which is recognised in the communion of His people; if overlooked, the people were guilty and defiled, in that they had profaned the name of the Lord.<a name=240:1></a> This consecration in purity to God, and this expression of His goodness, are singularly beautiful.<a name=240:2></a> Then the blessing of God was implored not only upon oneself, from God who cared for all His people, but upon all Israel, upon the land which was the proof of the faithfulness of God and of the riches of His goodness.<a name=240:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter is of great importance, and a kind of summing up of the spirit proposed of God in the whole book: it is the last chapter of the body of its contents.<a name=240:4></a> It refers to no promises to Abraham, Isaac, etc.<a name=240:5></a>, but takes the history of Israel from Jacob's going down into Egypt, a Syrian ready to perish; oppressed in Egypt they cried to the God of their fathers, historically so known (not the promises), and they were delivered with great signs, and Jehovah had brought them into that good land where they were, and they brought the firstfruits of the land Jehovah had given them.<a name=240:6></a> It was the acknowledgment of the possession of blessing in the land given by Jehovah through grace.<a name=240:7></a> This was their worship; and they, and Levites, and strangers rejoiced together there in all the good Jehovah had given.<a name=240:8></a> They did so also, when they had given to fatherless, widows, Levites, strangers, the tithes of the third year, which were eaten within their gates, they declare their cleanness and uprightness; there had been no profanation, but obedience in all things as to their ordinances; and thereupon an appeal to God for blessing on the people and the land.<a name=240:9></a> The land possessed, its firstfruits offered to Jehovah; then comes rejoicing in all the good Jehovah gave; then fellowship in grace with all in need every third year, and with this, avowal of purity of ways, thoroughness in doing it, and obedience, and so a blessing looked for.<a name=240:10></a> It is a picture of the true state of the people with Jehovah, and in the land, and walking uprightly, considering the needy, that the blessing might rest upon them; and on this ground they now entered into covenant with Jehovah to possess and enjoy the land in obedience, and be fully blessed and exalted.<a name=240:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This worship was, then, a bond between the people and God, in the communion of what He was; that is, a bond in worship by acknowledging what He was; and by bearing witness to it.<a name=240:12></a> Thus, according to the commandments of Jehovah, looked at as the conditions of this bond, God had that day acknowledged

		the people, and the people had acknowledged Jehovah for their God.<a name=241:1></a> This closes the teaching of the book.<a name=241:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now comes the sanction -- that is to say, that which gives vigour to His law -- in the consequences (blessings and curses) which were to correspond with obedience or disobedience.<a name=241:3></a> This is brought out in chapter 27 and two following chapters.<a name=241:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 27 is by itself, however, and is of rather wide scope in the understanding of the word of God.<a name=241:5></a> If individual piety expressed itself in the manner we have seen in the preceding chapter, the public relations of the people with God were based on the threats of the law.<a name=241:6></a> When the people should have gone over Jordan to take possession of the land of promise (an idea which constantly presents itself), having set up great stones and plastered them with plaster, they were to write the law upon them.<a name=241:7></a> This law contained the conditions on which the land was to be enjoyed.<a name=241:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people were to divide themselves into two companies of tribes, part being placed upon Mount Gerizim to bless, the other upon Ebal to curse.<a name=241:9></a> Upon the latter was an altar to be erected to Jehovah, not for sin-offerings, but for burnt-offerings and peace-offerings: a worship pre-supposing a righteous people in communion with Jehovah, but placed under the curse if they should break the law.<a name=241:10></a> The announcement of the curses follows, ending with that curse which would rest on every one, not continuing in all the things which were written in the book of the law to do them.<a name=241:11></a> But the blessings of Gerizim are entirely omitted.<a name=241:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is needless to insist upon the importance of this blank.<a name=241:13></a> The apostle seizes on it as the place of all under the law.<a name=241:14></a> "As many as are of the works of the law (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:241">footnote</a></i>) are under the curse", says the apostle: "for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law".<a name=241:15></a> There is no possibility of escape.<a name=241:16></a> No one, except the Lord Jesus, has accomplished it; and He, if one may so speak, did not raise an altar for burnt-offering, an altar of worship for a righteous man who had fulfilled the law -- for Himself alone; but He offered Himself for us on that mountain of cursing as an offering for sin, and has thus silenced for ever
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=242>[Page 242]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		all those threats and curses.<a name=242:1></a> The blessing of Gerizim, consequently, is not sufficient either.<a name=242:2></a> Heaven, and, moreover, for Him, the Father's throne, are the only worthy answer and reward for what He has accomplished by suffering for our sins.<a name=242:3></a> But this is the righteousness of God, giving to Christ, and so consequently to us, what He was fully entitled to in having glorified God, and to us what He has obtained for us.<a name=242:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection between the principles of chapter 26 and those of chapter 27 is deeply interesting: the fulfilment of the promise in the enjoyment of the land, the basis of thanksgivings and of the worship which has its source in redemption; afterwards the altar, the service to be rendered to God, a service linked to His law, the violation of which, in a single point, brought the curse.<a name=242:5></a> This was the condition of their enjoyment of it.<a name=242:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in that point of view, the only one which went to the root of the question, that the apostle looks at it.<a name=242:7></a> It is on the ground of this covenant of Deuteronomy that the people became the people of Jehovah on their entering the land (compare verses 2, 10, and chapter 29: 1).<a name=242:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 28 we have the principles of God's government in the midst of that people, and the immediate consequences of obedience or disobedience -- consequences so solemnly fulfilled in the fate of that unhappy people, still beloved for the fathers sakes.<a name=242:9></a> The consequences of the violation of the law as a principle of relationship with God, as to the point of a righteousness which was adequate ground of God's acceptance, must not be confounded with the temporary consequences of disobedience under the government of God.<a name=242:10></a> It is to these latter that chapter 28 has reference.<a name=242:11></a> We may notice for ourselves the deep instruction of verses 47, 48.<a name=242:12></a> As to Israel, universal history presents to us the accomplishment of the threats of the chapter.<a name=242:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 29 is the personal application to the conscience of the people, both collectively and individually, of all that precedes, that there may be no bitter root of sin (compare <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:15">Hebrews  12:15</a>, the application of this exhortation to the discipline and the loving care of saints now).<a name=242:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 29 requires to be noticed.<a name=242:15></a> We find in it the contrast between the consequences thus revealed of obedience and disobedience, and the purposes of God in behalf of the people, notwithstanding their disobedience -- purposes which evidently
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=243>[Page 243]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		could not be a rule for their conduct.<a name=243:1></a> The rule was found in the ordinance of the law.<a name=243:2></a> The meaning of this verse has been so twisted, that it is worth while thus to point out its force.<a name=243:3></a> The secret things are the purposes of God with regard to the people, though they should have been disobedient and driven out of the land; but, although they are not the rule of conduct, they are revealed and are of deep interest.<a name=243:4></a> In what follows, God begins already to present them to our attention, and surely it becomes us to consider them.<a name=243:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have, in these chapters, the relationship of the pious Jew with God, grounded upon the accomplishment of the promises made to the fathers, in the present enjoyment of the land; the relationship of the people with God, in view of the curse pronounced upon the violation of the law; the relationship of the people with God, according to the principles of His government, the consequences brought in, either by their obedience or disobedience: and, finally, after the disobedience, and when this has produced its fruit, the designs of God according to His purpose, which nothing could alter.<a name=243:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must now dwell a little on this last point.<a name=243:7></a> Chapter 30 furnishes us with an important principle.<a name=243:8></a> It supposes that the people have already incurred the consequences of disobedience, and they are seen as driven out of the land, and strangers among distant nations.<a name=243:9></a> The law could not be followed out in such a case; and, indeed, the violation of the law had even then produced its fruits.<a name=243:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then quite a new principle is introduced: the return of the hearts of the people to Jehovah, and obedience, one must add, in spirit.<a name=243:11></a> Thereupon Jehovah brings them back into their land, and blesses them in it.<a name=243:12></a> The curse is put on their enemies; and they are to observe in the land the ordinances of Jehovah, enjoying anew His full blessing; for the commandment was neither in heaven, nor beyond the seas, but in the mouth and in the heart.<a name=243:13></a> This was not the new covenant, but faith laying hold of the spirit of the law in principle, and turning the heart towards Jehovah, when the law was externally impracticable.<a name=243:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The establishment of the new covenant, based on this return of the heart, at a time appointed of God, will be something well defined.<a name=243:15></a> Here we have the principle of their return when under the curse of the law they had broken.<a name=243:16></a> Hence, the apostle quotes this passage for the basis of the principle, as a testimony

		given to what righteousness by faith was, applying it to Christ Himself -- the return of the heart to the object and end of the law, when judgment was on them for its violation, and hope of righteousness by its accomplishment impossible -- how Christ was the end of the law for righteousness.<a name=244:1></a> The principle is found here.<a name=244:2></a> The apostle brings in Christ as the true accomplishment of it.<a name=244:3></a> At the end of the chapter, Moses declares that he has now set before them the good and the evil, and that they would have to bear the consequence of their choice.<a name=244:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 31 he introduces Joshua, as the leader under whom the people were to take possession of the promised land.<a name=244:5></a> He orders that the law should be read before all every seventh year, in order that every one might take notice of it, in that solemn moment when, enjoying afresh, as it were, the blessing which it secured to them, they submitted to it as a testimony that the land, as well as everything, belonged to Jehovah.<a name=244:6></a> Afterwards, when Joshua is established in his charge, Moses is ordered to communicate to the people a song inspired of God, which, based upon the certainty of the iniquity of the people, announces the ways of the Lord towards them; commanding the Levites, at the same time, to put the written law by the side of the ark, as a witness against the people.<a name=244:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 32.<a name=244:8></a> We have the prophetic song, which is based on the foreknown fall of the people.<a name=244:9></a> First, it declares the perfectness of Jehovah, whatever may take place; it is Israel who have corrupted themselves (compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:3">Psalm  22:3</a>.<a name=244:10></a> Christ can say, "Why?<a name=244:11></a>") At the same time (verse 8) we have an all-important declaration; namely, that God, in His government of the world, had made Israel the centre, and had arranged the nations of the earth, in their various localities, as having respect to the bounds of Israel as being the first object of those ways.<a name=244:12></a> For His earthly people are Jehovah's portion, His inheritance upon earth.<a name=244:13></a> But Jeshurun (Israel) waxed fat, and kicked, and forsook the Rock of his strength.<a name=244:14></a> Consequently God moves them to jealousy with those that are not a people.<a name=244:15></a> It is the call of the Gentiles, according to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:19">Romans  10:19</a>.<a name=244:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The judgment, nevertheless, falls upon Israel, so that God would have destroyed them, had not the glory of His name hindered Him, for the Gentiles proved themselves perfectly wicked.<a name=244:17></a> Then, the people being distressed, without strength and without hope, He remembers them, and finally takes

		vengeance on their enemies, those idolatrous Gentiles.<a name=245:1></a> But, though avenging Himself, it is then that, having restored His people Israel, He will cause the Gentiles to rejoice in Him.<a name=245:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This principle is true already; but the testimony it furnishes will be fully accomplished when Israel is again restored to the enjoyment of the promises; when God will manifest His mercy towards His land, as well as towards His people.<a name=245:3></a> The whole course of His dealings, in respect of the people who form the centre of His ways upon earth, is thus fully brought out.<a name=245:4></a> Afterwards, Moses puts obedience (the great end of this book, Israel being placed under the condition of obedience for continuance in the enjoyment of the promises) before them again, and reminds them that thereby they would prolong their days in the land which they were going up to possess.<a name=245:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At last poor Moses has to go up Mount Nebo, to see the land into which he cannot enter, not having answered the requirement of the glory of God in the wilderness, nor sanctified His name by faith.<a name=245:6></a> It is the unavoidable consequence of the just government of God towards a servant -- I mean under the law.<a name=245:7></a> He does not get into the enjoyment of the promise.<a name=245:8></a> A single fault deprives him of it.<a name=245:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have also the blessings of this man of God, pronounced over the people before his death (chapter 33).<a name=245:10></a> The blessings of Jacob were more historical regarding the future.<a name=245:11></a> Here they are rather relationship with God according to His government.<a name=245:12></a> Twelve is still the number of the tribes (Simeon being omitted to make room for two tribes of the posterity of Joseph, the firstborn as to the inheritance, instead of Reuben).<a name=245:13></a> Here it is according to the blessing of God, and not according to the rights of nature.<a name=245:14></a> Upon this latter principle, Israel, represented by Reuben, will be diminished, but will not die.<a name=245:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jehovah is there in majesty, with the terror of the law in His right hand; but He loves the people, that is to say, His saints there surrounding Him to receive His words.<a name=245:16></a> The people receive a law, through the mediation of Moses, which is the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.<a name=245:17></a> This Moses is there as king.<a name=245:18></a> These, then, are the relationships on which these blessings are based.<a name=245:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The blessings are not here presented historically as those of the children of the fathers, and, consequently, in connection with Shiloh, the Rock of Israel, nor as a complete view of God's ways in Israel, as in Genesis; but the subject is the

		relationship of Jehovah with the people, as in possession of the land (as in the rest of the book), and placed under the government of God: Jehovah blessing, but blessing according to the majesty of Sinai, and of His revelation of Himself in the bush; Moses, the king, being the channel of these blessings, which had thus reference to the nation, and were based upon this relationship with God.<a name=246:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Levi is blessed, having been faithful to Jehovah; Joseph has the blessing and the goodwill of Him that dwelt in the bush, having been separated from his brethren, fearing God, and being the vessel of His purposes.<a name=246:2></a> This was accordingly the position of the two tribes in the land, as Simeon, not mentioned here, was, so to speak, lost in the land; his portion was where the Philistines dwelt.<a name=246:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must also remark here, that the chief blessings rest upon him who, for the sake of God, neither knew his father, nor his mother, that is, Levi; and upon Joseph, who, for the glory of God, was separated from his own.<a name=246:4></a> Both were His.<a name=246:5></a> Levi has the most excellent place; his separation, which should actually take place, was a fruit of faithfulness.<a name=246:6></a> Joseph has, perhaps, more sensible enjoyment; he was faithful to God in his involuntary separation.<a name=246:7></a> Both these are completely realised in Christ.<a name=246:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the blessing of God preserves life to Reuben, with but few men, Judah is presented to Jehovah, that he may be heard, and that the help of Jehovah may be with him.<a name=246:9></a> The expression, "Bring him unto his people", deserves careful notice, in the relations which have existed between that people and God, seeing the position of Judah in their history, under the government of God, and its present dispersion, and in that which is yet to take place, when the union of the whole people will be restored in their own place.<a name=246:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Levi occupies the third place, Simeon being left out.<a name=246:11></a> The request of the prophet-king for him (Levi) is the everlasting priesthood of the people of God (upon earth, of course).<a name=246:12></a> "His holy one" is used in the sense of piety towards God -- grace in the heart.<a name=246:13></a> He requests that light and perfection (Urim and Thummim) in the intelligence of the relations which would in reality exist at all times between the people and God, and between God and the people in return, might be with the man of grace and piety, officially the priestly tribe.<a name=246:14></a>

		Further, God not only said, "therefore Israel could not stand", but "Thou canst not stand".<a name=277:11></a> Their weakness would continue.<a name=277:12></a> Sorrowful change!<a name=277:13></a> Before it was "No man shall be able to stand before thee".<a name=277:14></a> Now they could not stand themselves.<a name=277:15></a> Where there is not holiness, God allows the weakness of His people to be practically seen; for there is no strength but in Him, and He will not go out with them where holiness is wanting, nor thus sanction and encourage sin.<a name=277:16></a> Only, let us remark here, that God does not always withdraw His blessing at once from those who are unfaithful.<a name=277:17></a> He frequently chastens them on one hand, and blesses them on the other.<a name=277:18></a> He deals patiently, He instructs them, in His grace; He does not bless them on the side where the evil is, but He acts with admirable tenderness and perfect knowledge, taking the trouble, so to say, of following the soul in detail according to its condition and for its good; for He is full of grace.<a name=277:19></a> How often He thus waits for the repentance of His people!<a name=277:20></a> Alas!<a name=277:21></a> how often He waits for it in vain.<a name=277:22></a> But we have here the great principle on which He acts (as in the case of Jericho, that of

		His power exercised on behalf of His people), proving that all is of God.<a name=278:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another important principle is here set before us.<a name=278:2></a> The people of God are viewed corporately, as to the effects of sin amongst them.<a name=278:3></a> God is in their midst.<a name=278:4></a> Sin is committed there.<a name=278:5></a> He is there.<a name=278:6></a> But since there is only one God there, and the people are one, if God is displeased and cannot act, the whole people suffer in consequence, for they have no other strength but God.<a name=278:7></a> The only remedy is to put away the accursed thing.<a name=278:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find the same thing at Corinth, modified according to the principles of grace.<a name=278:9></a> The wicked person must be put away.<a name=278:10></a> If not, they are all identified with the sin until they have put it away, and have thus "approved themselves to be clear".<a name=278:11></a> In doing so, they take God's part against the sin, and the relationship between God and the body reassumes its normal state.<a name=278:12></a> Nevertheless all this cannot fail to produce certain painful effects.<a name=278:13></a> If the accursed thing is there, although God may have been glorified in the manifestation of the perfection of His ways -- of His jealousy of sin, and perfect knowledge of all that happens (for Achan's confession justifies God, and the people have not a word to say), still, though the sin is no longer concealed, discipline must be carried out.<a name=278:14></a> The confession of Achan (whose sin had been brought to light, through the obedience of the people, or of Joshua, to the Lord's directions) does but ratify, in the eyes of all, the just judgment.<a name=278:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is well to remember here that christian discipline has always the recovery of the soul for its object.<a name=278:16></a> Even if the offender should be delivered unto Satan, it is for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord -- a most forcible reason for exercising this discipline, according to the measure of our spiritual power; for we cannot go beyond that.<a name=278:17></a> At the least we might always humble ourselves before God, in order that the evil may be removed.<a name=278:18></a> To be indifferent to the presence of evil in the church is to be guilty of high treason against God; it is taking advantage of His love to deny his holiness, despising and dishonouring Him before all.<a name=278:19></a> God acts in love in the church; but He acts with holiness and for the maintenance of holiness: otherwise it would not be the love of God which acted; it would not be seeking the prosperity of souls.<a name=278:20></a>

		If all the people were compromised by Achan's sin, it was needful that they should be sensibly restored to confidence, that they should be established, and consequently that they should go through whatever was necessary to their restoration.<a name=279:11></a> They must experience many things.<a name=279:12></a> Much experience of this kind would be avoided by walking in the simplicity and integrity of faith.<a name=279:13></a> Jacob had more of it than Abraham, and it was when unfaithful that Abraham went through the most (that is, of such experience as is really felt to exercise the heart).<a name=279:14></a> But God makes use of this to teach us what we are, and what He is: two things which -- if we know them not -- render experience necessary.<a name=279:15></a>

		Meanwhile, the power of God is with them, and everything succeeds; although the manifestation of this power is not such as it was at Jericho.<a name=279:22></a> At length by God's command Joshua stretches out the spear that was in his hand toward the city.<a name=279:23></a> It does not appear that the ambush saw it, or that it was

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is highly interesting to see the Lord thus the hidden spring of all action, giving impulse to the activity of His children, who in detail are ignorant of what it is that puts them in motion although, on the whole, the mind of God is revealed to them, even as Israel had the general orders of Joshua.<a name=280:5></a> When Christ stretches out the spear, all is activity to bring about the counsels of His wisdom and lead to the predetermined results of His mighty grace.<a name=280:6></a> May we only have faith to believe it!<a name=280:7></a>

		We have still two other important facts to consider in this chapter.<a name=280:8></a> Jehovah had already shewn in the taking of Jericho that it was His might alone that gave victory, or rather that made everything fall before Israel, the prince of this world having no power against Him; and that, the gold and silver being Jehovah's, the people were not to seek the treasures of the conquered world, nor to enrich themselves with its spoils In general, however, when Israel had exterminated their enemies, they took possession of everything, as of the promised land.<a name=280:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that these two great principles are established, (namely that the power of God is with His people, and that He will have holiness and consecration to Himself maintained in the camp,) Joshua takes formal possession of the whole country, as belonging to Jehovah.<a name=280:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, the conditions of the warfare being laid down, they publicly declare beforehand that it is Jehovah's land.<a name=281:3></a> Though Satan is still in possession of the contested land, by right it is Jehovah's.<a name=281:4></a> There were two actions by which Joshua verified this.<a name=281:5></a> He commanded the dead body of the king of Ai to be taken down from the tree as soon as the sun was down.<a name=281:6></a> This was the ordinance in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:22">Deuteronomy  21:22</a>, 23, "His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day (for he that is hanged is accursed of God); that thy land be not defiled, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance".<a name=281:7></a> Israel's victory was complete.<a name=281:8></a> The curse hung over their enemies, who were also God's enemies.<a name=281:9></a> They were made a curse, and declared to be so.<a name=281:10></a> Now, according to Joshua's faith, the land was so entirely Israel's, as the gift of God, that it ought not to be defiled; he had, therefore, the dead body taken down that it should not be so in fact.<a name=281:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other action was Joshua's building an altar on Mount Ebal.<a name=281:12></a> Having taken possession of Canaan as a consecrated land, they recognise Jehovah as the God of Israel by worshipping Him in the land.<a name=281:13></a> The altar was there as a witness, and as a bond between the people and Jehovah who had given them the land.<a name=281:14></a> The erection of this altar has been already spoken of, when considering the Book of Deuteronomy; I will not recur to it.<a name=281:15></a> I leave it to the reader to judge whether Joshua would have done better to set up this altar as soon as they had crossed the Jordan.<a name=281:16></a> Be that as it may, we do not always turn at once to God, when we enjoy that which His power has wrought.<a name=281:17></a> Our not doing so only proves our folly, whether it be in things connected with our joy or our safety.<a name=281:18></a> It was the Lord's mind here to give us the testimony of divine strength and human weakness before this public assumption of the land in His name; the practical realisation of being beyond Jordan in power and of Gilgal, brought home to them by its contrast.<a name=281:19></a> It is taken possession of in connection with Israel's responsibility under the law.<a name=281:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Samson, as a type, sets before us the principle of Nazariteship, entire separation to God, the source of strength in conflict with our enemies, looked at as enemies who seek to gain the upper hand amongst the people of God, within their own limits and in their own heart.<a name=301:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Philistines were not a scourge, a chastisement sent from without; they dwelt in Israel's own territory, in the land of promise.<a name=301:5></a> Undoubtedly, before this, other nations whom the faithlessness of the people had left in the midst of Canaan had been a snare to them, leading them to intermarriage with idolaters, and to the worship of false gods; and Jehovah had given them up into the hands of their enemies.<a name=301:6></a> But now, those who had been suffered to remain in the conquered land assume dominion over Israel.<a name=301:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, that which can give victory and peace to the heirs of promise is the strength imparted by separation from all that belongs to the natural man, and entire consecration to God, so far as it is realised.<a name=301:8></a> This Nazariteship is spiritual power, or rather that which characterises it, when the enemy is within the land.<a name=301:9></a> For Samson judged Israel during the dominion of the Philistines (chapter 15: 20).<a name=301:10></a> Afterwards Samuel, Saul, and above all David, entirely changed the state of things.<a name=301:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Canaanite, when the power of the enemy, reigns in the land, Nazariteship alone can give power to one who is faithful.<a name=301:12></a> It is a secret unknown to the men of the world.<a name=301:13></a> Christ exemplified it in its perfection.<a name=301:14></a> Evil reigned amongst the people.<a name=301:15></a> The walk of Christ was a walk apart, separate from evil.<a name=301:16></a> He was one of the people, but, like Levi (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:9">Deuteronomy  33:9</a>), He was not of them.<a name=301:17></a> He was a Nazarite.<a name=301:18></a> But we must distinguish with respect to this.<a name=301:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Morally, Christ was as separate from sinners while on earth, as He is now.<a name=301:20></a> But, outwardly He was in their midst; and, as the witness and expression of grace, He was spiritually in their midst also.<a name=301:21></a> Since His resurrection He is completely separate from sinners.<a name=301:22></a> The world sees Him not, and will see Him no more save in judgment.<a name=301:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in this last position, and as having put on this character of entire separation from the world, that the assembly, that Christians, are in connection with Him.<a name=301:24></a> Such a High Priest

		became us.<a name=302:1></a> The assembly retains its strength, Christians retain their strength, so far only as they abide in this state of complete separation, which the world does not understand and in which it cannot participate.<a name=302:2></a> Human joy and sociability have no part in it; divine joy and the power of the Holy Ghost are there.<a name=302:3></a> The life of our adorable Saviour was a life of gravity, always grave and generally straitened (not in Himself, for His heart was a springing well of love, but because of the evil that pressed Him on every side): I speak of His life and of His own heart.<a name=302:4></a> With regard to others, His death opened the flood-gates, in order that the full tide of love might flow over poor sinners.<a name=302:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless, whatever may have been the Lord's habitual separateness, He could say, with reference to His disciples, "These things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves".<a name=302:6></a> It was the best of wishes, divine joy instead of human joy.<a name=302:7></a> The day will come when these two joys shall be united, when He will again drink wine, though in a new way, with His people in the kingdom of His Father; and all will be His people.<a name=302:8></a> But at present this cannot be; evil reigns in the world.<a name=302:9></a> It reigned in Israel, where there ought to have been righteousness.<a name=302:10></a> It reigns in Christendom, where holiness and grace should be manifested in all their beauty.<a name=302:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The separation unto God, of which we have been speaking, is under these circumstances the only means of enjoying the strength of God.<a name=302:12></a> It is the essential position of the assembly.<a name=302:13></a> If it has failed in it, it has ceased to manifest the essential character of its Head, in connection with itself, "separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens"; it is but a false witness, a proof among the Philistines that Dagon is stronger than God; it is a blind prisoner.<a name=302:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless it is remarkable that, whenever the world draws away, by its allurements, that which God has separated from it unto Himself, this brings down the judgment of God upon the world, and leads to its ruin.<a name=302:15></a> Look at Sarah in the house of Pharaoh; and in this instance, Samson, blind and prisoner in the hands of the Philistines; and again also Sarah in the house of Abimelech, although God, on account of the integrity of his heart, did but chasten the latter.<a name=302:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the assembly's position, the only one which God recognises.<a name=303:3></a> The assembly, being united to Christ who is separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens, cannot be His in any other manner.<a name=303:4></a> It may be unfaithful to it, but this is the standing given it with Christ.<a name=303:5></a> It can be recognised in no other.<a name=303:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Samson represents to us also the tendency of the assembly, and of the Christian to fall away from this position, a tendency which does not always produce the same amount of evil fruit, but which causes the inward and practical neglect of Nazariteship, and soon leads to entire loss of strength, so that the assembly gives itself up to the world.<a name=303:7></a> God may still use it, may glorify Himself through the havoc it makes in the enemy's land (which ought to be its own); He may even preserve it from the sin to which the slippery path it treads would lead it.<a name=303:8></a> But the state of mind which brought it there tends to yet lower downfalls.<a name=303:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God makes use of Samson's marriage with a Philistine woman to punish that people.<a name=303:10></a> Still, in the freshness of his strength, his heart with Jehovah, and moved by the Holy Ghost, Samson acts in the might of this strength in the midst of the enemies he has raised up against him; and, in point of fact, he never marries this Philistine woman.<a name=303:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said that God used this circumstance.<a name=303:12></a> It is thus He may use this spiritual strength of the assembly, so long as in heart it cleaves to Him, although its walk may not be faithful or such as He can approve.<a name=303:13></a> For it is evident that Samson's marriage with a daughter of Timnath was a positive sin, a flagrant infringement of Jehovah's ordinances, which is in no wise justified by the blessing which the Lord bestowed upon him when wronged by the Philistines.<a name=303:14></a> It was not in his marriage he found blessing, but quite the contrary.<a name=303:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Accordingly Samson has not Israel with him in the conflicts occasioned by his marriage; the Spirit of God does not act upon the people as He did in the case of Gideon, of Jephthah, or Barak.<a name=303:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the part of Samson's life now before us there are some details which require more attention.<a name=304:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His marriage was a sin.<a name=304:7></a> But the separation of God's people had no longer that measure of practical application which the mind of God had assigned it.<a name=304:8></a> The fact itself was inexcusable, because it had its origin in the will of Samson, and he had not sought counsel from God.<a name=304:9></a> But, owing to the influence of circumstances, he was not conscious at the time of the evil he was committing, and God allowed him to seek peace and friendship with the Canaanite world (that is to say, the world within the inclosure of God's people), instead of making war against them; so that, as to the Philistines, Samson had right on his side in the contentions which followed.<a name=304:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before his marriage Samson had slain the lion, and had found honey in its carcase.<a name=304:11></a> He had strength from God while walking in his integrity.<a name=304:12></a> This is the "riddle", the secret of God's people.<a name=304:13></a> The lion has no strength against one who belongs to Christ.<a name=304:14></a> Christ has destroyed the strength of him that had the power of death.<a name=304:15></a> By the might of the Spirit of Christ our warfare is victory, and honey flows therefrom.<a name=304:16></a> But this is carried on in the secret of communion with the Lord.<a name=304:17></a> David maintained this place better in the simplicity of duty.<a name=304:18></a>

		If we have spoken of the fall of the priesthood, we must not infer from it that priesthood ceased to exist.<a name=316:2></a> It was always necessary to a people full of weakness (as it is to ourselves on earth); it interposed in the things of God to maintain individual relationship to Him in them, but it ceased to form the basis of relationship between the whole people and God.<a name=316:3></a> The people were no longer capable of enjoying this relationship through this means alone; and the priesthood itself could suffice no longer, having so deeply failed in its standing.<a name=316:4></a> We shall do well to dwell a little on this, which is the turning-point of the truths we are considering.<a name=316:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Israel's primitive state, and in their constitution generally, as established in the land given to them, priesthood was the basis of their relationship with God; it was that which characterised and maintained it (see <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:11">Hebrews  7:11</a>).<a name=316:6></a> The high priest was their head and representative before God, as a nation of worshippers; and in this character (I speak here neither of redemption from Egypt nor of conquests, but of a people before God, and in relationship with Him), on the great day of atonement he confessed their sins over the scape-goat.<a name=316:7></a> It was not merely intercession.<a name=316:8></a> He stood there as head and representative of the people, who were summed up in him before Jehovah.<a name=316:9></a> The people were acknowledged, although faulty.<a name=316:10></a> They presented themselves in the person of the high priest, that they might be in connection with a God, who, after all veiled Himself from their eyes.<a name=316:11></a> The people presented everything to the priest; the high priest stood before God.<a name=316:12></a> This relationship did not imply innocence.<a name=316:13></a> An innocent man should have stood himself before God.<a name=316:14></a> "Adam, where art thou?<a name=316:15></a>" This question brings out his fall.<a name=316:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Still the people were not driven away, though the veil was between them and God; the high priest, who sympathised with the infirmities of the people, being one with them, maintained the relationship with God.<a name=316:17></a> They were a very imperfect people, it is true; yet by this means they stood themselves in connection with the Holy One.<a name=316:18></a> But Israel was not able to maintain this position; not only was there sin (the high priest could remedy that), but they sinned against Jehovah, they turned away from Him, and that even in their leaders.<a name=316:19></a> The priesthood itself, which should have maintained the relationship,

		I pass over the preparatory circumstances; they will be considered in detail in their place.<a name=317:2></a> God then sets up a king, whose duty it was to preserve order and to secure God's connection with the people by governing them, and by his own faithfulness to God.<a name=317:3></a> This is what Christ will accomplish for them in the ages to come; He is the anointed.<a name=317:4></a> When the king is established, the priest walks before him (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:35">1 Samuel  2:35</a>).<a name=317:5></a> It is a new institution, the only one capable of maintaining the relationship of the people with God.<a name=317:6></a> Priesthood is no longer here an immediate relationship.<a name=317:7></a> It provides indeed, in its own functions, for the wants of the people.<a name=317:8></a> The king watches over it, and secures order and blessing.<a name=317:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark, also, that that which here distinguishes David is not shining deeds, the fruit of the power of faith, but the instinct and intelligence of that which is suitable to his position a moral discernment of that which is pleasing to God, and of the line of conduct which His servant should pursue as the vessel of His spiritual energy, while the power which belongs to him is in the hands of another.<a name=342:3></a> It is the walk of one who has apprehended that which is suitable to this difficult position, in all the circumstances it brings him into; who respects that which God respects, and does the work of God without fear when God calls him: a remarkable type of Jesus in all this, and example for us.<a name=342:4></a>

		Besides this spiritual perception, these moral suitabilities; the greater part of this history sets before us the way in which God makes everything tend towards the accomplishment of His purposes (in spite of all the motives and intentions of men) in order to place David, through patience and the energy of faith, in the position He had prepared for him.<a name=342:5></a>

		After having described the ruin of Israel, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>shews us Jehovah awaking; but it sets aside all rights of inheritance, and testimony to His former dealings with Israel; for (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#5">1 Chronicles  5</a>) the birthright was Joseph's -- "He CHOSE the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.<a name=356:7></a> He CHOSE David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds", etc.<a name=356:8></a> This psalm mentions indeed His sanctuary, but the mountain on which it was built is never represented as the object of God's election.<a name=356:9></a> This psalm reaches farther than our present history; but it applies election to David and to Zion.<a name=356:10></a>

		There is yet a remark to make on the subject of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>.<a name=357:2></a> We have seen that God maintains His majesty in His government, and does not allow any one to touch His ark.<a name=357:3></a> He gives David time to learn that God is a God of blessing and of grace; but, however good the intentions of His people may be, it is necessary that truth, that what He is, should be clearly demonstrated in His public dealings.<a name=357:4></a> If it were otherwise, if His government were not stable, all would go to ruin; the levity of man would constantly lead him into the paths of self-will.<a name=357:5></a> It is true that God is full of patience, and that after having formed the relationship between His people and Himself, He continues to act according to this relationship as long as possible, although forced to chasten at the same time; but judgment comes at length.<a name=357:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case we are considering, God had broken this relationship as originally established by His sitting between the cherubim; He had delivered His strength into captivity, His glory into the enemy's hand.<a name=357:7></a> David, as victor, restores to Him His place, but on a new principle, that of grace and power.<a name=357:8></a> Nevertheless, in examining <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>, we discover much deeper sentiments, a heart which desires to have God glorified among His people in a much more developed and much more intimate manner than was indicated by that which the outward pomp and train, in which Israel could take part, represented; sentiments to which God responded in a very different way than by the death of Uzzah.<a name=357:9></a> This psalm, it is true, was written after the touching communications which are revealed in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>, as verses 11, 12 prove.<a name=357:10></a> It teaches us however in what spirit David went to fetch the ark, the ardent desire of his heart to find a habitation for Jehovah, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:357">footnote</a></i>[a]) which, as we have seen, Christ will accomplish.<a name=357:11></a> Now it appears to me, that it was the consciousness of this desire that led to David's failure.<a name=357:12></a> Alas for man!<a name=357:13></a> In the consciousness of it he seeks to put it into execution, and he a little forgets the supreme glory of God, the sin which had caused God's departure from His people, and the majesty proper to Him.<a name=357:14></a> When God acts according to the requirements of His glory, and smites the man who lent David his assistance

		in accomplishing the desire of his heart, David is displeased.<a name=358:1></a> The death of Uzzah was the result of David's conduct, and he is angry with Jehovah when this result takes place.<a name=358:2></a> This was truly the flesh.<a name=358:3></a> God made David sensible of that which was becoming to the service of the God of Israel (see <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#15:12">1 Chronicles  15:12</a>, 13), (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:358">footnote</a></i>[b]) and He restored his soul by shewing him that He was the true source of blessing, and that the leaving the ark aside was leaving blessing aside too.<a name=358:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover the position of David, zealously maintaining a sense of Jehovah's glory in the midst of his exaltation, as portrayed in the psalm, is of the highest moral beauty, and has a very peculiar aspect in reference to the divine economies.<a name=358:5></a> The place which Solomon occupies at the dedication of the temple presents, no doubt, a more striking picture.<a name=358:6></a> The Melchisedec priesthood is there in its simplicity and its fulness, but this was the fruit of the accomplishment of blessing; and the moral condition of those who took part in it was much less the result of deep exercise of heart, and of the close communion with God which is its consequence; it was, therefore, much less connected with the intelligent expectation of Christ.<a name=358:7></a> Solomon enjoyed the present realisation of the glory upon which, in its true accomplishment in Christ, David relied by faith; Solomon does not go to a higher source than David's faith, and the responsibility of the people which flowed from it.<a name=358:8></a> The temple is the scene of this.<a name=358:9></a> David rises higher.<a name=358:10></a> He lays hold of God's purpose, as to the seat of Jehovah's kingdom; and at a time when this required faith, he becomes, as far as possible, the royal priest, and consequently ascends to God Himself, who is the source of this priesthood.<a name=358:11></a> Taught of God, he has understood the election of Zion, the seat of Christ's kingly glory; and in this sense his moral position, when dancing before the ark as an obscure man, and to his shame before the world, appears to be a much higher one than that of Solomon upon his brazen scaffold.<a name=358:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ark is also the sign of the re-establishment of God's power in the midst of His people by this moral link; but this re-establishment takes place, by what was in type the victory and the energy of Christ who prevails over His enemies, as will be the case, and not merely in the enjoyment of the glory.<a name=358:13></a>

		The following are the chief subjects of the revelation made to David, and of his reply: -- the sovereign call of God; that which God had done for David; the certainty of future rest for Israel; the establishment, on God's part, of David's house; his son shall be the Son of God, shall build the house; the throne of his Son shall be established for ever.<a name=362:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		David's first thought -- and it is always so when the Spirit of God works -- was not to rejoice, but to bless God.<a name=362:2></a> These are the striking features of the prayer of thankfulness: he is in peace and freedom before God; he goes in and sits before Him; he acknowledges at the same time his own nothingness, and how unworthy he was of all that God had already done.<a name=362:3></a> Yet this was but a small thing in the sight of God, who had declared to him the future glories of his house.<a name=362:4></a> It was God, and not the manner of man.<a name=362:5></a> What could he say more?<a name=362:6></a> God knew him; there lay his confidence and his joy.<a name=362:7></a> He acknowledged that God did it in truth and "of his own heart".<a name=362:8></a> It was grace to make His servant know it.<a name=362:9></a> The effect of all this was to make David recognise the excellency of Jehovah.<a name=362:10></a> There was none beside Him, and none upon the earth therefore to be compared to His elect people, whom He went to redeem for a people to Himself, and whom He had now confirmed to Himself, that Israel might be His people for ever, and that He Himself might be their God.<a name=362:11></a> The highest kind of prayer is that which does not spring from a sense of need, but from the desires and the intelligence which the revelation of God's purposes produces -- purposes which He will fulfil in love to His people and for the glory of Christ.<a name=362:12></a> Finally he asks that his house may be the place of God's own blessing.<a name=362:13></a> In a word, he desires that the purposes of God, which had awakened all his affections, may be accomplished by Jehovah Himself, who had revealed them unto His servant.<a name=362:14></a>

		He acts in grace also towards the humble remnant of Saul's house; and if Mephibosheth is not associated with the glory of his kingdom, he enjoys the privilege of the king's table, who shews him kindness; although Mephibosheth belongs to the family of his enemy and persecutor, but at the same time to that little remnant which favoured the king whom God had chosen (being itself, on that account, hated by those in power).<a name=363:6></a> He enjoys also the whole of his family's inheritance.<a name=363:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This touching and beautiful testimony to David's kindness and faithfulness through grace, appears to me to give us a picture of Christ's relations to the remnant of Israel, or at least that of the spirit of these relations.<a name=363:8></a> It was "the kindness of God" which sought out the family of Saul, the enemy of David's crown -- and which rests upon the representative of Jonathan, whose history we have read, and who typifies those that will attach themselves to Christ in prospect of the kingdom, to which their thoughts are limited.<a name=363:9></a> The remnant enjoys the effect of the establishment of the kingdom, but does not rank among those that surround the throne after having shared the sufferings of the despised and rejected king.<a name=363:10></a>

		The nearer David was to God, the more ineffectual were his attempts to conceal his sin.<a name=364:3></a> Given up to himself for the time in chastisement, he adds a second transgression to the first; he completes it, and enjoys its fruit, now that the removal of every obstacle gives a semblance of lawfulness to his course.<a name=364:4></a> What a sad history!<a name=364:5></a> What unworthiness!<a name=364:6></a> He forgets his position as king, and a king from God.<a name=364:7></a> Was it reigning in righteousness to take advantage of his royal power to oppress Uriah?<a name=364:8></a> He makes himself a slave to the wretched Joab by rendering him accessory to his crime.<a name=364:9></a> How degrading!<a name=364:10></a> How much happier was he, when, though hunted like a partridge in the mountains, he had a living faith and a good conscience!<a name=364:11></a> But who can shun the eye of God?<a name=364:12></a> Accordingly God, who knows and loves him, fails not to visit his sin.<a name=364:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was a very great sin: David committed it in secret; God punishes it in the sight of all Israel.<a name=364:14></a> If David knew not how to glorify God, nor -- while reigning in His name -- to maintain a true testimony as to the nature of God's kingdom; if he had on the contrary falsified its character, God Himself will know how, in the sight of all men, to retrace its features through the chastisement He will send upon the man who has thus dishonoured Him, and who had taken away the only witness to His government which God had set up before men.<a name=364:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This history shews us how far sin can blind the heart, even while the moral judgment continues sound; it shews also the power of the faithful word of God.<a name=364:16></a> God manifests at the same time the sovereignty of His grace; for although He chastened David by the child's death, it is another son of Bathsheba who was the elect of God, who became king and the head of the royal family, the man of peace and blessing, the beloved of Jehovah.<a name=364:17></a> David submits himself under the hand of God; his heart bows under it in the depth of its affections.<a name=364:18></a> He understands it better than his servants do, although more guilty than they.<a name=364:19></a> He acts becomingly according to spiritual intelligence.<a name=364:20></a> There was confidence in God and intimacy with Him; and therefore David can lay open the tenderest part of his heart to God, the part in which God had wounded him; but when the will of God is manifest, he submits entirely.<a name=364:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sin of David has been extremely great; but we can plainly see in him the precious work of the Spirit.<a name=365:2></a> Confounded by the simple faithfulness of Uriah, he cannot escape the hand of God!<a name=365:3></a> David is pardoned, for he confesses his sin; but as to His government, God shews Himself to be inflexible, and while sparing the king -- for he deserved death -- He announces to him that the sword shall never depart out of his house.<a name=365:4></a> We have seen a similar case in Jacob's unfaithfulness.<a name=365:5></a> David's punishment also answers to his sins (compare verses 10, 12 with the history of Absalom).<a name=365:6></a> As to David's affections, the chastisement was in the death of his child, a chastisement which he deeply felt; and the public government of God was manifested in that which was done, according to His word, before all Israel and before the sun.<a name=365:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is possible that the children of Ammon deserved severe judgment, and that this period was the time of their judgment; they were the insolent enemies of the king whom God had set up, and who had given proof of his kind feeling towards them.<a name=365:8></a> But as to his personal condition, I know not whether David would have treated his enemies in this manner when he was walking in the narrow path of faith.<a name=365:9></a> As a type, this judgment brings to mind the righteous judgment of the Messiah, and the dreadful consequences of having despised and insulted Him even in His glory.<a name=365:10></a> We learn from it also, that when a people are ripe for judgment, God will bring it upon them, even although others may seek to act in grace.<a name=365:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When David had shewn that he had forgotten God, and had failed in his entire dependence upon Him, the evils in his house soon broke out.<a name=365:12></a> He had added to the number of his wives.<a name=365:13></a> The root of bitterness buds and brings forth bitter fruits.<a name=365:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although in the main David's heart was upright before God and deeply acknowledged Him, yet, when once out of that path of humble dependence which is produced by faith and the sense of God's presence, he embittered the remainder of his days through following his own will in the midst of his blessings.<a name=365:15></a> There is sin in his house, wrath on account of the sin, vacillation through partiality for Absalom.<a name=365:16></a> Joab appears on the scene,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David's partiality for Absalom had yet other and more painful results, and heavy chastisements.<a name=366:3></a> It is painful to see the conqueror of Goliath driven from his home and his throne by his beloved son, and that under God's hand.<a name=366:4></a> For if God had not allowed it, who could have driven God's elect from the royal seat in which Jehovah had placed him?<a name=366:5></a> The sword was in his house; the word of God, sharper than a two-edged sword.<a name=366:6></a> How just is Jehovah!<a name=366:7></a> But whom He loves He chastens.<a name=366:8></a> Accordingly, whilst all this is a manifestation of the righteous rule of God, it is to David an occasion of deep heart-exercise, and of a more real and more intimate knowledge of God; for his heart was truly and eternally bound to God, so that all his sorrows bore fruit, although they were occasioned by his faults.<a name=366:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this respect also, although the cause of his grief was so widely different from that of the Lord's grief, he becomes the type of Christ in suffering, and the vessel of the expression of His sympathy for His people.<a name=366:10></a> This is even so much more the case, because with a faithful heart, and in a certain sense with perfect integrity towards God, the king's faults and transgressions gave rise to those confessions and to that humiliation which the Spirit of Christ will produce in the remnant of Israel; so that on the one hand he speaks of his integrity, while on the other he confesses his faults.<a name=366:11></a> Now that is what Christ causes His people to say, and what He says for them.<a name=366:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless we must remember it is not David himself, as a godly man, who speaks in the Psalms; it is by the inspiration of the Spirit he utters them; and it is a very precious thing for us that, in circumstances where faith might fail and the heart be discouraged, the word supplies us with language suitable to faith, and to faith in one who has perhaps been unfaithful: a precious testimony that, even in this condition, God does not cast us off, and that Christ sympathises with us, since He furnishes us with expressions and sentiments adapted to such a condition.<a name=366:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Psalms supply this, and in especial suitability to the remnant of Israel in the last days.<a name=366:14></a> They are characterised by integrity of heart and confession of sin.<a name=366:15></a> The Spirit of Christ gives the sentiments, and assures of His sympathy.<a name=366:16></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>gives us very strikingly this position of Christ.<a name=366:17></a> His goodness

		Nevertheless it is beautiful to see that, where faith has acted amid the people's ruin, it has stirred up many other instruments, who -- animated and encouraged by its success -- act fearlessly with the same power as that which wrought the first deliverance.<a name=368:6></a> It is well however to observe, that to conquer valiant foes, when all Israel was flushed with success and strengthened the hands of the mighty men, is a very different thing from the faith which reckons upon God, when strength and success are on the enemy's side and the people are fleeing before him.<a name=368:7></a> The latter was David's case with Goliath; the former, that of the men who slew the other giants.<a name=368:8></a>

		In chapter 23 he celebrates his prosperity.<a name=368:14></a> But what a difference!<a name=368:15></a> He declares, it is true, what Christ will be when He reigns; and he does so in language of most attractive beauty, a beauty which ravishes the mind and transports it into the reign of Christ, that blessed "world to come of which we speak".<a name=368:16></a> But then this sorrowful thought presents itself -- "my house is not so with God".<a name=368:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first of these two songs there is something more of profound interest.<a name=368:18></a> David speaks as a prophet; and, as he had done in so many other instances, he personifies the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jesus in connection with Israel.<a name=368:19></a> This song then sets before us the sufferings of Christ (as the representative of Israel, and often speaking of the nation as though it were

		The Books of Kings shew us the kingly power established in all its glory; its fall, and God's testimony in the midst of the ruin; with details concerning Judah after the rejection of Israel, until Lo-ammi had been pronounced upon the whole nation.<a name=371:1></a> In a word, it is the trial of kingly power placed in the hands of men, not absolute, as in Nebuchadnezzar, but kingly power having the law for its rule; as there had been a trial of the people set in relationship with God by means of priesthood.<a name=371:2></a> Out of Christ nothing stands.<a name=371:3></a>

		Although the kingly power had been placed under the responsibility of its faithfulness to Jehovah; and although it had to be smitten and punished whenever it failed in this, it was yet at this time established by the counsels and the will of God.<a name=371:4></a> It was neither a David, type of Christ in his patience, who, through difficulties, obstacles, and sufferings, made himself a way to the throne; nor a king who, although exalted to the throne and always victorious, had to be a man of war to the end of his life; a type in this, I doubt not, of what Christ will be in the midst of the Jews at His return, when He will commence the coming age by subjecting the Gentiles to Himself, having been already delivered from the strivings of the people (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#18:43">Psalm  18:43</a>, 44).<a name=371:5></a> It was the king according to the promises and the counsels of God, the king established in peace, head over God's people to rule them in righteousness, son of David according to the promise, and type of that true Son of David, who shall be a priest upon His throne, who shall build the temple of Jehovah, and between whom and Jehovah there shall be the counsel of peace (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:13">Zechariah  6:13</a>).<a name=371:6></a>

		From all these passages, we perceive that the royalty of David's family was established according to the counsels of God and the election of grace; that the perpetuity of this royalty, dependent on the faithfulness of God, was consequently infallible; but that at the same time the family of David, in the person of Solomon, was in fact placed upon the throne at that time under the condition of obedience and faithfulness to Jehovah.<a name=372:5></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:372">footnote</a></i>) If himself or his posterity were to fail in faithfulness, God's judgment would be executed; a judgment which nevertheless would not prevent God's fulfilling that which His grace had assured to David.<a name=372:6></a>

		The Books of Kings contain the history of the establishment of the kingdom in Israel under this responsibility, that of its fall, of the longsuffering of God, of God's testimony amid the ruin which flowed from the unfaithfulness of the first king, and finally that of the execution of the judgment, a longer delay of which would but have falsified God's own character, and the testimony that should be given to the holiness of that character.<a name=372:7></a> Such delay would have borne a false testimony with respect to that which God is.<a name=372:8></a>

		But there is another element in the history of the king of glory, in which he oversteps the limits of the king of Israel's legitimate position; he allies himself with the Gentiles, and marries Pharaoh's daughter.<a name=374:8></a> Neither the house of Solomon, nor that of Jehovah, was yet built; but the daughter of Pharaoh, whom the king espouses in grace, dwells in the place where the suffering and victorious king had provisionally placed the ark of the covenant, which secures blessing to the people, and which, when placed in the temple, will form the source of blessing for Israel.<a name=374:9></a> This ark was not a covenant made with Pharaoh's daughter; but she dwelt where the symbol of the covenant was hidden, and she was placed under the safeguard, and sheltered by the power, of Him who had made this covenant, and who could not break it, whatever might be the unfaithfulness of a people who ought always to have enjoyed its benefits.<a name=374:10></a>

		As to the responsibility of the moment, the state of the people in this respect appears to me to be set before us as a sorrowful state; and Solomon himself is but on a level with the existing state of things -- a state borne with indeed by God in grace, but not after His heart.<a name=376:9></a> The king thought neither of the ark nor of the hidden blessing of the covenant, as that from which all his thoughts and actions should spring, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:376">footnote</a></i>) and as the only means of his connection with Jehovah.<a name=376:10></a> He loved Jehovah.<a name=376:11></a> It was given him to accomplish all that was requisite for the manifestation of His glory; but his heart rose not to the height of that faith which reckoned upon the secret of God's love, when the glory was not manifested, and which discerned it through all the existing things, even while God still bore with them.<a name=376:12></a> It was this which formed the strength of David personally.<a name=376:13></a> The ark of the covenant in the city of David was the symbol of this and for the time its expression.<a name=376:14></a>

		The heart of Elijah and the hand of God led the prophet into the wilderness, where, overwhelmed perhaps, yet precious in Jehovah's sight, he will be alone with God.<a name=391:3></a> Elijah's forty days' journey in the wilderness has only a partial resemblance to the forty days which Moses spent with God, in the same Horeb to which the prophet was going, or to those which Jesus spent in the wilderness for conflict with the enemy of God and man.<a name=391:4></a> In the two latter cases nature was set aside.<a name=391:5></a> Neither Moses nor the Lord ate or drank.<a name=391:6></a> As for Elijah, the goodness of God sustains the weakness of tried nature, makes manifest that He considers it with all tenderness and thoughtfulness, and gives the strength needed for such a journey.<a name=391:7></a> This should have touched him, and made him feel what he ought to be in the midst of the people, since he had to do with such a God.<a name=391:8></a> His heart was far from such a state.<a name=391:9></a> Impossible, when we think of ourselves, to be witnesses to others of what God is!<a name=391:10></a> Our poor hearts are too far from such a position.<a name=391:11></a>

		Elijah goes on till he reaches Horeb.<a name=391:12></a> But coming before God to speak well of himself and ill of Israel is a very different thing from forgetting self through the power of the Lord's presence, and setting Him before the people in His power which is patient in mercy in spite of all their evil.<a name=391:13></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:391">footnote</a></i>) People sometimes come before God because they have forgotten Him in the place where they ought to have stood and borne testimony for Him.<a name=391:14></a> And thus God asks Elijah, "What doest thou here, Elijah?<a name=391:15></a>" Terrible question!<a name=391:16></a> like those addressed to Adam, to Cain, and now to the world with respect to Jesus.<a name=391:17></a> The answer does but betray (as is always the case) the sad and fatal position of one who has forgotten God.<a name=391:18></a> The voice was not a voice of thunder, but one that made Elijah feel it was the voice which he had forgotten.<a name=391:19></a> Wind, fire, earthquake, these heralds to man of the power of God, would have suited the angry heart of Elijah as instruments of divine power against Israel; but these manifestations of His power were not God Himself.<a name=391:20></a> The still small voice reveals His presence to Elijah.<a name=391:21></a> That which would have satisfied his will, and that which would perhaps have been just towards others, did not awaken his own

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's answer, although just, is sorrowful to the heart.<a name=392:5></a> Vengeance shall be executed, and Elijah is commissioned to prepare its instruments -- a sad mission for the prophet, if he loved the people.<a name=392:6></a> As to Elijah, he should be succeeded by Elisha in his prophetic office.<a name=392:7></a> But if the deserved vengeance was to be executed in his time, and if the saddened prophet was to announce it, God has still seven thousand souls who had not bowed the knee to Baal, although Elijah had not been able to discover them.<a name=392:8></a> Oh!<a name=392:9></a> when will the heart of man, even in thought, rise to the height of God's grace and patience?<a name=392:10></a> If Elijah had leant more upon God, he would have known some of these seven thousand.<a name=392:11></a> He would at any rate have known Him who knew them, and who raised up his testimony to strengthen and comfort them.<a name=392:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the time was not ripe for the fulfilment of God's purposes; and God will not give up the patience of His grace towards His people to satisfy the prophet's impatience.<a name=392:13></a> Elisha is anointed; but, Ahab having humbled himself when God threatened him on account of his iniquity, the judgments are withheld even during the life-time of Ahab and of his son.<a name=392:14></a> This displays another feature in God's government, namely, that judgment upon the evil-doer may not only have been pronounced in the counsels of God, but may be already marked out in His dealings, and be even ready to be executed a long time before it is really poured out.<a name=392:15></a> The prophet, or the spiritual man, will know or will understand in spirit that it is so, and will have to wait for the moment that suits this perfect patience, which itself waits upon the slowness of our hearts and the filling up of the iniquity of the wicked, or at least for their refusal to repent.<a name=392:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Before passing on to the Second Book of Kings, I will add some general remarks, which apply equally to the two books.<a name=394:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which is here in question is the government of God Now the principles of this government are laid open to us in the revelation made to Moses, when he went up the second time to Mount Sinai (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33">Exodus  33</a>).<a name=394:12></a> There was, first of all, goodness and mercy; then the declaration that the guilty shall not be held innocent; and, thirdly, a principle of public government, which caused the effects of misconduct to be felt, namely, that their children should bear its consequences (a principle which could not be applied where the soul is in question); but this principle important and salutary in the outward government of the world is verified daily in that of providence.<a name=394:13></a> This government of God was in exercise in the case of the kings; but the condition of Israel depended on the conduct of the kings.<a name=394:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already seen that the fall of the priesthood and the demand for a king had placed the people in this position -- a position which will be one of blessing when Christ shall be their King; but, meantime, God had set up prophecy, a more intimate and real connection between the counsels of God and His people.<a name=394:15></a> The existence of a king placed the people under the effect of their governor's responsibility.<a name=394:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=395>[Page 395]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet was there on the part of God Himself in testimony and in grace.<a name=395:1></a> He recalled to the people the duties attached to this responsibility; but he was himself a proof of those counsels which assured them of future blessing, and of the interest which God took in their enjoying it both then and at all times.<a name=395:2></a> He supplied the key also to God's dealings, which were difficult to be understood without this.<a name=395:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We, Christians, have both these things.<a name=395:4></a> God will have us act by faith upon our own responsibility; but close communion with Him reveals to us the cause of many things, as also the perfection of His ways.<a name=395:5></a> Thus, in His public government, God could well bless Israel after the events related in chapter 18.<a name=395:6></a> They strengthened the faith of His own people.<a name=395:7></a> Chapter 19 shews us the secret judgment of God upon the real state of things; and it was speedily manifested.<a name=395:8></a> Ahab knows not how to profit by the blessing; he spares Benhadad; and the affair of Naboth shews that Jezebel's influence is as strong as ever.<a name=395:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to what a degree are the patience and mercy of God manifested in all this, according to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33">Exodus  33</a>!<a name=395:10></a> Ahab, rebuked by Elijah, humbles himself, and the evil comes to pass neither in the days of Ahab, nor in those of Ahaziah, but in the days of Jehoram, who was also his son, and that according to the principle already laid down.<a name=395:11></a> Personally Jehoram was less wicked than his father and his brother.<a name=395:12></a> He did not worship Baal.<a name=395:13></a> Israel, however, who had been led into the worship of this idol, still bows down to it.<a name=395:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe the difference between the judgment of God and the appearance of things.<a name=395:15></a> The judgment of God was pronounced against the king and against Israel (chapter 19); yet prosperity and peace generally marked this reign, as we have seen.<a name=395:16></a> Syria is subdued, Moab tributary; and Judah in unaccustomed prosperity leagues itself with Israel.<a name=395:17></a> The king of Judah was as Ahab, his people as Ahab's people, and his horses as Ahab's.<a name=395:18></a> It was even proposed to send to Ophir for gold, as in the days of Solomon.<a name=395:19></a> Nevertheless judgment was only suspended, and its suspension was revealed to none but Elijah.<a name=395:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what was morally the character of this alliance?<a name=395:21></a> It is Jehoshaphat who comes to Ahab, and not Ahab to Jehoshaphat.<a name=395:22></a> The latter asks, as a favour, that Jehovah may be consulted.<a name=395:23></a> After this request the false prophets make use of Jehovah's name to announce the success of the enterprise.<a name=395:24></a> This was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=396>[Page 396]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		natural enough; for the Syrians having been overcome, and having failed in performing the conditions of peace laid upon them, Ahab was going to assert his rights with the help of the king of Judah.<a name=396:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In short Jehovah's name is in the mouth of the false prophets.<a name=396:2></a> Micaiah (for the king of Judah was uneasy) -- Micaiah, being come, announces misfortune.<a name=396:3></a> But Ahab's mind was made up; and the king of Judah was bound by his engagement.<a name=396:4></a> It was no longer time to consult Jehovah: to inquire after the truth, in such a position as this, was but to learn a judgment which they had resolved to contemn.<a name=396:5></a> Ahab was more consistent than Jehoshaphat.<a name=396:6></a> The conscience of the latter only made every one uncomfortable, and proved his own folly.<a name=396:7></a> To please Jehoshaphat by speaking to him of Jehovah was no more than decency required; but it was all that Ahab did for Jehoshaphat, except that he unwillingly sent for Micaiah.<a name=396:8></a> Jehoshaphat helped Ahab against Syria; he helped Jehoram against Moab; but neither Ahab nor his son helped Jehoshaphat in any one thing, except to be unfaithful to Jehovah.<a name=396:9></a> Ahaziah was willing indeed to go with him, but it was in order to obtain gold from Ophir.<a name=396:10></a> It would rather appear that this alliance was the cause of that between Moab, Ammon, and Seir against Jehoshaphat.<a name=396:11></a> Happily it was no question then of succouring Israel.<a name=396:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the history of the alliances of believers, not only with unbelievers, but with the unfaithful.<a name=396:13></a> The latter are very willing that we should go with them; but to walk in the ways of truth is another thing.<a name=396:14></a> This is not the question with them; if they so walked, they would cease to be unfaithful.<a name=396:15></a> A true union would necessarily have made Jerusalem the centre and capital of the land: for Jehovah and His temple were there.<a name=396:16></a> The alliance took it for granted that Jehoshaphat had given up all such idea, since it shewed that he recognised Ahab in his position.<a name=396:17></a> There is no equality in an alliance between truth and error; since, by this very alliance, truth ceases to be truth, and error does not thereby become truth.<a name=396:18></a> The only thing lost is the authority and obligation of the truth.<a name=396:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have anticipated some of the events related in the Second Book of Kings, in which we find the greater part of Jehoshaphat's history.<a name=396:20></a> Let us now proceed to examine the contents of this Second Book.<a name=396:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If God has shewn that He took notice of His servant's fault, and did not pass it lightly over, He did not fail towards him in either tenderness or faithfulness.<a name=397:1></a> He acted towards him as towards a beloved and faithful servant, even at the moment in which He made him sensible of his failure in the energy of faith; for He did not make others aware of it, although He has communicated it to us for our instruction.<a name=397:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I said failure in the energy of faith; for, with respect to the mass of the people, Elijah's judgment was just.<a name=397:3></a> God reveals His thoughts and His intentions to him, and even points out to him the agents He will employ; and, while definitely replacing the prophet by Elisha, God nevertheless makes him publicly re-enter His service, by commanding him to call Elisha to accompany him in his work.<a name=397:4></a> Thus Elijah resumes his ministry in the midst of Israel.<a name=397:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Ahaziah walked in the way of his father, and openly confessed Baal to be his god by sending to consult Baal-zebub at Ekron.<a name=397:6></a> Sent to meet the king's messengers, Elijah pronounces his sentence from the Lord.<a name=397:7></a> Incensed at being opposed in his iniquity, Ahaziah sends men of his army to take him.<a name=397:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find again here the same judicial character in Elijah's miracles which was spoken of before -- a character pointed out by Jehovah Himself.<a name=397:9></a> He calls down fire from heaven to consume these men.<a name=397:10></a> The last of those sent by the king, owning the authority and power of Elijah, has his life spared.<a name=397:11></a> Elijah goes down with him to the king, to declare again to him in person Jehovah's judgment which awaited him.<a name=397:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now we reach the end of the troubles and afflictions of this precious and faithful servant of God.<a name=397:13></a> And, if we do not find in his case the calmness of the ascension of Jesus, who, while blessing His disciples, ascends to His eternal and familiar home; if this peculiar characteristic became His departure alone, who -- perfect in Himself and in His human life, in which nothing had been found out of harmony with the heaven He was re-entering -- went back to His Father, from whom He came; if in Elijah's rapture we find not the elevation of One who, having come forth from the Father and come into the world, again left the world and returned to His Father, without having

	<div class="paragraph">

		The details are worthy of all attention.<a name=398:5></a>

		If the prophet's translation to heaven is the great object presented to faith, we find also that he goes to every place that had a voice with respect to God's relationship to Israel.<a name=398:6></a> Elijah maintained, in spite of the king, the relationship between God and Israel, according to God's faithfulness, and as a prophet upon the earth.<a name=398:7></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:398">footnote</a></i>) He did not maintain it by the king, which, since David, was the normal state of the people.<a name=398:8></a> This earthly relationship was impossible, and was to close by an act of judgment.<a name=398:9></a> It is this which took place, with respect even to Judah, in the rejection of Christ.<a name=398:10></a>

		Elijah comes at length to Jordan, the type of death, which should carry him out of the land of earthly promise, and break the links of God Himself with Israel on that footing.<a name=401:2></a> He crossed it indeed dry-shod.<a name=401:3></a> We know that he ascended without having tasted death, but typically he passed through it.<a name=401:4></a> (It is not a question here of expiation, but of passing through death).<a name=401:5></a> And now, beyond the borders of Israel -- the land of law, forsaken of God -- he can freely propose blessing to Elisha according to his desire.<a name=401:6></a>

		Elisha, attached by the power of God to the prophet -- to the same ministry which Elijah had just left -- asks for a double portion of his spirit; and, although now separated from him, yet associated by faith with Elijah, gone up on high (testified by his having seen him in his heavenly condition), his request is granted.<a name=401:9></a> He again receives Elijah's mantle; but it is that of the ascended Elijah.<a name=401:10></a>

		As we have said, the starting-point of his ministry is not Sinai.<a name=401:11></a> It is heaven beyond the borders of Canaan, the other side of Jordan, which is the type of death.<a name=401:12></a> For, the law having been broken, and prophecy -- which set before the people their relation to God on earth, and His blessing on that earth -- having been proved powerless for restoration, the faithful prophet, forsaking a land which had rejected him, had taken his place outside a blind and ungrateful people, and had been taken up to Him who had sent him (hidden, so to speak, in God; although that expression, in its fulness, is true of the precious Saviour alone).<a name=401:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Up to Jordan Elijah demanded, by his ministry, that the righteous claims of God upon His people should be satisfied.<a name=401:14></a> He sets these claims before them.<a name=401:15></a> He must withdraw, and God takes him away from a people who did not know Him.<a name=401:16></a>

		At Sinai he acted in human weakness, although God had revealed Himself.<a name=401:17></a> Why retire to Horeb, where the law dwelt which the people had broken?<a name=401:18></a> This could be only to demand the execution of justice.<a name=401:19></a> While manifesting that He could in His own time exercise justice, God reserved to Himself His sovereign rights of grace.<a name=401:20></a> But in effect it is fitting that it

		should be exercised in a sovereign manner beyond the limits of man's responsibility.<a name=402:1></a> The relationship of Christ with Israel, with man, clearly explains this.<a name=402:2></a> Therefore God first shews that grace has reserved the perfect number who were known of God in Israel; then, having sent Elijah to fill up the long-suffering of the will of God in grace towards the people, instead of cutting Israel off, He places ministry in a position with respect to Israel, in which He can act sovereignly in grace towards every one who has faith to avail himself of it.<a name=402:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After Elijah had passed the Jordan, we have seen that all was changed.<a name=402:4></a> Until then Elisha is on probation; after that, grace acts.<a name=402:5></a> In principle it is the position of Christ towards the assembly (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:402">footnote</a></i>) or at least towards men in grace; that is to say, it is sovereign grace, to the actings of which death has given free course, justice having nothing more to say, and no longer resting on the responsibility of man who had undertaken to obey, and from whom obedience was due.<a name=402:6></a> Justice now consists in God's having His rights, in His glorifying Himself, as is just, by being consistent with His entire being, love, justice, sovereignty, majesty, truth, and every attribute which forms a part of His perfection.<a name=402:7></a> He does so according to His sovereignty; and He does it by the Christ who has glorified Him on the earth in all these respects, in every part of His being, so indeed as to make Him known.<a name=402:8></a> The testimony of it is that He has exalted Christ as man to His right hand.<a name=402:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It must be remembered here that the application of this regards Israel, so that the rejection of the people is considered to have taken place by the very fact of Elijah's rapture.<a name=402:10></a> God has ceased to maintain His relationship with them.<a name=402:11></a> In His sovereign counsels God never withdraws His love from Israel; but, on the ground of the people's responsibility, God has judged them.<a name=402:12></a> He has stretched out His hands all the day to a rebellious and gainsaying people.<a name=402:13></a> Therefore Elisha says to the king of Israel, "Get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother.<a name=402:14></a> Were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee".<a name=402:15></a>

		Elisha, in the power of resurrection, re-enters the scene of Elijah's labours, who had sought in vain -- as He also had done who was more excellent than Elijah -- to gather Israel unto the God of their fathers (that is to say, to bring back man in the flesh to some faithfulness towards God).<a name=403:3></a> Jericho (pleasant in itself yet, as we have seen, an accursed place) ceases to be so; the curse is removed, and the spring of waters permanently healed, by means of salt brought in a new cruse: a type, I doubt not, of the purifying power of grace which separates man from evil, and which removes evil, as contrary to the relationship of man with God; a moral power, which will take away the curse from the world, and especially from the Jews, who are the centre of rebellion against God.<a name=403:4></a> Salt represents purifying power in the efficacy and the permanency that distinguish the work of God which heals the object of blessing; and it characterises, according to the faithfulness of God, the source of blessing itself.<a name=403:5></a> The new vessel is an image of the renewed condition of all things through resurrection.<a name=403:6></a>

		There remains another circumstance to be noticed in this history.<a name=404:4></a> Elisha curses the children who mock him.<a name=404:5></a> This action not only shews us the prophet's authority upheld by God; it characterises his position.<a name=404:6></a> For although sovereign grace, in spite of Israel's fall, is in exercise towards the people, yet, together with grace, judgment shall be manifested with respect to those who despise the messenger of God.<a name=404:7></a> It will be well to remark that the judgment happens when he re-enters the land of Israel, before he takes his place in the unchangeable promises of God to His people.<a name=404:8></a> Thenceforth it is the Carmel of God which is presented to our faith.<a name=404:9></a>

		We may observe also, in this chapter, how little man realises and believes what he knows, if in spirit he is not identified with it.<a name=404:10></a> The sons of the prophets knew that Elijah was to be taken away.<a name=404:11></a> Nevertheless they propose to search for him.<a name=404:12></a>

		In the following chapter we enter into the historical part of Elisha's ministry.<a name=404:13></a> Jehoram goes to war; and, although less wicked than his father, the prophet no longer regards him.<a name=404:14></a> Jehoshaphat is still something to him: but the prophet seeks to abstract himself from the influence of the whole scene.<a name=404:15></a> He then proclaims blessing, and directs the counsels of the united kings.<a name=404:16></a> He is a saviour of Israel.<a name=404:17></a> He provides (chapter 4) for the need of the poor of his people, and delivers them from their distress.<a name=404:18></a> He bestows the heart's desire upon faith, which recognises and receives the prophet; and restores life to the dead, thus binding up the broken heart.<a name=404:19></a> He feeds the sons of the prophets during the famine, and multiplies the scant measure of bread.<a name=404:20></a> Death having been mingled with the food, he remedies the evil so that they eat with impunity.<a name=404:21></a>

		Elisha goes also beyond the borders of Israel in dispensing the blessing of which he is the instrument; and, when the king of Israel is troubled at Naaman's coming, Elisha heals the leprosy of this Gentile, who is brought to acknowledge Jehovah, the God of Israel, as the only true God.<a name=404:22></a> The Lord Jesus points out the sovereign grace of God on this occasion, which,

		As it has been frequently remarked, the means used were simple, and humbling to the flesh and to the pride of man, having their efficacy in full apprehension of, and full submission of heart and faith to, death, which is become life unto man, and that which heals him and cleanses him from sin.<a name=405:2></a> The man who was the most closely connected with Elisha, a prey to covetousness, suffers the painful consequences of a hardened heart; and that from which the Gentile had been freed comes irremediably upon him.<a name=405:3></a> Such is the position of Israel, outwardly nearer to Jehovah, but morally afar from Him.<a name=405:4></a>

		Elisha preserves Israel after this from the attacks of their powerful enemies.<a name=405:11></a> The king of Syria seeking to take Elisha prisoner, it is Elisha, on the contrary, who captures the whole host that came to seize him, thus teaching his blind servant, who had eyes and saw not, the unfailing care with which the Almighty constantly surrounds His own people.<a name=405:12></a>

		But that which has been preserved here of the genealogies of the people -- an affecting remnant (through grace) of those who had fallen under the sorrowful condemnation of "Lo-ruhamah" and "Lo-ammi" -- reveals to us another circumstance, namely, that, wherever there has been faith, God has blessed His people individually.<a name=418:5></a> Jabez (chapter 4: 9, 10), the son of affliction, seeking blessing in the presence of the God of Israel, failed not to find it.<a name=418:6></a> Jehovah enlarged his borders, and so kept him from evil that it grieved him not.<a name=418:7></a> Simeon, although dispersed in Israel, was able to drive out the enemy and possess their land, even unto mount Seir.<a name=418:8></a> The two tribes and a half beyond Jordan enlarged their territories also, and possessed the gates of their enemies, "because they cried unto God".<a name=418:9></a> Afterwards they were carried away captives, because they forsook God.<a name=418:10></a> Thus, although there was neither the power of the king nor the order of the kingdom, yet, wherever there was faith, God blessed those of His people who trusted in Him.<a name=418:11></a>

		which God preserved those heirs of promise, when they went from nation to nation.<a name=425:1></a> The remainder of the psalm is omitted; it speaks historically of the ways of God, with respect to the preservation of His people in Egypt, and of their deliverance thence, to be established in Canaan, that they might observe the statutes of Jehovah; and this part of the psalm would have been unsuitable here, where grace is celebrated in the establishment of the people in power after those statutes had been broken.<a name=425:2></a> The beginning of the psalm celebrates grace towards Israel according to the promises made to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, when the judgments of God are in all the earth.<a name=425:3></a> This is the first thing founded upon the presence of the ark, and the establishment of the throne in Zion.<a name=425:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The verses 23 - 33 are almost the words of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#96">Psalm  96</a>.<a name=425:5></a> It is a call to the heathen to acknowledge Jehovah, whose glory should be declared among all nations.<a name=425:6></a> This psalm belongs to a series of psalms, which, from the first cry of the people until the universal joy of the nations, relate in order all that refers to the bringing again the Firstborn into the world.<a name=425:7></a> Only in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#96">Psalm  96</a>the words, "Say among the heathen that Jehovah reigneth", have a place which gives them a more prophetic character.<a name=425:8></a> Here the joy of the heavens and the earth precedes this message to the heathen, and, instead of saying "his courts", it is said "before him".<a name=425:9></a> The words, "He shall judge the peoples with righteousness", (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:425">footnote</a></i>) are also omitted, as well as the second half of the last verse, which applies this judgment to the world.<a name=425:10></a> Apart from these alterations, which appear to me to give this psalm more of the character of a present joy, these verses correspond with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#96">Psalm  96</a>.<a name=425:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The omission of the judgment of the peoples in righteousness is remarkable.<a name=425:12></a> It is because the subject here is joy, and the grace of deliverance in the establishment of power, with the subsequent government of the earth, and that the nations are called up to Jerusalem to present themselves there before Jehovah.<a name=425:13></a> This is the leading thought.<a name=425:14></a>

		At the close of chapter 16 we see that the king regulates everything that was to be done before the ark, and before the altar which was in the high place at Gibeon (that is to say, for the service of every day before the ark, and for the sacrifices upon the altar); and that he also appointed Levites to praise Jehovah, and to sing that "His mercy endureth for ever".<a name=427:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is touching to see, that the testimony to this precious faithfulness on God's part is not only found in the place where power had set the ark, but there also where the heart of the people needed it meantime, namely, at the altar, which, although the place where the people drew nigh to God, had become after all a testimony to the fallen condition of the people, a tabernacle without the ark.<a name=427:5></a>

		We may also remark here, that the extent of authority which David exercised was very great and of wide bearing.<a name=434:5></a> The whole religious order was reconstructed.<a name=434:6></a> Everything, even to the age of the Levites' service, depends on the authority and regulations of David, as formerly on those of Moses.<a name=434:7></a> All the pattern of the temple, and of its vessels, is given him by inspiration, as that of the tabernacle, and all belonging to it had been given to Moses.<a name=434:8></a> He also introduced singing, and divers musical instruments, which are even called "the musical instruments of God", and which, as well as the singing, had previously formed no part of the public service.<a name=434:9></a> With the exception of the ark, even the various vessels were different from those of the tabernacle; and for each thing the precise weight in gold or in silver was determined by David.<a name=434:10></a>

		God would also associate the people with David in this willing service of the day of His power; and, even as they had been associated with him in his wars and conflicts, there are those who shall be so likewise in the liberality which he manifests towards the house of his God.<a name=434:11></a> They are at a great distance from him, it is true: it is, so to say, a superfluous thing.<a name=434:12></a> They have nothing to do with the wisdom that arranges and prepares, but they are allowed to share in the work.<a name=434:13></a> This favour is granted them, and their goodwill is acceptable to God, and it is also the fruit of His grace.<a name=434:14></a>

		2 CHRONICLES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This Second Book of Chronicles unfolds the reign of the son of David and of the family of David.<a name=436:1></a> It does not commence with the faith of David at the ark, but with the tabernacle that Moses, the servant of Jehovah had set up, and the brazen altar, at which the king and the congregation worshipped.<a name=436:2></a> The kingly power is realised in connection with Israel, the people of God whom Moses brought out of Egypt.<a name=436:3></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:436">footnote</a></i>[a]) It is the means by which the purposes of God with respect to them are accomplished; it is not yet assuredly a new covenant by a new power, but the object of blessing is Israel.<a name=436:4></a> If it is Boaz and Ruth who raise up the family, it is to Naomi that a son is born, that is, through sovereign grace, by a redeemer "in whom is strength": (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:436">footnote</a></i>[b]) one who had no title (and Israel had no more any) is introduced into the enjoyment of the promises.<a name=436:5></a> Israel, long known as the "pleasant one" (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:436">footnote</a></i>[c]) of God, is the people which receives into its bosom the son that is born.<a name=436:6></a> To us, they say, a son is born (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:7">Isaiah  9:7</a>).<a name=436:7></a> At the altar which was before Jehovah in the tabernacle of the congregation Solomon recognises his position.<a name=436:8></a> He is to judge the people of God.<a name=436:9></a> Hereafter all this shall take place in power.<a name=436:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This book presents us also with kingly power in connection with the earth and the government of the people on the earth.<a name=436:11></a> Glory and riches are added to that which Solomon requests.<a name=436:12></a> Neither enemies nor the energy of faith is in question.<a name=436:13></a> The king's position is the result of the victory which that faith had obtained.<a name=436:14></a> He reigns, and is established in glory and in riches.<a name=436:15></a> He begins to build the house.<a name=436:16></a> Hiram acknowledges Jehovah as the Creator of heaven and earth, and the strangers who dwell in Israel are the king's servants to do his work.<a name=436:17></a> In the temple the cherubim have their faces towards the house, that is, outwards.<a name=436:18></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:436">footnote</a></i>[a]) The attributes of God do not now look only at

		the covenant to maintain it in spite of everything, but they also look outwards in order to bless.<a name=437:1></a> It is the time of the millennium; but the veil is here found again in the temple.<a name=437:2></a> Whatever may be the blessing of the true Solomon's reign, Israel and the earth have not immediate and direct access to Him who is hidden in the heavens.<a name=437:3></a> That is our portion, even to enter boldly now through the veil, and to find no veil in heaven: blessed be God!<a name=437:4></a> There is no temple there.<a name=437:5></a> Jehovah God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.<a name=437:6></a> The stability of a divine government is granted to the earth, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:437">footnote</a></i>[b]) and the blessing of a God whose face is turned towards it; but those who are blessed do not behold that face, do not draw nigh unto it.<a name=437:7></a> There is also an altar adapted for worship in a time of such blessing.<a name=437:8></a> The altar and the veil are not mentioned in the Book of Kings, where the structure of the temple is the figure of things not seen, and where, as a whole, it is presented to us as the dwelling-place and manifestation of God.<a name=437:9></a> We are told of a golden door, opening with two leaves, before the oracle, and nothing is said about the altar.<a name=437:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Chronicles the order is arranged also according to the state of things which this book sets before us, that is to say, according to the state of Christ's glorious kingdom.<a name=437:11></a> There is a court for the priests, and the large outer court with doors.<a name=437:12></a> All was arranged (chapter 4: 9) for the relationship of which we speak.<a name=437:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also, as to the manifestation of the glory, nothing is said in the Book of Kings of the public acceptance of the sacrifice; but it is simply stated that when the ark had been carried into the holy place, and the priests were gone out, and the staves of the ark had been drawn out, so that the dwelling of Jehovah was definitively established there, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.<a name=437:14></a> It is God's habitation, a figure of the heavenly dwelling-place which awaits us, our Father's house.<a name=437:15></a> On the other hand, that which is set before us in the Book of Chronicles is God's connection with His people Israel in the last days, prefigured by that which happened to Solomon.<a name=437:16></a> It was when the trumpeters and singers lifted up their voices with one accord to praise Jehovah, saying "His mercy endureth for ever",

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen that there was a second part of grace, the acceptance of Israel as worshippers after their sin -- not only the ark on Mount Zion, but the sacrifice and pardon and consequent worship of Mount Moriah, the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.<a name=438:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Solomon having prayed, and entreated Jehovah that His eyes should be open, and His ears attent to the prayers that should be offered to Him in that place (quoting David's petition in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>, and using His mercies to David as a plea), the fire comes down and consumes the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah fills the house.<a name=438:5></a> And now, it is not only that the priests cannot enter, but the children of Israel behold the glory which rests upon the house; they fall upon their faces and worship.<a name=438:6></a> It is the public acceptance of the sacrifice which sets the people in public connection with God, and makes them confess that "Jehovah is good, and that his mercy endureth for ever" (compare <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#9:24">Leviticus  9:24</a>).<a name=438:7></a> Only in this last passage the acknowledgment of God's unwearied mercy was not the point.<a name=438:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also another element in the scene we are considering, and that is the public and joyful assembly of the whole people, the feast of tabernacles, the great congregation (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:25">Psalm  22:25</a>), and also the dedication of the altar.<a name=438:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are the two things which mark Israel's participation in the blessing, namely, the altar, and the feast of tabernacles; worship subsequent to their fall and ruin, founded on the acceptance of the sacrifice, and the realised effect of the promises, the people being no longer in distress.<a name=438:10></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#43:438">footnote</a></i>[a])
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find again here the musical instruments of Jehovah, which David had made to praise Jehovah, "because his mercy endureth for ever"; when David himself "praised by their ministry" (7: 6); blessed thought!<a name=438:11></a> for who is this David?<a name=438:12></a> (compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:22">Psalm  22:22</a>).<a name=438:13></a> The people saw themselves blessed

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, with respect to Solomon and the seed of David generally, on their faithfulness the blessing of the whole people was to depend.<a name=439:5></a> If the house of David should turn away from God, Israel should be rooted out of the land; and the house, which had been sanctified by the worship of Jehovah, should become a by-word among all nations, and a witness to the just judgment of God.<a name=439:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 8 gives us a few more details of the state of Israel -- a state which prefigures that of the last days.<a name=439:7></a> Solomon brings everything into subjection that could have hindered the full enjoyment of the promised land in its whole extent, whether on the side of Tyre or of Syria.<a name=439:8></a> The strangers in the land continue to pay tribute, and the children of Israel are captains and men of war.<a name=439:9></a> Zion is entirely sanctified, and the worship of Jehovah maintained and honoured by the king.<a name=439:10></a> The service of the house of God, the praises, and the whole order connected therewith, were appointed according to the ordinances of David.<a name=439:11></a> The king's commandment was the absolute rule for everything.<a name=439:12></a> Edom itself was his possession; and, as far as the Red Sea, all were the king's subjects.<a name=439:13></a> The king of Tyre, who represents the Gentile glory of the world, supplied all that he needed to accomplish his designs.<a name=439:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is not only within the borders of the land that the power and glory of Solomon are known.<a name=439:15></a> His fame spreads among the heathen, even to distant lands; and the queen of Sheba comes to bring him her tribute of admiration, and the precious things of the Gentiles, who thus contribute to the splendour and glory of the place chosen by God, whose light had come, and upon which the glory of Jehovah had risen (in type doubtless for the moment, but according to the principle of grace, and by the power that will fully accomplish it, according to the counsels of God).<a name=439:16></a> It is a glory, the report of which attracts the nations, but which, when seen, surpasses all that could be said of it; and which one must be near to appreciate.<a name=439:17></a> It is a glory that excels all that the world has seen, a wisdom
