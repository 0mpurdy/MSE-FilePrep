		REFLECTIONS UPON THE PROPHETIC INQUIRY AND THE VIEWS ADVANCED IN IT¦

	<div class="paragraph">
		"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book," <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:18">Revelation  22:18</a>, 19.<a name=1:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The existing circumstances of the Church of God seem to call upon those who earnestly desire its welfare, not to hold back from expressing that which may, in any way, tend to the strengthening of faith and healing those divisions which, while they destroy charity, and the fellowship one with another that is proper to walking in the light, weaken the testimony which is held out to the unconverted, or to the inquirer, of the everlasting truth of God.<a name=1:2></a> It appears to me that, on the subject of prophecy (divisions on which now shame godliness), both those who hold and those who strenuously oppose views, which, for convenience' sake, we may call Millenarian, are deeply culpable.<a name=1:3></a> Many have written on one side and the other ignorant of each other's views, and precipitate and unwarranted in their inferences from them; and, while those who hold the views of prophecy, which have occasioned the controversy, have indulged in language utterly inconsistent with the spirit of their Master, those who are unconvinced by them, though charging this exclusively on the Millenarians, are themselves, it appears to me, in no way free from blame.<a name=1:4></a> Superciliousness, distrust, and animosity, not perhaps so distinctly expressed, because new views are generally the most active and forward, but quite as evil in their character and spirit, have marked their conduct and language; while those who sought instruction, and to whom the others were debtors for it, have been hindered, perplexed, and repelled in their inquiries by the selfish precipitancy of the one and presuming ignorance of many connected with them, and the uncandid

		uninquiring rejection and denouncement of the other.<a name=2:1></a> There is no one at all observant of what is now existing, and interested in the strengthening of humble souls, but must feel the culpable responsibility in which many leaders of the professing church are involved.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are some observations I would make on these subjects, being convinced of the extreme precipitancy in which many have written upon them; and I think that in such a time (though I am persuaded the purposes of God will eventually result, and His glory be manifested in our weakness), there should be a disposition to try more maturely the soundness of our views and statements alleged to be from Scripture, before truth and the value of the sacred Scriptures themselves are brought into question, perplexity, and disgrace, by the presumptuous and hasty pursuit, not of scriptural truth, but of our own untried thoughts, given out to a greedy public, glad of novelty, which has no requisition of sanctification attached to it, and ready to neglect their own souls for unfounded and idle speculations.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, it is equally certain that the Scriptures of God have not been written to no purpose; that, as His provision for His saints, the prophetic like all other parts of them have a sanctifying, strengthening and directing influence.<a name=2:4></a> What God thought it worth while to order and arrange, as ministering to the ends of His glory and man's participation in it, and to reveal (that is, to communicate, to man), as that in which He is concerned, must be surely worth while for man to inquire into and be informed of; and they seem guilty of presumption who would arraign the value and importance of what God thought fit to reveal.<a name=2:5></a> The fact of God's revelation to one who knows what God is (in a word, to a believer) is demonstrative evidence of its vast importance and his interest in it; and when it comes from God to man, is man to say it is not of importance?<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These truly are the themes which have called forth most the admiration and praise of those who have seen God in them; nor can any one believe rightly in His saving love, who is not deeply interested in the manner by which its results are accomplished.<a name=2:7></a> The argument that prophecy is only available as an evidence of revelation after its fulfilment, not to reason upon general grounds, seems to have little weight.<a name=2:8></a> All the prophecies testify of facts which require a certain line of conduct,

		at or previous to their fulfilment; and though they are evidence of themselves as a revelation, and of the value of the prophesied fact, there are few instances of this being of importance after their fulfilment.<a name=3:1></a> Besides, many of them unequivocally relate to the closing period of the world; and it would be hard to say of what avail these could be for the purpose stated.<a name=3:2></a> And further, almost all which are considered as fulfilled prophecies by those who use this argument, were expressly delivered as testimonies to the consciences of men immediately concerned in them, previously to their fulfilments.<a name=3:3></a> Will any one say, that the directions of our Lord to His disciples were of no interest, and not important to be understood previous to the destruction of Jerusalem, and merely that that destruction might accredit His testimony?<a name=3:4></a> Were Jeremiah's urgent remonstrances and warnings not to be inquired into before the Chaldeans took the city; and shall it be said that the solemn testimony to Israel put them under no responsibility, but were useless declamations, till the kings of Assyria had been the means of burying them in yet unveiled oblivion?<a name=3:5></a> There seems to be something of infidelity in all this.<a name=3:6></a> Or do they argue that God is less concerned in the Church now, or that the Lord now will not do good, neither will He do evil?<a name=3:7></a> Besides, they leave, arguing in the present time, a large scope of prophecy unfulfilled, which manifestly cannot be of any direct avail subsequent to its fulfilment; and yet they would afford us no assignable cause why it has been revealed at all.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But they say it does not tend to sanctification.<a name=3:9></a> But man is not a judge of this; he would still be sanctifying the Church his own way.<a name=3:10></a> I am persuaded that God never revealed anything without a sanctifying purpose; for His nature is holy, His purpose holiness; and I believe the sober and holy study of the word of God, as such, in His fear, will concentrate the affections upon Him, separate from the world, and give enlarged views of His kingdom, wisdom, and glory, peculiarly calculated to sink in our estimation this world -- its glory, its strength; and to fix our minds on the Lamb's glory.<a name=3:11></a> There is in fact in these objections a tendency to depreciate the purposes of God in Scripture, to preserve the importance of man's little sphere of views.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, the extreme precipitancy with which the subject has been taken up has led -- which has given occasion to this part of the charge -- to unjust estimate of the

		use, and value, and seasonable application of those truths.<a name=4:1></a> Men have sought to please themselves, instead of edifying themselves or their neighbours.<a name=4:2></a> Let men either inquire humbly, or use God's word to God's purposes, or else refrain from seeking to affect the minds of others.<a name=4:3></a> Loquacity or forwardness on religious subjects is a great hindrance to real edification.<a name=4:4></a> "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God," as those who have something to say on God's behalf, or else use the modesty which becomes those who only seek for truth.<a name=4:5></a> One other complaint is to be made against those who oppose these views, and it is a serious one.<a name=4:6></a> Instead of weighing what has been advanced by others in the spirit of serious inquiry, separating the chaff from the wheat, and willing to see the use which God might make of their brethren's testimony; jealous of the tone which they assumed, and hurt by their charges against them, they irritably threw the whole of their views overboard, without inquiring what the scripture itself said upon the subject; and then, to justify themselves, endeavoured all they could to shew, in the darkest colours, every part of the system, and bring up reasons against the whole.<a name=4:7></a> But if there be any truth in these things, they are defrauding themselves, and it is a poor compensation to prove their brethren wrong.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In many things, alas!<a name=4:9></a> we are divided enough -- enough exposed to the enemy not to be opposed to one another in our very hopes.<a name=4:10></a> Surely they should give some just sense, if they think those to whom they are opposed in the wrong.<a name=4:11></a> For my own part, if I were bound to receive all that has been said by the Millenarians, I would reject the whole system; but their views and statements weigh with me not one feather.<a name=4:12></a> But this does not hinder me from inquiring by the teaching of the same Spirit (which in measure, I believe, directed them) what God has with infinite graciousness revealed to me concerning His dealings with the Church.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I confess I think the modern writers on prophecy justly chargeable with following their own thoughts hastily, and far too much removed from the control of Scripture.<a name=4:14></a> They have got some general view, perhaps sound, of God's purpose.<a name=4:15></a> They take some text or prophecy as a starting point, pursue the suggestions of their own minds in connection with their general views previously adopted, but leave the results almost entirely untried by the direct testimony of the word, affording

		us theories, often enlarging when by a writer much imbued with Scripture, often of general soundness of view though replete with false statements: but, when not by such a writer, diverging into absurdities calculated to awaken the impatience of many and bring the truth of all into dishonour.<a name=5:1></a> In the meanwhile the Church is distracted.<a name=5:2></a> There is not a single writer whose writings I have seen (unless it be the author of one short inquiry) who is not chargeable with this fault.<a name=5:3></a> Some of the most confident really call for much reprobation.<a name=5:4></a> But good, I am persuaded, will grow out of it; and the very difficulties will call, under God's Spirit, the attention of the faithful servant of God: and while the precipitancy of the others will be repressed by the distinct manifestation of the error into which it has led them and the calm statement of truth, they who have hitherto rejected even inquiry will yield themselves to much which they have scorned, and be humbled both to the acknowledgment of a common truth and the spiritual sincerity of many against whom they have been bitter, because they could not convince them, when in truth it was their own fault.<a name=5:5></a> I would call upon the servants of God to pray that He would guide and direct His church by His Spirit in these things in sober and subdued meekness, and it will surely be led into all truth.<a name=5:6></a> I shall take notice (with this feeling) of some things which seem to me illustrative of the unguarded, unscriptural statements many of which, I think, have dishonoured Scripture, and been spoken ignorantly: and I shall, secondly, propose some ground of inquiry, to those who have hitherto repudiated these views.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These views trench upon many habits in which religious teachers have for the most part been formed -- many views in which they have long had their boast.<a name=5:8></a> No man likes to give up these: their relative consequence is lost; it is distinguishing to oppose them.<a name=5:9></a> "No man, having drunk old wine, straightway desireth new, for he saith, the old is better.<a name=5:10></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:39">Luke  5:39</a>.<a name=5:11></a> Many of the subjects mentioned in the foregoing pages are of themselves of deep interest, such as the use of prophecy generally, and materially affecting the present views of men upon the subject; but it has not been attempted to dwell upon them at length here: other occasions, or a better instrument, perhaps may draw them out into more useful and instructive relief.<a name=5:12></a> My object is unpretending and simple, and I pursue it at once: it has been some time on my mind, though withheld hitherto.<a name=5:13></a>

		The observations on the "<i>resurrection from among the dead</i>," published in the <i>Christian Examiner</i> (sound in criticism, and temperate in spirit, and calculated to be useful) point out an instance of the extreme carelessness with which bold statements are made by writers on these subjects: but having been there discussed, I omit it here.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is an error of another kind, small in importance, perhaps, because of obvious correction, but illustrative of the way in which men inconsiderately make statements, when they fall in with their system, in the face of the simplest testimony of Scripture itself.<a name=6:2></a> In the third and fourth sermons on Daniel's vision of the four beasts and of the Son of man, by Mr.<a name=6:3></a> Irving, Zephaniah is stated to have prophesied before the carrying away of Israel captive; and it is assumed that they carried the book of that prophet to Nineveh, whereby Nineveh would know of its threatened judgments.<a name=6:4></a> The prophet addressed Judah alone, and expressly states that he prophesied in the reign of Josiah (that is, about one hundred years after the carrying away of Israel captive).<a name=6:5></a> The reason of the statement is, to shew that God gave testimony to Nineveh and her king, before He judged them.<a name=6:6></a> He certainly had done so previously by Jonah.<a name=6:7></a> The idea is a very laudable one; but, running away with it, we have the following passage in page 92: "Yet God suffered not such a city to perish without witnesses, but raised certain of the captivity to the highest offices in his kingdom," etc.<a name=6:8></a> "There can be no doubt, also, that the prophecies of Nahum and of Zephaniah, which almost solely concern the judgment upon Nineveh, and which were given before the captivity of Israel, were carried with the captives into Nineveh, and there more or less circulated amongst the Ninevites, and especially brought to the knowledge of the king himself; for God is very merciful," etc.<a name=6:9></a> They say much of taking Scripture as it presents itself.<a name=6:10></a> Who could suppose that all that concerned Nineveh in the prophecy of Zephaniah was three verses, bringing it in amongst the many other countries which were to be destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar -- the whole book being concerning him, Jerusalem, its present evil, and future hopes; and this, as we have said, a century after Israel was carried into captivity!<a name=6:11></a> We take it as shewing the extreme neglect of Scripture and <i>even</i> prophecy itself, the hurried pursuit of an object in the mind, something brought in at random to illustrate it, without any reference or mature

		weighing, whether it is really borne out by Scripture.<a name=7:1></a> I think the interpretation of Isaiah in the same page erroneous, and the occasion of the error the same: but as this might seem to involve interpretation, I do not say anything of it, though I think the case perfectly clear, and that the simple reading of prophecy will evince the total inapplicability of the alleged meaning.<a name=7:2></a> Another instance, upon which it is not proposed to dwell, but mentioned as occurring in the same book, is in a long dissertation to shew that the Greek empire was set up in order to give prevalence to the Greek language, which, though a collateral result, is, I think, a very confined view, and in itself exhibits the absorption of mind into its present idea, which I complain of as so injurious, and, in the case of Scripture, so very culpable; but it is there stated, that our Lord and His apostles always quote from the Septuagint.<a name=7:3></a> This is not the fact, as has been fully shewn.<a name=7:4></a>

		Again, in the translator's preliminary discourse to Ben-Ezra, we have (page 55), "And to this effect I understand <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:1">Romans  8:1</a>, 'There is no condemnation' <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:1">Romans  8:1</a> (<i>krisis</i>, i.<a name=7:5></a>e.<a name=7:6></a> judgment)," etc.<a name=7:7></a> The word is <i>katakrima</i> without a single various reading in Wetstein or Griesbach.<a name=7:8></a> Doubtless he had in mind <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>, where it is <i>krisis</i>.<a name=7:9></a> If this were an isolated act of inadvertency, it might be well passed over; but it is evidence, and accumulated evidence, of great carelessness.<a name=7:10></a> And it is adduced on this account, that it is introduced by the author as determining the sense of an important passage, to which, at the time of stating it, it is evident, he could not have referred; not merely from the mistake itself, but because the whole passage (and this is the point I would urge) bears in a long train of argument upon subjects totally unconnected with the one upon which he is arguing, and in which <i>krisis</i>, in his view of it, would have no place or object.<a name=7:11></a> That which we advert to is not the casual mistake, but the drawing in a whole passage into a purpose beside its object, through absorption of mind, into one particular view.<a name=7:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must say that this is a most unholy mis-statement of Scripture, and destructive of that which is the glory and influential power, as well of the resurrection of the saints, as of their present hopes; and that, if the Lord's presence be not a paramount blessing, prevailing over death now, it never will be at the resurrection, or at any other time.<a name=9:5></a> It shews the folly of man in his thoughts; for, in attempting to shew the importance of his views above another's, the sole thing which is of power in those very views and can alone realise them is undermined and destroyed, and this in the face of the fullest and most anxious statements of Scripture, and to the dishonour of Christ and the faith of the saints of God.<a name=9:6></a> Satan reigns by death; Christ has brought life and immortality to light by the gospel.<a name=9:7></a> And to argue from the circumstances of His death is folly; for it was because He so suffered, and (having overcome in full conflict with the very power under which it is here stated we rest) rose again into glory, that we have not that trial, that we are delivered and triumph, and that its power is past away towards us.<a name=9:8></a> The observations from the Apocalypse are a total misapprehension of its force.<a name=9:9></a> This might call for much and varied animadversion; but my object is not to condemn or accuse (God forbid that it should be!<a name=9:10></a>) but precisely the contrary.<a name=9:11></a> But these are the sort of statements which have awakened the impatience of observant Christians, and occasioned a natural, though indeed an unjust prejudice against the persons who hold those views they are urged in maintenance of, and a hasty rejection (still more foolish) of the views themselves.<a name=9:12></a> For in this they are making themselves servants to the unguarded precipitancy of others, not judges of it, and masters of the truths which they confound with so many mis-statements.<a name=9:13></a>

		But it must be confessed, it is a bold word to say, that when Christ said to the thief on the cross, "To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:43">Luke  23:43</a> -- that which made Paul always confident, giving him, upon the common faith of God's people, a desire to depart -- that what the Lord comforted and assured the thief with, and the apostle built on, was, "a day of death, from sight of which the soul shrinketh, and a void beyond it, so vacant and unintelligible, as not to be available for any distinct end of faith, hope, edification, or comfort.<a name=10:2></a>" "And this notion of blessedness with Christ, upon our leaving this tabernacle, is a vague notion which Satan hath substituted.<a name=10:3></a>" Christ substituted it as something nearer to the dying thief, when he proposed that on which the writer so much insists; and it was because it was a distant hope, and there would have been a vague void without this revelation, that we were given the assurance that that was revealed in great mercy, which is thus now thrown to the dogs.<a name=10:4></a> The hope of the individual is being with Christ; the hope of the church is His coming: doubtless the individual is deeply interested in this hope likewise.<a name=10:5></a> On the whole, throughout this preface, Christ's present glory is not duly seen, nor its perception by the believer as manifested by Him, as it is not to the world.<a name=10:6></a>

		Not to lengthen out the statement of these general principles, nor to enter upon a disquisition on the slowness of man's heart to believe, I proceed to the consideration of the question raised, as to <i>days</i> meaning <i>years</i>.<a name=33:9></a> And first, I would remark, that the question seems to me to have been very imperfectly discussed.<a name=33:10></a> To adduce the evidence of <i>Lexicons</i> was not well either in the <i>Morning Watch</i> or by R.<a name=33:11></a>D.<a name=33:12></a>, as they contain no evidence of weight, but a mere statement of the thing inquired into, given as a meaning, because so <i>supposed</i> in the passage in question.<a name=33:13></a> This, therefore, I dismiss, after observing (with a view to mark the extent to which this confusion, between use and meaning, may be carried) the quotation of R.<a name=33:14></a>D.<a name=33:15></a> from the <i>Critici Sacri</i>, which is made to prove that it means years, as well as weeks of days.<a name=33:16></a> "<i>Hoe hebdomades intelligentur de annis</i>.<a name=33:17></a>" (The force of the word <i>Hebdomades</i> is as well known to be seven days as the word <i>week</i> in English.<a name=33:18></a>) Such a quotation as "<i>These weeks are understood of years</i>" would be strange evidence in proof of the English term "week" meaning seven years, as much as it does seven days!<a name=33:19></a> But let this pass.<a name=33:20></a> Again, R.<a name=33:21></a>D.<a name=33:22></a> says he does not understand certain assertions made in the <i>Morning Watch</i>.<a name=33:23></a> Now though I mistrust, as R.<a name=33:24></a>D.<a name=33:25></a> does, my knowledge of Hebrew, these seem to me perfectly intelligible, though, at the same time, to have been advanced so entirely without inquiry as to throw considerable discredit upon the assertor of them.<a name=33:26></a>

		The assertion is this, that "Seven (the numeral) and its derivatives are always feminine": therefore he would conclude against Mr.<a name=34:1></a> M.<a name=34:2></a> that seven days (<i>shabeth yomim</i>) may, indeed, stand for a week, but that his reasoning can have no application to <i>seventy</i> (<i>shibim</i>), which, as the numeral is always feminine, cannot mean seven years as well as days.<a name=34:3></a> Now, the passage in Daniel ought to have kept him from such a mistake; for he is proving that <i>shibim</i> cannot be a numeral, because it is masculine, in a passage in which the very word confessedly means <i>seventy</i>!<a name=34:4></a> Strange, indeed, must be the structure of the mind, when it can produce reason in the Hebrew for seventy weeks, to shew, as to the second, that it cannot be a numeral, because it is masculine, when the first was admitted to be seventy!<a name=34:5></a> -- the points, if referred to, not affecting the question of the masculine termination.<a name=34:6></a> On the other hand, Mr.<a name=34:7></a> M.<a name=34:8></a> is without ground of inquiry; for if the Hebrew word have no technical or conventional meaning, it would not be sevens at all, according to the Hebrew idiom, but seventy; so that we must admit the conventional meaning, and inquire what it is.<a name=34:9></a> But to shew the carelessness of the assertion of the <i>Morning Watch</i> in this, we may remark, besides the contradiction in the very passage in question itself, that the masculine form is constantly used for seven.<a name=34:10></a> At a distance from books, and exceedingly engaged, I would yet, from cursory reference to Scripture, mention the following:

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two or three principles which I would lay down in proceeding to the more general consideration of the question before us.<a name=35:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, in prophecy, when the Jewish church or nation (exclusive of the Gentile parenthesis in their history) is concerned, i.<a name=35:11></a>e.<a name=35:12></a>, when the address is directly to the Jews, there we may look for a plain and direct testimony, because earthly things were the Jews' proper portion.<a name=35:13></a> And, on the contrary, where the address is to the Gentiles, i.<a name=35:14></a>e.<a name=35:15></a>, when the Gentiles are concerned in it, there we may look for symbol, because earthly things were not their portion, and the system of revelation must to them be symbolical.<a name=35:16></a> When therefore facts are addressed to the Jewish church as a subsisting body, as to what concerns themselves, I look for a plain, common-sense, literal statement, as to a people with whom GOD had <i>direct</i> dealings upon earth, and to whom He meant His purposes concerning them to be known.<a name=35:17></a> On the other hand, as the church was a system of grace and heavenly hopes (though GOD indeed overruled by providence in respect of His ultimate purposes concerning it, it was neither the visible object of His dealings upon earth, nor had an admitted interest in, though acted on by them), it is addressed by an exhibition of their moral character, and is symbolised by analogous agencies.<a name=35:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=36>[Page 36]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, intimately connected with this (because the history of the Bible is the history of the Jews -- for history is the relation of facts on earth, of which the Jews are the portion of GOD'S agency and as to whom we know it was ordered), is another principle, viz.<a name=36:1></a>, that wherever Scripture affords the history of a fact, there we may expect it to be distinctly and literally declared or predicted in prophecy.<a name=36:2></a> When the Scriptures do not extend to the giving the history (which is evidently the case after the fact of the restoration of the Jews from Babylon, save the fact of the Lord's coming to offer Himself, and perhaps we may add the outpouring of the Spirit), then we must expect it to be declared only symbolically, i.<a name=36:3></a>e.<a name=36:4></a>, appropriately in its moral character; and hence, partly, the partial obscurity of the seventy weeks of Daniel, because they were no regular recognised portion of the Jewish history, but a sort of anomalous period for the coming of the Lord.<a name=36:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, the Spirit loves to contemplate the desolation of the Jewish people -- the prevalence of necessary wrath -- and, by consequence, mercy on the believing remnant of the seed of the Lord -- as but for a moment; and hence the reason why it is shortened into days.<a name=36:6></a> To one familiar with Scripture and the expression of GOD'S mind and feelings, then, no proof, save appeal to themselves, need be made of this: it is an interesting, and, may I add, affecting circumstance of considerate kindness.<a name=36:7></a> He avenges speedily, though He bear long with them, as it might seem, and we are not to learn why He so bears.<a name=36:8></a> We know what to count it.<a name=36:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The proof then that prophecies of literal days have been fulfilled in literal days, and that years have been prophesied of as years, would prove nothing as to the prophecy in question; for first, if the principles above laid down be correct, the difference is accounted for; and, in the next place, a prophecy confessedly literal (for its literal accomplishment is given, or the days may mean years, and the proof fails) can be no evidence of the meaning of the word when used typically and confessedly in a symbolical prophecy.<a name=36:10></a> Their meaning days in such a case would be a positive anomaly, just as much as their <i>not</i> meaning days in the other; for they are used here manifestly in a symbolical way, and all their accomplishments are symbolical.<a name=36:11></a> The question is not, therefore, whether a day ever means a day, when used in Scripture or in prophecy, confessedly literally expressed (as evidenced by a literal fulfilment, evincing
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=37>[Page 37]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that meaning), but what is its force, when used as a symbol in a confessedly symbolical prophecy?<a name=37:1></a> The consideration of the mind of GOD, as adverted to in the third principle afore stated, will give us a full apprehension of the reason of the statement, when we consider the value too it was to the Church -- the principle of the "yet a little while," and the moral gap unfilled up by any events which made the time included in the 1260 years of this prophecy.<a name=37:2></a> As to the event not satisfying us in fulfilment, neither did the Lord's coming; and I would remark that there is no remarkable event of such external magnitude in the world's eye as to fix the mind on its evident fulfilment; and as to the former, to this day the terms of the seventy weeks are as much discussed and in the dark as the 1260 years, save that we, by habitual belief, have recognised Jesus the Lord, as the Messiah.<a name=37:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=37:4></a> therefore is not right as to two believers in revelation not disagreeing in the broad features of the seventy weeks.<a name=37:5></a> We could not disagree as to Jesus being Messiah, or we should not be believers at all, and Daniel names the Messiah as the terminating epoch; though in this all interpreters are not agreed, but carry it on to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans; but as to the rest, no two independent thinkers, hardly, agree in their computation -- some of learning at this day, going back to Cyrus's decree, and cutting off a century in mass from the ordinary dates of the Persian history.<a name=37:6></a> R.<a name=37:7></a>D.<a name=37:8></a> would find also that in Hebrew (though I say not that the idiom is precise), <i>yamim, days</i>, is also used for a year, and from year to year, as evidently in other passages, so evidenced to be in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#1:3">1 Samuel  1:3</a>,7.<a name=37:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would further remark, that the passage from Ezekiel is not so without force, as is supposed, when the real question (too much overlooked by R.<a name=37:10></a>D.<a name=37:11></a>) is considered, viz.<a name=37:12></a>, the typical or symbolical force of a day; for then we have a symbolical action indicative of years, defined in time, marked by the term days, so that as to the principle of symbolical diction, it is an expressive instance; and the other case, though not so strong, is analogous and confirmatory.<a name=37:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now, having considered the ground on which such a symbol stands, consider the instances in which it is used.<a name=37:14></a> If R.<a name=37:15></a>D.<a name=37:16></a> affirms that the use of the term month is entirely distinct from that of day, and that there is no argumentative identity with the statements in Revelation before him, I shall
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=38>[Page 38]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		not argue the point.<a name=38:1></a> I do not say that there is no reason for difference -- for I am inclined to think that there is, and perhaps see the reason of such difference, in some degree.<a name=38:2></a> But as to the limit of time, to me it is obvious they are identical.<a name=38:3></a> If so, contrary to the assertion of R.<a name=38:4></a>D.<a name=38:5></a>, we have a prophecy in which such an enumeration of days for years is agreed on by all commentators (amongst the Protestants at least), namely, the continuance of the conquests of the Saracenic comet.<a name=38:6></a> I suppose there is no prophecy in Scripture which, as far as commentators go, has been more uniformly interpreted, or universally acquiesced in by inquirers at large.<a name=38:7></a> Nor am I disposed to think, that the Euphratean horsemen are less susceptible of determinate calculation of time, though I admit the date has not been received with equal uniformity.<a name=38:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now consider the same symbols in Daniel.<a name=38:9></a> I certainly am disposed to think that the term <i>times</i> in <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#4:16">Daniel  4:16</a>,23,25,32, used as to Nebuchadnezzar, has reference to the bestial dominion in the world; and the language of Scripture as to the dominion of Nebuchadnezzar so tallies with the rightful dominion of Christ as to confirm this idea, but it is impracticable to pursue this here, nor does it affect the present inquiry sufficiently directly to claim definitive investigation.<a name=38:10></a> As to "time, times, and dividing of a time," we have this distinctly referred to the power before which the three horns fell; that is, we have three times and a half, or 1260 days, ascribed to the little horn which rose up behind, or amongst, the three horns (of which I believe there never has been any doubt in applying it to the Papal power); and there is a particular characteristic to be observed in him -- that he is to make war with the saints and to prevail against them, wearing them out -- a statement which I do not find applicable to the final apostasy.<a name=38:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then we have evidence of this expression being used as a symbol, contrasted, as in distinct perspective of some long continuance of time, during which there is a prevailing power wearing out the saints of the Most High; not in its character of infidel apostasy, leading all forward, but in its specific one of casting down three horns.<a name=38:12></a> Again, I apprehend, the end of the vision must be accounted from the commencement of its subject matter, and its computation must be (when the time is referable to a particular fact within the prophecy) from the date of that fact; or otherwise (when the vision is said to continue), from the commencement of its subject matter
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=39>[Page 39]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		generally.<a name=39:1></a> If this be so, we have a date of 2,300 or 2,400 days (the readings differ) as the continuance of Daniel's vision of the ram and the he-goat, with its territorial reference to the covenant of Israel.<a name=39:2></a> And accordingly he says, "Shut up the vision, for it shall be for many days.<a name=39:3></a>" <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#8:26">Daniel  8:26</a>.<a name=39:4></a> If this be not a just reasoning, the passage must apply to the possession of Jerusalem by its last enemy for upwards of six years -- an interpretation which does not seem to me to coincide with the tenor of scriptural declaration; nor do I think it consistent with the genealogy of the little horn, which would then mean the power or person vulgarly called Antichrist.<a name=39:5></a> We have therefore again the term of days used for a long continuous period, ending in the cleansing of the sanctuary, and brought into perspective before the mind of the Spirit to the prophet, and thus shortened in its symbolical expression.<a name=39:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		We may now proceed to the passages in the Revelation.<a name=39:13></a> Does R.<a name=39:14></a>D.<a name=39:15></a> believe that the Lord Jesus meant the church of Smyrna to have tribulation just "ten days" literally, or ten years?<a name=39:16></a> We have already adverted to the Saracenic and Euphratean invasions, which he would find difficult to interpret on his literal system.<a name=39:17></a> The next is, that the holy city should be given to the Gentiles 42 months (the well-known period of 1260 days, a symbolical prophecy, and containing in the term evidence of some unliteral meaning).<a name=39:18></a> In the meanwhile the witnesses are to prophesy 1260 days, more appropriately thus marked, because it shewed not merely its continuance but its constancy also.<a name=39:19></a> This, be it observed, is something previous to the seventh trumpet; and, however the date may be disagreed on, I undertake to say that, as to the subject-matter, no prophecy in Scripture has received more uniformity of interpretation.<a name=39:20></a> And, observe, it ends by their being slain by the beast out of the bottomless pit.<a name=39:21></a> Now in chapter 13 We have a beast who continues precisely the same period, recognised

		to be in power (under the form of the ten horns being crowned, i.<a name=40:1></a>e.<a name=40:2></a>, the Roman Empire in its divided state) by the northern nations under the papacy, as may be plainly seen in chapter 17.<a name=40:3></a> Take these things together and we see -- not to advert to the three days and a half -- a connection with Babylon and the papacy during these periods, which brings them, in addition to the difficulty of making days symbols of days, to be a continuous period when the woman rides the beast (not, is devoured by the horns), and therefore is a continuous period of some such length as is generally supposed.<a name=40:4></a> In a word, we may, I think, state it thus: The mystery of Babylon and the papacy have no place in the prophets, or the 1260 days mean years.<a name=40:5></a> A difficulty in date does not affect the moral evidence of the subject-matter of the prophecy; for difficulties may lie at the door of ignorance as well as inconsistency.<a name=40:6></a>

		It would be inconvenient here to enter into further detail.<a name=40:7></a> The true question to be discussed is, whether the papacy, as such, has any place in the prophetic writings or not, or merely infidelity.<a name=40:8></a> If it has, it appears to me that no doubt remains on the question; but I refuse no light on its special application to the last infidel state, though I deprecate a morbid disposition to apply all things to our own times.<a name=40:9></a> I rejoice, however, in the discussion, not merely in that it will throw light on Scripture by consequent research and inquiry, but that I am persuaded that this will lead more (for such I believe to be the truth) to the deep conviction that we are within the verge of the end of all, so as to be daily looking for the Lord, i.<a name=40:10></a>e.<a name=40:11></a>, to be caught up to meet Him in the air in order to His judging of the nations.<a name=40:12></a> Amen.<a name=40:13></a> Amen.<a name=40:14></a>

		Sir, -- In your number of this month, which has only come to my hand today, a correspondent, who subscribes himself J.<a name=41:2></a> N.<a name=41:3></a> Darby, begins his letter with saying, "The following remarks on the statements of Mr.<a name=41:4></a> Maitland in the <i>Morning Watch</i>, and of R.<a name=41:5></a>D.<a name=41:6></a> in the <i>Christian Examiner</i>, were written in short intervals of constant occupation.<a name=41:7></a>"

		Without wishing to trespass on your pages, with a defence of statements which I have made, or of the statements of R.<a name=41:8></a>D.<a name=41:9></a>, which I have not seen, will you allow me to say that I never made any statement in the <i>Morning Watch</i>, having never written anything in that work?<a name=41:10></a> I should be sorry to suspect your correspondent unjustly, but I cannot help thinking that he knows my statements principally, if not entirely, from the Review in the <i>Morning Watch</i>; and with regard to the prophecy of the Seventy Weeks, only from a garbled and falsified extract contained in that Review.<a name=41:11></a> I am driven to this suspicion, not only by his mode of referring to my statement, which I have already noticed, but from his saying -- 'On the other hand, Mr.<a name=41:12></a> M.<a name=41:13></a> is without ground of inquiry; for if the Hebrew word <i>shibim</i> have no technical or conventional meaning, it would not be sevens according to the Hebrew idiom at all, but seventy; so that we must admit the conventional meaning and inquire what it is.<a name=41:14></a>' If your correspondent had read my first Inquiry, he would have seen that I did admit a conventional meaning, and shewed by several references that the Misnic writers used <i>sheba</i> to signify the space of time between one sabbatical year and another: a fact which the Reviewer in the <i>Morning Watch</i> did not think proper to notice.<a name=41:15></a>

		The principal occasion of Mr.<a name=42:5></a> Maitland's letter is a mistake occasioned by an unnoticed defect of a stop (I dare say in my manuscript), which should have been supplied thus: "of Mr.<a name=42:6></a> Maitland; in the <i>Morning Watch</i>; and of R.<a name=42:7></a>D.<a name=42:8></a>", instead of "Mr.<a name=42:9></a> Maitland in the <i>Morning Watch</i>, and of R.<a name=42:10></a>D.<a name=42:11></a>", etc.<a name=42:12></a> Indeed, no one, I should have thought, could have made the mistake; for the article in the <i>Morning Watch</i> is written <i>against</i> Mr.<a name=42:13></a> M.<a name=42:14></a>, and treats him with considerable slight.<a name=42:15></a> I had read both of Mr.<a name=42:16></a> M.<a name=42:17></a>'s pamphlets or Inquiries.<a name=42:18></a> It is very possible my paper (in the <i>Christian Herald</i>) does not take adequate notice of them; and I have not them with me now to refer to; but the principal argument and the evidence from the passage in Leviticus remain untouched.<a name=42:19></a> If you are disposed, I shall be glad to revert to it, as with a mind entirely open on the subject.<a name=42:20></a> I feel it one of great interest, and shall be very glad to receive all the light I can from Mr.<a name=42:21></a> M.<a name=42:22></a>, or anyone else, there or elsewhere.<a name=42:23></a> R.<a name=42:24></a>D.<a name=42:25></a> was the immediate object of my paper, which occasioned the less reference to Mr.<a name=42:26></a> M.<a name=42:27></a>, for whom I have really every respect, and from whom I should be very glad to learn.<a name=42:28></a> I should, however, confine my inquiry certainly to the scriptural sense of the word as evidence, even though I examined other things brought forward.<a name=42:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am surprised Mr.<a name=42:30></a> M.<a name=42:31></a> did not see what the first passage he quotes meant; as the article in the <i>Morning Watch</i> (or rather articles) is not only written against him, but is accompanied by a note accounting for their refusal (as I recollect) to insert Mr.<a name=42:32></a> M.<a name=42:33></a>'s reply to themselves, so that even if I had not read Mr.<a name=42:34></a> M.<a name=42:35></a>'s books, or the <i>Morning Watch</i> either, I (or anyone else) must have been of a strange constitution of mind to think that article was Mr.<a name=42:36></a> Maitland's.<a name=42:37></a>

		ON THE EXTENDED SCOPE OF PROPHECY
	</div>

		(From the <i>Christian Witness</i>, Plymouth, January, 1834.<a name=43:1></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that the result of prophecy has been much obscured, and particular passages much more difficult of interpretation, by narrowing their scope and applying them only to the anti-christian character of the last primary evil.<a name=43:2></a> Hence, the subject being wrongly assumed, the application has been forced and unknown.<a name=43:3></a> The anti-christian form of the Roman empire engrosses the mind, so that even when prophecy is applied to the Jews, nothing further is seen.<a name=43:4></a> But this is a confined view; <i>all</i> the nations of the earth are engaged in this scene.<a name=43:5></a> Thus Gog the chief prince of Magog, and his army and followers, formed no part of the Roman empire.<a name=43:6></a> The Medes and Persians formed no part of that empire; yet all these do form a part of the great prophetic drama of the latter day.<a name=43:7></a> I purposely refrain from entering into details here; if I am permitted, I hope to open out my views upon it, at some future time.<a name=43:8></a> I merely now make these few remarks, in the hope of enlarging the sphere of observation.<a name=43:9></a> The immediate moral position in which we are, may involve us in direct concern with the last exhibition of power of the Roman beast, even Antichrist, destined, I do not doubt, to close the scene and his career in Jerusalem -- the mountain of God, where he has, craftily and to his own destruction, set his seat.<a name=43:10></a> But this is but one out of many.<a name=43:11></a> He thus becomes one, the first (I apprehend) of those powers, who, round the great centre of divine providence, the Jewish land, are brought, as the inhabitants of the earth, under the judicial process of that righteous providence which shall set the Son of man on the throne of the kingdom of the earth, in the righteousness and peace of God's own government in Him.<a name=43:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the full moral responsibilities of the Christian Church, the apostasy and judgment of the anti-Christian power is clear and decided, as well as solemn and affecting to the believer, but deliverance and joy withal.<a name=43:13></a> But when we turn our eyes to the earth, to the dealings of God with its nations, we find, when He divided to the sons of Adam their inheritance, "He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel," <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:8">Deuteronomy  32:8</a>.<a name=43:14></a> In this, of course, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		beast will take his part; doubtless, he may <i>lead</i> in the career of evil, but let us enlarge our view a little.<a name=44:1></a> Were all the nations of the image in the last beast?<a name=44:2></a> Clearly not.<a name=44:3></a> The Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and (I suppose) about the Firths of Forth and Clyde, and the Irish Sea, form the geographical bounds of all that could ever be taken within the grasp of the last beast, unless perhaps part of Hungary and Transylvania.<a name=44:4></a> I am not saying that all this will be under Antichrist,<a href="#44:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> or how far it may be, but merely that the last beast extends no farther than this.<a name=44:5></a> But besides this, there is in the image, part of the subject of latter-day judgment -- the arms and the breast; the Medo-Persian power not included within these limits.<a name=44:6></a> This then, besides the actings of the first power, we must find scope for in the scenes of the latter day, as one of the nations that must act upon the Jews, and in the land.<a name=44:7></a> The omission of this may cause great confusion in the application of passages, which, having the Jews and the land in view, must include the account of the vicissitudes arising from this also.<a name=44:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, Gog and Magog (who form, I imagine, no part, not only of the beast, but of the image, yet take a conspicuous part in the scenes of the latter day, as the witness of the power of God) must be let into the scheme of prophecy; and till we have developed the sphere in which these take their parts, we cannot appropriate the special prophecies which may have their ultimate fulfilment in these very powers.<a name=44:9></a> I do not doubt we shall find much detail of movement within the territorial limits of the beast, which are not the action of its body, as immediately headed by Antichrist,<a href="#44:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> as well as the final suppression of smaller nation,, within the limits of Israelitish territory, as given of God; but into these details it is not my purpose to enter.<a name=44:10></a> That which I would press upon your readers is this -- that (while the scene in which we are individually engaged leads us to contemplate directly the growth and operations of Antichrist,<a href="#44:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> our most important concern), if we would interpret Scripture fully, we must see that this is but conducive to a system and scene of which the land of Israel is the focus and centre, and in which all the people of the earth are concerned and called in question.<a name=44:11></a> The length, the circumstances, the particulars of the great day of tribunal of judgment on the people and nations, beginning at Jerusalem, we may reserve

		<h3>SCOPE OF PROPHECY</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(From the <i>Christian Witness</i>, Plymouth, July, 1835.<a name=45:5></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great subjects connected with prophecy -- the hope of the Church and the order and accomplishment of that system of earthly government which, with the Jews as its centre, has formed the great subject of ancient prophecy, its proper subject as a literal and distinct testimony of what should happen in the earth.<a name=45:6></a> As it is written, "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.<a name=45:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:8">Deuteronomy  32:8</a>,9.<a name=45:8></a> "For the Lord's portion is his people; Israel is the lot of his inheritance.<a name=45:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point, the connection of the two, the passage from the failing dispensation (failing as in man's hand) in which we stand, into that which is to come; the portion of the remnant in the Gentile body and of the restored Jewish people, which, it seems to me, from involving both, induces greater difficulty of judgment than either considered apart.<a name=45:10></a> The moral state too both of the Christian remnant and of the Jewish remnant is so immediately involved in the question -- their responsibilities and the divine judgment concerning them -- that responsibility in estimating their place I feel sensibly increased.<a name=45:11></a> Nevertheless the faithful word is our sure and only guide, and wherever this directs us, the Spirit shedding light on it to our souls, we shall find the light and power of life in it.<a name=45:12></a> Nor will its connection with our responsibilities weaken its importance and value to us.<a name=45:13></a> I should value therefore exceedingly any light upon this subject.<a name=45:14></a> But though I have thought in the study of the word on many things connected with it, I do not feel my mind so distinctly ascertained of that portion of the mind of God as to state myself at present anything concerning it, though quite alive to the inquiry.<a name=45:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would state very briefly as to the second point what would
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		enlarge the basis on which our inquiries into Scripture may be conducted; and, by extending the limits of that which is certain in things revealed, increase our power of spiritual judgment, both within those limits and also as to those things in which we may be yet untaught.<a name=46:1></a> The essential difference of the government of the world during the four beasts is not, I think, sufficiently considered.<a name=46:2></a> During this time, there ceased to be, properly speaking, Jews and Gentiles.<a name=46:3></a> That which had given importance to the Jews, was that they were God's people.<a name=46:4></a> Otherwise "have not I brought (says God) the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?<a name=46:5></a>" <a href="../bible/Amos.htm#9:7">Amos  9:7</a>.<a name=46:6></a> This removed, they were but as one among the nations made of one blood in all the earth, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him.<a name=46:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is true this distinction, once constituted, was never and never is to be recalled; "for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=46:8></a>" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:29">Romans  11:29</a>.<a name=46:9></a> And hence the Jews, or people of Israel, always constituted a distinct subject of government in the divine mind, never lost sight of and kept continually for the purposes formed therein for His glory, whatever the circumstances were through which they were passed.<a name=46:10></a> But they ceased to be the immediate manifested object and centre of the divine government upon earth, the moment "Lo-ammi" was written upon them.<a name=46:11></a> They ceased to be the scene in which God displayed His character as a recognised people, and from which, as identified with Himself, He exercised righteous judgment on surrounding nations, accounted but as strangers meddling with the place of His sanctuary.<a name=46:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Identical with this inscription of "Lo-ammi" (for a little season and still reserved for mercy, and it counted long to Jehovah) was the setting up of the Gentile power, the kingdom of the beasts which should arise out of the earth.<a name=46:13></a> This is matter of common knowledge and has been noticed in the <i>Witness</i>; and the whole history of the Jews connected with Nebuchadnezzar makes it too plain to one familiar with Scripture to need the evidence in detail here.<a name=46:14></a> But the inscription of "Lo-ammi" being set upon the Jewish people, their present distinction as God's people from the other nations of the earth ceased (not in purpose nor in providence, but as the subject of manifested government and revelation).<a name=46:15></a> And, though for the purpose of the manifestation of Messiah there was a suspension of the final accomplishment of these things.<a name=46:16></a> and a partial restoration,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		or rather setting in such a place as that they might be the subject of Messiah's restoration, the rod that was upon them of the stranger was never taken off, let it be light or gilded.<a name=47:1></a> There was no Jewish history, but of the fact of their rebuilding under the favour of the Persians, and of the rejection of Messiah under the government of the Romans and Herod; and then they are lost to historic scripture after the death of Stephen, forbidding that which was now come to the Gentiles to go to them, and wrath come upon them to the uttermost.<a name=47:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the setting up of Nebuchadnezzar as the golden head of the image, the man of the earth, "the times of the Gentiles" began, and Israel was lost.<a name=47:3></a> It was not Ammi and Goiim,<a href="#47:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> but government left in the hands of the Gentiles, now exercising it in the covetous greediness of self-will, and the apparent government of God, in principle, lost, though never, of course, in providence.<a name=47:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the four beasts connected with this state of things, every reader of prophecy is familiar.<a name=47:5></a> But it is taken notice of here as co-extensive with Israel's (whatever their circumstances) being "Lo-ammi," not God's people, and, consequently, the distinction of Jew and Gentile lost in present manifested exercise, unless in priority of judgment.<a name=47:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we shall find a very distinct division of prophecy connected with this subject, and appropriation of it, much calculated to clear the ground on which we stand.<a name=47:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three prophets connected with this state of Jewish rejection -- Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.<a name=47:8></a> Each have their separate portion of testimony, and their several place of giving it.<a name=47:9></a> Jeremiah prophesied in the place and habitation of the rebellious people.<a name=47:10></a> "The sin of Judah was written with a pen of iron, and the point of a diamond.<a name=47:11></a>" Ezekiel prophesied by the river of Chebar, among the captives.<a name=47:12></a> Daniel in the midst of Babylon, when the golden representative head had been set up.<a name=47:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Jeremiah we shall see, therefore, the sin of the people proved, and they made Goiim (heathen) of; and then, after various judgments on all the nations, the new covenant with Israel and Judah, their captivity brought again; in a word, "Lo-ammi," and Ammi as to both in restoration; while the history of their present wickedness is given and their necessary captivity, ashamed of Egypt as they were ashamed of Assyria.<a name=47:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#47:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>*Ammi*, my people; *Goiim*, Gentiles or heathen.
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=48>[Page 48]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ezekiel we shall find the sign of the glory departed, the consequent disallowance of the remains of the people in the land, then the setting aside of every other power previous to Nebuchadnezzar, and the fact of his prevailing as king of Babylon over the last of them; but then a passing by the whole history of, or any allusion to, the beasts: and after setting aside the previous nations by the king of Babylon, the immediate recurrence to the principles of God's dealings with the house of Israel, their restoration and deliverance as one stick in His hand; and, consequently, the <i>heathen</i> knowing that He, Jehovah, did sanctify Israel when His sanctuary was in the midst of them for evermore.<a name=48:1></a> And what subsequently happened of Gog, prince of Magog, is a coming up against "<i>my people</i> Israel.<a name=48:2></a>" Thus way is made in the suppression of previous powers (and Or Israel) for the introduction of the beasts, but they are wholly omitted; and the prophet passes over (after the principles of God's dealings are discussed) to the restoration of the people and God's dealings among the heathen, as with them as His people.<a name=48:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Daniel precisely fills up this gap.<a name=48:4></a> Nebuchadnezzar is seen as the golden head in the outset, and a king of kings to whom the God of <i>heaven</i> had given a kingdom; and, wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven had He given into his hand, and made him rule over them all.<a name=48:5></a> He was the head of gold.<a name=48:6></a> Then the character and proceedings of this system and of the four beasts are given, but no mention of anything before or after, nor of the Jews or Israel as God's people at all.<a name=48:7></a> It is "the times of the Gentiles," of the four beasts, in which God's people are "Lo-ammi"; and when mentioned, it is not "My people," but "thy people," addressing Daniel.<a name=48:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gives the subjects of these books, I think, great clearness, and shews the character and importance of the time subsequent to the renewal of the distinction between God's people and the heathen.<a name=48:9></a> The convulsions and trouble preceding this are of the utmost importance, and have their place; but they are to be viewed as a distinct subject from Israel acknowledged of the Lord.<a name=48:10></a> Israel is still lost in the midst of the nations rising one against another.<a name=48:11></a> Jerusalem may be taken; but He is not come whose right it is; and, therefore, though it may be the occasion of the Lord's fighting against these nations, still it was not Jehovah-Shammah (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#48:35">Ezekiel  48:35</a>) that was taken;

		I would advert to a few passages illustrative of what I have stated, and then allude to one or two consequences.<a name=49:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, as to Jeremiah, up to chapter 24 we have the sin of Israel, and specially Judah, continuously proved.<a name=49:3></a> In chapter 25, is the judgment; recapitulating the testimony -- shewing immediate judgment also on Babylon, the type of all the nations.<a name=49:4></a> The judgment, however, actually runs thus, "Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand and cause all the nations (Goiim) to whom I send thee to drink it.<a name=49:5></a> Then took I the cup at the Lord's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the Lord had sent me; <i>Jerusalem and the cities of Judah</i>, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation"; and then the rest, to "all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth, and the king of Sheshach after them.<a name=49:6></a>" <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#25:15">Jeremiah  25:15</a>-18.<a name=49:7></a> But this definitely involves Judah and Jerusalem in the indiscriminate and common name of Goiim -- "judgment beginning in the house of God.<a name=49:8></a>" (See verse 29.<a name=49:9></a>) Then, after various details to chapter 30, in that chapter we have the new and sure promises connected with God's purpose concerning the nation to the end of chapter 33.<a name=49:10></a> The rest is historically probative or relative to Egypt, till chapter 46, when we have the word against the Gentiles, but restoration to many of them.<a name=49:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ezekiel, chapter 24 divides the book.<a name=49:12></a> We have the utter rejection of the city.<a name=49:13></a> The glory of the Lord is seen at the outset in its full providential governing power; and in chapter 10 its departure from the city and temple: then in chapter 25, getting rid of other nations -- these within and surrounding the land.<a name=49:14></a> Then two are mentioned who would fain have been beasts in the earth -- Assyria and Pharaoh-Necho.<a name=49:15></a> The first, however, had fallen.<a name=49:16></a> What was the latter better?<a name=49:17></a> He should fall; "So was Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.<a name=49:18></a>" Then in chapter 32 we have their common dirge.<a name=49:19></a> Here the prophet closes.<a name=49:20></a> Instead of pursuing the history of the earth then farther, which must have brought in the beasts, he turns at once to the shepherds of Israel.<a name=49:21></a> All but the beasts are disposed of; these Daniel is occupied about in Babylon, not Ezekiel at Chebar.<a name=49:22></a> Restoration under the Lord's salvation from evil shepherds is the only remedy.<a name=49:23></a> So in chapter 33: 4 and in chapter 34: 7.<a name=49:24></a> The restoration follows; then Gog against Israel <i>as God's people</i>, settled on their own

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of Daniel I have already said enough, it is manifestly the history of the unnoticed period, the times of the beasts and their doings and character; the account in Babylon of all that belonged to it, or arose out of it, while Israel was no more a people, and power was recognisedly in the hands of those who knew not how to use it, who had beasts' hearts and left to be so and not man's till the due times had passed over it.<a name=50:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then these three agencies to look for, connected with Israel, and at the close of these times, when the great concentrated crisis comes to take effect.<a name=50:4></a> First, the heathen as looked at under Jeremiah, nation against nation and kingdom against kingdom, in which Jerusalem and the Jews have a place in the secret enmity perhaps of the wicked one, knowing what is to be and happen there; and surely in the providence of God.<a name=50:5></a> Yet still as one of the Goiim, merely mixed up in the troubles with all the rest, only the first to drink the cup.<a name=50:6></a> Secondly, the beast (or beasts) then in his power, having his own specific and distinct character as such.<a name=50:7></a> That which constitutes the power may be heathen perhaps in race; but it is not merely this but a beast.<a name=50:8></a> And lastly, we have the renewed position of Israel as God's people, and the heathen definitely distinguished from them, and opposed to them as such; and God acting on this principle.<a name=50:9></a> The other prophets give many details as to them; their proper statements are, of course, of the Jews as Jews, and treating the heathen as such, and therefore not concerning the beasts at all.<a name=50:10></a> And I suspect if Antichrist be mentioned in them, he is spoken of in his professed character as "the king"; and the state of the people merely alluded to on the critical time of change, when the summons of the Lord is addressed on the coming of the heathen, when the Lord is just about to go forth, rejected indeed by the nations, but listened to by the remnant.<a name=50:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Joel describes some <i>Goi</i> (nation) going up against the land, etc.<a name=50:12></a>, and summons the inhabitants of the land, and alarms Zion, and sounds for the gathering.<a name=50:13></a> When there is this cry, then the Lord is jealous for His land and pities His people; and the answer to them (not before so called), and blessing, and consequent judgment on all the heathen, is described.<a name=50:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I will not enter farther into details.<a name=51:4></a> I have mentioned these passages as immediately affected by the considerations I have offered.<a name=51:5></a> If one could see the Jews and Jerusalem (as shewn in the paper, under the title of "Jerusalem," in a previous number) as the great subject and centre of earthly government and prophecy, we should better understand the force of <i>nations</i>, and then, looking at Israel as lost in them and mixed in their troubles, and the object of their hatred; then the subject of the wilful king's special though wicked interference; and subsequently, on his destruction, as the scene of the Lord's deliverance and power, who then holds it in His hand as His weapon against the nations (now again recognised as in opposition to <i>Ammi</i>, "my people," and He therefore putting them under His feet), we should see much of the prophecies more distinct and more simple.<a name=51:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though I acquiesce in and value the general scope of the article I have alluded to, let me just say that it seems to me in some of its details to have overstepped the limits of evidence.<a name=51:7></a> I cannot see that <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>, 8 and <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>are necessarily identical, however analogous the language may be.<a name=51:8></a> The connection of <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>with <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>cannot doubt.<a name=51:9></a> The proof of the identity of chapters 7 and 8 arises not from direct interpretation, but the necessity, if both be universal, and at the same time, that they should be the same.<a name=51:10></a> The argument is good enough (though I distrust and feel difficulty in all illative reasoning about Scripture), but depends, and is justly made to do so, on the universality of both, and also the sameness of time.<a name=51:11></a> But I cannot see the universality in chapter 8.<a name=51:12></a> Thus "by him the daily sacrifice shall be taken away," should (I apprehend) be from him, though this by-the-bye.<a name=51:13></a> I entirely recognise the working of Antichrist as the head of the last beast,<a href="#51:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> or the last head of the beast in Jerusalem in his place

At least, two such manifestations of power we find in @Revelation 13. See papers on "The Antichrist," later in this volume.

		THE DISPENSATION OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would say a few words on this chapter, or collection of parables, in the deep feeling of the imperfectness with which any of us understand "the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven"; and this, not merely from personal feelings as to individual weakness, but from the scope and extent of the divine wisdom in them -- a wisdom knit up with and developing the whole of the divine counsels -- a wisdom, therefore, not to be acquired in mere detached passages, but in the comprehension of the mind of God which flows from the abundance of the Spirit exercised in spiritual application to Scripture.<a name=53:1></a> Nevertheless, I feel that our portion, as believers, is to be given to know them -- our blessed portion; and we may be allowed, in the confidence of His love, to breathe out also what we may have apprehended of the mind of the Spirit, and to present it to the judgment of our brethren.<a name=53:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With this feeling of confidence in the Lord, I shall open out what appears to me to be the order and power of this collection of parables.<a name=53:3></a> Their detailed meaning may, perhaps, be the subject of some subsequent observation.<a name=53:4></a> I would remark, then, in the first place, that the phrases, "kingdom of heaven," and also, "kingdom of your or their Father," are peculiar to Matthew -- expressions manifestly not unimportant in force.<a name=53:5></a> The only exception at all is the use of the latter expression, by implication, in the instruction to pray, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>an exception not without interest, but which I can dwell on here only to observe, that the kingdom in every instance we are taught to pray for is the Father's kingdom.<a name=53:6></a> In these parables we have both: the term "kingdom of heaven" being common to all, save the first; that of "kingdom of your Father" being found in the explanation of the second of the parables.<a name=53:7></a> The importance of the former expression is seen not only in its being a positive subject of all the parables, except the first, but from the emphatic declaration of our Lord: "Every scribe, instructed into the <i>kingdom of heaven</i>, will bring forth out of his treasure things new and old.<a name=53:8></a>"<a href="#53:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#54:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>"The kingdom of God" is a distinct expression from "the kingdom of heaven," although in many respects so identified, that the same things could be affirmed about it. Thus it could be said that the kingdom of God was at hand: that was most true; as it could be said also, that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. But at the same time they were of very distinct import; for it was matter of faith to know that the "kingdom of God was come amongst them." (See Gr., @Luke 11:20; chapter 17:21.) So the Lord makes use of expressions never used of the kingdom of heaven -- to know that the kingdom of heaven was not, but was "at hand" (@Matthew 4:17, Gr.); whereas the same evangelist, or rather the Spirit of God by him, in speaking of the kingdom of God, immediately changes his phrase to the one noticed in Luke (Gr., @Matthew 12: 28). The kingdom of God was necessarily there when the Son of God was there -- in a word, when God was there. The kingdom of heaven, as the development of God's *purpose*, could not be there while He was there; it resulted from the Lord's going away into heaven. The kingdom of God is the exercise or exhibition of the ruling power of God under any circumstances in the wisdom of God. The kingdom of heaven is the kingdom of God in its heavenly character. In *dispensation* this is set up by *the rejection of the King of God's kingdom by the world*; and, while it ought to have been known (even while He was upon earth), by faith, is known to faith by Jesus the Head, the Lamb slain, sitting on the throne of the Father. The kingdom of God, therefore, was amongst the Jews when He, the Son of God, Jesus, was there -- and they ought to have known it -- and the kingdom of heaven was at hand. By the earthliness of men, however, instead of gathering the Gentiles to the Jews, the Messiah being recognised, it was known only (as in God's counsels and wisdom meant to be) by the rejection of Him, and the exaltation (to the place "where he was before") of the Son of man, who was the Lord from heaven, and Son of man in heaven. The kingdom of heaven (His kingdom was not of this world) was set up, continuing, as regards the Church, till the time when the saints, in the Father's kingdom, raised with Jesus at His second coming, shall know the blessedness of the rule of the Son of God and man, in the whole scene which once rejected Him, now brought under His sway and theirs (still, in that sense, the kingdom of heaven to those below), when they witness the blessedness of heavenly rule, while dwelling "kings and priests unto God" in the quiet and secure fulness of the Father's house-sons with Him. This, too, more properly is the kingdom of man (compare @Daniel 7); for under the exalted Man and His saints all things are put. Had Jesus not been rejected, it would have been the kingdom of God (still, it is surely so in character; for He is God, and it is God's kingdom); He would have been righteously subject, "having taken upon him the form of a servant," and as such come, "not to do his own will, but the will of him that sent him." And it is thus, I apprehend, the Son shall be subject, when God -- not the Father, which would be confounding everything, and not be what the word teaches, but "*God* -- shall be all in all," Father, Son and Holy Ghost; but the rule taken out of man's hands, into which it had been put, through the obedience of Christ. Therefore it is not until after the resurrection that He says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and earth," @Matthew 28:18 etc. All things are delivered unto Him as the Son of God, as heir of all, in whom all centres. This inheritance He has not yet taken. But at present "all power is given unto him" as the appointed Man, according to the glorious mystery in which, as the Son, for whom (and by whom) all things were made. He took it up as the Redeemer in the Person of Jesus; but the power was given to Him as the obedient Man.

		That "the kingdom of heaven" was merely the true invisible church of God is an explanation which cannot for a moment be maintained, consistently with a single statement of these parables and of analogous ones.<a name=56:3></a> That it was merely the visible church of God is neither consistent with what we find in this chapter, nor any adequate representation of the matter, as is manifest from the parables of the treasure and the pearls.<a name=56:4></a> The rule of heaven is the simple force of the expression "the kingdom of heaven.<a name=56:5></a>" Earthly dominion was exercised by the Gentiles unrighteously; earthly dominion was expected by the Jews, and expected, though true, unrighteously; as was shewn by their rejection of "the Holy One of God," who came from heaven -- "the Son of man," "the King of the Jews.<a name=56:6></a>" Most important, then, and a point of sustaining faith, to one who might think that it had been "he who should have redeemed Israel," was it to recognise in this word "the kingdom of heaven," that a resurrection Lord might hold its power; and anomalous, and apparently failing, as their position might have been, to learn, not only new spiritual things, but that the kingdom of heaven was that which, even in dispensation, was the mind and order of God's counsels.<a name=56:7></a>

		Thus we see the character of the whole chapter -- to wit, Christ's prophetic testimony upon the rejection of His word by the Jews: the order of the divine kingdom during the absence of the Son of man consequent upon His rejection, and the assumption of His own throne, the ministration of power in the hands of the Son of man, with the closing scene of that order, the assumption of the righteous into the Father's kingdom in the brightness "of the sun" (i.<a name=59:10></a>e.<a name=59:11></a>, Christ Himself); the purging of the Son of man's kingdom, the field in which the tares were; the declaration of the intrinsic excellence and value with the beauty of the kingdom [the gathering of the good first into vessels], and the judgment of the visible church, the net-full gathered out of the sea.<a name=59:12></a>

		The blessing of Abram, by Melchisedec, runs thus -- "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be the Most High God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand.<a name=64:1></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14:19">Genesis  14:19</a>,20.<a name=64:2></a>

		It is familiar to every reader, that the apostle uses Melchisedec as the type of Christ, according to the word of the oath: "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=64:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We would say a few words on this Melchisedec priesthood of Christ, its extent and blessing.<a name=64:4></a> And first, it is not that which Christ the Lord now exercises.<a name=64:5></a> Not that He is not a priest after that order -- we know fully that He is, by the epistle to the Hebrews, and from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, and that He is not of any other.<a name=64:6></a> But the exercise of His priesthood is according to the typical character of Aaron's on the day of atonement, as the same epistle shews.<a name=64:7></a> The whole of the present order of things answers to the day of atonement -- is typified by it.<a name=64:8></a> The High Priest is gone within the veil, with the blood of the sacrifice -- even of Himself -- His own blood.<a name=64:9></a> So there, as yet, He is, whom the heavens must receive till the time of the restoration of all things, which God hath promised by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.<a name=64:10></a> This, then, is the time during which the Lord, though a priest after the order of Melchisedec, after the power of an endless life, made with an oath for ever (<i>eis to dienekes</i><a href="#64:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>), in perpetuity, a continuous, not a successional priesthood; yet exercises it practically for us according to the type, though not according to the <i>order</i> of Aaron, as within the veil, on the great day of atonement.<a name=64:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Accordingly the apostle, after declaring the order of His priesthood, enters upon and dwells exclusively in detail upon the Aaronic priesthood, as characteristic of that which the Lord Christ now exercises.<a name=64:12></a> He shews that He exercises it, anti-typically, within the veil, the priesthood being, in its exercise, now one entirely of a heavenly character.<a name=64:13></a> He is gone within, not the typical veil, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.<a name=64:14></a> The blood is not of bulls and goats, with which the patterns of things in the heavens were purified, but His own blood -- those better

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is manifest, then, that the type of Melchisedec here presented to us, as indicative of the priesthood of Christ, in its exercise leads us to further results and wider exhibition than that in which He now so graciously, and blessedly for us, secures the life, and blessing, and salvation of His people in heavenly places; Himself far above all heavens, at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having by Himself purged our sins.<a name=65:6></a> The priesthood of Christ is clearly after the order of Melchisedec, and solely so; its exercise now is as clearly after the type of the order of Aaron solely; and that as exhibited on the great day of atonement within the veil.<a name=65:7></a> Not but that there is a great deal revealed now as to Aaronic types, which could not be seen in the type itself, which was a shadow, not the very image, the veil is now rent behind Him, and we are enabled to follow Him within, and see where He is set down, to our comfort and everlasting joy.<a name=65:8></a> But there is a glory besides, not yet fulfilled; a glory of its own character, a glory properly Christ's, and taught us in this type of Melchisedec, the exercise of which we find yet to come; and all that develops Christ's glory is precious to the saints.<a name=65:9></a> It is the Lord's glory, the glory of the Son of the Father, His own glory, too, as well as the Lord's glory.<a name=65:10></a> On this I would speak a little.<a name=65:11></a>

		The priesthood of Melchisedec is, then, that royal dominion of priesthood in which, as representing the Most High God, and speaking also for man to Him in returns of praise, Christ blesses from Him (as now in His possession) heaven and the uttermost parts of the earth, through and in the seed of God.<a name=65:12></a> We find even in the case of Nebuchadnezzar (the first great

		The conclusion is in no way the scriptural mind of God.<a name=77:6></a> Who told the writer that there would be succeeding ages of this world's history?<a name=77:7></a> We have not so learned to say, "Come, Lord Jesus; come quickly!<a name=77:8></a>" "Our Lord shall exercise undisputedly.<a name=77:9></a>" This is exactly what He does <i>not</i> do now <i>in the church</i>; for we wrestle with principalities and powers, "against the <i>rulers of the darkness of this world</i>, against spiritual wickedness in high places," <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:12">Ephesians  6:12</a>.<a name=77:10></a> If the exercise be far more extensive than at present, it is clear, in some sort, there is a power which He has not taken.<a name=77:11></a> This is the thing we assert from Scripture: the question is, what is the manner of it?<a name=77:12></a> The writer, if he says anything, must say, Christ can exercise His power in no other way than He does now.<a name=77:13></a> We think He can, and we think the Scriptures say He will; for example, "Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel," <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:9">Psalm  2:9</a>.<a name=77:14></a> We do not think that this is the gentle influence of His Spirit in the hearts of His people, by which, according to the notion of the writer, He is King in Zion.<a name=77:15></a> These nations are not Zion at all, and the exercise of the power is quite a different thing yet to come.<a name=77:16></a> When Mr.<a name=77:17></a> S.<a name=77:18></a> says, "Christ will still continue seated where He now is" -- if he mean that the Man, Christ Jesus, shall never leave His place in heaven, it is clean contrary to Scripture, and a denial of the faith; for we read, "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:11">Acts  1:11</a>.<a name=77:19></a> And again, "Times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus .<a name=77:20></a>.<a name=77:21></a>.<a name=77:22></a> whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:19">Acts  3:19</a>-21.<a name=77:23></a>

		EVIDENCE FROM SCRIPTURE OF THE PASSING AWAY OF THE PRESENT DISPENSATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of Scripture is the only secure resting-place for man amid the darkness of this world.<a name=89:1></a> This, through the teaching of the Spirit, is the believer's light and security; from this his judgment flows; and, consequently, from this the rule and foundation of his conduct springs.<a name=89:2></a> Wrong thoughts as to God's dealings, and our own place before Him, must lead to wrong judgment as to the conduct claimed from us; and thus all our service will be folly, and, perhaps, our hopes presumption; our light will be darkness, and then what will become of those "who are led"?<a name=89:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Immediately connected with this inquiry (and thus involving the most practical results) is the question as to the dispensation in which we stand, and what are to be our hopes in it?<a name=89:4></a> Many most interesting inquiries are connected with this subject, as to the development of the purposes of God; but it is not my present purpose to enter into them.<a name=89:5></a> I intend to confine myself to the scriptural evidence on the two following most important questions, which, in the highest degree, affect the present interests and operations of the church of Christ.<a name=89:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) IS THIS DISPENSATION THE LAST, OR NOT?<a name=89:7></a><br>(2) WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH ANY OTHER IS TO BE INTRODUCED?<a name=89:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The answer to these questions appears to me to involve the whole ground of the judgment of a believer's mind, as to his present position in the world; and, consequently, as to his duty and his hopes.<a name=89:9></a> Without examining the detail of circumstances, I shall endeavour to seize on some of the broad facts and principles.<a name=89:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) Is this dispensation the last, or is it not?<a name=89:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First -- Let us consider the evidence of Scripture as to the Christian body.<a name=89:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The 9th verse of the 1st of Ephesians affords a leading declaration of Scripture on this subject: "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:9">Ephesians  1:9</a>,10.<a name=89:13></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=90>[Page 90]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is in no way applicable to the present dispensation.<a name=90:1></a> He is to gather together in one all things which are in heaven, and which are on earth.<a name=90:2></a> This the present dispensation does not assume to do: it is a dispensation in which Satan is the prince and god of this world -- in which he sows tares among the wheat, and is in high places.<a name=90:3></a> In this, God visits the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name.<a name=90:4></a> This is indeed a dispensation of another gathering (as we shall see presently), in which angels minister and devils oppose -- anything but a gathering into one things in heaven and things on earth; for we must be absent from the body to be present with the Lord, and absent from the Lord to be at home in the body; and we "groan" waiting.<a name=90:5></a> Indeed, there is ample demonstration in the above passage, that the present dispensation does not and was not meant to do this.<a name=90:6></a> The passage declares that God has made known this to us, as that which should happen in the fulness of times, of which we have the earnest under the present dispensation until the redemption.<a name=90:7></a> This is not merely "going to heaven," because, as we see in the passage itself, God is to gather together in one all things in heaven and on earth in Christ.<a name=90:8></a> That which we have under the present dispensation is an earnest merely of that which we are to have; which is not a going to heaven, but a dispensation in which all things are gathered together in heaven and on earth.<a name=90:9></a> In a word, the passage declares a gathering, which cannot mean the church in the present dispensation, or in any dispensation; for the church, as applied to believers, in no dispensation comprehends all things in heaven and on earth; and that which comprehends and gathers all into one (all things in heaven and on earth) is manifestly not the church; for the church, even here, is gathered out of the earth, and does not gather all things on the earth into itself, and as a dispensation of the assembled saints in heaven, it has none of the things of the earth in it at all.<a name=90:10></a> Indeed, except from the force of habitual prejudice, it is just as fairly inferred from this passage that all the things in heaven will be gathered in the earth, as that all on the earth will be gathered in heaven.<a name=90:11></a> If we do not acknowledge a common gathering of all things

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		both in heaven and on earth under the authority of Christ (as is also written elsewhere), it is manifest we must force this passage into some previously assumed sense, and then it may mean anything we like.<a name=91:1></a> Chapter 3 of John's gospel might throw light on this, if the reader is disposed to enquire.<a name=91:2></a> But as it is manifest that the church is no such gathering actually, so it is equally manifest that to say that the assembly of the saints in heaven is a gathering of all things in heaven and on earth into one, is a plain perversion to suit previous ideas; for the saints are not all things, if the position taken were otherwise tenable: and it is thinking that they are so (in self-complacency) which is one grand source of error, for thus His glory is marred and shortened, by whom and for whom all things are created.<a name=91:3></a> I affirm (though it be the manifestation of God's wisdom) that the church of God's saints is only a part -- a small part -- of the glory and purposes of God, as fulfilled: a part worthy, indeed, of all admiration, as it is; but one which, if we take the comeliness that God has put upon us, and make our boast as if it were all God's glory, He will shew us it is as nothing in His sight calling the things that are not as though they were.<a name=91:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:9">1 Peter  1:9</a>-13), "Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.<a name=91:5></a> Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.<a name=91:6></a> Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.<a name=91:7></a> Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=91:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have three things: the prophets prophesying of a grace to be brought to us, the Holy Ghost reporting these same things, and, <i>therefore</i>, the Christian church waiting to the end for the things which are to be brought unto them at the revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=91:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is to say, that which the prophets prophesied should be brought to us, the Holy Ghost, in the present dispensation, reports in the word, and believers, <i>therefore</i>, wait for as about

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=92>[Page 92]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to be brought to them at the revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=92:1></a> But it was not heaven the prophets prophesied of, but the dealings and dispensations of God; therefore there is yet a dispensation to come, in which the things prophesied of by the prophets will come, and for which those who have received the truth wait; and this dispensation is not it.<a name=92:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, there is another important fact we would advert to:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no promise of universality annexed to the present dispensation, but the contrary.<a name=92:3></a> "Go ye," is its leading instruction, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.<a name=92:4></a> <i>He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be damned</i>.<a name=92:5></a>" But there is a dispensation, when the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.<a name=92:6></a> This is therefore not the last, for the effects stated of <i>that</i> are not contemplated in the instructions of <i>this</i>.<a name=92:7></a> This is a dispensation of testimony and of instruction; that, of universal knowledge, and therefore essentially different, for men shall no more say, "Know the Lord.<a name=92:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, as to the Jews, there shall be a state of things in which all Israel shall be saved, i.<a name=92:9></a>e.<a name=92:10></a> as a body.<a name=92:11></a> But now, "Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah": and again, "Even so, then, at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.<a name=92:12></a>" The dispensations, therefore, are essentially different in their character; the one the rescuing of the remnant, the other, the saving of the body.<a name=92:13></a> So, of the Gentiles, "Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.<a name=92:14></a>" It has not, therefore, the intention of universality manifested in it.<a name=92:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:52">John  11:52</a>: "And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.<a name=92:16></a>" Here we have a gathering which characterises this dispensation, but essentially distinct from that noticed by Paul in the Ephesians.<a name=92:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in connection with this, the character and position annexed to His people equally contravene the idea of the universality of the dispensation.<a name=92:18></a> "Who gave himself for us," we read, "that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works": all this is essentially distinctive, therefore not universal.<a name=92:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=93>[Page 93]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Peter: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.<a name=93:1></a>" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:9">1 Peter  2:9</a>.<a name=93:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:15">Philippians  2:15</a>: "That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.<a name=93:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So John, in the conclusion of his first epistle, and many like passages, and others withal, which prove suffering to be their portion.<a name=93:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And connected with this, is the direct warning of the excision of the church<a href="#93:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> on its failure of maintaining effectually this position.<a name=93:5></a> See the whole of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>.<a name=93:6></a> The conclusion is summed up in verse 22: "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness; <i>otherwise</i> thou also shalt be cut off.<a name=93:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:22">Romans  11:22</a>.<a name=93:8></a> But is not the confidence of the necessary continuance of the present dispensation very like that high-minded conceit which ruined the Jews, though they had perhaps better ground for it; and against which, expressly, the apostles warned these Gentiles?<a name=93:9></a> Is it not what the apostle warned of as the very way of being cut off?<a name=93:10></a> The ruin of the Jews was, boasting of the comeliness which God had put upon them.<a name=93:11></a> But to proceed (nevertheless, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear), the position in which they are thus put, with such purpose and responsibility, under pain of excision, is thus expressed (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:13">Matthew  5:13</a>): "Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?<a name=93:12></a> it is henceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.<a name=93:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequences are fully stated by the Lord: "In the world ye shall have tribulation.<a name=93:14></a>" "Whoso taketh not up his cross, and followeth not after me, cannot be my disciple.<a name=93:15></a>" "He that saveth his life shall lose it .<a name=93:16></a>.<a name=93:17></a>.<a name=93:18></a> he that serveth me, let him follow me": and many other like passages, familiar to the Christian.<a name=93:19></a> They were to be called Beelzebub, and he that killed them would think that he did God service -- they were to be hated of all men, etc.<a name=93:20></a> -- nor, may we add, was the church at any other time pure.<a name=93:21></a>

		So the apostles, or rather the Spirit in them: "If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.<a name=94:1></a>" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:17">Romans  8:17</a> "Yea, all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution": <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:12">2 Timothy  3:12</a> and yet more, for "yourselves know that also we are appointed thereunto.<a name=94:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the results of the testimony of Christ by the Spirit, and the ultimate results of His incarnation, are contrasted: "Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth," is the title of the latter; "Suppose ye that I am come to send peace on the earth?<a name=94:3></a> I tell you, Nay; but rather division," is the result of the former.<a name=94:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the full continuance of evil, until some change by power be wrought, is fully declared: "As it was in the days of Noe," and "as it was in the days of Lot," we are told, "shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.<a name=94:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, this could not be a day of universal blessing simply, or it would be idle to talk of it as coming "unawares," "as a thief in the night", and that there would be some whom it did not take unawares.<a name=94:6></a> Judgment may overtake those unsuited for it; but spiritual light and blessing are blessings because they do so.<a name=94:7></a> Yet Peter declares this is the day of grace to the church, which was prophesied by the prophets of old, even the glory of Christ that was to follow; <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:10">1 Peter  1:10</a>-12.<a name=94:8></a>

		But more, evil shall get worse:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse," says Paul to Timothy, "deceiving and being deceived.<a name=94:9></a>" This does not look like the knowledge of the glory of the Lord covering the earth, as the waters cover the sea.<a name=94:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the next place, we are assured that the man of sin, the apostasy of professing Christianity, will be destroyed by the brightness (<i>lit</i>.<a name=94:11></a> appearing) of Christ's coming; <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:8">2 Thessalonians  2:8</a>.<a name=94:12></a> What that is I think may be fairly learned from <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:13">Titus  2:13</a>; but I do not here press it thus far.<a name=94:13></a> I merely use it as evidence that this is not the last dispensation.<a name=94:14></a> It is, however, not different in degree, but contrasted in character from "the grace .<a name=94:15></a>.<a name=94:16></a>.<a name=94:17></a> which hath appeared"<a href="#94:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> in verse 11, just before; the one leads to wait for the other.<a name=94:18></a> But the passage in Thessalonians proves this: that the apostasy continues up to a time when a wholly different power has intervened, and a new state of things ensued; for, not to hang it on the thread of sense

		Having thus seen that the uniform analogy of God's dealings (by all parts of it, save judgment itself), and also the direct warnings of Scripture, lead us thus to judge of the nature and object of the testimony referred to, let us now turn to the light afforded by the passage usually quoted in connection herewith: that it is thus justly quoted I am willing to admit,<a href="#97:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> because I believe it does point out what is going on now in the testimony which some think will convert the world.<a name=97:6></a> "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people"; but what is the message?<a name=97:7></a> -- " Saying, with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; <i>for the hour of his judgment is come</i>.<a name=97:8></a>" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14:6">Revelation  14:6</a>,7.<a name=97:9></a> We have, then, the uniform analogy of God's moral dealings (herein His ways are evidenced to be equal) -- the solemn warning -- and the actual testimony (on which those who think otherwise rely), all tending to this point, that this dispensation inherits judgment, not the world; is itself to be cut off, not to be the system of the world's blessing.<a name=97:10></a> I expressly avoid argument upon the subject here, because it supposes either space for very great length, or the reception of first principles, and, though profitable, is less direct than testimony; to which, therefore, I confine myself.<a name=97:11></a> But this I say, that either the church must shew that it has <i>continued</i> in God's goodness, or else it must admit the conclusion, it shall be cut

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is admitted upon all hands that there is a time, or dispensation, in which the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.<a name=99:3></a> This is a great object held out in prophecy.<a name=99:4></a> The question between us is, How is this to be brought about?<a name=99:5></a> They say, By our preaching, or the preaching of the gospel.<a name=99:6></a> (I take the best ground for them.<a name=99:7></a>) How do they know that?<a name=99:8></a> How do they conclude that?<a name=99:9></a> Did the gospel ever do it before?<a name=99:10></a> Was it ever promised that it should do it?<a name=99:11></a> That man is responsible for its not doing so, I freely admit, but that is not the question.<a name=99:12></a> And that he is guilty, too, I admit.<a name=99:13></a> I conceive, indeed, that therefore the Gentile church will be cut off, because it has not done so; and therefore, we may say, as a church it is damnably guilty, because it has not done so.<a name=99:14></a> But as to actual result, those I speak of pass by the present sin of the church, and then prophesy (i.<a name=99:15></a>e.<a name=99:16></a>, assert as to the future), that of which they can have no experience as to the past, that their exertions will do it.<a name=99:17></a> They charge us with looking into prophecy: undoubtedly we do, and use it as God intended it, as a charge and warning against our present sin and state; while they prophesy for themselves that which is credit for themselves -- though never has the professing church at large been so far from godliness as now; if not, why all this labour, effort, formation of societies for home or continental purposes?<a name=99:18></a> This is the simple difference: we acknowledge it as a result of God's power; they say, without God's word (and we must add, against it), 'It will be done by our instrumentality.<a name=99:19></a>' Believers say, with God's word, It will not be done thus.<a name=99:20></a> We quarrel not with their efforts, but join in them according to our ability of God, as far as our poor hearts permit us; but we do quarrel with their assumption as to the coming result of their own labours, as if they were prophets, of that of which God has prophesied otherwise.<a name=99:21></a> They prophesy; we consult the word, and apply it to judge ourselves, and find the church guilty.<a name=99:22></a> Our assertion, accordingly, is this:

	<div class="paragraph">

		Secondly, that the prophecies always connect the filling of the world with the knowledge of the glory -- with judgments.<a name=100:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, we add, to those who are labouring without reference to this glory, yet are looking to the gathering of God's elect -- faithfully perhaps -- that there is a vast purpose of God, and one which is the result of all God's purposes, not embraced in their views, and that, as teachers of God's mind and will, their system must be wholly and utterly defective; for the earth is to be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.<a name=100:4></a> They recognise, and justly, that that cannot be, as it has never been, and, as we have seen, that it was not intended to be, by the gospel.<a name=100:5></a> There must, therefore, if they admit the truth of God's word, be some great plan and act of God's power, on which His mind is especially set (for His glory on the earth, as in heaven, must be His end as well as our desire, because we are His saints, and have the mind of Christ), of which they embrace nothing, teach nothing.<a name=100:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to our assertion just made, of these three points, the second point, viz.<a name=100:7></a>, 'that the prophecies always connect the filling of the world with the knowledge of the glory -- with judgments,' is that which we would now prove.<a name=100:8></a> The first, 'That there is no prophecy in scripture that the gradual diffusion of the gospel shall convert the world,' would be proved by the second, were it complete; but, as a negative assertion, it rests only on reference to Scripture -- and must be disproved by them -- a single text is sufficient for the purpose, and to disprove the whole view, so that their task is a very easy one, if I am wrong.<a name=100:9></a> The third, as argumentative, is not a subject for proof here.<a name=100:10></a>

		Let me here remark, before turning to the collateral statements of Scripture, that in many of these passages it is not merely the statement of the fact which we affirm, which is material, but its statement coincidently with facts which leave it impossible to spiritualise it away to other meanings.<a name=115:12></a> For example, it might be said that gathering all nations to Jerusalem, or coming up to Jerusalem, meant the assembly of the Gentiles into the church; but I find it associated with the

		One passage demands our attention, before we turn to the New Testament: I mean Daniel's image.<a name=116:4></a> There we have a stone cut out without hands, unseen till the image was formed, even to the ten toes.<a name=116:5></a> This stone did not progressively diffuse its influence over the image.<a name=116:6></a> Indeed the image was not the earth, nor people, but empires, or kingdoms of well-known characters; nor was the stone the gospel, but something that destroyed the image.<a name=116:7></a> This stone, then, was cut out without hands, as its first act here stated, struck the image on its feet (i.<a name=116:8></a>e.<a name=116:9></a>, the Roman empire in its divided state), and thereby put empire out of the earth; and the stone which smote the image became a mountain, and filled the whole earth: it was that which destroyed the empire of the whole earth.<a name=116:10></a> Here, then, we have a power, differing in its nature, but analogous in its character, not formed by the ordinary instrumentality of man, acting in destruction of that which assumed authority on the earth in its last form; and then, after having destroyed it, filling the earth, the place of them being no more found.<a name=116:11></a> Is not the character of this work as simple and determinate as possible, and the manner by which the hoped-for filling the earth with the glory of the Lord is to be accomplished evidently declared?<a name=116:12></a> -- a work in which man has no part, and which is not the gospel but Christ's power.<a name=116:13></a>

		The world which exists now is a new world, reserved for fire in the day of judgment.<a name=132:8></a> In this world there are two great principles: <i>rule</i> in the hands of men -- and <i>separation from the world</i> by the call of God.<a name=132:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is easily corrupted; and men may shew themselves in this, and in everything else, unfaithful in maintaining the glory of God; but where there is the possibility of evil, where there are principles, which, left to themselves, might produce evil and misery, there the ordering of everything on divine principles, according to the will of God, is the first principle of happiness, which, in its character, embraces all the extent of the earth.<a name=132:10></a> This was the principle which, in its root, was established for the first time with Noah, for the guidance of that new world, which rose out of the ruins caused by lust and violence: "He who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.<a name=132:11></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:6">Genesis  9:6</a>.<a name=132:12></a> It was the authority of God over life, put into the hands of man, and for which he was to be responsible.<a name=132:13></a> The exercise of this power was the manifestation of the judgment of God, and recalled the holiness, the authority, and the constant watchfulness of the Most High.<a name=132:14></a> This at least was its true character.<a name=132:15></a> But in order that the value of this principle of rule should be recognised in its details, either by the governor, or the governed, it was necessary that the source

		<a name=133>[Page 133]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		whence it emanated should be acknowledged.<a name=133:1></a> The value of this principle was its recalling, to the heart and the eye, the authority of that God who had established it -- an authority which, thus recognised, would restrain the lusts of the flesh, ere they broke out in those acts to which the power of the sword itself was to be applied, and would even prevent the effects of those desires which were not sufficiently serious to come under the immediate application of the law.<a name=133:2></a> But not only do we see the head of this new world failing (in the very beginning) in self-government, and consequently losing the respect of him who ought to be the first to obey, even his own son; but we also perceive an evil and malicious spirit, who knew how to destroy the efficacy of this power in its very source, by appropriating it to himself -- presenting himself as the source both of the evils and blessings which resulted from man's conduct, or were the effect of the power and rule of God.<a name=133:3></a> And in the fallen and sinful state of man, he was able in some degree to verify his pretensions, or at least to cause them to be respected.<a name=133:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hereupon, then, came in the second principle; viz.<a name=133:5></a>, the call of God: a principle which (by separating one person, one people, one family, one assembly, which acknowledged the true God) was capable of rendering them witnesses of His character, and the theatre where He could display His power in accordance with that character.<a name=133:6></a> "And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.<a name=133:7></a> And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.<a name=133:8></a> And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan," etc.<a name=133:9></a> <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24:1">Joshua  24:1</a>-3.<a name=133:10></a> We see, in the history given in this passage, the occasion and the necessity of this call, which was a thing unheard of in all the provocations before the deluge.<a name=133:11></a> "Your fathers served other gods!<a name=133:12></a>" -- a fresh crime, a fresh snare of Satan, which called for new measures on the part of a God who is all goodness.<a name=133:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, whilst the pride of man was abased by the judgments of God, and served only to display His watchful power and to accomplish His providential designs, the substitution of the power of Satan in man's heart, under the form of false gods, as the originators of rule and the authors of judgment, gave occasion to Almighty God, who is ever able to extract good from evil, to display the other principle before mentioned, even the calling of God; and thus He glorified Himself, even by the perversities of His foolish creatures.<a name=134:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God called Abraham, who was a type (both according to the flesh and the spirit) of the family of God, and the depositary of all His promises.<a name=134:5></a> These are the terms of this call: "Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great: and thou shalt be a blessing: and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.<a name=134:6></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12:1">Genesis  12:1</a>-3.<a name=134:7></a> Here, in principle, was separation from the world, by breaking all its strongest ties and nearest relationships, in order that he might give himself to God alone, in heart, faith, and confidence.<a name=134:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle of national government and family authority remained in all its power, but Satan had seized upon it; and our gracious God, by drawing one family and nation nearer to Himself, introduced a new and powerful principle to make good His name, His character, and His grace, in the midst of that world, which had withdrawn from His providential judgments, by throwing itself into the hands of the great adversary of its happiness, as well as of the glory of God.<a name=134:9></a> The want of fidelity and power in man, under responsibility, was thus again shewn, in a manner fatal to the whole world; because his weakness had placed it in the hands and under the authority of Satan,

		Israel is found a prisoner in Babylon, or, what is still worse, united in desire and principle with the king of the apostate system, having "made a covenant with death," and being "at agreement with hell," saying, "When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us, for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28:15">Isaiah  28:15</a>: wretched refuge against the justice and the wrath of the Lord!<a name=152:6></a> The return from Babylon, when Cyrus was king, changed nothing in fact: "Behold we are servants this day," said Nehemiah (who felt the truth of the thing), "and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers, to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it: and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins; also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress," <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#9:36">Nehemiah  9:36</a>,37.<a name=152:7></a> And the Lord Himself, the legitimate King of the Jews, united Himself, in His infinite wisdom, to this confession of the state of His beloved Israel, in repelling their unholy temptations: "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.<a name=152:8></a>" The wretched Jews received a repulse, which left the weight of their wickedness on their own heads.<a name=152:9></a> Their malice and wretchedness reached their height when they said, "We have no other king but Caesar.<a name=152:10></a>" Although their state varied according to the character, the strength, or weakness of their rulers, yet were they always under the dominion of the Gentiles.<a name=152:11></a>

		We will quote some passages as proof of the accomplishment of these things: first, of the government of Christ in Israel, as powerful to subdue and drive out the enemies of His ancient people; and then of His being the peaceful Benefactor of them, and through them of the whole earth: in both cases joining together power and justice, which had long been separated.<a name=155:1></a> The cross of Christ was the complete overthrow of justice on earth.<a name=155:2></a> For the only just One was persecuted by the people whom He loved -- of whom He was the benefactor and the glory; condemned by him who represented the government of the world, and who, nevertheless, declared His innocence; and at length apparently, and in one sense really, forsaken of God and given up to the justice of Him He had appealed to.<a name=155:3></a> This is what the cross was to the world.<a name=155:4></a> The church, which views these things in their heavenly light, sees in them, not the judgment of the patient Jesus, but of that world which rejected Him.<a name=155:5></a> It sees heavenly justice in the abandonment on the cross (divine love having provided a lamb for a sacrifice) -- a justice which made good the rights of that victim, not by helping Him in this sinful and wretched world, where He finished the work of salvation, but by receiving Him to that place which was the only real witness of His righteousness and the glory of His Person; namely, to the right hand of the Majesty on high.<a name=155:6></a> The church, consequently, partaking of the righteousness and glory of Christ, should seek rather the fellowship of the sufferings of her Head, than the participation of that false glory which drove Him from the earth (see <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>); expecting that which He expects -- that His enemies be made His footstool.<a name=155:7></a>

		We cannot, I think, interpret the divine word in the book of the Revelation with the same confined sense that the ancient prophecies carry; because the church has the mind of Christ, and is supposed not merely to have particular facts communicated to it, but to understand the thoughts of God about, or as manifested in, those facts.<a name=167:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To take an example: I read in Isaiah, "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor brought to mind.<a name=167:2></a> But rejoice ye for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.<a name=167:3></a>" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#65:17">Isaiah  65:17</a>.<a name=167:4></a> Now here, I find this vast and blessed expectation of the new heavens and the new earth brought down to a definite joy connected with earthly associations, and resulting from known though new enjoyments and blessings; coming indeed fresh from the hand of God, and, therefore, real and divine blessings, but restricted to a given and earthly sphere, and to definite facts.<a name=167:5></a>

		Could the church confine itself to this sphere?<a name=167:6></a> or are such its apprehensions created by the testimony of a new heavens and a new earth?<a name=167:7></a> Clearly not.<a name=167:8></a> The mind of God -- the glory of Christ -- the deliverance of the whole groaning creation of which (in the marvellous love of God, and the power of that worthiness which makes it due to Christ, according to the counsel of grace and glory which unites them to Him) the church is a fellow-heir with Christ -- the being like Him, and seeing Him as He is, displayed in the same love of the Father in which He is, that the world may know it -- the savour of that love which can delight not only in its own blessing, but by its divine nature, in the blessing of others -- and the filling of all things with the divine glory, first mediatorially, and then directly -- these are the thoughts (with the blessing of banished sin, perfected holiness, and the restoration of all things) which would occupy the mind of the church as having the Spirit.<a name=167:9></a>

		It is not my object here to enter into the detail of instruction given to the churches, though it be most personally precious; turning attention here rather to the structure and prophetic character of the Apocalypse.<a name=177:2></a> And, as briefly as I may, I add, therefore, here merely the order of the statements made to these churches, and their condition, that they may stand together before the mind of the reader of the Apocalypse.<a name=177:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, declension from first love, and the Lord taking the place of examination and judgment.<a name=177:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, persecution: Christ the overcomer of death, a giver of the crown of life.<a name=177:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, dwelling in the world, to wit, where Satan's throne is (the prince of this world), yet Christ's witness amongst them where Satan dwelleth, suffering faithfully: with this, the beginning of teaching error for reward, and allowance of evil and low practice.<a name=177:6></a> Christ would fight against them (to wit, as an adversary) if they did not repent.<a name=177:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourthly, a state of increased devotedness in patience, charity, and works; but Jezebel, teaching communion with an evil and idolatrous world; and suffered.<a name=177:8></a> Space had been given for her repentance, but she did not (note here, it is a woman, not some of them).<a name=177:9></a> Judgment would fall on her followers, but discriminating -- to every one according to his works, and no further burden laid on the faithful.<a name=177:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here begins another distinction, that, whereas the reward promised was, previously, after the warning to hear, from this point it comes regularly before.<a name=177:11></a> On this fearful judgments, and the Lord's coming first introduced and the morning star, and the kingdom on the earth substituted for the professing church.<a name=177:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fifthly, a name to live, but no reality; profession of being alive as something distinctive: but there were, however, things remaining and a few names.<a name=177:13></a> The Lord, if they did not repent, would come on them like a thief: here the church, in this state, judged like the world.<a name=177:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sixthly, weakness, but an open door, marked, not by detailed works, but keeping the word of Christ, of His patience, and not denying His name.<a name=177:15></a> They would be kept from an hour of temptation, which was coming on all the world to try the dwellers upon earth.<a name=177:16></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#24">Isaiah  24</a>.<a name=177:17></a>

		Seventhly, the church to be spued out of His mouth without proposal of repentance, because of what they had become, yet counsel given; and if any one who has remained within and heard when Christ knocked still at the door, that one would be with Him.<a name=178:1></a>

		These addresses, however, as we have remarked, come in incidentally.<a name=178:3></a> John was to write the things he saw.<a name=178:4></a> But this was not properly his vision, but came in afterwards, generally under the things that are, and that only as a consequence.<a name=178:5></a>

		In the fourth chapter we come to the next branch of the subject -- the things <i>after these</i>, or (as it is here translated) which must be hereafter, taking up chapter 1:19.<a name=178:6></a>

		If we take the former part as the protracted condition of the church dispensation, then this will be the power of the throne of Him who was, and is, and is to come,<a href="#178:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> (the Lamb being still, however, there), exercised over the world, after the close of this dispensation, yet properly before the beginning of the next.<a name=178:7></a> If we take the former part as the things which actually then were (and, doubtless, such actually existed), then it is the governance of the world, when the church had no formal recognised existence on earth which could be called the habitation of God in any full sense, though just as dear to Him individually as regards salvation.<a name=178:8></a> I believe both these thoughts are intended for the church.<a name=178:9></a> In the former case we have literal fulfilment of the prophecy which follows; in the latter, analogies in a protracted period.<a name=178:10></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#179:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>History was not written in heaven. I believe that the attempt to interpret prophecy by history has been most injurious to the ascertaining of its real meaning. When we have ascertained, by the aid of the Spirit of Christ, the mind of God, we have, as far as it be history, God's estimate of events, and their explanation. But history is man's estimate of events, and he has no right to assume that these are in prophecy at all, and it is clear that he must understand prophecy before he can apply it to any: when he understands it, he has what God meant to give him, without going farther. I do not admit history to be, in any sense, necessary to the understanding of prophecy. I get present facts, and God's moral account of what led to them, and thereby His moral estimate of them: I do not want history to tell me Nineveh or Babylon is ruined, or Jerusalem in the hands of the Gentiles. Of course, where any prophecy does apply to facts, it is a true history of those facts; but it is much more. It is the connection of those facts with the purposes of God in Christ, and whenever any isolated fact, however important in the eyes of man, is taken as the fulfilment of a prophecy, that prophecy is made of private interpretation; and this I believe to be the meaning of that passage. Of course, when any prophecy is fulfilled, the fulfilment is evidence of its truth, but the Christian does not need this; and evidence of truth and interpretation are two very different things.

Though thus owned, therefore, vengeance could not be taken for this little space, till this was done. But then the heavens were changed to prepare for this vengeance. In the trumpets, note that there is no evil on the saints, or any saints, but judgment on the earth or its inhabiters. The last suffering (i.e., as to death) of these "brethren" seems a transition point, the act of the beast in its last state, as coming out of the bottomless pit, getting rid of them in that power, to the comfort of the inhabiters of the earth whom they tormented. They stood before the God of the earth. <p>Some would account this the time of the catching up of the church; but this appears to me a mistake. It is the time, rather, of their public owning before the throne, consequent upon the change in the heavens previously spoken of, and previous to the commencement of the judgments. The hundred and forty-four thousand are, in that case, the Jewish remnant, then owned upon earth. Looked at as the church, in its own portion, it is looked at, I apprehend, as in the heavens from the end of chapter 3. It is quite done with on earth there.

For the sources of power in the heavens must be changed before the day of the Lord come, though Satan may be raging upon earth; against whose earthly doings, and upon them, the day may come. See @Joel 2; @Mark 13: 24, 25. The extent and importance of this revolution in the heavens I believe not to be sufficiently attended to ordinarily. The earth may have been often shaken, and have reverted to its course, because the heavens are not. But when the heavens are, the sources of power are changed, and the enemy cast out; and he never regains that place, though, when loose, he may still act in opposition -- fruitless opposition -- on earth; for then the judgment is come, the heavens being so established and ruling.

But I take it, water is always viewed as under active moral influences of some sort, when living, in power; when the sea, it may be acted on merely; when fountains, it may be the spring of their influences, as the rivers would be their source; and therefore, according to the form of its use, it would be the source, or effects, of these moral influences on the mass of the population (what we call "the people"), and hence, the moral popular condition as a whole, the respective form of water indicating its particular character. The springs of waters, the sources of this influenced condition: "From the fountain of Israel," looked at Israel as the source of the whole nation. Thus he stamped their relative character on all that flowed from him: and hence, it might be applied perhaps directly to a teacher, or rather existing set of teachers -- fountains of waters: for where they are, they characterise the people; as men say, "Like people, like priest."

		Thus, this little open book gave the historical account (when it assumed its place in external history) of the state of things under the great apostasy, in order to closing the whole scene as a history in the seventh trumpet; while the detail of the apostasy, its origin and source (before it was matter of the church's progressive history at all), the power and intent of Satan as manifested in it, were reserved for a distinct account (that is, all its moral workings and developments).<a name=194:8></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#194:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>But the historical continuance is then not immediate; but from the state of things consequent on the position of the parties, more particularly from the flight of the woman into the wilderness, the previous verses being merely to shew what had brought the parties into this condition, that the strength of the man-child was not at first put forth, but taken out of the way -- then there was a process by which the heavens were first cleared; and then that by which, after its full heading up against Christ, apostate power was put down. The thing to be noted here, as to order, is, that the war seems to be before the powers of heaven were changed, with which the fifth, sixth, and seventh seals must be compared. I do not see that the owning of the saints, in the fifth, involves the changing of the heavens. The sixth seems, however, to do so.<p>The order which these passages would involve, as to the final crisis, would be this: The three seals after the first are the beginning of sorrows; during this period the faithful witnesses on earth were liable to be killed, and the gospel of the kingdom was preached among the Gentiles. At the fifth seal the heavens are changed. The abomination of desolation is set up in the midst of the last week. A time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation, the dragon persecuting the woman. The woman flees. Those in Judea flee to the mountains. <p>The sixth seal is opened: and, before the winds blow, the remnant are sealed, and the palm-bearing multitude seen clothed in white. The cry of the remnant on earth brings judgment down there; as the cry from under the altar in the fifth seal had brought on the sixth. Then come the trumpet-judgments in succession, the last involving the final judgment.<p>The only point that remains is, when is Satan cast down? The twelfth chapter takes in the whole course of the book, in its sources within, to introduce the last agents as objects of judgment announced in heaven on the seventh trumpet sounding. That chapter shews, as noticed, the first act to be catching clean out of the way Him who is to rule the nations; and the whole question all goes on after that. The next step is, not changing the heavens, but war there; and then the adversary and accuser is cast down. This is clearly before the last three and a half years when there is tribulation, and before the tribulation and fleeing takes place; at least it seems to me so. The changing of the heavens is after that, or rather thereupon. I only state, then, as to this, that upon these passages, the casting down of the dragon, as to the crisis, seems to be some time previous to the setting up of the abomination, after the catching up of the saints, i.e., before or in the period of the first four or five seals. The sixth would be the effect of it.<p>It is clear that the appearing of the Son of man is subsequent to these changes in the heavens, from Matthew, Mark, Joel; and indeed the whole course and order of these mighty dealings of God's judgment. The appearing of His coming destroys the man of sin. @Isaiah 24 may be referred to here.

A voice accordingly is heard in heaven; but it clearly expresses the mind of God in the church above; for it says "the accuser of our brethren," and has the prospect of the kingdom as now come. It is as a gleaming out of the church's joy in heaven, before the saints are manifested with Christ, on the cessation of the sufferings of those left on earth, and the clearing of the heavenlies. The voice of heaven, the church, is here rather identified with the priesthood and expectation of Christ, but that in a triumphant character, because accomplished by the casting down of Satan, and the kingdom now come, though not yet established for three years and a half upon earth.<p>I apprehend the proper application of the catching up of the man-child, besides Christ, to be to the Church of the first-born -- His body, and to be undated, save by its precedence of all ulterior events, i.e., of all events below, and even of the war in heaven; for Christ and His body cannot take their new relative place on earth, till Satan and his angels are cast down.

Its date in the course of events may be seen in @Matthew 24 and @Mark 13; but it forms no part of the course of mere human events, but is a change in the heavenly administration of their order. But the war in heaven, and the consequent casting down of Satan to earth, do alter altogether the relative position of the saints, heaven, and earth. The direct administrative exercise of all this is deferred for three years and a half, to give time for the ripening of God's purposes, the separation of the remnant of the Jews in their tribulation, and the full satanic rising of the earth against heaven: but heaven could announce its joy at once, and woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea. But, the administration not being yet changed, things otherwise went on unrebuked, until the earth being worse far by this, and in satanic energy enlisted against heaven, the Son of man has to take the power into His own hands, and the administration itself is changed. Then begins the administration of the world to come, whereof we speak. This last is a most important, and scripture speaks of it as a very solemn, event. It is what I apprehend is called the end: "Then shall the end come." Sinai was the manifest beginning; though there were other points connected with it in the world and earth, to wit, Noah and Nebuchadnezzar.

Hence, we have the celebration of the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have kept themselves pure; and afterwards, distinct, those who have got the victory over the beast. It does not follow that some of them may not have been involved in both trials, or have kept themselves from one, and suffered under the other, but they are treated as distinct subjects; and there may be those who are under the trial of the beast's actings, in general, preparatory to his final conflict in Judea, who have never been in the circumstances, at any rate fully, of the hundred and forty-four thousand. They are numbered before Babylon falls. The warning against the beast has its peculiar force after. That chapter 13 has had accomplishment in the protracted period of years, may easily be understood; and if applied to what is closing, its application is rather preparatory, not final; when the second beast falls, as a false prophet merely (his secular character as a beast gone), this change has taken place in him; he has lost his secular character and power as a beast, and is merely a false prophet. It seems to me that all this is previous to the last actings of Antichrist in Judea as the wilful king¦ they are quite distinct in character. This is preparatory in order to bring them, the dwellers on earth, into his subjection, and carry them with him. The whole, save the period of his blasphemous continuance, is not here date, but character, or doings. He may draw after him the Gentile dwellers upon earth in this way; and, when in the land, the same process may locally and specifically continue there. The only date to the second beast is the restoration of the wounded (as I suppose) imperial head.

When the beast falls in Palestine, the second beast is merely viewed as a false prophet; his person as kingly seems superceded by the beast's presence. As in @Isaiah 24, the difficulty is as to the force of earth. The whole passage requires maturer consideration. Note, the world, and kindred, tongues, and nations are not formally put under the influence of the second beast.

		<a class="footnote" name="#225:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>We have the distinction of periods, I think, very distinctly marked in @Daniel 7. The character of the little horn -- the last evil form of presumption against the Most High in the beast -- we have in verse 8: that is, its character before God. The prophet saw this till the thrones were set; in 9 and 10, judgment set and books opened, not now the time of testimony. Then again he beholds till the beast was slain (verse 11), because of the little horn's great words. After this, the Son of man's kingdom is spoken of as given; this in connection with the Lord. The saints, whether of the heavenly places or simply saints, are introduced in the explanation (verse 21); the character of the horn, as to the saints, is given -- saints, whether of the heavenlies or not -- it is the horn's character. Then this is till, first, the Ancient of days comes; then, judgment is given to the saints of the heavenlies; thirdly, the saints, heavenly or on earth, possess the kingdom. As to the acting of the little horn explained, we have, first, his presumption against the Most High; next, he wears out the saints of the heavenlies, and takes the Jewish times and festivals into his power, and they are given up to him for a prescribed period; then, the judgment sits, as in the close of verses 10, 11. Verse 25 seems to me, then, properly the three years and a half antecedent to the commencement of the judgment or the judgment-sitting; after that there is a process goes on to take away, to consume, and to destroy; and then the kingdom, under the whole heaven, is given to the *people of the* saints of the Most High, thus connecting the earthly people at Jerusalem, the city of the great King, with the heavenly people.<p>Chapter 8 I conclude to be an entirely different and opposed enemy; and I believe the confounding the Assyrian and Antichrist¦ has much tended to obscure prophecy, and embroil the mind as to the simplicity of its statements. One is the enemy of Christ as coming from heaven with the saints; the other His enemy, as associated with the accepted remnant of the Jews at Jerusalem. I see no reason to suppose that "they shall be given into his hand" (@Daniel 7:25) means the saints, but rather times and laws.

Any diligent student of the gospels will see the transition, from promises presented to the Jews in the Person of Christ in the flesh, to this everlasting gospel.

And this last, while I fully recognise what precedes as involving the principles, is the strong final sense of the passage, and therefore, as noticed in the preceding note, God is announced as a Creator, who had a right to His creatures, and presented Himself as such to men on the earth, as against all their idolatries, resuming (first in testimony) His place as God in the earth. Babylon, which had been the great corrupter of the earth, and the centre of idolatry, is next judged of God.<p>There is another point connected with the hundred and forty-four thousand and the everlasting gospel. The hundred and forty-four thousand are redeemed from the earth, where the testimony is already a redemption from the midst of prevailing evil in the limited sphere so designated -- in the crisis, probably, entirely confined to the land. Before the judgment ("the end") comes, the everlasting gospel goes out afresh to the nations (many of them, doubtless, in actual idolatry) to announce the coming judgment, and to testify the good news of the coming millennial kingdom and blessedness. These two spheres -- earth, and people and tongues and nations and languages -- we have noticed as contrasted in repeated instances.

This distinction is only what we actually find in the interpretation of that parable in Matthew. In the parable, the tares are gathered in bundles in the field, and the wheat into the garner: in the explanation, the tares are burned in the field, and the righteous shine forth. This is precisely the difference, and only this, I make here. The harvest and vintage are two acts of judgment, the harvest being of much wider scope; and, accordingly, in it there is not clear riddance of the corners of the field as to the wheat. It may distinctively clear and take the wicked, leaving those spared for earthly blessing. The vintage is pure vengeance on a specific object (the religious system), which has its character from earth -- in the crisis, I apprehend, Jewish. Its grapes are now fully ripe. This vengeance is actual earthly judgment: "blood came out of the wine-press" far and wide. It was an actual and dreadful judgment in the land. All these -- all the contents of this chapter -- are God's religious warnings or dealings with the earth.

		<a class="footnote" name="#232:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There may be an application of what passes in this chapter to the crisis; and, in such case, many dates would be ascertained, but the application is less particular of part. Thus the song, being before the throne of God, must be taken only as the commencing association of heavenly with earthly things, and the recognition of the earthly by the heavenly powers. The Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, would recognise the return of the Jews into suffering associated with the Lamb amongst them in grace (that is, of a remnant among them). The everlasting gospel would then be strictly that mentioned in Matthew, "the gospel of the kingdom" (i.e., that Christ was just coming in His kingdom), which I have no doubt will so go out in all nations before the end. The fall of Babylon would precede the harvest of the earth, and then the last time of trouble would be to the Jewish people such as never was, and Michael would stand up for them, and the sanctuary at length be cleansed. In this case, I am inclined to think, the vine of the earth would be rather the Jewish part of profession, as in @Isaiah 65 and 66. Such judgment is certain. But there will be also the apostasy to be destroyed; but that is rather in war against the royalty of Christ then, and has assumed a worse form than mere apostasy or profession. Viewed in this light, "without the city" would, in the general application, refer to the great city of the corporate Roman empire; in the application in crisis it would, as before, be taken for Jerusalem.<p>In the application in the text (page 229) of the claim of true worship, there are most important principles -- the acknowledging God, not man, as the source in creative power of every blessing, or order of blessing, or power, or streams and fountains of true influence, and consequent condition of men -- than which there cannot be a more important principle possible for daily use. The sense given above in the text I believe to be the most important for the church in the present time.

But the exclusion of the ecclesiastical character in this place seems to me a great error: it is the virus of her active will in this place, though clothed with the world. She is not viewed here as the city of the apostate king at all, though, in the worldly sense, she may be the beginning of his kingdom He comes in here, as the eighth head of the beast, supplanting the woman. The kings lay her waste to give their power to him; for power, not wealth, is the last form of evil presented, and that against the Lamb, which is true, active rebellion, and more than mere apostasy. God therefore judges Babylon; and the destroyers of her wealth and importance are those who give their kingdom to the beast: thereupon and then war against the Lamb comes. I have no doubt the principles of Babylon were manifested in her -- not royal power. Though Babylon was the beginning of his power in whom royal power was first displayed, yet it was specially what the confederate will of man had done; its first form was confederate will in independence of God. This is shewn in the character which constituted the whore, yet had its development by her corruption and fornication: and the effects of this are supplanted by another confederacy, which is not only apostasy, as all human will apart from God is, but active war against God's King, the Lamb.<p>As to the ten kings, I would here also notice, what, not being the direct subject of the book, I have not noticed hitherto. It appears to me a mistake to include the Grecian or eastern part of the Roman empire in the ten kings or direct power of the beast, though he may seek to possess himself of it as his dominion, and in a measure may do so. The little book of the eleventh chapter takes up the beast in his last satanic character, in order to complete the scene of the final catastrophe and woe; but the first two woes seem to me to embrace the eastern or Grecian part of the great scene of the prophetic earth. When we come to the geographical divisions and actings at the close (for all are aware that the catastrophe of all the powers of the earth is in the east, in Judea), then the king of the north and the king of the south seem to me to occupy the Grecian part, not the ten kings, though the beast may be seeking to possess himself, as of old, of their territory, and may in part succeed. I allude here to @Daniel 11, as may readily be seen.

He exercises his power thus as influence, secretly, as false worship. He is the object of false worship; and hence, in this dispensation, he works by the corruption of Christian profession; and yet this still as the god of this world, which title he cannot lose, for it is all he has: "the course of this world ... the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience." @Ephesians 2:2. This is said of him as still in the heavenlies.<p>False worship, as the source of power, would be its heathen character; false worship, as the source or means of fellowship, its Babylonish character in the Christian dispensation. In a word, this is rather His anti-priestly character and spiritual influence: the man of sin, or lawless one, is not revealed. Power continues outwardly owned of God, and the letter [he that letteth] remains. When he is cast down, he loses this character, which is opposed to Christ as Priest, and to Him as acting by His Spirit in maintaining the holy communion of His saints and washing their feet. He then raises power as of earth (the king doing according to his will) against the heavens, for he has no place in them even falsely. He could render his influence as anti-priest paramount to supreme civil authority, which is of God, using the name of God falsely in religion; but he cannot, save in open rebellion when cast down, bring power against God. [The substance of this note is of great importance; only it must not be supposed that the first sentence is to be taken strictly as the existence of Babylon. But I apprehend there will be a total change when Satan is cast down, perhaps practically prepared before. The principles, I have no doubt, are already at work.]

	<div class="paragraph">
		In pursuing this study, we shall find, according to the measure of light which is given to us, a very beautiful result, namely, a full development of the perfections of God under two names or characters, according to which He has revealed Himself in relationship to man.<a name=282:2></a> To the Jews, it is as Jehovah that He makes Himself known (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6:3">Exodus  6:3</a>); to the church, it is as Father.<a name=282:3></a> In a word, as that which is predicted by the mouth of the prophets as to the Jews gives us the character of Jehovah -- His faithfulness and all His attributes; so that which is prophesied concerning the church opens out to us the name of Father.<a name=282:4></a> The church is in relationship with the Father, and the Jews with Jehovah, which is the characteristic name of their relationship with God.<a name=282:5></a> Jesus, in consequence, is presented to the Jews as the Messiah, the centre of the promises and of the blessings of Jehovah to that nation; to the church He appears as the Son of God, gathering to Himself His "many brethren," sharing with us His title and privileges, those, namely, of "children of God," members of His "family," "joint-heirs with Christ, the firstborn among many brethren," who is the expression of all the glory of His Father.<a name=282:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the dispensation of the fulness of times, when God will gather together all things in Christ, then will be also realised in its fullest sense the name in which He revealed Himself to Abraham, the father of the faithful: that name under which He has been celebrated by Melchisedec (a type of the royal Priest, who will be the centre as well as the assurance of the common blessing of the united earth and heavens), the name of "the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth.<a name=282:7></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the three objects which have been mentioned in the first lecture as about to form the subject of our study, that of the church and its glory is to have the first place.<a name=282:8></a> It introduces us to the name of Father, the character in which God has revealed Himself to us, and whence flow to the church, the fruits of grace, and all the circumstances of its state of glory,

		as everything flowed to Israel from the name of Jehovah.<a name=283:1></a> To this name of Father, however, is to be added another relationship, distinctly marked in the epistle to the Ephesians, and closely allied to the principal one, namely, that the Father has given the church to Christ as His bride, so that it will fully participate in all His glory.<a name=283:2></a> In adopting us for His children, the Father has associated us with the dignities and glory of the Son, "firstborn among many brethren," <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a>.<a name=283:3></a> As the bride of Jesus, we enjoy, in virtue of His incomparable love to us, all the privileges that belong to Him.<a name=283:4></a> "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand," <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a>.<a name=283:5></a> This is the first great truth we desire to set out from.<a name=283:6></a> And as the Son has glorified the Father, so the Father will glorify the Son.<a name=283:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our second point is: we shall participate in the glory of the Son; as it is said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:22">John  17:22</a>, "And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them"; and it is in order that the world may know that the Father loves us as He loves Jesus Himself.<a name=283:8></a> In seeing us in the same glory, the world will be convinced that we are the objects of the same love; and the glory which we shall have at the last day will be but the manifestation of this precious and astonishing truth.<a name=283:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the hope of the church is not alone salvation, that is, to escape the wrath of God, but to have the glory of the Son Himself.<a name=283:10></a> That in which the perfection of its joy consists is the being loved by the Father, and by Jesus; and, in consequence of this love, the being glorified.<a name=283:11></a> But more than thus, the Father would have us enter into the full intelligence of these riches, and has even given us the firstfruits by the presence of the Holy Ghost in all those who are saved.<a name=283:12></a> Before we follow up these thoughts by other testimonies from the word of God, let us look into the chapter before us.<a name=283:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the very first lines, God presents Himself as a Father, and in the relationships already indicated.<a name=283:14></a> He is "<i>our</i> Father (verse 2), and "the Father of our <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>" (verse 3).<a name=283:15></a> From this until verse 8 the apostle expounds salvation.<a name=283:16></a> God "has made us accepted in the beloved" -- this "to the praise of the glory of his <i>grace</i>," in God's presence, in conformity to His nature, and adopted as children to the Father.<a name=283:17></a> We have redemption through Christ's blood.<a name=283:18></a> This is according to the riches of God's grace.<a name=283:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verses 8 to 10, We see that this grace of salvation
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=284>[Page 284]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		introduces us by its actual power, by the Holy Spirit, into the knowledge of the proposed purpose or decree of God as to the glory of Christ; a touching proof, as we have before remarked, of the love of God, who treats us as His friends, and tranquillises our souls, in an ineffable manner, in making us see the termination of all the efforts and all the agitation of the men of this world.<a name=284:1></a> The decreed purpose of God is this, God will "gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth.<a name=284:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Until verse 8, we have seen our predestination to the state of children of the Father, and the actual accomplishment of salvation.<a name=284:3></a> "<i>We have redemption</i> through his blood.<a name=284:4></a>" In that which follows, we have the purpose of God, as to the glory of Christ, in relation with all things; afterwards, from verse 11, our participation, yet future, in the glory thus designated; and, further, the sealing of the Holy Spirit whilst we are waiting in expectation of this glory.<a name=284:5></a> "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance .<a name=284:6></a>.<a name=284:7></a>.<a name=284:8></a> that we should be to the praise of his glory.<a name=284:9></a>" Previous to verse 8, it had been "to the praise of the glory of his grace.<a name=284:10></a>" Now it is "to the praise of his glory"; and then, "after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our <i>inheritance until the redemption</i> of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.<a name=284:11></a>" The remainder of the chapter is a prayer of the apostle, that the faithful may understand their hope, and that the power of the resurrection and of the exaltation of Christ, to whom the church is united, may be accomplished in them, a power which works towards them as believers.<a name=284:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This position of the church, which enjoys its own redemption, and which waits for the redemption of the inheritance, has its perfect type in Israel.<a name=284:13></a> This people, redeemed from Egypt, did not enter at once into Canaan, but into the wilderness, whilst the land itself remained still in the possession of the Canaanites.<a name=284:14></a> The redemption of Israel was finished, the redemption of the inheritance was not.<a name=284:15></a> The heirs were redeemed, but the inheritance was not yet delivered out of the hands of the enemy.<a name=284:16></a> "Now all these things," says the apostle (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:11">1 Corinthians  10:11</a>), "happened unto them" [the Israelites] "for types, and they are written for our admonition" [the church], "upon whom the ends of the world are come.<a name=284:17></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us keep in mind, then, these two fundamental points: -- Firstly, Christ, in the counsels of God, possesseth all things.<a name=285:5></a> Secondly, In virtue of being the bride of Christ, the church participates in all that He has, and in all that He is, except His eternal divinity, although in a sense we do participate in the divine nature.<a name=285:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look through the passages which furnish the thoughts we have been giving out.<a name=285:7></a> All things, we say, are for Christ.<a name=285:8></a> "He is appointed heir of all things," <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a>.<a name=285:9></a> They belong to Him of right, because He is their Creator; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:15">Colossians  1:15</a>-18.<a name=285:10></a> Observe, in this passage, two headships of Christ; first of all He is called "firstborn [or, chief] of every creature," then, "firstborn from the dead," "the head of the body, the church"; a distinction which throws much light on our subject.<a name=285:11></a> "All things were created by him, and for him.<a name=285:12></a> Moreover, He will possess them as man, as last Adam, to whom God has intended in His counsels to subject them.<a name=285:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thus that we read in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, which is applied to Christ by Paul (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:6">Hebrews  2:6</a>), and is, in fact, the corner stone of the doctrine of the apostle upon this subject.<a name=285:14></a> He cites the psalm

Speaking as a prophet, Christ announced His coming as the terrible judgment which was to fall upon an unbelieving nation; but the counsel of God as to this judgment, or at least as to the moment of its approach, was contained in those words, Sit thou at my right hand *until* ... ." Christ as a servant waited (as always, and this was His perfection) upon the will of His Father, and to receive the kingdom when the Father would have it so. It is worthy of remark that @Psalm 110 and @Mark 13 refer exactly to the same subject. The enemies are the Jews who rejected Him (@Luke 19:27).

		Again, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, this same fact, the glorification of Jesus, and the subjection of all things to Him, is shewn to us, but still in another point of view, that is, as about to take place at the resurrection, according to the power of which Jesus has been declared the last Adam, and withal head of a kingdom which He will possess as Man, and which He will eventually deliver up to God the Father, whilst He Himself, as last Adam, is to be "subject unto him that put all things under him," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:28">1 Corinthians  15:28</a> instead of reigning as Man, as He had been doing, over all things -- all things, we say, except over Him who will have subjected them to Him.<a name=286:7></a>

		An important distinction results from the passages we have been citing: it is this, that besides the reconciliation of the church, there is the reconciliation of all things.<a name=287:3></a> You may have perceived this in the chapter, with the reading of which the lecture began: we saw that the proposed intention of God was to gather together all things in Christ; that the reconciliation of the church is represented, in the verses which precede verse 8, as a thing accomplished, and the glory as a thing future, of which we have as yet but the earnest in the presence of the Holy Spirit in us after having believed.<a name=287:4></a> But we see in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:19">Romans  8:19</a>-23 that the deliverance of creation will take place at the time of the manifestation of the sons of God.<a name=287:5></a> As to the present, that is, the time during which Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, everything is in a state of misery, the whole creation remains in the bondage of corruption.<a name=287:6></a> It is true that we are redeemed, and that even the price for the redemption of creation has been given; and more than this, we have received the firstfruits of the Spirit as earnest of the glory.<a name=287:7></a> But all this is but our expecting state, until the Most High enters upon the exercise of His power, until He reigns, and becomes possessor in fact, as He is by right, of the heavens and the earth.<a name=287:8></a> Inhabiting in our bodies a fallen creation, whilst indeed by the Spirit we are united to Christ, we have, on the one hand, the assurance of being children "accepted in the beloved," and the joy of the hope of the inheritance by the Spirit which is the earnest of it; but, upon the other hand, by the same Spirit, we give utterance, inasmuch as we are in the body, to the sighs and groanings of the creation, being participators therein owing to this body of death.<a name=287:9></a> All is in disorder; but we know Him who has redeemed us and made us heirs of all things, and who has introduced us into the enjoyment of the love of the Father: we enjoy these privileges; but, understanding also the blessings which will be shed upon the inheritance, when Christ shall take it and we shall appear with Him in glory, perceiving likewise the miserable state in which the scene of His future dominion actually is, we serve,

But there are insurmountable obstacles in applying "the abomination of desolation" to the army of Titus, or to the Roman ensigns. For there is a period which dates from this event, of which we see no fulfilment, in counting from the taking of Jerusalem. So that it has been found necessary to transport this part of prophecy to popery, which we know has nothing to do with the invasion of Titus. The passage in Luke would seem to have more to do with the events which took place at the taking of Jerusalem by Titus; but again I say, to attempt to apply the passages which have been occupying us to this event is to lose our time.

		<h3>LECTURE 4 -- <a href="../bible/LUKE.htm#20:17">LUKE  20:17</a> -- FIRST RESURRECTION; OR, RESURRECTION OF THE JUST</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject which I propose for this evening's lecture, is the resurrection, and particularly the resurrection of the church apart; that is, the resurrection of the just as altogether distinct from that of the unjust.<a name=301:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already spoken of Christ, the Heir of all things; of the church as co-heir with Him; and of the coming of Christ to reign before the thousand years -- an event which we must not confound with the day of the resurrection of the unjust, and of the judgment before the great white throne, which will not take place until after the millennium.<a name=301:2></a> We have now to see that the church will participate in this coming of Christ; it does so as the subject of the first resurrection.<a name=301:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no need to speak to you of the resurrection of Jesus as being the seal of His mission; it is an admitted truth; it is enough to quote <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:4">Romans  1:4</a>, where the apostle tells us that "Jesus Christ was declared to be the Son of God with power .<a name=301:4></a>.<a name=301:5></a>.<a name=301:6></a> by the resurrection of the dead.<a name=301:7></a>"<a href="#301:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This resurrection was the great fact which demonstrated that Jesus is the Son of God; but it was likewise, for other reasons, the great theme of the preaching of the apostles, the basis of their epistles, and of all the New Testament.<a name=301:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us commence by saying, that the difficulty people find in the subjects of which we are treating do not arise from the word of God not being simple, clear, and convincing; but from this -- that preconceived ideas often rob us of its natural sense.<a name=301:9></a> We have habits of thinking apart from the Scripture, before we know it; then it is we find inconsistencies -- incompatibility -- in that which presents itself to us, not suspecting that this incompatibility belongs alone to human preconceived opinions.<a name=301:10></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#301:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is not exclusively by His own resurrection, though there was the first and most important proof. The reader will do well to pay attention to the expression, "from among the dead," employed elsewhere. It is an expression distinct from the present, and indicates the introduction of a divine power into the realm of death -- a power which withdraws some from it in such a sort as to distinguish them completely from others. This it was that astonished the disciples (@Mark 9:10). Resurrection was the faith of every orthodox Jew; but what they did not understand was a resurrection *from among* the dead.

		The doctrine of the resurrection is important under more views than one.<a name=302:1></a> It links our hopes to Christ and to the whole church, in one word, to the counsels of God in Christ; it makes us understand that we are entirely set free in Him, by our participation in a life in which, united by the Holy Ghost to Him, He is also the source of all strength for glorifying Him, even from the present time; it sustains our hopes in the most solid manner; finally, it expresses all our salvation, inasmuch as it introduces us into a new creation, by which the power of God places us, in the second Adam, beyond the sphere of sin, of Satan, and of death.<a name=302:2></a> The soul in departing goes to Jesus, but is not glorified.<a name=302:3></a> The word of God speaks of men glorified, of glorified bodies; but never of glorified souls.<a name=302:4></a> But, as before observed, prejudices and human teachings have taken the place of the word of God, and the power and expectation of the resurrection has ceased to be the habitual state of the church.<a name=302:5></a>

		That which we learn, then, in general, of this beast, is, first, that from its beginning, the Roman empire has been guilty of the rejection of Jesus as king of the earth here below; secondly, that later in the time of this fourth monarchy, there is a little horn that speaketh great things; and, lastly, that this fourth beast, after having ceased to exist for a season, will reappear upon the scene out of the bottomless pit, and be destroyed on account of the great words which the little horn spoke.<a name=318:7></a> This beast is connected with a power described in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:9">2 Thessalonians  2:9</a>, "That wicked one, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders," whose destruction is found in verse 8.<a name=318:8></a> There is another description of the last head of the beast (see <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#17:11">Revelation  17:11</a>), which is the beast himself.<a name=318:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Up to the present, dear friends, we have only spoken of the happiness that pertains to the church, save that, at our last meeting, we traced the progress which evil will make on the earth until the very end.<a name=321:5></a> This evil has a twofold character, upon which I will speak a few words, seeing that the relations which exist between the power of evil and the judgments which await it, have a special interest for the children of God.<a name=321:6></a> When the evil has come to its height, God will destroy it.<a name=321:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The verses which I read are the interpretation which the angel gives to Daniel of the vision of the beasts which the prophet saw; and, as always occurs in symbolic prophecies, the interpretation contains many new features.<a name=321:8></a> In the explanation given to Daniel, all that will happen to the saints is added; but the principal subject of the chapter is the beast who exalts and elevates himself against the most high God.<a name=321:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say, dear friends, that there are two characters in the evil which manifests itself on the earth: the first is ecclesiastical apostasy; and the second, apostasy of the civil power itself.<a name=321:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, apostasy of the church -- viewed in its outward responsibility here below -- has in principle taken place.<a name=321:11></a> Later on there will be a more open manifestation.<a name=321:12></a> As to the second, the civil power will rise against Him to whom all government belongs -- against Christ, whom God will establish king over the earth.<a name=321:13></a> It is in the time of the fourth beast, the Roman empire, that this revolt will take place.<a name=321:14></a>

		Before entering directly on our subject of today, I desire to make a few remarks on <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>, to which we shall return when we speak of the nations; for all the peoples of the earth which shall exist at the end of the times shall be either subject to Christ and, consequently, saved, or in rebellion and, consequently, destroyed.<a name=321:15></a> But to remove doubts on the subject of

	<div class="paragraph">
		this chapter, a few words must be said on it.<a name=322:1></a> People believe ordinarily that the judgment of which this chapter treats is the last or general judgment; but they are wrong.<a name=322:2></a> It is the judgment of the living nations on this earth, and not of the dead.<a name=322:3></a> Accordingly I did not speak of it when we treated of the resurrection of the dead.<a name=322:4></a> In this chapter of Matthew, I repeat, there is no question whatever of resurrection.<a name=322:5></a> In chapters 24 and 25 are seen the judgment of the Jews, what will happen to that nation; next, what will happen to believers; then, what will happen to the Gentiles.<a name=322:6></a> It is the judgment of the quick, and not of the dead.<a name=322:7></a> It is this when we read, "Before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.<a name=322:8></a>" What has given rise to the notion that it is the judgment of the dead is the statement that "these [the wicked] shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.<a name=322:9></a>" But this would only tell us that the judgment of the living would be <i>final</i> like that of the dead.<a name=322:10></a> Certainly, when God judges the living, His judgment sends some to eternal punishment and others to life eternal.<a name=322:11></a> The judgment of the living is as certain as that of the dead.<a name=322:12></a> We shall be able to speak of it in its place.<a name=322:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Last time I was speaking mostly upon the tares, that is, the ecclesiastical apostasy -- of the progress of evil there, -- of that which has happened to the church as on earth.<a name=322:14></a> Now I am going to look into the apostasy of the civil power in its outward form, and the judgment which will come on it from God; for His wrath will fall upon this power.<a name=322:15></a> If at the close, ecclesiastical evil in some sort disappears in the character of secular power; and if the civil power has exalted itself, ecclesiastical power, is not the less vigorous: only it has not the supremacy; and herein is the difference.<a name=322:16></a> In other words, it is not that ecclesiastical power has improved itself, only it is not exercised in the same way; but its influence is not the less pernicious.<a name=322:17></a> It is no longer an ecclesiastical power wielding the secular arm, which is seen riding on the beast, and ruling it; but it takes a more mysterious form, and consequently a more dangerous one.<a name=322:18></a> Its occult influence continues, though deprived of its outward splendour; for by their pride men now begin to lift themselves up and combine against God, and so prepare the way for the son of perdition.<a name=322:19></a>

		nevertheless, as we have been saying, civil apostasy will have its time of manifestation.<a name=323:1></a> Scripture tells us that all civil power is of God.<a name=323:2></a> Now, in the same way that the church loses its proper force and character by its rebellion against God, so the civil government will be found in a state of revolt and apostasy when, instead of confessing fealty to God, it sets itself up against God, who is the source of its authority.<a name=323:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God being the true strength of the church, the church's revolt begins when, instead of being subject to Christ, it gives itself over to the will and power of man, leans upon man's aid, and renounces truth to follow error.<a name=323:4></a> Christ is the Head: the Holy Spirit is the only strength by whose means the church can act; and when the church is not guided by the Spirit, and is not in this sense truly subject to Christ, Christendom is practically apostate.<a name=323:5></a> Now, at the end of the present dispensation, the civil power will be found in this same state of revolt; and be it remembered that apostasy in the civil power is a thing much more manifest and prominent than in the church.<a name=323:6></a> This will take place in the bosom of Christendom; and it would seem that ecclesiastical wickedness will be its moving power.<a name=323:7></a> We have examples of this in Scripture.<a name=323:8></a> When Absalom was in revolt against David, Ahithophel was his counsellor; <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#15">2 Samuel  15</a>.<a name=323:9></a> The instigator of the rebellion was, without doubt, Satan; but Ahithophel directed the conspiracy against the king.<a name=323:10></a> It was Dathan and Abiram, simple Israelites (though men of renown), who rebelled against Moses; but the revolt is called that of Korah, who was a Levite, and seduced the others.<a name=323:11></a> In the same way, God accuses the priests and the prophets of Judah of the iniquity of the people, since the civil power had only followed their evil counsels.<a name=323:12></a> The same has been the order of things in Christendom.<a name=323:13></a> Those who ought to have instructed the church who ought to have represented the wisdom of God, and have recalled governments to a sense of their duty towards God, being themselves in a revolt against Him, have concealed the truth, have taken a form which has seduced the world, and have thus led the civil power into the same departure from God.<a name=323:14></a> There will be a revolt of this latter, but the ecclesiastical power will be the soul of it.<a name=323:15></a>

		What do we find at Armageddon?<a name=323:16></a> A false prophet who falls there along with the beast.<a name=323:17></a> From the beginning to the end, there is always a beast, and with the beast a false prophet.<a name=323:18></a> It is the one or the other who guides the rebellion.<a name=323:19></a> But at the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the instant that the beast, or the civil power of the fourth monarchy, shall set himself in revolt against God, this monarchy will be found in relation with the Jews; and it is this which introduces us anew into the history of this people.<a name=324:4></a> You remember, dear friends, that when the fourth beast appeared on the scene of this earth, there were Jews at Jerusalem; Christ was presented as King of the Jews to the fourth beast, represented by Pontius Pilate, who rejected Him in this character which He is never to lose.<a name=324:5></a> At the end of the age the same fact will be reproduced: the Jews -- returned to their own land, though without being converted -- will find themselves in connection with the fourth beast.<a name=324:6></a> There will be saints among them; and this fourth beast, exalting himself against God, will put himself in direct opposition to Christ, as the King of the Jews.<a name=324:7></a> It is true, indeed, that his deadly opposition to Christ will go much farther than at the time when Christ stood before Pontius Pilate; for he will then arrogate to himself His rights as King of the Jews; and it is then that Christ, coming down from heaven, will destroy the beast, together with the Antichrist, and will take the remnant of the Jews to be His earthly people, and will put all nations under His feet.<a name=324:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This being the case, you will readily understand that many things in Scripture apply to the Jewish saints, that is, to this faithful remnant of the Jews, and not to the church.<a name=324:9></a> We know, e.<a name=324:10></a>g.<a name=324:11></a>, that, during the time of the ecclesiastical apostasy, there have been many persecutions against God's faithful children; in such cases, the saints of all times could draw comfort from the consolations of God found in such passages; but in these last times, when it is a question of persecution of the saints, the application must be made to the remnant of the Jews, whose "blood will be shed like water," <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#79:3">Psalm  79:3</a>.<a name=324:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we consider the history of the beast in a general manner, whether in its pagan form, as under Tiberias Caesar, and the other emperors; or, under the influence of the corrupted Christianity of the Middle Ages, we see there have been, at every succeeding epoch, persecutions against the saints; and we may use as of them the scriptural expressions, "And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth," <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#18:24">Revelation  18:24</a>.<a name=324:13></a>

		<a name=325>[Page 325]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when we come to the time when the civil power will openly raise the standard of revolt -- to the moment when these prophetic facts have their full realisation, it is upon the Jews that the persecutions will fall; to whom, therefore, these citations have their primary application.<a name=325:1></a> From the moment that the rights of Christ, as King of the Jews, are agitated, it is the Jews who will appear on the scene; for the Jews are God's earthly people.<a name=325:2></a> But where is the church then?<a name=325:3></a> It will be entirely out of the scene at the time of these last persecutions.<a name=325:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before we quote the chapters which treat of the apostate civil power substituted for the apostate ecclesiastical power, we would insist again upon this, that the revolt of the ecclesiastical power is not the less dangerous because it has not the supremacy.<a name=325:5></a> On the contrary, we repeat, that this power is the secret counsellor of all the evil.<a name=325:6></a> The only change that will take place is, that it will cease to have <i>outwardly</i> the preponderance; and the not seeing this has led many into error.<a name=325:7></a> Because men, in the use of ordinary observation only, have perceived that it could no longer depose kings, they have supposed that the ecclesiastical power had absolutely disappeared.<a name=325:8></a> No attention has been paid to that which the children of God might ascertain out of His word, namely, that its moral influence would survive the destruction of its political existence; and that it was precisely this influence which would urge on the power, properly so called political, to revolt against God, and thus to its destruction.<a name=325:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not saying that it is not the will of man which, by its own energy guides the beast to its eternal ruin.<a name=325:10></a> This is indeed true; but in the meantime, it is the ecclesiastical apostasy which, either arrogating to itself the power, or shutting the door to the manifestation of the will of God, seduces by its machinations the inhabitants of the earth to acknowledge and adore the beast.<a name=325:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I advert to the passages which refer to the observations just made.<a name=325:12></a> First, the end of <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>, where the fourth beast is found; afterwards, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#16">Revelation  16</a>, and especially chapter 17, where the two are distinguished, namely, the great whore or Babylon, and the beast.<a name=325:13></a> In chapter 17 We get the woman clothed with scarlet, a power whose principal element is ecclesiastical; she is mounted on the beast (civil power).<a name=325:14></a> After that, "the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore (ecclesiastical power), and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.<a name=325:15></a> For God hath put in their hearts to .<a name=325:16></a>.<a name=325:17></a>.<a name=325:18></a> give their kingdom to the beast.<a name=325:19></a>"

It is the judgment of the nations living upon this earth, and not of the dead. There is no question of the resurrection, but only of the judgment of the Gentiles. What will happen to the Jews is mentioned in chapter 24; then, what will happen to believers, or at least professors of the faith of Christ; and then, the fate of the Gentiles. It is the judgment of the living, and not of the dead. we say it is the judgment of the living, because we read, "Before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats." That which has given rise to the supposition that it is the judgment of the dead, is this passage, "These shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal"; but this only means that the judgment of the living will be final, like that of the dead. When God judges, whether the dead or the living, His judgment sends the good into life eternal, and the wicked into everlasting punishment. The judgment of the living is as sure as that of the dead.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:1">Romans  11:1</a>, this question put by the apostle as to Israel: "Hath God cast away his people?<a name=344:17></a>" As far as chapter 8 he has been detailing the history of us all as men, whether Jews or Gentiles; he has fully stated the gospel of the grace of God, namely, the reconciliation of man by the

		death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<a name=345:1></a> After having established this point, he begins in chapter 9 the history of the dispensations: he makes known the manner in which God has acted towards the Jews and the Gentiles; and in this chapter 11 he starts the question, "Hath God cast away his people?<a name=345:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen, in studying the history of the four beasts, and also that of the church, that the Jews were put aside; and that the gospel has appeared in the world to save sinners, whether Jews or Gentiles, in order to reveal the hidden mystery of a heavenly people, and that "unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known, by the church, the manifold wisdom of God.<a name=345:3></a>" A Jew, who is now converted, enters into the dispensation of grace; but upon this comes the immediate inquiry, "Hath God cast away his people?<a name=345:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not concerning His spiritual people that the question is asked, but concerning His people according to the flesh -- His people, the Jews.<a name=345:5></a> The apostle says (verse 28), "As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes; but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.<a name=345:6></a>" In this chapter 11 the gospel is not in view, -- namely, the calling of the Jews, as a people, into grace by the gospel -- although, indeed, there is a gospel election from among this people; but the question treated is that of the Jews, as God's manifested people, of Jews according to the flesh, who are enemies as to the gospel, but beloved on the principle of a national election on account of the fathers.<a name=345:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Because, then, the gospel has come in, has God rejected His people?<a name=345:8></a> Does He count them enemies?<a name=345:9></a> The answer of the apostle is, "God forbid.<a name=345:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We Christians boast of this, that "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance"; well we may -- it is a scriptural principle: but to whom does the apostle apply it?<a name=345:11></a> Not to us, but to the Jews.<a name=345:12></a> It is always important to consider the context of every passage of the word of God, and not to force it out of the situation where God has placed it.<a name=345:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The present is the dispensation of the calling of a heavenly people, and, in consequence, God puts aside His earthly people, the Jews.<a name=345:14></a> The Jewish nation is never to enter into the church; on the contrary, "blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in"; until all the children of God, out of them composing the body of the church in this dispensation, are called.<a name=345:15></a>

		From the moment it can be affirmed of the dispensation of the Gentiles, that it has not "continued in the goodness of God," we can say that, sooner or later, it will be cut off.<a name=346:6></a> "Toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<a name=346:7></a>"

		The root of the olive-tree is not alone Israel under the law; far from it.<a name=346:8></a> It is Abraham, to whom the call of God was addressed.<a name=346:9></a> It was the calling of a single man, separated, elect, the depositary of the promises.<a name=346:10></a> The choice fell upon Abraham, and upon the family of Abraham according to the flesh.<a name=346:11></a> Israel has served for an example, as depositary of the promises and of the manifestation of the election of God; now it is the church which so serves.<a name=346:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to make you understand the <i>root</i> of the promises, which is Abraham, I will touch upon the series of dispensations which preceded.<a name=346:13></a> First, at the fall of man we see him left to himself.<a name=346:14></a> Although not without witness, he had neither law nor government; and, as a consequence, evil was carried to the highest pitch, so that the world was full of violence and corruption; and God purified it by the deluge.<a name=346:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Afterwards came Noah.<a name=346:16></a> A change took place; it was this -- that the right of life and death, the right of taking vengeance, was given into the hands of men: "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, <i>by man</i> shall his blood be shed.<a name=346:17></a>" To this is added a blessing to the earth, greater or less.<a name=346:18></a> "This same," said Lamech, in speaking of Noah, "shall comfort us, .<a name=346:19></a>.<a name=346:20></a>.<a name=346:21></a> because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed"; and a covenant is made by God with Noah and with the creation; a covenant in witness of which God gives the rainbow.<a name=346:22></a> "The Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:21">Genesis  8:21</a>; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:6">Genesis  9:6</a>,12,13.<a name=346:23></a> This was the covenant given to the earth immediately after the sacrifice of Noah, the type of the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=346:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in all dispensations the immediate failure of man; but that which is lost in all of them by human folly will find its recovery at the end in Christ; whether it be blessing to the earth, prosperity to the Jews, or the glory of the church.<a name=347:4></a> All that has appeared and has been spoiled, under the keeping of the first Adam, will blossom again under that of the Second Adam, Bridegroom of the church, and King of the Jews and of the whole earth.<a name=347:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another still more signal failure took place after Noah's.<a name=347:6></a> God had made His judgments terribly felt in the deluge, and His providence was thus revealed.<a name=347:7></a> What did Satan do?<a name=347:8></a> As long as he is unbound he takes possession of the state of things here below: No sooner did God manifest Himself in His providential judgments, than Satan presented himself also as God; he made himself, as it were, God.<a name=347:9></a> Is it not written, "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God?<a name=347:10></a>" Satan made himself the god of this earth.<a name=347:11></a> <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24:2">Joshua  24:2</a>: "Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time .<a name=347:12></a>.<a name=347:13></a>.<a name=347:14></a> and they served <i>other gods</i>," said the Lord to the Israelites.<a name=347:15></a> It is the first time that we find God marking the existence of <i>idolatry</i>.<a name=347:16></a> When it made its appearance, God calls Abraham; and thus, for the first time, appears the call of God to an outward separation from the state of things here below; because Satan having introduced himself as influencing the thoughts of man, as the one whom man was to invoke, it was necessary that the true God should have a people separated from other people, where the truth might be preserved; and consequently all the ways of God towards men turn upon this point -- that here below God called Abraham and his posterity to be the depositary of this great truth, "There are none other gods but one" (see <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#4:35">Deuteronomy  4:35</a>).<a name=347:17></a> Consequently, all the doings of God upon the earth have reference entirely and directly to the Jews, as the centre of His earthly counsels and of His government.<a name=347:18></a> This is shewn us in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:8">Deuteronomy  32:8</a>.<a name=347:19></a> It was according to the number of the children of Israel that the bounds of the nations were set.<a name=347:20></a> It was with reference to Israel that He gave them their habitations.<a name=347:21></a>

		You will see also these two principles distinctly presented in the word; on one side, the promises made to Abraham without condition; and on the other, Israel receiving them under condition, and so losing all.<a name=348:1></a> But as Abraham received the promises without condition, God cannot forget them, although Israel may have failed in the conditions which they engaged for.<a name=348:2></a> And this is very important; for if God had failed in His promises towards Abraham, He could fail also in His promises towards us.<a name=348:3></a>

		That which happens to the dry bones seen by Ezekiel exhibits, very forcibly, the matter to be treated of this evening; namely, what God in His goodness will yet do in favour of Israel.<a name=353:6></a> We shall follow our usual method of giving a succession of passages out of the word of God upon it.<a name=353:7></a> You remember, that in commencing this subject, we remarked the difference between the covenant made with Abraham, and the covenant of the law given on Mount Sinai; and that whenever God was going to shew grace to His people, He called to mind the covenant made with Abraham.<a name=353:8></a> We also remarked that Israel took the promises under the covenant made in the wilderness, and not under that made with Abraham; and that, from that time Israel, being put under the condition of obedience in order to persevere in the enjoyment of the promises, failed altogether; but that, notwithstanding, thanks to the mediation of Moses, God was able to bless the people.<a name=353:9></a>

		I would now remark, for a moment in passing on our Lord's discourse with Nicodemus (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>particularly verse 12), where there is an allusion to "earthly things.<a name=360:9></a>" Previously (verse 10) He had said, "Art thou a master [teacher] in Israel, and knowest not these things?<a name=360:10></a>" -- namely, the need of being born of water and of the Spirit to enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=360:11></a> This knowledge was to be got out of the Old Testament, the source whence the teachers drew their instruction.<a name=360:12></a> The passage just quoted out of Ezekiel contains almost the very same words used by our Lord.<a name=360:13></a> How!<a name=360:14></a> says He, you a master [teacher] in Israel!<a name=360:15></a> you ought to understand that Israel must have a new and purified heart in order to enjoy the promises.<a name=360:16></a> How is it that you know not these things?<a name=360:17></a> If you enter not into My saying that you must be born of water and of the Spirit, and do not understand these earthly things, how can it be expected that you should believe about heavenly things?<a name=360:18></a> As if He had said, If I have spoken to you of the things which apply to Israel, if I have told you that Israel must be born again to enjoy those <i>terrestrial promises which belong to her</i>, and you have not understood Me, how will you comprehend about heavenly things -- about the glory of Christ exalted in heaven, and the church, His companion, in this heavenly glory?<a name=360:19></a> You have not even understood the doctrines of your prophets.<a name=360:20></a> You a teacher in Israel!<a name=360:21></a> you should at least have made yourself acquainted with the earthly things, of which Ezekiel and others have spoken.<a name=360:22></a>

		In this chapter of Ezekiel, as in many others, expressions are found, such as "fruit of trees" -- "increase of the field" -- details of earthly things, which are the earthly blessings promised to Israel; whilst, at the same time, the necessity of a new heart is connected with them, in order that those to whom these promises belong may be able to enjoy them.<a name=360:23></a> Israel must be

		<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#37">Ezekiel  37</a>gives a detailed history of the re-establishment of Israel -- the joining together of the two parts of the nation, their return into the land, and their state of unity and fidelity to God in this same land; God being their God, and David their king being present -- present for ever, in such a way as that the nations shall know that their God is the Lord, when His sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.<a name=361:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#39:22">Ezekiel  39:22</a>-25.<a name=361:4></a> It is evident that the time here mentioned is not yet come; since, when it does, God "will not hide his face any more from them," as He is doing at the present time, and that He will gather them "unto their own land," and will leave none of them among the heathen.<a name=361:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, let us call to mind the great principles upon which these prophecies rest.<a name=361:6></a> The restoration of the Jews is founded upon the promises made to Abraham <i>without</i> condition; their fall is the result of their having undertaken to act in their own strength.<a name=361:7></a> After having exercised the patience of God in every possible way "until there was no remedy," judgment is come upon them; but God reverts to His promises.<a name=361:8></a> Let us make a proper application of this to our own hearts.<a name=361:9></a> The same history is ours -- always that of the fall.<a name=361:10></a> No sooner has God placed us in such or such a position than we immediately fail in it.<a name=361:11></a> But there is behind our failure a principle of strength, that is to say, the revelation of the counsels of God, and, by consequence, unconditional promises; and we have seen (in Moses as the type), that it is the mediation and the presence of Jesus which is the accomplishment of these promises.<a name=361:12></a> We have also seen that God executes judgment only after extraordinary patience, after having used every possible means (however long that judgment may have been pronounced) to recall man to a sense of his duty, if there had been a spark of life in his heart; but there was none.<a name=361:13></a> Individuals, quickened by grace, hold to the promises which will have their fulfilment in the manifestation of Him who can realise them, and merit the realisation for others.<a name=361:14></a> And nothing puts these principles in clearer relief than the history of Israel: "All these things happened unto them for types (see margin), and they are written for our admonition.<a name=361:15></a>" It is like a mirror, in which we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=362>[Page 362]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		can see, on the one hand, the heart of man, which fails always, and on the other, the faithfulness of God who never fails, who will fulfil all His promises, and who will put forth a strength able to surmount all the wickedness of man, and the power of Satan.<a name=362:1></a> It is when the enmity has arrived at its height, that He says, "Make the heart of this people fat" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6:10">Isaiah  6:10</a>): but it is not until nearly eight hundred years after (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#28:27">Acts  28:27</a>), that we find the accomplishment of this judgment pronounced so long before by the prophet.<a name=362:2></a> It was when the people had rejected everything, that God hardened them, to make them a monument of His ways.<a name=362:3></a> What patience on the part of God!<a name=362:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in that which concerns us Gentiles -- the execution of the judgment has been suspended for eighteen centuries, and God is still drawing upon all the eternal resources of His grace to try if there be any who will listen to His testimony of salvation.<a name=362:5></a> As the Lord said (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:22">John  15:22</a>,24), "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.<a name=362:6></a> If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=362:7></a>" Admirable patience!<a name=362:8></a> Infinite grace of Him who interests Himself in us, even after our rebellion and iniquity!<a name=362:9></a> To Him be all the glory!<a name=362:10></a>

		But it is fitting, here, to touch on the manner of God's dealing with the houses of Judah and Israel in their judgment and dispersion.<a name=368:6></a> The first to be gathered are those who rejected Jesus, those who were guilty of His death.<a name=368:7></a> The ten tribes, as such, were not guilty of this crime; the ten tribes were dispersed before the introduction of the four monarchies into the rule of the world.<a name=368:8></a> It was the Assyrians who led captive the ten tribes, before Babylon had existence as an empire.<a name=368:9></a> A circumstance relating to a Jewish family or tribe (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#35:1">Jeremiah  35:1</a>-10), found living in the midst of the Arabs, is related of Mr.<a name=368:10></a> Wolff, who visited it of late years.<a name=368:11></a> These Jews say of themselves, that they are descended from some who refused to return to Judea with Ezra, because they knew that those who returned with Ezra would put the Messiah to death; and for this reason they remained where they were.<a name=368:12></a> Even though this be false, the existence of such a tradition is not a little wonderful One thing is evident that those who rejected the Christ will be subjected to the Antichrist; they will make "a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28:15">Isaiah  28:15</a>); but their covenant will destroy all their hopes; having united themselves to Antichrist, they will undergo the consequence of this alliance, and at last will be destroyed.<a name=368:13></a> Two thirds of the inhabitants will be cut off in the country of Israel itself after their return; <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#13:8">Zechariah  13:8</a>,9.<a name=368:14></a>

		Besides these two classes of Israelites who will return by providential agency, but still of their own free accord, the Lord after His appearance will gather together from among the Gentiles the elect of the Jewish nation, who will be yet among the nations; and this return will be accompanied with great blessing.<a name=369:16></a> (See <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:31">Matthew  24:31</a>; compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#27:12">Isaiah  27:12</a>,13, and chapter 11:10,12.<a name=369:17></a>)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read this chapter, not as professing to explain it in detail, but because it gives a summary of that which will happen at the close of this dispensation, at least the heavenly sources of these events, and the woes of the earth<a href="#370:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=370:5></a> My object this evening is to take up, in their order, the prophetic events which have been occupying us, as far as God shall give me ability.<a name=370:6></a>

		But, beforehand, dear friends, it will not be amiss to return to a few of the thoughts which were given out at the very beginning of these lectures.<a name=370:7></a> Let us be reminded, in treating of these subjects, of their great end -- a double one.<a name=370:8></a> One end is that of detaching us from the world, to which (though indeed the effect of every part of the word, when the Spirit of God is applying it) prophecy is peculiarly adapted; its tendency must be to "deliver us from this present evil age.<a name=370:9></a>" The other end is to make us intelligent of the character of God, and of His ways towards us.<a name=370:10></a> These are two precious and wholesome fruits, which spring from the acquirement of the knowledge of prophecy.<a name=370:11></a>

		Many are the objections made to its study; it is thus that Satan always acts against the truth.<a name=370:12></a> I do not mean objections against such or such a view, but against the study of prophecy itself.<a name=370:13></a> And Satan works in this way as to the entire word of God.<a name=370:14></a> To one he says, Follow morality, and do not meddle with dogmas, because he knows that dogmas will free a man from his power, by the revelation of Jesus, and of the truth in their hearts.<a name=370:15></a> To another he suggests the neglecting of prophecy, because in it is found the judgment of this world, of which he is prince.<a name=370:16></a> But to allow weight to such objections, is it not to

		find fault with God, who has given prophecy to us, and who has even attached a particular blessing to the reading of the part reputed the most difficult?<a name=371:1></a> Prophecy throws a great light upon the dispensations of God; and, in this sense, it does much as regards the freedom of our souls towards Him.<a name=371:2></a> For what hinders it more than the error so often committed, of confounding the law and the gospel, the past economies or dispensations with the existing one?<a name=371:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If, in our internal fighting, we find ourselves in the presence of the law, it is impossible to find peace; and yet if we insist on the difference which exists between the position of the saints of old, and that of the saints during the actual dispensation, this again troubles the minds of many.<a name=371:4></a> Now the study of prophecy clears up such points, and at the same time enlightens the faithful as to their walk and conversation; for, whilst it always maintains free salvation by the death of Jesus, prophecy enables us to understand this entire difference between the standing of the saints now and formerly, and lights up with all the counsels of God the road along which His own people have been conducted, whether before or after the death and resurrection of Jesus.<a name=371:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, dear friends, as we have before said, it is always the hope which is presented to us which acts upon our hearts and affections.<a name=371:6></a> There are thus always enjoyments in prospect which stamp their actual character upon our souls.<a name=371:7></a> That which occupies the heart of man as hope makes the rule of his conduct.<a name=371:8></a> Of what vast importance is it not, then, to have our souls filled with hopes according to God!<a name=371:9></a> Persons say it is the idle curiosity of prying into hidden things; but if it were true that we ought not to look into prophecy, the conclusion is inevitable, that our thoughts are not to go beyond the present.<a name=371:10></a> The way of knowing what God's intentions are for the future is certainly the study of that prophecy which He has given to us.<a name=371:11></a> Prophecy records things to come; it is the scriptural mirror, wherein future events are seen.<a name=371:12></a> If we refuse the study of what God has revealed as to come, we are necessarily left to our own ideas upon it.<a name=371:13></a>

		The famous passage of Paul has been quoted to some here (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>): "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.<a name=371:14></a>" It is constantly used as an objection against the study of what is found revealed in the word.<a name=371:15></a> This arises from two causes.<a name=371:16></a> The one is due to

		<a name=372>[Page 372]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that prolific source of error, namely, the citation of a passage without examining the context; the other, alas!<a name=372:1></a> arises from a greater or less want of uprightness -- from a desire (unrecognised, it may be, in our own deceitful hearts) of standing still in the ways of the Lord, by making as little acquaintance with them as may be.<a name=372:2></a> It is not true that we are to limit ourselves to the knowledge of Jesus Christ crucified.<a name=372:3></a> We must also know Jesus Christ glorified, Jesus Christ at the right hand of God; we must know Him as High Priest; as Advocate with the Father.<a name=372:4></a> We ought to know Jesus Christ as much as possible, and not be content with saying, "Jesus Christ, and him crucified.<a name=372:5></a>" So to say is to take the letter of the word and abuse it.<a name=372:6></a> The apostle, seeing the tendency that there was in the church at Corinth to follow rather the learning and philosophy of man than Christ (a thing not to be wondered at in a city renowned for science), points out, in leading their souls back to Christ, how foreign his entry among them was from earthly wisdom.<a name=372:7></a> He "was with them in weakness and fear; his speech and his preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom"; "he determined not to know anything among them but Jesus Christ, and him crucified" -- Jesus Christ, and even Christ as the despised one among men.<a name=372:8></a> He is not speaking of the value of the blood, but of the condition of Christ Himself, in order to bring down, by the cross, all their vain glory, and found their faith upon the word of God, and not on human wisdom.<a name=372:9></a> But in the same chapter he says, that from the moment he comes into the midst of true Christians, his conduct changes; he speaks "wisdom among them that are perfect.<a name=372:10></a>" He would have nothing to do with human wisdom; but as soon as he finds himself among the perfect ones, he says, "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect.<a name=372:11></a>" Desiring to confine ourselves to Jesus crucified, in the way it is urged, is, I repeat, to confine ourselves to as little as possible of Christianity.<a name=372:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6">Hebrews  6</a>the apostle says, he is unwilling to do what they would make him say in this place; he altogether condemns that which is urged upon us.<a name=372:13></a> "Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ," says he, "let us go on unto perfection.<a name=372:14></a>" After these observations on the study of prophecy in general, I proceed to recall, in a few words, how God has revealed Himself by it.<a name=372:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>presents to us the great object of prophecy, and of all the word of God, that is, the combat which takes

		place between the last Adam and Satan.<a name=373:1></a> It is from this centre of truth that all the light which is found in Scripture radiates.<a name=373:2></a> This great combat may take place either for the earthly things (they being the object), and then it is in the Jews; or for the church (that being the object), and then it is in the heavenly places.<a name=373:3></a> It is on this account that the subject of prophecy divides itself into two parts: the hopes of the church, and those of the Jews; though the former be scarcely, properly speaking, prophecy, which concerns the earth and God's government of it.<a name=373:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before coming to this great crisis, namely the combat between Satan and the last Adam, it was necessary that the history of the first Adam should be developed.<a name=373:5></a> This has been done.<a name=373:6></a> And in order that the church, that is, Christians, may be in a position to occupy themselves with the things of God, it was needful, first of all, that they should be in happy certainty as to their own position before Him.<a name=373:7></a> At His first coming, Christ accomplished all the work which the wisdom of the Father, in the eternal counsels of God, had confided to Him; this effected the peace of the church.<a name=373:8></a> The Lord Jesus came, in order that the certainty of salvation, by the knowledge of the grace of God, should be introduced into the world, that is, into the hearts of the faithful.<a name=373:9></a> After having accomplished salvation, He communicates it to His followers in giving them life.<a name=373:10></a> His Holy Spirit, which is the seal of this salvation in the heart, reveals to them things to come, as to the children of the family and heirs of the family estate.<a name=373:11></a> During the period which separates the first coming of the Lord from the second, the church is gathered by the action of the Holy Spirit to have part in the glory of Christ at His return.<a name=373:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These, in a few words, are the two great subjects which I have been opening; namely, that Christ, having done all that is needful for the salvation of the church -- having saved all those who believe, the Holy Ghost now acts in the world to communicate to the church the knowledge of this salvation.<a name=373:13></a> He does not come to propose the hope that God will be good, but a fact -- that fact, once more, that Jesus has already accomplished the salvation of all those who believe; and when the Holy Spirit communicates this knowledge to a soul, it knows that it is saved.<a name=373:14></a> Being then put in relationship with God as His children, we are His heirs, "heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.<a name=373:15></a>" All that concerns the glory of Christ belongs

		to us, and the Holy Spirit is given to us, in the first place, to make us understand that we are children of God.<a name=374:1></a> He is a Spirit of adoption, but more, a Spirit of light, who teaches the children of God what their inheritance is.<a name=374:2></a> As they are one with Christ, all the truth of His glory is revealed to them, and the supremacy which He has over all things, God having also constituted Him heir of all things, and us co-heirs.<a name=374:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After Christ has fulfilled all that was necessary, the church, until the second coming of its Saviour, is taken from out of all nations, and united to Him.<a name=374:4></a> It has, whilst here below, the knowledge of the salvation which He has accomplished, and of the coming glory, the Holy Spirit, in those who believe, being the seal of salvation accomplished, and the earnest of the future glory.<a name=374:5></a> These truths throw a great light upon the entire history of man.<a name=374:6></a> But let us ever remember that the great object of the Bible is the conflict between Christ, the last Adam, and Satan.<a name=374:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what condition did Christ find the first Adam?<a name=374:8></a> In a condition into the lowest depths of which He was obliged to enter, as responsible head of all creation.<a name=374:9></a> He found man in state of ruin -- entirely lost.<a name=374:10></a> It was needful that this should be unfolded before the coming of Christ; for God did not introduce His Son into the world as Saviour until all that was necessary to shew that man was in himself incapable of anything good was brought out.<a name=374:11></a> The whole state of man, before and after the deluge, under the law, under the prophets, only served as a clearer attestation that man was lost.<a name=374:12></a> He had failed throughout, under every possible circumstance, until, God having sent His Son, the servants said, "This is the heir; let us kill him.<a name=374:13></a>" The measure of sin was then at its height; the grace of God then did also much more abound, and gave us the inheritance -- us poor sinners, the inheritance with Christ in the heavenly glory, of which we possess the earnest, having Christ in spirit here below.<a name=374:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But (to enter a little more into the succession of dispensations, and also into that which concerns the character of God in this respect) the first thing which we would remark is the deluge, because until then there had not been, so to speak, government in the world.<a name=374:15></a> The prophecy which existed before the deluge was to this effect, that Christ was to come.<a name=374:16></a> The teachings of God were ever to this end: "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints.<a name=374:17></a>" <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#1:14">Jude  1:14</a>.<a name=374:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us pass on.<a name=375:1></a> In Noah's time there was government of the earth, and God coming in judgment and committing the right of the sword to man.<a name=375:2></a> After this comes the call of Abraham.<a name=375:3></a> Mark: the principle of government is not put forward by the word, but the principle of promise, and the call to be in relationship with God, of that one person who becomes the root of all the promises of God -- Abraham, the father of the faithful.<a name=375:4></a> God calls him, makes him quit his country, his family, bidding him go into a country which He would shew him.<a name=375:5></a> God reveals Himself to him as the God of promise, who separates a people to Himself by a promise which He gives them.<a name=375:6></a> It is at this epoch that God revealed Himself under the name of God Almighty.<a name=375:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After that, among the descendants of Abraham, by this same principle of election, God takes the children of Jacob to be His people here below -- the object of all His earthly care, and out of whose midst Christ was to come according to the flesh.<a name=375:8></a> It is in this people of Israel that God displays all His characters as Jehovah; it is not only as a God of promise, but it is a God who unites the two principles of calling and government, which two had been each successively brought out in Noah and in Abraham.<a name=375:9></a> Israel was the called, separated people -- separated indeed only to earthly blessings, and to enjoy the promise; but, at the same time, to be subject to the exercise of the government of God according to the law.<a name=375:10></a> We say then, that in Noah was marked the principle of government of the earth, and in Abraham that of calling and election; and so Jehovah will accomplish all that He has said as God of promise, "who was, and is, and is to come," and govern all the earth, according to the righteousness of His law -- the righteousness revealed in Israel.<a name=375:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have shown that God (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:4">Exodus  19:4</a>-9) made the accomplishment of the promises, in those times, to depend upon the faithfulness of man, and that He took occasion to prove him, and to represent in detail, as in a picture, all the characters under which He acted towards him.<a name=375:12></a> It was this which He was doing under priests, prophets, and kings.<a name=375:13></a> And it is to be particularly observed, that the bearing of prophecy, in the unfolding of this succession of relationships of God with Israel, and with man, is not alone the manifestation of the fall of man, but also, and chiefly, of the glory of God.<a name=375:14></a>

		When Israel had transgressed in every possible way and circumstance, even in the family of David, which was the last human resource of the nation -- at the moment that family failed in Ahaz, prophecy commences in all its details, having these two features: one, the manifestation of the glory of Christ, in order fully to shew that the people had failed under the law; the other, the manifestation of the coming glory of Christ, to be the support of the faith of those who were desiring to keep the law, but who saw that everything was out of course It is too late to take an interest in the prophecies when they are fulfilled.<a name=376:1></a> Those to whom at the actual time the prophets addressed themselves, were the people from whom submission was expected.<a name=376:2></a> The word of God should have touched their conscience.<a name=376:3></a> It ought to be so with us.<a name=376:4></a> In the midst of all this, however, were predictions which announced that the Messiah was to come, and to suffer for ends most important.<a name=376:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Prophecy applies itself properly to the earth; its object is not heaven.<a name=376:6></a> It was about things that were to happen on the earth; and the not seeing this has misled the church.<a name=376:7></a> We have thought that we ourselves had within us the accomplishment of these earthly blessings, whereas we are called to enjoy heavenly blessings.<a name=376:8></a> The privilege of the church is to have its portion in the heavenly places; and later blessings will be shed forth upon the earthly people.<a name=376:9></a> The church is something altogether apart -- a kind of heavenly economy, during the rejection of the earthly people, who are put aside on account of their sins, and driven out among the nations, out of the midst of which nations God chooses a people for the enjoyment of heavenly glory with Jesus Himself.<a name=376:10></a> The Lord, having been rejected by the Jewish people, is become wholly a heavenly person.<a name=376:11></a> This is the doctrine which we peculiarly find in the writings of the apostle Paul.<a name=376:12></a> It is no longer the Messiah of the Jews, but a Christ exalted, glorified; and it is for want of taking hold of this exhilarating truth, that the church has become so weak.<a name=376:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus briefly retraced the history of the different dispensations, it remains for us now to see the church glorified, but without the Lord Jesus having abandoned any of His rights upon the earth.<a name=376:14></a> He was the Heir: He was to shed His blood, which was to ransom the inheritance.<a name=376:15></a> As Boaz said (whose name signifies, In him is strength), "What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance," <a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#4:5">Ruth  4:5</a>.<a name=376:16></a>

		So it was necessary that Christ should buy the church, co-heir by grace (as Boaz, type of Christ, bought the inheritance by taking to wife Ruth) to whom the inheritance had devolved in the decrees of Jehovah<a href="#377:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=377:1></a>
