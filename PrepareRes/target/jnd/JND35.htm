		PREFACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ministry of John Nelson Darby is, by the Lord's mercy, so well known as to render comment unnecessary; it only remains to explain the circumstances under which the present writings are published.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His executors have found, amongst his papers, a number of note books, in his own handwriting, containing many comments, notes and meditations on various subjects of divine teaching, explanatory and otherwise edifying, and have decided to set them forth for the benefit of the Church of God at large, and in the interests of the truth.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was Mr.<a name=1:3></a> Darby's habit to jot down, in such books, thoughts on Scripture and scriptural subjects as they occurred to him, not in any regular order, nor in view of publication; thus, the germ of thoughts, amplified elsewhere by him, will sometimes be found in the following pages, together with fresh and deeply interesting matter, such as might be expected to issue from the private study of one so richly taught in the Word.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These writings were not revised by the author with a view to publication, they were made solely for his own use; and are now put forth with the earnest hope that the Lord's people may derive much blessing and instruction from their diligent perusal.<a name=1:5></a>

		Such is the Lord's approval of those who, in the midst of perilous times, seek to keep themselves pure, and to continue in the things which they have learned and been assured of.<a name=1:7></a>

		It has been the gracious wisdom of God to bring great principles -- such as love, righteousness, and others -- into evidence, by facts.<a name=1:9></a> This makes it simple to the poor, and keeps intellectual power in its place, and this is all right, and divinely right.<a name=1:10></a> -- <i>Milwaukee, April</i>, 1865.<a name=1:11></a>

		What a sorrowful thing it would be (must we say "would be"?<a name=1:18></a>) to our hearts, to say "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course", -- and that end in "the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine", etc.<a name=1:19></a> -- and "they shall turn away their ears from the truth!<a name=1:20></a>" Was that the end, here below, of fighting the good fight of faith?<a name=1:21></a> What a world we live in!<a name=1:22></a> With this Paul identifies finishing his course; in another world it is different, but this is sorrow.<a name=1:23></a> So Christ however, <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49:4">Isaiah  49:4</a>, "I have laboured in vain".<a name=1:24></a> -- 1867.<a name=1:25></a>

		EVOLUTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see nothing in the elaborate statement at the opening of the Belfast meeting (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#35:4">footnote</a></i>) which affects the evolution system, or divinely-formed species at all.<a name=4:1></a> Creation it does not touch, as none of them do.<a name=4:2></a> But more, that embryos were gradually formed in the womb was always known.<a name=4:3></a> That microscopic investigation has discovered segmental division, and the separation into an upper and lower set, with the lines between, may be very interesting to anatomists, adds nothing but details.<a name=4:4></a> So, that there are general principles of formation from lower to higher <i>genera</i> in the foetus growth is curious, and shows God's acting analogously, and with system, but no more, unless the contrary to the development theory, because after all men and women have human children, and cocks and hens chickens, and it shows that these analogies of formation do not make intermingled species now.<a name=4:5></a> Phillips in his Geology, though afraid to say so, shows there was no cross-intermingling of species.<a name=4:6></a> And it is one of the remarkable things that from the same materials and analogous processes, both in plants and animals, specific results are produced.<a name=4:7></a> The oak and the bramble grow from the same soil, but the oak does not become a bramble, nor the bramble an oak.<a name=4:8></a> Forms of inception, and food, and digestion are the same, and we have eggs, and upper and lower segmentary division, but a man grows into a man, and a pig into a pig.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not see that evolution or development, once creation is fully recognised, is anything that concerns us.<a name=4:10></a> We all admit it.<a name=4:11></a> A corn of wheat, if it has lain 4,000 years without germination, if it meets "the scent of water" will sprout.<a name=4:12></a> Supposing the microscope discover there protoplasm itself, or appropriating power leading to organic growth, that is what in English we call "life" in its broadest sense, tree, animal, or man; in every case protoplasm in a cell.<a name=4:13></a> What was there 4,000 years is evolved, appropriates extrinsic stuff, and is a plant of wheat, and will, by "seed in itself after its kind", produce more evolved wheat.<a name=4:14></a> Now if God pleased (and who can say He did not) -- chose -- when chaos reigned, <i>to-hu</i> (wasteness), <i>bo-hu</i> (emptiness), to form such plants all at once from protoplasm to wheat, or an oak, and cause them to produce "after their

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		kind", by an instantaneous act of will, what should or could prevent it?<a name=5:1></a> This the evolutionists do not pretend to explain, nor can they -- that is, how protoplasm came there.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They -- for science is always, and necessarily atheistical, when it does not honestly confess ignorance (and honest in this sense its pride seldom is), because it can only follow experimentally the series of what does exist, and can only trace it as existing, but how or why it exists can know nothing, for that is no matter of science -- they, to get rid of God, will say matter is eternal, but not only cannot prove it, but a finite mind cannot have the thought "eternity" in it, so that all that is wilful falsehood.<a name=5:3></a> Notwithstanding, in spite of us, we know there <i>is</i> a cause, but that is not science.<a name=5:4></a> It is clearly seen change of species is another thing; God no doubt could have made it so physically, but it is not proved, and Darwin admits the proofs fail in geology, and if we are to believe the best searchers into the question it is disproved (as Phillips on "Geology of the Thames").<a name=5:5></a> God may allow commixture, and mules, if He pleases in nearly related species, but this rather proves there is no such change, for no such race producing "after its kind" has been found; but it is another question.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If evolution, as daily seen, takes place in four weeks where necessary conditions exist, or waits four years till they do, it is evident divine power could at once produce, I mean produce, so as to set the principle at work, in a moment.<a name=5:7></a> The foetus they tell us on its train goes through all classes of life from beginning to end in nine months; be it so.<a name=5:8></a> Why not in nine seconds -- be formed so as to do so?<a name=5:9></a> But men producing fishes, or fishes producing men, have not been found.<a name=5:10></a> It is a mere hypothetical conclusion of what may have been, but this is not science.<a name=5:11></a> Science may arrive at a general principle of what is, and so find what will be on the principle which is known in existing facts.<a name=5:12></a> But permanent change of species has not been found; varieties from circumstances are common, union of kindred species forming none may be found, but "after its kind" in nature remains "after its kind".<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>takes up the facts as apparent and no more -- does not touch the "how".<a name=5:14></a> There are species -- horses are not oxen, nor cats dogs, nor men apes -- they may tell us they were or may have been, but, as I said, that is not science; but <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>takes up the positive and unquestionable facts, and does only one thing -- reveals the creative authorship of God,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and that is all -- the "after its kind" is the statement of what is which we all know; more real science than the modern pretended science, and adds what confessedly is not and cannot be the subject of science -- creation -- and which Scripture says is of faith.<a name=6:1></a> A more precise account is given of man, because there was a moral relation between him and God; his body was distinct from his soul, and when made, God breathed into his so-formed body and he was in relationship with God, as nothing else was.<a name=6:2></a> This was, though creation, more than mere animal creation.<a name=6:3></a> "Let the earth bring forth" was for <i>mammalia</i>.<a name=6:4></a> God formed man out of the dust.<a name=6:5></a> <i>Os homini sublime dedit</i> (He gave to man a face that looks on high), and then connected him livingly with Himself.<a name=6:6></a> But what I had on my mind here was, that Moses took up the ostensible facts, and does not touch the "how" (save with man who is in relationship with God), but merely that God, the Creator and Orderer of all that was apparent, <i>ba-ra</i> created, <i>a-sah</i> formed, <i>ya-tzar</i> made (as a potter); He creates all, and then the earth being <i>to-hu bo-hu</i>, He brings it into order with everything, from plants to man.<a name=6:7></a> Hence when what orders times and seasons is set in order, he adds, "He made the stars also", but that is all.<a name=6:8></a> The creation of angels is not mentioned, they do not belong to this creation.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The creating is brought out I think as distinct parts of the general statements.<a name=6:10></a> First God created the heaven and the earth, then He goes on and orders it as earth with its bringing forth.<a name=6:11></a> This is to the end of the fourth day.<a name=6:12></a> It was the habitable earth, the waters being separated, and the earth, as ordered of God, standing out of it.<a name=6:13></a> Then comes the creation of what peopled the waters, it was what belonged to and was of them, but still was a distinct and new part of creation, the lower, and in a certain sense, unordered part.<a name=6:14></a> Then comes the higher class of living creatures, from the earth to which they belong.<a name=6:15></a> This was a bringing forth, but of the highest kind; still it was a <i>to-tze</i> (let bring forth).<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes a quite distinct act; God takes counsel in Himself to make man in His image, and creates him.<a name=6:17></a> So that the earth is looked at as the proper object of what had been created originally, and the account is continued in it; but then the separated waters have their own special notice, of which, though not the dwelling-place of man, the great things were God's creation; and then apart from all, though on the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sixth day, but no <i>to-tze</i>, man "created" is repeated three times.<a name=7:1></a> Nor do I think "created to make" is without special intention; all was His creation, but with a view of ordering it before Him.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The men of science forget that they can deal with phenomena only, and the evolution, if they so please to call it, of what exists; with existence they have nothing to do; evolution and fixed laws have nothing to do with it either.<a name=7:3></a> Fixed laws are learned from the constant course of things, but the constant course of things supposes the things whose course goes on, and even to have gone on long enough to call it a fixed law; man may see the perfection, and universality of it, and conclude perhaps it is a fixed law, but he cannot by science go beyond the constant order of what is.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Evolution is true to a certain point, the foetus or sperm becomes a man or a beast in due time.<a name=7:5></a> I have seen no evidence of change of species by it, not certainly, in historical time, in geological mummies and fossils there is no change of species; it is not science but fancy.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, though man ventures pretty far, and no man denies variety in species, big cows and little cows, and horned or unhorned, yet it seems to me that fixed laws and evolution are difficult to reconcile.<a name=7:7></a> It is all well to fancy that circumstances so act on an ape that he takes the human form, and say that this operation of fixed laws must have produced that consequence, habit begetting a second nature; but it is not science -- phenomena and deduction from it.<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Species are, and the fixed law is that they remain species, and always have; change into other species, arbitrarily, from circumstantial influences, is not a fixed law of nature.<a name=7:9></a> At first it is an accident, if it has a natural effect, i.<a name=7:10></a>e.<a name=7:11></a>, the consequence of an antecedent, but this is individual, and goes no farther than will, and need; there is no change of race in it.<a name=7:12></a> All apes did not shorten their arms, and turn hands into feet together, and, if one did, we should have as many races as circumstances, i.<a name=7:13></a>e.<a name=7:14></a>, there would be no fixed laws at all; but the truth is, the thing, as far as known phenomena go, is disproved really.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the main point I would insist on is, that science only begins when the system of uniform succession of consequents from antecedents exists, so that the whole system exists, and exists under an order of fixed laws, and science can go no farther than the discovery of them -- is absolutely and necessarily
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		confined to them -- means only that -- and if it presumes to go farther, wholly ceases to be science; accounts for nothing, and has no ground to go on in accounting for anything, beyond a course of things already in existence, having such fixed laws; as to existence, and fixed laws, or any knowledge about them, it is out of court -- ceases to be science if it attempts to touch them.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Science could not even say that in another Universe bodies, instead of having what we call weight, gravitation, or ether, or what it may be, which are only names after all, are not in a self-repelling gas which drives them away from one another; science knows what is, and no more.<a name=8:2></a> Existence cannot be said to be a consequent from an antecedent, nor even fixed laws -- what goes on according to them may be.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But mere fixed laws, and consequents from antecedents reveal causation -- mean that a certain effect follows because another fact is there.<a name=8:4></a> Therefore I must pursue causes, evolutionary ones, if you please; and existence must have had a cause, and the fixed laws or causes must have had a cause, for all facts we have ever ascertained flow from antecedents.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the antecedent to existence and fixed laws?<a name=8:6></a> You tell me -- you leave me in the dark, for I cannot conceive a cause which is not caused; I agree you are there in the dark, and must be.<a name=8:7></a> Own it, that is all, and that your science can only know present phenomena, and not God, and we are agreed.<a name=8:8></a> But men of science are afraid of being honest in these things.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The argument, as to infidels, is mere stupid presumption, and is merely this: Science, i.<a name=8:10></a>e.<a name=8:11></a>, man's mind, cannot go further than antecedents and consequents; it comes to a point where it has to stop, for, after all, they cannot deny this, therefore there is nothing beyond.<a name=8:12></a>

		In Genesis we have what addresses itself to man in his responsibility, the first Adam placed in it, and what it is needed he should know.<a name=10:1></a> We may have counsels in types, but no more; it is the sphere of responsible man, and man in it.<a name=10:2></a> The existence of God is assumed, the creation of angels not spoken of; but first the creation of the heavens and earth needed to be known by us, then the forming of this scene in which we are as established in it, where I may notice that the expanse is not called good as no actual part of the things formed in connection with man.<a name=10:3></a> Then creatures being finished, and the last pronounced good (chapter 1: 25), the solemn creation of a head to represent Him in it, is taken up, and a lord or head over the creation that had been made, but quite a different thing; "saw that it was good" (verse 25) closed the creation.<a name=10:4></a>

		The first thing I notice in the end of this chapter is, there is no confession.<a name=36:6></a> Adam and Eve tell the truth as to fact, and God pronounces judgment accordingly, as He sees fit, but there is no moral action in their hearts apparent.<a name=36:7></a> The serpent is not asked, his judgment goes first by itself -- enmity and final destruction by power through Him who had the heel bruised.<a name=36:8></a> We then get the present effects in this world on to death (where, note, death is pronounced on the man only as representative of the race, as before the life -- breath of life -- was communicated); but then we find faith on man's part as to life, Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living -- this, after death was pronounced.<a name=36:9></a> Then God clothes them both.<a name=36:10></a> Life is not from Adam, so to speak, it is the woman's seed; but clothing, and putting away nakedness (the witness of sin, verses 7 - 10) is Jehovah Elohim's act; this is full of instruction -- grace first brought and fully.<a name=36:11></a> Man is then driven out from the place of blessing, and all recovery of life naturally.<a name=36:12></a> This is the judgment, and blessing of man, as man before God; the history of the race comes in chapter 4.<a name=36:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter, as already remarked, as a continuation of chapters 2 and 3, carries on, evidently, the question of sin into men's relationship with one another.<a name=39:8></a> It is not absolutely said that Eve gave Cain his name (Seth she did), but the thought is hers.<a name=39:9></a> Ha-Adam is merely the course of the race.<a name=39:10></a> Eve was Adam's <i>Ish-shah</i> here, but "Eve" is in sense; it was her thought on the Lord's mind of giving a seed; she has gotten a man -- "<i>Ish</i>" -- the name Adam gives himself in chapter 2; she came out of "<i>Ish</i>".<a name=39:11></a> She -- Eve -- on this great new event, had from herself, with Jehovah's will, and as from Him, a man, a born man, seed of the woman in the world.<a name=39:12></a> I say it was her thought; it is not "the Lord hath appointed", that was deference to His will.<a name=39:13></a> This, her feeling, though looking to the Lord; she looked at the gift, though she ascribed it to Jehovah; but it was man -- natural man -- a child of Adam really; evil, yet outwardly in the place God had set Adam in -- a tiller of the ground.<a name=39:14></a> Abel's place was a place out

		Then comes out exasperated hatred; but first the immensely important ground it is all on -- law and gospel.<a name=40:3></a> First, we have God still in intercourse with fallen man; He had clothed Adam -- grace had wrought; next, acceptance if he did well -- that is law -- if not a <i>khat-tath</i> (sin offering) was there, ready for him; that was the ground he was on with God; as to his brother, as the elder, Abel would be subject to him.<a name=40:4></a> But what man <i>is</i> comes out; hatred is above all fear, and remedy or intervention of God.<a name=40:5></a> Sin against one's brother fills up the measure of sin against God, through which they were already cast out.<a name=40:6></a> There is, again, a present judgment as to the ground; and, besides hiding from God's face (which his own conscience tells him), he goes out -- here his own act -- from the presence of the Lord, not in sorrow -- no humiliation in His presence -- the despairing complaint of selfishness -- and makes the world as comfortable as he can without Him.<a name=40:7></a>

		In chapter 4, the question is of the state of man, and how, being such, he could approach God; the answer is, by expiatory sacrifice, which owned the state of sin, grace, and the remedy it afforded; or, rather, the self-offering up of another to God -- it is "fat", not "blood" as for committed sin.<a name=42:11></a> It was not a question of guilt from sins, but of man's state, so here it is a sin-offering "if thou doest not well".<a name=42:12></a> The two things are quite distinct, one is the abstract consideration of man's estate before God; the other, getting an individually purged conscience before God.<a name=42:13></a>

		It is objected that till the law there was no <i>khet'</i> (sin).<a name=42:19></a> In general, I apprehend this is just, and the difference important; as in Abel's sacrifice it was the state of man -- "Where art thou?<a name=42:20></a>" -- not what he had done.<a name=42:21></a> The burnt offering took this ground; it was not for particular faults which a man had committed, but that man, driven out of Paradise, alienated in sin from God, could not come to God as if nothing had happened; sin, and death for sin, and the glorifying of God as to it, must come in, in order to approach acceptably; and this was the general character of sacrifice till the law made imputable transgressions.<a name=42:22></a> It was the ground on which sinful and excluded man stood with God.<a name=42:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here chapter 15 is the promise; the manner of its accomplishment, in divine grace and power, is not yet revealed, nor is it until God reveals Himself in chapter 17, after law.<a name=72:4></a> Christ may be known after the flesh; but as Sarai was the state, no fruit of promise by divine power; yet Abram acts on flesh's impatience to have it, according to flesh's desire, in its own way.<a name=72:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In a certain sense Ishmael answered to chapter 15: 4, but it was all flesh's doing.<a name=72:6></a> Under promise, Israel according to flesh will have inheritance, but it is not in the place of Sarah and Abraham, the heavenly glory over the Gentiles; in itself, in chapter 21, it is cast out, and cannot be heir, it will come in no doubt under grace.<a name=72:7></a> Even in chapter 15, it was promise according to desire; in chapter 17 according to Elohim's own full purpose, and direct revelation of Himself; chapter 15, we have seen, however, met faith, only Abram did not, in reply, rise above want.<a name=72:8></a>

		NOTE.<a name=72:9></a> -- Up to the end of chapter 15, we have promises fully, and a covenant for earthly promises as to Israel, and government, the smoking lamp, and the furnace.<a name=72:10></a> But the development of the seed is after the entering into relationship by express revelation, and the consecration of Abraham to Himself by God by circumcision -- the judgment, though here only partial, of the flesh; before this we have the earthly seed, which is according to law -- Hagar, which God takes care of providentially, but which is not the true personal son of promise in grace.<a name=72:11></a>

		Note, in all this chapter, Abraham never calls the Lord "Jehovah", here it was not the name of relationship.<a name=78:2></a> In chapters 12 and 13 his altars are to Jehovah, and again at Beersheba he calls on the name of Jehovah; so in chapter 15: 2.<a name=78:3></a> But here in this closer communion and intercourse with God, founded on his walking in covenant relationship, in his own place as set of God in the earth, it is Adonai.<a name=78:4></a>

		The mystery is evidently intentional here, and the perception of faith, and the already exercised spiritual mind in Abraham, instructive and divine.<a name=78:5></a> He knew he had to do with One who visited him thus, but, till the Lord reveals Himself, he acts towards Him in the way He comes; this was true deference, and heavenly propriety, and he receives the fruit in the Lord's gracious familiarity with him on this ground -- a significant anticipation of Christ's presence.<a name=78:6></a> From verse 9 onwards the Lord blesses him, in revealing Himself, according to and as a reward of -- as meeting -- this instinctive perception of who it was.<a name=78:7></a> Under the Spirit's power, we always do what is fitting.<a name=78:8></a>

		What a wondrous passage this is!<a name=80:5></a> It appears, certainly to me, that Jehovah appeared and talked, but that it was He only who alone reveals Jehovah, who was the man of those three thus associated with Him as the messengers of His service -- for He is Lord of angels.<a name=80:6></a> Yet we know that He has had Angels strengthening Him, and He sends them here -- the executors of His judicial power, compare <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:41">Matthew  13:41</a>, for it is the Son revealed who is the executor, the Father judging no man, but committing all judgment to the Son -- and He, as Man, will here exercise this judgment; I certainly do think also more particularly that Abraham represents here the saints, and Lot the Jews, though what else, I say not here.<a name=80:7></a> There was some good in Lot, though he was in Sodom; there was the sense of evil, and hence he did not lose the good -- he liked to have it with him -- I do not say it was the only motive, the apostle commends it in Hebrews.<a name=80:8></a>

		We are admitted to the Lord's thoughts by revelation; only leaving that, He treats Abraham as His friend, and I think that, though verses 20, 21 are an abstract revelation, yet the place they are introduced shows that, as to the nature of the communications, the Lord, though with Abraham who was on earth, was on His own heavenly ground, not gone down to earth in judgment, and to judge; this is important as the place of intercession.<a name=80:10></a> Only the Lord knew of course what He would do, and the two men -- angels -- had gone on their way, but faith's heavenly intercourse with the Lord, however imperfect, is within all that.<a name=80:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's own most patient grace in judgment is also shown both in verse 21, and in the intercession.<a name=81:9></a> Abraham never says "Jehovah", but "Adonai"; Abraham was not in his place, as at home on earth, when he pleaded with the Lord; he was with Jehovah in the way of faith -- we may say a heavenly way.<a name=81:10></a> He returned to his place -- the home of nature; there he had received the Lord, but in his communing and intercession, he was before the Lord, where the Lord had taken him.<a name=81:11></a>

		CONSCIENCE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards Conscience I have more than one point to note.<a name=104:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, speaking, as infidels and annihilationists do, of its being the effect of education, etc.<a name=104:2></a>, is all confusion -- confusion between a rule by which it judges, and the intrinsic power to judge.<a name=104:3></a> No one denies -- it may be misled by education -- making such or such feelings a rule, an obligation; but a rule, or obligation imposed -- and all such are so -- is the opposite of conscience.<a name=104:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Conscience is the sense that there is right and wrong, and when called into activity by an act, that such is right or wrong, it pronounces, by its own judgment, that it is right or wrong, it pronounces for itself.<a name=104:5></a> I may have dimmed, blinded, influenced, misled it, but Consciences are; <i>und frsich</i> (and in itself) is the judgment I pronounce from instinctive, and uninfluenced persuasion that such an act is right, such wrong.<a name=104:6></a> So far from its owning a law, it ceases whenever there is one which has authority, because it has not to judge for itself.<a name=104:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Quite true that the instinctive judgment of conscience is according to some inscrutable law, but that is another thing; it is not the perception of that law, but man's judgment of right and wrong in itself.<a name=104:8></a> It is our knowledge of good and evil, not a rule outside us.<a name=104:9></a> Hence, when Adam had it not, was not "become as one of us, knowing good and evil", he had a law, to which obedience was to be paid, and as to an act in which there was no right and wrong in itself -- he might have eaten had it not been forbidden.<a name=104:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man acquired this judgment of right and wrong, because "as one of us knowing good and evil"; of this there was no trace before.<a name=104:11></a> It was a question of obedience, law, and authority -- subjection to God; but he enjoyed goodness -- blessings -- had to be grateful -- but had no question of there being a right or a wrong perceived by himself -- no power of it, no occasion for it, no possibility of it; it would have falsified his whole position, -- he would have ceased to be innocent.<a name=104:12></a> Indeed the thing was impossible, for he was not as God, holy, i.<a name=104:13></a>e.<a name=104:14></a>, essentially abhorring perfectly known evil -- known because, and by being, holy; and sin was not in him, he could not innocently know evil to judge it.<a name=104:15></a> When a law was given, no doubt it might condemn what conscience did, but conscience had no more to do; if godly, under law man had only to obey.<a name=104:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=105>[Page 105]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, education may corrupt the judgment as to what is right and wrong, but supposes the judgment faulty.<a name=105:1></a> I suspect that the true test is, that whenever the conscience is falsified by education, the will and passions will be found to be at work, and though the person may not think of it, it could not be denied by a person not having <i>his</i> passions engaged.<a name=105:2></a> It is conventional right and wrong found by circumstances; hence, as in mere civil circumstances, conscience is the ultimate rule.<a name=105:3></a> We have Pascal's <i>dictum</i>, "<i>juste c'est ce qui tabli, donc tout ce qui est tabli est juste</i>"; only when this violates too seriously the conscience, or natural sense of right, or wrong, it tends to revolution, i.<a name=105:4></a>e.<a name=105:5></a>, will breaks out against the pressure.<a name=105:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suspect the immutable law of right and wrong is founded on relationships, whether with God, or as God has formed them; from them duties flow.<a name=105:7></a> Only that man having been set lord over the earth, possession has come in also; it is regulated by convention, only if it too much violates the right to possess in others -- in many -- it tends to violence in order to possess -- wants ministering to this.<a name=105:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Grace has brought us out of law into absolute obedience to a Person, but then it has its own rules which we need, and has set up the absolute authority of a Person, and a relationship which governs conduct, i.<a name=105:9></a>e.<a name=105:10></a>, right and wrong, as all relationships do; Christ being the perfect model of that in which we are with God and man.<a name=105:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must not confound the rule of right and wrong with conscience -- the discernment of right and wrong.<a name=105:12></a> "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin"; that rule varies divinely, even because the relationship is changed.<a name=105:13></a> My duty <i>was</i> a man's, a child of Adam's to God, and to other children of Adam, for that was my place, and relationship; it <i>is</i> of a child, a son of God, of which Christ is the pattern.<a name=105:14></a> Hence one rule or test of right or wrong is universality, practically what I hold to be right for all everywhere, but modified by this principle, where the same relation exists, i.<a name=105:15></a>e.<a name=105:16></a>, one formed of God, creature, son, daughter, wife, etc.<a name=105:17></a>, man with God, and with men, general or specific, whatever He has ordered.<a name=105:18></a> Only we must distinguish between obedience to God, or what represents Him, and conscience viewed as judging right and wrong.<a name=105:19></a> It is right to obey Him, wrong to disobey, and so far conscience comes in, for man had a given, has an instinctive, recognition of God, but it is not any judgment
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=106>[Page 106]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of right and wrong, as such, in the act itself.<a name=106:1></a> It is not what man acquired by the Fall, i.<a name=106:2></a>e.<a name=106:3></a>, the divine prerogative of judging right and wrong for himself, "one of us".<a name=106:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question may arise, how far grounds of judgment, and so far reason enter into conscience, and I answer, "not at all"; they go to lead to the estimate of the fact of the relationship, and whether it be violated, and I conclude that the thing is wrong.<a name=106:5></a> I then pronounce judgment, not on the thing, but on myself, or another conscience is at work, I call it wrong; but conscience always judges the thing.<a name=106:6></a> But there are, thus, three ideas connected in our mind with conscience, which we must look at if we would not have confusion in our minds; firstly, the sense of responsibility to a Being above us, principally to God, not the duty of loving Him, that is law -- but authority; this, Adam had before the Fall; secondly, the sense of good and evil; thirdly, the self-judgment or repulsion of heart, as to others, produced by it when an act is contemplated it condemns; the second is properly, I apprehend, Conscience.<a name=106:7></a>

		INNOCENCE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The loss of innocence closed evidently the simple enjoyment of blessing in thanksgiving.<a name=107:1></a> The knowledge of good and evil being come in, God, in saying "the man is become as one of us", has declared that man, to be with God, must be with Him as suited to Himself -- as knowing good and evil -- in a word, in righteousness.<a name=107:2></a> One must, having knowledge of good and evil, be suited to what God is according to it; but there is a certain modification of this to be introduced, not the diminishing or lowering of required righteousness (<i>dikaioma</i>), so as to allow of any evil, for that is impossible -- God cannot allow evil, He would not be holy if He did -- but the taking the measure of the knowledge of good and evil, according to the real light and moral condition of the position in which he is -- I do not mean as fallen in this position -- but according to the moral elements of that position in which he is with God.<a name=107:3></a> If he is perfect to the level of that position he may righteously live there, and enjoy God there; man never was, but it was put before him -- it is the law.<a name=107:4></a> If, as man, he loved God with all his heart and his neighbour as himself, he would righteously, as man, be happy with God, because he would meet the mind of God perfectly, as knowing good and evil in the position in which He was, according to the knowledge he had of God; He was perfect according to that -- man was never so, because he had lusts -- but the case was put.<a name=107:5></a> He never <i>de facto</i> could have been so, because he got the knowledge of good and evil in and by sin; unfallen Adam had not a bad conscience, but he had not a good one.<a name=107:6></a> The truth is, there was no such position of man, because he set up to be like God, knowing good and evil -- he made the measure for himself in desire, and would have risen up to God -- by robbery been equal with God; he broke through to be with God, and now he must be with Him or shut out.<a name=107:7></a> He cannot, of course, be independently equal, which would be absurd, but he must be morally fit, according to God's presence, or be excluded from it; there is no return to innocence, or to the tree of life on that ground.<a name=107:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law, however, never took the ground of introducing into the presence of God, as He is, according to the absolute revelation of His nature -- Christianity alone does that -- it

		keeps man without, hiding God, "Thou hast said thou wouldst dwell in the thick darkness", and gives to man thus without, but from God Himself, a perfect rule of right for the creature as such, condemning withal all that entered into man's state contrary to this, and, further, putting man into relationship with God on the ground, however, of natural creation, but assumedly in the rest of it -- a thing really impossible now that evil was entered, and meant to show this, but still, for this very purpose, established on this ground.<a name=108:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The perfect rule was, loving God with all the heart, and one's neighbour as oneself -- sin and lust condemned, and the Sabbath added to all.<a name=108:2></a> But for a sinner, evidently this had no reality but to condemn, and it did not profess to bring to God; it gave a rule to a people outwardly already brought into relationship with God, but with a barrier, and a double veil, and a priesthood, but it gave the <i>perfect</i> rule of right and wrong to the creature, who had the sense of it according to his nature, in the creation; but he was a sinner, there could be no rule in respect of sin but condemning it, but the law contained, as Christ showed in extracting it, the perfect positive rule; in this respect the perfection of the law's bearing is most wonderful, only it was the opposite of bringing an unjust man to God.<a name=108:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is unveiled -- He was manifested in grace in Christ, but, through His death, the veil is rent, "He suffered, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God" -- this accordingly is according to good and evil as known of God Himself; and as walking "in the light as he is in the light", we are to be fit for God as He is -- "rejoice in hope of his glory" -- joy in Him.<a name=108:4></a> Our estimate of good and evil is the divine one -- what is fit for God's presence; in view of this Christ has made the expiation, He is sitting, in the full condition belonging to it, as Man at the right hand of God.<a name=108:5></a> It is an unspeakable blessing, but the necessary result, we may say, of the work being God's according to His counsel, and wrought by Christ; for where should Christ be, as to His Person, or in desert of His work?<a name=108:6></a> Then the Holy Ghost is come down thence, while He is there, according to infinite love, to bring us in spirit into it -- to bring us through the rent veil into the Holiest of all.<a name=108:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is our knowledge of good and evil, and the fruit of Christ's work -- the darkness passes, the true light now shines; our coming to God is "renewed according to his image in

		righteousness and true holiness".<a name=109:1></a> It is an immense blessing.<a name=109:2></a> There never was really any being with God on another ground than in the light as He is, as brought by grace, and power, out of the darkness into the light, knowing good and evil.<a name=109:3></a> He cannot -- and have this knowledge -- do anything short of Himself, i.<a name=109:4></a>e.<a name=109:5></a>, what was fit for, worthy of Himself; so that, as when man was ruined, and got into darkness with the knowledge of good and evil, God only could deliver him, He delivered him necessarily for His own glory, according to His own nature.<a name=109:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He put man provisionally on another ground -- of perfect creature blessing, but as a sinner apart from Himself, to bring out where he was in sin, and which therefore spoke of sin, and a positive curse -- but this was by the bye for a special end.<a name=109:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The only thing is innocence or glory -- innocence in human condition -- earthly; glory in a heavenly, Angelic condition sustained.<a name=109:8></a> Hence I apprehend, morally speaking, angels could not be brought back because of the knowledge of good and evil in the light with God; so man, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6">Hebrews  6</a>; but -- innocence lost, with the knowledge of good and evil -- the work of God according to His own glory, and hence necessarily bringing into it -- or, a law, provisionally showing the abstract moral perfection of a knowledge of good and evil in a creature, but actually, relatively founded on a prohibition of evil, which brought in, where really apprehended, the conviction of sin.<a name=109:9></a>

		CIVILISATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Civilisation is the artificial and polished life which arises from the elaborate development of skill, in which the faculties of men have been exercised, and in which men are associated, by common recognised rules, and where the mental faculties are in play, and can act reflectively on themselves, in contrast with men individually, or collectively acting from natural impulses and passions, and, at least in a greater degree, by means which nature affords.<a name=110:1></a> For the faculties exist in the savage, and the impulses and passions remain in the civilised, and, if let loose, unrestrained by common recognised rules, can use the means acquired by civilisation to satisfy them, as in revolution, war, etc.<a name=110:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Consequently in civilised society men are more dependent on each other, and more closely united; in savage life more personally free, and individualised, though man is naturally social, if not gregarious, for social is different from gregarious -- supposing mind and speech.<a name=110:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As known in the world, civilisation supposes the fall, but so indeed does barbarism, though in a different way; in fact civilisation began, on man's being driven out from God, in Cain's family; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:16">Genesis  4:16</a> - 24.<a name=110:4></a> Adam in Paradise had no basis of civilisation, the simplicity of his life in innocence gave no occasion for it; what the effect of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:28">Genesis  1:28</a> might have been, supposing Adam had remained unfallen, can be only supposition.<a name=110:5></a> Barbarism was the natural effect of Adam's state when he had lost God, and civilisation is the effort to make, by the development of human faculties and the resources the earth furnished, the world pleasant without Him.<a name=110:6></a> What could a naked creature, thrown upon his own resources outside Paradise, be but a barbarian?<a name=110:7></a> -- though the hunting state was a lower state when alone, and the means of life, but connected with natural energy as in Nimrod -- though God had sent him out to till the ground, and clothed him with skins, not utter barbarism, but little more, only peaceful.<a name=110:8></a>

		We have already seen that the man represents the conduct, the woman the state of the relationship with God; thus then it was not only generally with Abram and Sarai; but Abraham denies the total separation of his wife -- the Church -- to himself, even as Sarah, but it was not Abimelech's fault but Abraham's; so with the Church -- it is not the world's fault, but the Church's -- believers' -- that the Church is put into the hands of the world in this sense.<a name=139:3></a> Sarah is finally reproved, though both are in fault, and Abraham intercedes for the world then, when Sarah is restored -- this has special reference to the Jews and Christ -- so in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12">Numbers  12</a>, Aaron, though also guilty, interceded for Miriam; Abraham takes Christ's place in spirit then -- and so indeed the remnant, though guilty, noted hereafter.<a name=139:4></a>

		As to the Jews, I should say it was the interval immediately before the coming of Christ as the Son born to them, in which the Gentiles are entirely unfruitful while they are in their hands -- the Son is born, and they give up and cast out the old covenant, and then Abimelech recognises that God is with them in all that they do, not seeking to use them for his own purposes.<a name=139:7></a>

		If it be the case, as above, about the Jews, then there is a recognition of them in Abraham in blessing, before the full blessing comes in -- indeed it is so for Christ's sake, for in all their affliction, blessed Lord, He is afflicted -- and thus Abraham would represent both Christ and the Jewish remnant, before the open manifestation of Christ, but it is more a display of principle than full details.<a name=140:4></a> It was when Hagar wandered and lay down, in despair, that Abraham made a covenant and reproved Abimelech after.<a name=140:5></a>

		HOLINESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To estimate holiness aright, we must first of all think of God Himself in His holy nature -- and of a nature, a divine life in which we have fellowship with and enjoy Him.<a name=165:1></a> But for us, sinners, we must then take into account Christ, in and through, and by whom we have a part with God -- further we must take cognisance of the operation of the Holy Ghost, through whom all is revealed and imparted -- lastly of the state and condition of the sanctified.<a name=165:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point needed to be gone into to judge rightly of it, that is the object before us, which, as a means, sanctifies us; for the creature morally lives by objects placed before it, and acting on it.<a name=165:3></a> Besides all this, the Word of God, which is that in which all is revealed, and works effectually in us through faith.<a name=165:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With a holy God we have to do, with a holy God to be in communion -- holiness becomes His house for ever.<a name=165:5></a> But it is important as a preliminary point, to distinguish between righteousness and holiness, both elements of God's nature and character in which we have to do with Him, and even practically that in which we are assimilated to Him in the new nature, "after God created in righteousness and true holiness" -- I do so, because these are often confounded, to the prejudice of the soul's peace.<a name=165:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Righteousness, as contrasted with holiness in God, is the judicial estimate of, and dealing with what is right or wrong -- involves responsibility to some one, and obligation in the one judged -- and, in its exercise, the authoritative acceptance or rejection of what is presented to its judgment.<a name=165:7></a> It is used also for that which is the fulfilment of obligation, and acting according to what is due (and in this sense is true even of God), and satisfies that judicial estimate, but also for the just estimate itself too -- the righteous Lord loveth righteousness -- in all cases, its measure is consistency with the relationship in which we stand -- in God, consistency with Himself and His own perfection, maintaining withal the obligation of those relationships in which He has placed us.<a name=165:8></a> It is thus doing right according to them, or judging justly how far right is done.<a name=165:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Holiness, on the other hand, is the abhorrence, in the nature, of what is evil, and delight in what is good and pure, and, when we speak of men, God having His own full place in

		our hearts (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#35:166">footnote</a></i>), as in God it is His separation from all evil, and abhorrence of it.<a name=166:1></a> One is connected with judicial title, the other with the delights of the nature.<a name=166:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we are clearly told that "without holiness no man shall see the Lord".<a name=166:3></a> This, assuredly true, acts on the conscience, and it is all well; but then we seek to be holy that we may be accepted.<a name=166:4></a> But in this case, it is really righteousness which is sought -- God's judicial estimate of us according to what we are -- it is a question of acceptance, hence of judicial estimate, not of holiness, or our own delight in good, or hatred of what is evil -- and feeling evil in us, we feel God cannot accept us.<a name=166:5></a> Thus, though there may be a holy nature, and an abhorrence of what is evil, and delight in what is good, there is never holiness practically till the question of righteousness is settled; because the holy nature acting on the conscience, this -- our righteousness not being settled, nor our acceptance in righteousness known -- necessarily raises the question as to that acceptance, and ought to do so.<a name=166:6></a> Suffice it to say that it must -- hence the true desire for holiness destroys peace.<a name=166:7></a> When the question of righteousness is settled, and the soul thoroughly convinced of sin, "none righteous, no not one" -- and that it cannot make it out, even if the will is present with it -- cannot make it good as an obligation, which it is before God, the flesh not being subject to the law of God, as it cannot be -- and has given up hope of righteousness in itself, and through grace finds Christ its righteousness before God -- peace made by His precious blood, and He in the presence of God for us -- divine favour resting on it in Christ, knowing that it is in Him, and that it is accepted in the Beloved, by one offering perfected for ever -- in a word, washed from its sins through His precious blood, and not only so, but accepted in Christ in the sweet savour of His acceptance, then the delight in God Himself, from whose love all comes, is free, holiness has its free scope.<a name=166:8></a> We joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have been reconciled to Him.<a name=166:9></a> It is of God's holiness we are made partakers, even when chastened.<a name=166:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This, then, is practically what holiness is -- the soul in the new man in the light as God is, enjoying His purity (enabled to do it through the blood of Christ), and that in grace, having fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ;

		and the more we take it in this simple manner, the more really and practically shall we know what it is.<a name=167:1></a> If we are holy, we shall know what holiness is, only it will be enjoyed in its fulness and perfectness in God Himself, and so directly connected with love, for God is love; His other essential name is light, and in that we walk, being light in the Lord, and there enjoy, as we are formed by love.<a name=167:2></a> We have boldness to enter into the Holiest by the blood of Christ -- and what brought us there?<a name=167:3></a> Infinite love -- and what do we find there?<a name=167:4></a> Infinite love -- and in Christ, nothing in us inconsistent with it; and, walking with God, nothing in our minds or consciences.<a name=167:5></a> "We joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have received the reconciliation" -- for this we must have life, divine life, to know and enjoy it, and by the power of the Holy Ghost be separate, through the eye being fixed on Christ, from evil to good.<a name=167:6></a> The simpler we apprehend this, the better, if we would know what holiness is.<a name=167:7></a> It is separation, in living communion, to God who is holy.<a name=167:8></a>

		It is only as to the means of meeting the practical difficulties of many souls, that I pursue the subject into any details, showing how Scripture teaches us on the subject.<a name=167:9></a> I know not anything which will more fully express our calling in this respect, than the first verses of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, "According as He hath chosen us in him (Christ), before the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and without blame before him in love" -- this is the counsel of God as to us in Christ.<a name=167:10></a> The other part of it -- being sons -- is His prerogative and sovereign purpose, the good pleasure of His will.<a name=167:11></a> The first is according to His nature, both not only in Christ, but Christ's own place in which we are set by grace; it is the first which is according to God's nature, so that He cannot have other than such -- this is our subject here.<a name=167:12></a> As it is here spoken of as the counsel of God, the degree of realisation is not.<a name=167:13></a> It is what His purpose about us is -- it is identified with what God is, in His nature and ways, and what Christ was before Him; of course He is essentially the same now that He is glorified.<a name=167:14></a> The second part of the calling -- sons -- is relationship, but Christ's also -- He is gone to His Father and our Father, His God and our God.<a name=167:15></a> On this wonderful and perfect place (we could have none other such), I have entered elsewhere; my part now is to weigh that part of it which is contained in verse 4.<a name=167:16></a> We may look at it in two ways, as God's nature thus imparted and reflected in

		us, and enjoyed in its perfectness in Him -- or as Christ, as man before God, according to it.<a name=168:1></a> God is blameless in His ways -- He is love and He is perfectly holy -- we are called to answer perfectly to what He thus is.<a name=168:2></a> We are made partakers of the divine nature; the spirit of love and holiness is that of the new man in us, and, as such, its fruit blameless -- hence it is said, we cannot sin, because we are born of God.<a name=168:3></a> Thus the Christian state is, with a nature derived from God, "born of him", and hence necessarily holy -- to be "before God" in His presence; an infinite and infinitely perfect object -- God Himself -- before Him, with a nature capable, as being of Him, of enjoying Him.<a name=168:4></a> We must add, the Holy Ghost as the power of doing so.<a name=168:5></a> The divine nature, with God who is love, a divine and infinite object -- "before him" -- to enjoy, with no thought of self needed (for we answer to His own nature), save to know that His favour rests upon us.<a name=168:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We may also look at it in Christ Himself, as Man here below -- He was holy and without blame, always before God so, and in love; the same applies to verse 5, but on this I do not enter here.<a name=168:8></a> It is what we have to seek to realise -- communion with Him who is light, being light in the Lord, and in the light as He is, called to have communion with Him, not grieving His Spirit who dwells in us.<a name=168:9></a> The measure of it in practice is walking as Christ walked, and walking in the Spirit as we live in the Spirit.<a name=168:10></a> Walking in obedience, we have our <i>fruit</i> unto holiness, a greater knowledge of God, walking in His presence and enjoying Him, and are more deeply imbued with His estimate of all things, with His mind, more separated to Him in spirit, before whom we thus walk.<a name=168:11></a> In obedient righteousness in Christ (for it is to Christ's obedience we are called) we walk, and increasingly in the atmosphere in which God dwells.<a name=168:12></a> Practically separated from evil, we live in that we are separated to, we delight in Him, have communion with Him, and are separate from all that obscures this, and distracts us.<a name=168:13></a> True we see through a glass darkly, then face to face; but the objects are the same -- God revealed in Christ -- and the nature in which we enjoy them, the same.<a name=168:14></a> We joy in God -- we have the treasure, but in a poor earthen vessel, and needing to have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may now inquire into the means of so walking, and what and how it is, as to our place in this world.<a name=169:2></a> It is in every sense -- place, state, relationship with God, nature and glory -- likeness to Christ, and that in glory, for this is the only good.<a name=169:3></a> It is true, this includes glory as well as holiness, but so it is presented in Scripture -- we are "changed into the same image, from glory to glory" -- "he that has this hope in him, purifieth himself even as he is pure".<a name=169:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another element, which though collateral, cannot be separated from it, and that is, love.<a name=169:5></a> If God is holy, His nature is love as well as light, and He cannot, so to speak, be divided; and thus divine love is inseparable from holiness.<a name=169:6></a> For divine affections in us is the very being of holiness, and these cannot be without divine love -- we partake in them of the divine nature.<a name=169:7></a> Failure in love would not be holiness, but flesh and sin -- self as a centre, if not positive hatred -- and this is not holiness, for holiness is separation of heart to God in known love, and so walking in that spirit with others.<a name=169:8></a> This gives us too, superiority over the evil with which we have to say; this, in an infinite way, is in God too, in whose communion we walk in holiness, and then we are followers of God as dear children.<a name=169:9></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, 5, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:43">Matthew  5:43</a> - 48, and <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#6:35">Luke  6:35</a>, 36.<a name=169:10></a>

		So we find in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3">1 Thessalonians  3</a>, "the Lord make you to increase, and abound in love one towards another, and towards all men, even as we do towards you, to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints".<a name=169:11></a> A remarkable passage, showing the path of holiness, before whom it is measured and estimated -- before God, even our Father; and, when and in what circumstances -- the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ with the saints in glory.<a name=169:12></a> Sin is always selfish -- holiness inseparable from love.<a name=169:13></a> It is holiness before God and our Father.<a name=169:14></a> It will have its estimation in the time of glory.<a name=169:15></a>

		Thus as He was the holy One of God here, only absolutely and perfectly as born, even as to the flesh, of the Holy Ghost -- walking in love -- so we, as partakers of life in Him, He being our life, are holy brethren, are saints, brought in as we have seen by His precious blood, but saints as partakers of the life also that was and is in Him.<a name=170:14></a>

		This takes a double character in the Christian, according as we look at him as emerging out of a world of sin, in the power of this new life and the Holy Ghost, "the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus" -- or as sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, and coming thence, so to speak, into the world.<a name=171:2></a> The one we have in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, the other in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>and 5.<a name=171:3></a> In the former, we yield ourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead -- yield our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, our intelligent service, proving what the good and acceptable and perfect will of God is.<a name=171:4></a> Here it is the original principle of giving ourselves wholly up to God, separated, sanctified to Him.<a name=171:5></a> It is simply that -- and that is much -- and true of the believer; we have not love connected with it.<a name=171:6></a>

		The Apostle Paul gives us the blessed effect, he desired for the saints individually, at the end of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, "Strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the length and breadth and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled up to all the fulness of God".<a name=173:9></a> John speaks more of the divine Personality of Christ revealing God, and so our dwelling in Him, and He in us -- for habitually he does not distinguish God and Christ, speaking of Manhood and Godhead in the same sentence, though in chapter 4 he goes up to simple Godhead, and His presence known by the Spirit; Paul more of His mediatorial place -- of the counsels of God accomplished through His work and in His: Person, and that to the glory of God by us.<a name=173:10></a> So that the form is different; still as one gives the fact, true through the Holy Ghost, that God dwells

		But while this is the full blessedness of our present state, living here as creatures acted on by grace, there is another aspect of the operation of the Holy Ghost in us; that is, the fixing the affections and intelligence on the Word which the Holy Ghost reveals, and that with sanctifying power.<a name=174:2></a> Thus the Apostle in Ephesians I prays that they may know the hope of God's calling, and the riches of the glory of God's inheritance in the saints; for the creature, whatever the excellency of his nature, lives by objects -- is characterised by those that govern him -- money -- power -- pleasure -- in a word, our object, what our mind, our <i>phronema</i> is upon, is what we morally are.<a name=174:3></a> Thus where it is on Christ and on heavenly things, we are Christian and heavenly minded.<a name=174:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These then, the Holy Ghost reveals, fixing the affections on the object thus revealed, and so sanctifying the heart.<a name=174:5></a> Thus, so to speak, in its natural effect on the new man -- "With open (unveiled) face beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord".<a name=174:6></a> So in holy spiritual activity -- we know that "When he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is, and every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself even as he is pure".<a name=174:7></a> So the Apostle in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>, "This one thing I do, forgetting the things that are behind, and reaching forth to those things that are before, I press towards the mark for the calling of God above (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#35:174">footnote</a></i>), which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=174:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the exhortation (though the Holy Ghost is not the subject of the Colossians, but life), "set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth"; but these things are called "the things of the Spirit".<a name=174:9></a> "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.<a name=174:10></a> But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit".<a name=174:11></a> "We have received not the spirit which is of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God".<a name=174:12></a> Hence our conversation is in heaven, and we declare plainly that we seek a country.<a name=174:13></a>

		But this consideration of the sanctifying power of the object the Holy Ghost sets before us, gives us the true character and only measure of our sanctification practically -- Christ in glory -- "we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" -- "conformed to the image of his Son, that he may be the firstborn among many brethren" -- "as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly".<a name=175:1></a> The only object and goal of the saint is the prize of the calling above.<a name=175:2></a> This one thing he does.<a name=175:3></a> Hence he purifies himself even as He is pure -- knowing he shall be like Him in glory, seeks to be as like Him as possible now.<a name=175:4></a> When Christ comes, even his body of humiliation shall be fashioned like Christ's glorious body.<a name=175:5></a>

		The goal and object of the heart of the believer is Christ glorified, only the present effect is sanctifying him according to that measure, leading him to walk withal as He walked down here, and to grow up to Him, who is the Head, in all things.<a name=175:6></a> As Christ ever looked up to His Father, and ever did such things as pleased Him -- in His case perfectly -- so we, He being our life, looking up to Him glorified, walk in our measure as He walked.<a name=175:7></a> Hence we read that Christ sanctified Himself -- set Himself apart -- as the Man in glory according to the counsels of God, that we might be sanctified through the truth -- our souls formed by the revelation of that into which He is entered.<a name=175:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It remains to be noticed that it is the Truth -- the Word -- by which we are thus sanctified.<a name=175:9></a> The Word is the truth as to everything, but it is, as Christ was in Person, the revelation of what is heavenly amongst men, and perfectly adapted to man on the earth.<a name=175:10></a> Though it be made effectual, by the Spirit, in the heart, the Word is that by which all is wrought, from the giving of life, onward till glory comes.<a name=175:11></a> So, just before the passage quoted above from <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, we read, "Sanctify them through Thy truth -- Thy word is truth".<a name=175:12></a> Hence, as to life -- "of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first fruits of his creatures" -- man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.<a name=175:13></a> It is by words the Holy Ghost taught, that the things the Holy Ghost revealed were communicated.<a name=175:14></a> It is the incorruptible seed of the Word which endures for ever.<a name=175:15></a> Hence it is by faith -- sinners are sanctified by faith that is in Jesus.<a name=175:16></a> The Word is the revelation of God's mind, and of all that is unseen, and, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, is faith in the heart; and thus

	<div class="paragraph">
		I certainly think that spiritual relationship to God is much more founded on what is spoken of in chapter 2 of Genesis, than the recital of chapter 1.<a name=178:1></a> In chapter 1 it is much more the place man holds in the whole creation -- no doubt a special and distinct one, still as taking his place as of God there; chapter 2 is his distinct relationship with God in connection with his nature.<a name=178:2></a>

		As to man's creation in the image and likeness of Elohim, I think we must add the exercise of voluntary thought.<a name=178:6></a> This is of immense moral importance as connected with responsibility.<a name=178:7></a> It is not mere happy obedience to God, flowing from an undivided, untempted nature, kept in its unity by Him without another thought, but obedience connected with consequences; this we have revealed as the basis of all, not with knowledge of good and evil -- it was no evil <i>in se</i>, but disobedience.<a name=178:8></a> But this was connected with another immensely important thing -- the consciousness of a special connection with God, and God's special interest in him, wrought by breathing from Himself into his nostrils the breath of life.<a name=178:9></a>

		GOD'S QUESTIONS TO MAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The questions which are put to man by God are very remarkable, as shewing the position in which man was, whether in the first Adam, or when put by Jesus in the second -- for it is this difference which is the wonder.<a name=181:1></a> First, God says, "Adam, where art thou?<a name=181:2></a>" -- he was away from God -- He had to ask where he was, i.<a name=181:3></a>e.<a name=181:4></a>, to put his real state to Adam's conscience.<a name=181:5></a> Adam had hid himself; he was naked, and could not, dared not appear.<a name=181:6></a> Away from God, naked -- but the question said he was separated from God, and that by his own conscience.<a name=181:7></a> Terrible, horrible condition!<a name=181:8></a> Such was what the first question brought out.<a name=181:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is, "Where is Abel thy brother?<a name=181:10></a>" here his malice, as murderer, against his brother.<a name=181:11></a> Here it was the not loving his brother or neighbour, as before not loving God; I speak of the principle.<a name=181:12></a> It was the positive active wickedness of man's heart when departed from God, and here also it was hatred against what was connected with God, and in His favour, and had the signs of His favour upon him.<a name=181:13></a> This was fully shewn in the rejection of Christ, of which this was the first manifestation in principle and type.<a name=181:14></a> (It is a clear figure of the blessed Lord's rejection by the Jews, as Cain is of them.<a name=181:15></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Last, it is not God simply addressing responsible man as such, but a glorified Man who is indeed the Son of God -- the Lord, gone into the glory which He had with the Father before the world was.<a name=181:16></a> But though the Lord "God over all blessed for ever" (for who but He had the title to put such a question?<a name=181:17></a>), yet He was Himself a man who had died for sin, for the sins of others, had accomplished Abel's sacrifice; Himself had put all His people's sins away, glorified God as man -- accomplished righteousness, so that in virtue of God's righteousness, He, as man, was on high -- in whom man had taken his place in the presence of God in the divine glory -- the new Man -- the heavenly One -- according to the full glory of the desires and counsels, and the perfect display of God's character, power and glory -- and that in respect of sin and man's ruin.<a name=181:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would state it clearer to say, how remarkable the difference between the questions God puts to man in respect of his responsibility, and that which can be put, and is put when Man is in the glory of God, in virtue of the accomplished work.<a name=182:9></a> That was then man's place in the presence of Him who is "God over all blessed for ever", owning others as one with Him.<a name=182:10></a> It is the contrast between God on earth putting the question, according to His majesty, to man in his responsibility -- he was in sin, and Man, "God over all blessed for ever", who puts it, being in Heaven in virtue of accomplished redemption.<a name=182:11></a>

		He cannot accuse of that height of wickedness at which Paul was, without owning all believers as one with Himself in glory.<a name=182:12></a> Paul (Saul) was slaying them because of Christ whom he could not reach in heaven; his resistance to the witness of the Holy Ghost was against the members -- to convict him of the sin, Christ owns them such.<a name=182:13></a>

		PRAYER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more simply we act on divine precepts and exhortations, the better, for they are the fruit of absolute divine wisdom, which knows divine perfectness and human wants, met in Christ too; but I would say a few words on the real character of prayer.<a name=185:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The answer to prayer seems to me the going forth in divine actions in power -- what has flowed forth from divine wisdom, forming desire and wants in the soul.<a name=185:2></a> This connects itself with love, dwelling in love, and hence connects itself with confidence which faith expresses.<a name=185:3></a> Hence, if it be a mere lust, or to consume it on lust, it is not answered (<a href="../bible/James.htm#4:3">James  4:3</a>), or is answered in chastisement -- is a <i>Kibroth hattaavah</i> (graves of lust); if it be in the Spirit, and the prayer of faith, it is answered according to the request.<a name=185:4></a> Thus also it is connected with the moral state of the soul -- the entering, first in the nature of the thing desired, and then spiritual acquaintance with God's will, into the thoughts of God, and what His love would have and cause us, as moved by that love, to desire.<a name=185:5></a> Christ, perfect in this, could say, "I know that thou hearest me always", save in atonement, where yet, in result, He was yet more gloriously heard.<a name=185:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are often mixed in our thoughts -- there are things that press on us as human beings down here, and we cast ourselves on love, and are sure to be met in love, though the answer may be other than we might seek; but God meets the moral intent of the prayer -- what His Spirit has produced -- though the positive request, in which wisdom failed, may not be accomplished in itself.<a name=185:7></a> But what moves down to us is always what has moved up to God, as wrought in us by the wisdom of God, and the confidence wrought in us by dwelling in love; hence, our prayers should flow, and do where real, from what is immediately drawn from Christ being in the heart by faith -- identity of interest with Him (through grace) in the secret of the Lord with us.<a name=185:8></a> But there may be the sense, thorough spiritual apprehension of the holy goodness of God, of need according to it, and desire of heart towards it, and yet not intelligence of the divine way of meeting the need; this is the case in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, but He who searches the heart knows the <i>phronema</i> of the Spirit, for He intercedes for the saints according to God.<a name=185:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=186>[Page 186]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Grace comes down, and works through the circumstances, though there may be even no remedy for the circumstances, but there is a want, a desire according to God -- the Holy Ghost is there.<a name=186:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, too, all things work together for good to them who love Him; faith realises God's intention -- hence, in the knowledge of His will, knows that it has the petitions -- and this reliance on the ear and arm of God is ever met.<a name=186:2></a> Grace comes down, and takes up its place in Christ, and in faith through Him, in the wants of men and saints down here, and in Christ, according to the wisdom and mind of God, producing perfect confidence in His love, and in the activity of that love; and so in Christ too, as Lord in its place, He was perfection in this down here -- we, according to the measure in which we enter into His mind.<a name=186:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the great general principle is, that what came down into our wants in wisdom, goes up and is answered in power; but this coming down is in grace in Christ, so that it is immediately connected with divine love, and the confidence of faith expresses this.<a name=186:4></a> The great secret is to be with God.<a name=186:5></a> If God trusts His mind with one, and thus he is a prophet, then the action follows -- God does not let His words fall to the ground; and to this there is analogy or approach, when we walk wholly with God, though there be no official function, and, in the case of the prophets, what was announced authoritatively was at any rate sometimes, always in spirit habitually, prayed for, as James teaches us in Elias for the famine, so authoritatively announced in history.<a name=186:6></a> And so the Lord Himself, in the case of Lazarus.<a name=186:7></a> But what a place this gives to prayer -- dependent intercourse with God in grace, as admitted into His interests, though encouraged to bring every want in childlike, perfect confidence in Him, because He has taken up all our interests into His own love.<a name=186:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Divine wisdom, acting in the midst of this world, in love, looks for the exercise of divine power.<a name=186:9></a> It is not simply divine wisdom, but as Christ Himself, divine wisdom exercising itself in the midst of evil; then, as we have seen, dependence is wrought out in it, and confidence where the divine will is known with certainty of answer.<a name=186:10></a> Divine power at our disposal, and when not, when it is the expression of a want with submission to that will and confidence in divine love which gives peace; "If we ask anything according to his will", etc.<a name=186:11></a>, and

		As to the bright effect of it on our souls, it is just the same principle as speaking to them, the moment I believe that God works the real work Himself.<a name=187:22></a> God not only gives us blessing with Himself, but He gives us a part in the other part of His blessedness, viz.<a name=187:23></a>, blessing others.<a name=187:24></a> I preach -- man gets eternal life -- yet it is wholly God's work, not mine; yet God graciously

		LIFE

	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection of life, the sanctifying word, and glory is very interesting in Scripture.<a name=189:1></a> Connect the following passages: "the truth shall make you free", and "the Son shall make you free" -- and that in contrast with being the servant of sin; then, "Sanctify them through Thy truth, Thy Word is truth" -- "For their sakes I sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified by the truth" -- for the Spirit takes of the things of Christ, and shows them to us; but this is the heavenly glory, especially of His Person, into which He is entered in following the path of life -- hence, "we, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord".<a name=189:2></a> This is particularly brought out also in the Lord's work, and our aspirations, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>and <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>.<a name=189:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>we find the Lord having loved the Church, and given Himself for it, sanctifies and cleanses it by the washing of water by the Word, that He may present it to Himself, a glorious Church, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.<a name=189:4></a> Now, one would say, the cleansing has nothing to do with glory -- yes, it is the realising in a life, already given -- which, spiritually speaking, is Christ -- all that is in Christ thus glorified; we are changed into His image; in living principle, and nature it is there.<a name=189:5></a> It is objectively realised, and the life formed into it, and all inconsistent removed by the communications from a glorified Christ to the soul -- we grow up to Him who is the Head in all things.<a name=189:6></a>

		Then comes the physical change, by change or resurrection, so that the body also partakes of it, according to its nature, see <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:11">Romans  8:11</a>.<a name=189:7></a> So in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3">1 John  3</a>, "we know that we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<a name=189:8></a> And everyone that hath this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure".<a name=189:9></a> So the course of the Christian -- Paul would know the power of His resurrection -- go through anything for it -- having the excellency of the knowledge of the glory of Christ, and his hope being to be raised up from among the dead -- he has not yet attained, nor is already perfect, but, forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching forth to the things which are before, he presses towards the mark of the high prize of his calling in Christ Jesus -- the calling <i>ano</i> (above).<a name=189:10></a> When Christ comes, the vile body will be fashioned like His glorious body -- but all tended, in one laid hold of for

		REALISM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that the disputes, between Realists and Nominalists, arose from confounding the acquirement of knowledge by the mere human mind, and the original divine intention and purpose in creation.<a name=191:1></a> God created Adam an individual man no doubt, but also <i>eth ha-Adam</i> (the man) -- that kind of being, and in His image after His likeness.<a name=191:2></a> A child may know man in its father, and gradually generalise, because it has only human sources of knowledge, and humanly; man is only an idea.<a name=191:3></a> But the faith that believes in a Creator, knows that God created a kind of being which <i>is</i> that according to His thought.<a name=191:4></a> So even with the Church -- Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it, to present it to Himself a glorious Church.<a name=191:5></a> Now it was not an idea with no reality, He was going to present it to Himself -- it did not exist actually till it is built up of Him.<a name=191:6></a> Whether we call an idea in God's mind a reality -- which it must be -- is a question which man may decide -- He calls the things that are not, as though they were.<a name=191:7></a> Still, they have reality for faith, according to God's mind who chose to have such a thing, though the mind may learn by abstracting, and so the universal be, as to his learning it, a name -- but he would not have it to learn, were it not really an existing thing in the thought and purpose of God.<a name=191:8></a> God had a certain purpose about the creation -- man -- connecting it, redeemed, with His Son.<a name=191:9></a> Other creatures have not that place -- I say, What is man?<a name=191:10></a> and there is an answer, and an answer which will be accomplished.<a name=191:11></a> Only there may be thought to be a difference between classes or races, and compound ideas -- as a state, a church; but it is not well-founded -- only, one is natural order, the other a constituted state of things.<a name=191:12></a> But if God had in His mind to have a church, it is a real thing, not merely a name, nor indeed is abstraction needed here -- I have only to embrace God's idea of it.<a name=191:13></a> So of the state; if it were God's will to group people under authority or government, the thing is a real thing, and the name the name of a reality, though here abstraction may be called for, as He may allow different forms of government, each of which may group men in a state.<a name=191:14></a> Men's classes when they are <i>genera</i> (not species), may be fictitious, and merely for convenience, but that is nothing to the purpose if there are definite species.<a name=191:15></a>

		FORGIVENESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Forgiveness is, I think, evidently the changed aspect of the mind of him who forgives, as regards the faults of the forgiven.<a name=192:1></a> Where judicial authority, or an injured right existed of the forgiver, and judgment as to the person concerning the act, ceased in the mind, judgment was no longer its aspect for the wrong done.<a name=192:2></a> It may be authoritative judgment of the wrong, or the kind of authority there is in the possession of a right -- there is authority as to that, so that we may say, in general, that it is authority ceasing to view the fault in the aspect of judgment, and, thereon, releasing the offender who had come under that judgment; hence, it is evident, it cannot go beyond the claim or title to judge of him who takes cognizance of the offence.<a name=192:3></a> All beyond this is impossible in the nature of things; I may forgive a thief, or a murderer, his wrong, but this does not screen him from the laws, nor from God's judgment if unrepentant.<a name=192:4></a> A man may be forgiven of God, and yet as testimony in the world, providential effects may follow, because the spheres are different, and everlasting exclusion from His presence, or favour, is the effect of sin; or, I may impose a condition -- as if my child had stolen an apple, I may require him to return the apple, or I do not forgive him, because there is a double relationship -- my parental authority, and the wrong done to another.<a name=192:5></a> But, in general, forgiveness is the release of one in fault from the judgment of one in authority -- who has title to release him, and this includes all wrong -- and takes place in the mind of him who has authority, who ceases to hold him in the aspect of judgment.<a name=192:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many consequences and effects may follow, but this, I think, is what forgiveness is; the consequence is, it is according to the measure and sphere in which that authority moves, and applies to the judgment from which the offender is released.<a name=192:7></a> God may chasten governmentally for our good, or even in testimony as in David's case, and <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#14:20">Numbers  14:20</a>, yet, as between Him and the guilty, forgive, and not impute the sin -- no longer hold him guilty.<a name=192:8></a> I may forgive a wrong doer, but it is measured by the value and import of my forgiveness.<a name=192:9></a> The church may bind sin on a guilty Christian, in the exercise of discipline, or forgive, in restoring or releasing from the discipline, and God will sanction it, but it does not go beyond

	<div class="paragraph">
		When all the Apostles were commissioned to preach remission, this was from God.<a name=193:8></a> It was no action of the Church at all -- on the reception of the Word, they were admitted into the Church, their sins being remitted; there, there is no imputation of sins.<a name=193:9></a> Hence Ananias can say to Saul, "Arise, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord" -- it was the earthly administration of forgiveness, a present reception of the peace which Christ had made -- then the government of God, I add, of the Church begins, and in that sphere of government, forgives or binds by judgment; God does so, as in <a href="../bible/Job.htm#36">Job  36</a>, and the Church, cognizant of His mind, ought to be able to do, and the individual by the prayer of faith obtain it.<a name=193:10></a> It has nothing to do with the putting away, or imputing sin as to condemnation, but only, as far as the Church goes, to those who are forgiven by one offering -- perfected for ever, or supposed to be so, and dealt with as such.<a name=193:11></a> "Do ye not judge them that are within; them that are without God judgeth" -- their reception in again is present administrative forgiveness -- they enjoy, as amongst the forgiven therein, the

		In the giving of the Law we have clearly Elohim, God as such, and man in His presence.<a name=214:1></a> Moses went up to God, the people drew near to God, and God said, etc.<a name=214:2></a> But then in all that is given it is Jehovah thy God, and the whole character of the Law is this, "who brought thee out" -- "thy God" -- "visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children" -- "the days long in the land".<a name=214:3></a> It is on the ground of a people in relationship, "I have borne you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.<a name=214:4></a> Now therefore" -- A law to Gentiles would own them not outcast, as a people whom God could guide, and give rules to, in connection with Himself; that law may contain a true rule for man in flesh, but must be given to man in relationship to God, as a rule for him in that place.<a name=214:5></a> The Gentiles were not yet revealed (see Simeon's song), and God winked, as to government in this world, at the times of ignorance -- nor even finally will they be judged by it.<a name=214:6></a> Reasoning on the spirit of <i>nomos</i> (law) is something else, and goes further; the Pharisees had hopes of eternal life by it.<a name=214:7></a> Christ never says this: "This do and thou shalt live".<a name=214:8></a> As Scripture speaks: "He that doeth these things shall live in them".<a name=214:9></a> Man's natural longings and heart may go further -- he thinks he can keep it, and seeks that fuller life he knows of by it.<a name=214:10></a> Not so faith, "if there had been a law given, which could have given life", for now life means more -- then only by times, in longings.<a name=214:11></a>

		The character of Moses is certainly one of the most blessed in the word of God; still all man's conduct in the Scriptures is given us to judge by -- to judge ourselves by -- and I think I see in the breaking of the tables, man's righteousness it is true, but not a divine act -- not that I think he could have done anything else then -- it was surely righteous.<a name=231:15></a> How could he bring the precious open law of God into a camp which had already violated it, and was naked to their shame before their enemies?<a name=231:16></a> But I do not see that he had consulted God, in lowliness of spirit with Him, about the law, and "what am I now to do with thy law?<a name=231:17></a>" broken-hearted as to its honour and this result.<a name=231:18></a> Christ was in a different position -- in the same as to Israel -- but what a position He took, Himself the victim of all this!<a name=231:19></a> It is true He alone could, that is clear, but one feels the difference, and what a place as to the law and the condition of the people under it, He takes as victim.<a name=231:20></a> How, accomplishing righteousness, it sets aside the whole condition of the people by taking it in grace -- this set aside all necessity of vindicating God's honour in acting as to the people -- He did it gloriously, perfectly, in suffering, and accomplished all, and magnified the law and made it honourable.<a name=231:21></a>

		community.<a name=233:1></a> And then see the other side of this truth -- the time for the accomplishment of this counsel of grace was not yet come, and therefore God does not put it into the heart of Moses on the mountain to ask: "And what am I to do now with the violated law?<a name=233:2></a>" but, after having broken the tables of the violated law (having received in virtue of the promise to Abraham, etc.<a name=233:3></a>, a pardon as to God's acts of government, and afterwards in hot anger broken the tables) he says: "Ye have sinned a great sin, and now I will go up to the Lord; peradventure I shall make propitiation for your sin".<a name=233:4></a> But the answer of God sets aside entirely the work of expiation, and casts each sinner on his own responsibility in this breaking of the tables, and proposed but rejected expiation -- leaves entirely out the work of Christ, which places the Church on the ground of accomplished justice -- God's justice -- after a violated law.<a name=233:5></a>

		SYMBOLS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ordinary prophecy gives the application of power to a certain path, and against certain conduct, approved and disapproved respectively of God; it is never the statement of mere facts -- those facts are the introduction of God's power sanctioning, and judging certain things, and introducing Christ's glory.<a name=253:1></a> But a symbol gives the morally characterised existence of the thing itself.<a name=253:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of symbolical prophecy is different, and has special instruction in this respect, that, from the nature of it, it gives the full moral characteristics which designate, in God's eyes, the thing spoken of.<a name=253:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all prophecy, principles then are involved, but, besides this, facts which effectuate God's judgment on them, and His estimate of them, for neither does He ever so act, till they are ripe; hence also, if we seize the moral bearing or language of symbols, we get a large introduction into the mind and purpose of God.<a name=253:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A symbol is more than a figure, though in its nature it is figurative.<a name=253:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A figure is simply the use of some known fact or object in nature, or some material act, to represent, and present sensibly, what is moral or mental.<a name=253:6></a> It runs into every part of language, and is used unconsciously, e.<a name=253:7></a>g.<a name=253:8></a>, he drew a lovely picture of virtue -- 'drawing a lovely picture' is a mere figure, at once intelligible, and hardly felt to be a figure and so of almost every sentence we use, which is not simply speaking of material things -- 'he dragged me into an argument' -- 'hammered away at his subject'.<a name=253:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A symbol goes further; it does borrow images, but it uses them, not merely to render a mental thought more sensible by material objects, but to create a positive object of thought, often combining various circumstances, and characteristics, to give the moral idea of the object whose existence it thus reveals characteristically and as a whole, so that it may be recognised by these characteristics.<a name=253:10></a> The mere figurative speech thus takes some sensible fact, as the vivid expression of what is mentally known, or communicated; the symbol takes any known elements or objects to create a new idea -- to express a new fact.<a name=253:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The symbol, however, is not always a combination of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=254>[Page 254]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		characteristic elements; it may take an object which is in relationship with others to represent what is in an analogous one -- as the Sun, for supreme authority.<a name=254:1></a> In such cases, indeed in all cases, the main point is, to seize the abstract idea meant to be conveyed; hence also the object used as symbol by itself, may be also spoken of in positive relationship with another, and the relationship is the point of the symbol, and then we must not confound it with the object taken by itself.<a name=254:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me adduce some instances to illustrate what I have just said: In the ten horned beast we have a combination of elements -- body -- heads -- horns.<a name=254:3></a> Besides as a beast, what is ravenous is depicted, what is not intelligent as a man, is not in submission to, and in relationship with God, but acting by its own will and power.<a name=254:4></a> In a great tree -- exaltation and power in the earth, and therewith also competency to protect, and to be a resource for others; or again in the Sun -- as indicating supremacy, or supreme authority -- we have examples of the second class spoken of.<a name=254:5></a> Fowls of the air picking up seed and devouring it, are not the same as fowls seeking shelter under the branches of a great tree, because the idea is not being fowls, but devouring and taking away, of which fowls were a natural instrument in such case; in the other the thought was not fowls either, but the power of the tree to shelter and protect, and the abstract intention of the image is that which we must look to.<a name=254:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some further details will render these preliminary remarks still clearer, and afford a safeguard against the precipitate use of symbols.<a name=254:7></a> When their use is well understood, they will be found to be a regular language, requiring indeed patience, and the power of analysis and abstraction to learn the leading idea of each term, but still, when that is learned, affording considerable assistance in the interpretation of those parts of Scripture in which they are employed.<a name=254:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First then, the same symbol may be used for several objects, and such as are opposed to each other in their historical existence, provided the abstract idea represented by the symbol be maintained.<a name=254:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Sun may be, and is used of Christ as Supreme in righteousness, or of the supreme power in the dominion of the beast; in either, it is supreme power -- in the one case, of righteousness, in the other, of oppression and bitter persecution.<a name=254:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The clothing with the Sun in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>, is still with supreme authority; "the moon under her feet" (of the woman) is merely the reflected system of law and ordinances, entirely put down and of no worth -- in fact, the state of Israel under the old covenant.<a name=255:1></a> The new moon, or the blowing of the trumpet in the new moon, is the return of Israel to light and honour after disappearing from view; it is no longer the reflective character in contrast with the sun, but re-appearance which is the leading idea.<a name=255:2></a> Taken simply as the moon, it is a secondary, and not the supreme glory in the place of authority, with the sense perhaps of dependence on another.<a name=255:3></a> When sun, moon and stars are found together, all in the ruling and conspicuous place of importance are embraced -- what stands in a conspicuous place, a place of display and rule.<a name=255:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will examine now various symbols which occur to me.<a name=255:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sun -- Supreme rule as ordained of God, in blessing or judgment.<a name=255:6></a> "The Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#4:1">Malachi  4:1</a>, 2), but it is the time of judgment.<a name=255:7></a> In the Apocalypse we have Jerusalem, clothed with the Sun -- Jerusalem, or the Jewish people clothed with supreme authority -- the old reflection and image of it in the old covenant, under her feet; so, chapter 16: 8, it is the supreme power in the earth of the beast.<a name=255:8></a> The source of the image is evident -- the sun set supreme in the heavens.<a name=255:9></a> The full antitype will be when Christ, the Sun of righteousness, takes to Him His great power and reigns, <a href="../bible/Joel.htm#2:10">Joel  2:10</a>, quoted in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24">Matthew  24</a>, <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13">Mark  13</a>, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a>, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#6:12">Revelation  6:12</a>, and chapter 8: 12 -- in all these the idea is supreme rule in the sphere spoken of.<a name=255:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Sun, then, is supreme authority, set up over the earth.<a name=255:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Moon, a reflected and subordinate vessel, to represent governmental authority on the earth.<a name=255:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Stars, smaller independent authorities -- vessels of light and power.<a name=255:13></a>

		The Sea and great waters, masses of people, viewed as such, that is, taken in the mass as unformed and undirected.<a name=255:14></a>

		Rivers are portions of population, to which a given form and direction has been given.<a name=255:15></a> It implies often some principle which gives it its character, or produces national consistency, or a nation; only that when used in its highest sense, it is more connected with the influences which flow from God's presence -- the refreshment with which He blesses the earth,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		or even the heavenly city -- because a perennial stream, in the East, is a chiefest blessing.<a name=256:1></a> As the rivers, in general, are mere general influences which animate and combine men, and give, as a motive, their impulse to them, so this is God's influence to refresh, and make glad His people.<a name=256:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Water, when used by itself, is the Word in the power of the Spirit of God, but it is still the divine source of truth and grace.<a name=256:3></a> That which would have been an influence, flowing down from what was near God, to carry diffused blessing and refreshment from Him in all quarters, became, in fallen man, after Babel's judgment, local influences which combined men in human passions and energies.<a name=256:4></a> Water, in itself, is looked at also as cleansing, but, in this character flows to us only through the death of Christ -- death to sin is the only true cleansing -- but this requires more accurate analysis.<a name=256:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the use of water, as a symbol, we must distinguish the element itself, and divers objects physically composed of it where its physical condition is not the symbolic use.<a name=256:6></a> In itself, it is used in a double way, as cleansing and refreshing, this is quite natural from its use -- we drink of water, and wash with water -- with both the Word is connected, as it vivifies and cleanses, we are "born of water" and "washed with water" -- but "born of water" is intimately connected with cleansing, but it is used for refreshing and drinking.<a name=256:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where we find "great waters", "many waters", the idea is wholly different -- it is not applied to us internally or externally; it is a mighty unformed mass, seen often in tumultuous motion, and is used for masses of people, as such, i.<a name=256:8></a>e.<a name=256:9></a>, not characterised by particular forms or institutions.<a name=256:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Living water is fresh and clear -- it is refreshment in the power of the Spirit, whether springing up in us into eternal life, or flowing from us.<a name=256:11></a> The next use of it is in the form of rivers.<a name=256:12></a> Still I think here we must distinguish the cases where the main idea is refreshment, and the river is merely its perennial and abundant character, and where "river" is the main idea.<a name=256:13></a> Thus, in "a pure river of water of life", the main idea is "water of life"; it flowed from the throne of God and the Lamb.<a name=256:14></a> "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" -- this, whether finally in the heavenly city as a symbol, or on earth out of Jerusalem, gives the idea of a blessed influence proceeding from God.<a name=256:15></a> It leads up to one of an inferior character, but analogous -- that Eden was a water-shed,

		or plateau of water sources, and thence went off in four streams for the refreshing and blessing of the country below it; this, though they may remain physically, has been ruined, and now rivers are from the source and power of man, however Providence may order it.<a name=257:1></a> "My river is my own", says Pharaoh -- the king of Assyria was to "overflow all his banks and reach to the neck" -- thus rivers came to mean symbolically, nations, armies of people under certain direction or influence, flowing onward actively in a given direction, as, "Whose land the rivers have spoiled".<a name=257:2></a> It is still the outflow of active principles, but not of God; the ultimate abstract idea is the same.<a name=257:3></a> I have been fuller here, however, because it is the case the most difficult to separate from its adjuncts in its various applications.<a name=257:4></a>

		INSPIRATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is this character in inspiration -- I do not speak of the Old Testament now, which is not in general, properly speaking, doctrinal or a revelation of God, but of His acts and ways on the earth -- there is a revelation of such truth relating to the glory of Christ, or of God in Christ, as could be had by no human knowledge, and this, though new truth, yet when known we see to be necessary truth, He being what all the rest of Scripture declares, so that it falls in with, and connects itself with an infinite number of other truths, and consequences, and relationships which apply to and are connected with His Person.<a name=260:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, take <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>-- we have a revelation of the glory of Christ as Son -- all things were created by Him and for Him; now no man but can see here that it is a declaration of truths or doctrines relative to Christ, which can be known only by relation, are given as such, and have this character.<a name=260:2></a> Yet it is clear that, if He created all things and all things were created for Him, if He takes a place amongst creatures (e.<a name=260:3></a>g.<a name=260:4></a>, as man), He must when He has, be, as to final purpose, the Head of them; yet this connects itself, though an independent revelation, with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, unfolded by the Apostle in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>-- the doctrine of the Headship and exaltation of Christ, in resurrection, at the close of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>-- His heirship of all things as Son, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>, and a multitude of passages which link together the whole body of doctrine as to Christ, as a whole.<a name=260:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take again the Epistle to the Hebrews; here we have a definite revelation of the priesthood of Christ, and His ascension into heaven, in the presence of God the Father, to exercise it.<a name=260:6></a> Now this presents itself as a definite positive revelation, yet it connects itself, though quite on a different subject, with the whole doctrine of our heavenly standing, which is so characteristic of real Christianity and so contrary to Judaism, see chapter 7: 26, 27, yet links it with our present known and felt infirmity, and gives us the bearing, aim, and key to the whole Levitical system, while it sets it aside entirely.<a name=260:7></a> It is connected, too, with the numerous passages which unfold, on the one hand, the divine nature and glory of Christ, and at the same time His elevation to heaven -- noticed historically in the Gospels and the Acts, doctrinally in the Epistles -- and at the same time employs in the fullest way all His humiliation and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another mark which I do not enlarge on, as often noticed -- the absence of mere human persuasion, and the divine authority with which the Word speaks to man, not which it assumes for its own credit, as fearing it might not be accepted, but as never needing anything for this authority acting in love for man, and woe to him who does not!<a name=261:4></a> It is what the centurion said was sufficient -- <i>eipe logo</i> (say in a word) -- I speak of this character.<a name=261:5></a> Mohammed claimed this, but he proved, supposed it would be denied, justified it.<a name=261:6></a> Scripture, while asserting it if needed for edification, leaves itself to its own expression of what it is.<a name=261:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point I observe is its reality, i.<a name=261:8></a>e.<a name=261:9></a>, it really deals with men's souls.<a name=261:10></a> You may find good writings pressing things on men, founding themselves on Scripture, using the authority of God to deal with men, and speaking as men; you may find spurious works pretending to give communications of Peter or Paul, etc.<a name=261:11></a>, but they are written to prove the excellence of Peter or Paul, piously or evilly, for there are both, but none have the smallest appearance of God really dealing with men, as God, if He be God, must deal with living, real men's consciences, and with love as well as truth, as God a Saviour.<a name=261:12></a> It is a real, present, living, actual declaration and dealing of God with men, according to what both are, and bearing all the consequences of such a dealing.<a name=261:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may unfold truth -- I may urge even conduct as a matter of exhortation -- but when good men have done this, divine communications are owned; but divine writings, as a direct communication addressed to souls, imply in their non-reception the rejection of God in the truth which He reveals as an eternal necessity to the soul, and in the authority of His word which conveys it.<a name=261:14></a> It is the present basis of relationship between God and the soul, and cannot but be so as revealing God to it.<a name=261:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a character in the Scriptures very remarkable, besides the blessed fact of its being the truth -- there is not a wandering of the human mind -- a device of the enemy -- an elaborate system of error -- those immense systems which flow from a mixture of depraved original truth or knowledge of God, and the workings of the human mind, and craving after what it had not of God.<a name=262:3></a> There is not one of the things which the enemy has raised, by tradition and human imagination, into high-flown deception, which are not judged, and their true character told in unmistakable terms -- this is very remarkable.<a name=262:4></a> They are immense and elaborate -- high flown -- wrought out -- puffed up, so as to engross and amaze and mystify man.<a name=262:5></a> A few words of God break the whole spell; vast as they are they are all described in an unmistakable way -- their immense and imposing vastness puffed out into swollen power, forms of piety and professed wisdom shrink into the evident certain truth which gives the key to them all.<a name=262:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, in more than one way -- they are morally accurately described in every element of their character, the facts are told with matchless simplicity, while they are but the idle exaggeration of as fabulous ghost stories, when some simple fact is known; and this in so few words, so true, so perfectly telling everything about them, that the divine character of the Word is marked in the most wonderful way.<a name=262:7></a> Hence, I apprehend the Mosaic history was written after the schemes of idolatry were afloat, and the institutions of the Levitical law took up all that had been abused, and gave it in its true place, even in symbols, and associated it with the true knowledge of God.<a name=262:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was a difference as to Christianity in this -- the early knowledge of God, though true was of course not full as now; hence there was opportunity of man's seeking out, when fallen and under the enemy's influence, many inventions.<a name=262:9></a> Moses -- God's word and revelation -- comes after, and takes up all the symbolical expressions and puts them in their place -- judged

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Apocalypse, which treats of the corporate and open form of such evil in the world, is hence all through a book of judgment, and though indeed all so -- I speak now from chapter 4 out -- and the evil is so dealt with, even when a witness is given by men, fire goes out of their mouths and judges.<a name=263:7></a> It is not like Christ at the Samaritan village, but connects itself with judgment, and the divine announcement of the everlasting Gospel is that the hour of His judgment is come.<a name=263:8></a> Hence the Spirit does not speak expressly, as in the Epistles, but symbolically -- we are on the ground of earthly dealings where alone Jesus is not owned, but Gentiles in power -- such is the key to the use of symbolical prophecy, I believe -- but this by-the-bye.<a name=263:9></a> The great principle, I speak of, gives, besides the blessed positive truth, a singularly remarkable character to the Word of God.<a name=263:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to inspiration, it is a mistake to suppose that the reception of texts, which declare inspiration, do not affect the credibility of the history, because they show the writers, if not true, to be fanatics or impostors, and thus their facts cannot be trusted, at any rate as an adequate revelation of God.<a name=263:11></a> No doubt historical veracity and exactness are quite different from inspiration, and it may be very useful, for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, much of the history of Genesis could be known only by inspiration, or even revelation; so even of the Gospel history, and while I quite admit the historical veracity may be rightly shown, or rather the folly and unreasonableness of those who dispute it, and that the human character is manifested in the inspired authors, yet I must, if I sit down to read it as Scripture, I must estimate it as a divine work.<a name=264:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Evidently belief in Christianity may be brought about, not without the Word, but without any estimate or personal examination of the Scripture; but if I take Scripture up inspiration is directly involved in its own account of itself, and gives it its value -- you cannot read it as Scripture, as a record of what a religion is, but as an inspired statement.<a name=264:5></a> Is it to be alleged that the histories of Scripture do not reveal heavenly or heaven-given truth?<a name=264:6></a> If the Gospels do not rightly present Christ, but only a human estimate of Him, where am I?<a name=264:7></a> If the creation be not inspired, where am I?<a name=264:8></a> Or the whole history of Genesis, or if the accounts of Israel's history be not according to God, how have God's righteousness in judgment?<a name=264:9></a>

		The discourses of our Lord -- their historical occasion and bearing -- (and they are generally abstracts) if not given as God would give them, cannot possibly teach me aright -- they will mislead me with the authority of Christ.<a name=264:10></a> They are His teaching, as the wisdom of the Holy Ghost recorded it, for the Church in all ages.<a name=264:11></a>

		My faith in Christianity may not depend on the Gospels at all -- no one's did at first -- but if I have them, and their contents do not give me a divine revelation of Christ, I have no divine ground of faith left, save as God's sovereign grace may keep me without any known ground.<a name=264:12></a> I admit the human element for men, but I cannot do so to the enfeebling the divine.<a name=264:13></a> God uses each Gospel to present the truth of Christ's history by a human instrument, quite independent of the

		You have four witnesses, but you have God making each of them perfect, and sure in his own place.<a name=265:2></a> Christ distinguishes the testimony of the Apostles and the Holy Spirit, but He also says that the Holy Ghost would make their testimony perfect, bringing to their remembrance what He had said.<a name=265:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I admit the human element fully -- it is most interesting, and Christ tells us the talent was given according to every man's ability, and still more, the working of the Spirit in the inspired authors in the order of the dispensation they were in, even to the difference of the apostolic writers; but it is utterly (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#35:265">footnote</a></i>) unfaithful and false to tell us to read them as authentic human writings -- an element or form of expression, because the Holy Ghost was acting in the circumstances to which the form applied, is not a human writing.<a name=265:4></a>

		In meeting unbelief I may show the rationalists to be unreasonable on their own ground, and if they are genuine they are for him so many confirming testimonies, but if they are authentic human writings, and I read them as such, I exclude the divine element while so taking them, and half of it becomes tradition or hearsay.<a name=265:5></a> I take the first chapter of Genesis -- as an authentic human writing, what is it?<a name=265:6></a> I take the first chapter of John -- as an authentic human writing, what is it?<a name=265:7></a> Who can authenticate the Word being with God, and being God?<a name=265:8></a> What is the Revelation as a human writing?<a name=265:9></a> Why even the different order of events, if a mere human writing?<a name=265:10></a> All the revelations preclude this -- authentic writings, if you please, and by men, but authentic <i>human</i> writings I cannot receive.<a name=265:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Old Testament gave a testimony to Christ, besides the historical basis of the whole matter, in the history of man and God's people; He was the subject and object of their testimony, but Christ's and, through grace, our testimony, is different -- His testimony was the expression of the thing in Himself, so ours, though imperfect -- the life of Jesus manifested in our mortal bodies, the epistle of Christ written by the Spirit of the living God on the fleshy tables of the heart.<a name=266:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the New Testament inspiration partook of this, though there was also, in tongues and prophecy, dictated utterances; that is, the full blessing of the thing revealed was conveyed to the heart and understanding.<a name=266:4></a> How was Paul made an Apostle and minister of the Church?<a name=266:5></a> By the revelation of Christ in glory to him, for his own conversion, through grace; so he speaks, "When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood" -- so in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4">2 Corinthians  4</a>, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give (out) the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" -- so indeed in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:12">1 Corinthians  2:12</a> - 14, they had received the Spirit to know; only, when it was to be for divine communication also, they spoke it in words taught of the Holy Ghost.<a name=266:6></a> And this is the instruction of the Lord Himself on the subject, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink, and, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=266:7></a> But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him should receive".<a name=266:8></a> The streams which flowed forth for others, were the fruit of what had been drunk for self; this is true of all so ministering, only, as we have seen, for what is properly called inspiration, the words were given by the Holy Ghost also.<a name=266:9></a>

		But choice, to make out righteousness, is all a blunder, because if man had not gone wrong, there was no righteousness to make out -- if he had gone wrong, in heart and will, choice was no good to make out righteousness, to say nothing of setting aside Christ.<a name=272:11></a> Return to God -- faith -- is alone the path of it that became perfect in its object -- the Father revealed in the Son, in Christ, and in the revealed purpose of God, when, as Man, He has taken the place of Glory, Head over all.<a name=272:12></a> The responsibility came in by-the-bye, however real, as it is, and its reality the basis of the bringing out of the other, in the first Adam, the perfect purpose in the Second.<a name=272:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But further, with regard to freewill, man's likeness to God is an important point, for man was set to have a will and to exercise it; Angels were not.<a name=273:9></a> This leads us to a double sense of will.<a name=273:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the mere energy of nature which sets our practical powers in motion; this all active beings have, even animals -- so Angels, only their activities, and what they will flows from the will of another, even God.<a name=273:11></a> But there is another sense of will, where I determine for myself from some motive; this Adam had in innocence, independent of the test of obedience which exercised him on the point whether his will was at any rate subject to God's, or what man is pleased to call "free".<a name=273:12></a> He was put into the garden to dress and to keep it; he dressed it as he pleased; he pleased himself in it -- was meant to please himself -- and, though in a little finite sphere, was in the image of God in this, which Angels are not.<a name=273:13></a> But he was in God's image in doing as he pleased simply; being governed by motives (which man calls being free, because it is not obedience to another), is a far lower state than the spirit of obedience, and so indeed in itself was Adam's, for Christ took the place of simple obedience and doing God's will.<a name=273:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I refer to an absolute will, as an image of God, though exercised in a subordinate sphere, and a contrast with a perfectly blessed state, such as Angels.<a name=274:4></a> It may be a title to have one without restraint from another, but till I have chosen, I have no will -- what gives me one?<a name=274:5></a> If God and good, it is grace; if not, it is something else that is evil and self.<a name=274:6></a> Freewill belongs to God only, in its true sense -- the right to please Himself identified, as it is, with the essential goodness of His nature; it belonged to man, in a finite way, within the limits of obedience.<a name=274:7></a> To say he was free to do evil, save as not outwardly hindered, is an abomination; <i>now</i> he is certainly inclined to sin, to say he is free to continue in it, equally so.<a name=274:8></a> He is bound to turn to good, but finds hindrance in an evil nature.<a name=274:9></a>

		As regards God's choosing, out of all possible worlds, the best, it is a weak and foolish thought it seems to me, as the world must in thought be created to compare, and He who could think a good world and consequently approve of it by His thought, had no need to think a bad one to compare with it.<a name=274:10></a> His own thought, which in thought created it, could do so for His own glory, according to the perfectness natural to His own thought -- I do not create by my thoughts, nor am I perfect to do so, and I compare; save as mercy and in gracious condescension to us, God does not think -- we think, because we do not know.<a name=274:11></a> I do not admit that this created world is of God's counsels at all -- it is a fallen one; besides it results in something, and the result must be the object of counsel, not the probationary productive process, though He may order all in it towards that result, but what is perfectly to the purpose, as means, may be utterly inadequate as an ultimate object of purpose, and if we attempt to justify it, as such, we must be

		DEPENDENCE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that no creature can subsist in truth, save in absolute dependence on God.<a name=276:1></a> It must be kept to be in the truth -- cannot subsist without it -- for, if it is not dependent, and if dependence is real, it must be kept.<a name=276:2></a> It has lost its place of creature, if it is not in the truth of it.<a name=276:3></a> The first principle of its being, as such, is that dependence; it is in virtue of creation, i.<a name=276:4></a>e.<a name=276:5></a>, it subsists in relationship with the Creator, and with the Creator as such, and does not exist if the Creator has not created it -- exists in virtue of His power as Creator, and of His will too; hence, the moment it has made itself, in <i>will</i>, independent (in <i>fact</i> it cannot) it has falsified its existence -- its existence, morally, is a lie in opposition to the truth of its necessary condition, that by which alone it exists.<a name=276:6></a> Thus dependence is alone the truth of any creature.<a name=276:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, if this be so, there must be an active process of sustainment by Him who creates, otherwise the dependence is in vain; hence, whenever the creature is left to its responsibility, free to the action of its own will, its first act in will is its fall -- it has gone out of dependence -- it has left God -- and the truth of its position with God, its subsistence, if it subsists, is a lie, and will becomes, not a mere part of nature, setting the rest in activity, but a will of its own, i.<a name=276:8></a>e.<a name=276:9></a>, rebellion against God.<a name=276:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A creature, not positively sustained, necessarily falls; and if there is to be responsibility, and moral trial, in whatever shape, this must be gone through.<a name=276:11></a> Christ is just the contrary of all this -- He was dependent and obedient -- came, when in the form of God, having no independent place to seek, in the form of a servant to do God's will.<a name=276:12></a> When good and evil are known in a state of things grown up away from God, besides the conscious disposition itself, the Word and prayer are the expression of the two sides of this relationship.<a name=276:13></a>

		But I have another remark to make.<a name=277:9></a> It is important that we hold fast the sense of the victory of good over evil by faith now, while evil has the upper hand, or our thoughts of God will be wrong -- falsely characterised, I do not say false.<a name=277:10></a> We cannot, ought not, to hide the evil or palliate it.<a name=277:11></a> A world that has rejected the good that came into it, is in itself an evil and judged world; its works too are evil -- there is no good in palliating evil.<a name=277:12></a> But then I ought to be so with God, according to the perfection and work of Christ, as to be able to come in according to His mind into the scene of evil, i.<a name=277:13></a>e.<a name=277:14></a>, with a sense and consciousness of perfect good.<a name=277:15></a> This gives a different tone to my having to say to the world; I shall find evil to say to, evil to know -- morally speaking it is all evil, man's mind being in a lie and false -- enmity against God.<a name=277:16></a> Nor am I to deceive myself as to it; I know it in knowing myself, but I come into and approach it with the sense of good in my soul -- I think no evil -- I see in the very creation around me proofs of goodness, see God's creation in it, and by faith look at it, and enjoy it as such, though I know evil is in it -- as Christ who knew all the evil, yet could notice the beauty of a flower, and tell us that God fed the ravens.<a name=277:17></a> And so it should be with us -- we ought not to let the sense of evil around us shut out God.<a name=277:18></a> Christ has entitled us to see good in the midst of evil, though that good has made us conscious of the evil.<a name=277:19></a>

		True miracles must be to demonstrate God, and reveal Him in some way; if a miracle does not do that, it either produces no effect, or sets me against its author -- a being who has power but is not God, in whom I confide, whose goodness I know -- for a miracle is always a testimony of or to something.<a name=281:11></a>

		REVELATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A revelation supposes its own possibility, for what exists is possible -- that is clear, but it is not an <i> priori</i> point, for it would have to be proved -- it cannot be proved without a revelation.<a name=301:1></a> But it is not doubted either, save as a result of reasoning; man never questions the possibility of a revelation.<a name=301:2></a> In his natural state, he makes God too like himself, or like a fish, to suppose he cannot communicate with man; it is only when revelation has made known the true God -- perhaps a mixture of reasoning and conscience can go thus far, as in Plato -- that the distance is felt; at any rate, a revelation is not made to Platonists.<a name=301:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mankind have no idea of such a difficulty; and a revelation, besides being founded on an actual revelation of God, as to Abraham at Sinai, in the Person of the Lord Jesus to Paul, is, when it becomes individual, only to conscience in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=301:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are accustomed to think of revelation as it stands now before us, but no revelation began so; it was to a people called by the revelation of God Himself, to a people or to individuals to whom He displayed His power -- or if false, who so pretended, or had diabolical revelations.<a name=301:5></a> But it is true there is no natural supposition that God cannot reveal Himself; it revolts feeling, and one may feel it ought to be, and must be, or it destroys all link with God, all positive authority (not sense of right and wrong, that is independent of it, we are as God "one of us" in that) and direct responsibility; but I do not think reason ascribes to Him a capacity to communicate with the creature He has made.<a name=301:6></a> The heathen doctrine of <i>logos</i>, <i>bathos</i>, silence the unknown God, all flow from a certain apprehension of God, which consciously reasoned Him -- man far away from God.<a name=301:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Power of apprehending by thought is not the same however as power of communicating to man; I do not say to thought used in the sense of reason, which use of it however is a great fallacy, when used to say mind or man's power of concluding is all that is thought.<a name=301:8></a> It is a small and very narrow part -- in reasoning, my mind is the measure, and it cannot go beyond itself.<a name=301:9></a> But that does not prove that another cannot produce a

		sensible effect on the soul, and that is a thought -- the two things are quite distinct; the two even run up into one, in what I may call instructive thought.<a name=302:1></a> A holy, living Being produces trust; it is a conclusion, but it is not a calculated reasoning, or it would not <i>de facto</i> take place -- we have often to correct such conclusions in fact, but they are often far truer than calculation.<a name=302:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is false that reasoning is the highest faculty of the soul; conscience and affection in which thoughts are produced, as acted on, are both clearly higher.<a name=302:3></a> Reasoning is the province of a weak nature that does not know intuitively beyond physical science; it is the result of weakness, and ruin in its nature, of imperfect and feeble knowledge -- <i>de facto</i> Science is so too.<a name=302:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eternal power and Godhead may be discovered by reasoning, still more and clearer by impressions; but what He is, reasoning can in no wise tell, feeling and impression can, in a measure.<a name=302:5></a> I feel He must be good and pure -- but that is no reasoning.<a name=302:6></a> But though I admit it is folly to deny a revelation -- folly as to reason -- I do not admit that, as a mere objective thing without, God s character, ways, etc.<a name=302:7></a>, can be made known -- if this implies the fact and not the mere display, the <i>act</i> it may be, but not the <i>how</i> of it.<a name=302:8></a> Hence capacity I admit, powers I deny; and this is the doctrine of Scripture -- adequate evidence, but no perception -- yet on the other hand, rejection and darkness through the will, "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life", "the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not", "they have both seen and hated" is not any true knowledge of God.<a name=302:9></a> Love and Light were displayed, but the light was rejected, and the love never known at all; God's character and ways were not known, they were displayed.<a name=302:10></a> What man could see, he hated, hence sin; what God is to those who knew Him, man did not see -- they say "we see", and their sin remained, yet He does not say "ye see".<a name=302:11></a> He can, to explain this, say "seeing, they see not, nor yet understand"; that would bring conversion and healing, for receiving Him man must be born again, i.<a name=302:12></a>e.<a name=302:13></a>, the quickening word (therefore faith) reaches him by the Holy Ghost, but not by reasoning, but by that in which he is subject, not active.<a name=302:14></a>

		Reasoning is never conscience, though a rational creature may have both, and one may act on the other, or rather be a basis for its acting.<a name=303:3></a> God's reasoning is an appeal to heart and conscience, not to reasoning.<a name=303:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity is a revelation, not merely of what all may learn as Newton's <i>Principia</i>, but which does put them, not as instruments, but in relationship just as near God as Paul himself -- that is what it reveals.<a name=303:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The notion of rare condescension in a revelation is an utterly absurd objection, if the thing revealed be complete truth, because, once revealed, there it is for all times -- it is itself eternal.<a name=303:6></a> There may be, because of man's weakness, a preparation for it, and there was a testing of man which was the true preparation for grace.<a name=303:7></a> This men may object to, though the right-minded will only see the goodness and wisdom of God; in both wisdom will be justified of her children; but to object to revelation (for we must not confound inspiration with it, though this, in a special manner, be needed for revelation), that it is "rare", is unmitigated nonsense -- except through patient mercy, a revelation must be, for what it contains, unique, save as patient mercy towards men may confirm it by renewed testimony, yet these are in fact never identical.<a name=303:8></a> The objection of a yoke upon conscience is simply saying that light is a yoke and burden on the eye in seeing -- either everybody has all the light and knowledge of God, and of right and love, and spiritual purity, that it is possible to have, or a revelation is a blessing.<a name=303:9></a> Besides, divine authority is necessary if God and man are to have to say to each other.<a name=303:10></a> Under the plea of reason, refusal of revelation is merely a claim of absolute independence of God, and thus it betrays itself.<a name=303:11></a>

		I find gods of passions in Heathenism (and, though modified necessarily, in Popery too, i.<a name=303:12></a>e.<a name=303:13></a>, the saints are used to get the desires of men's hearts), and I find conscience in individuals, and amiable qualities; I find the latter in infidels, and men will make much of their natural conscientiousness and amiable qualities, in contrast with others, to exalt self.<a name=303:14></a> But I never find God and conscience connected but in revelation -- even in Judaism, "who shall ascend into thy holy hill, who shall dwell in thy tabernacles; he that hath clean hands, and a pure

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity does more; besides bringing us to God, and without a veil, and because it has, it sends us out in love to others, who have not this, to bring them to it, because we know God who is Love, are partakers of the divine nature, and He dwells in us according to it -- hence there is an activity of love, and that to bring to God.<a name=304:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gods of passions -- man pretending to be much by himself -- that, I find in heathenism; in infidelity, poor wretched man is all.<a name=304:4></a> But in revelation man associated with, brought unto God's presence, and what he is connected with that, first in the claims of His nature, and then in the activities of His grace, but now I insist on the connection of character.<a name=304:5></a> Grace, in every sense, gives a closer connection, making us partakers of His nature, filling us with Him; but I speak now of moral connection -- that is only in revealed truth.<a name=304:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		False religions never take notice of the conduct of their votaries, but of their interests, i.<a name=304:7></a>e.<a name=304:8></a>, their relationship with their God is based on their interests -- the question of conduct is a question of Corban (a gift) only.<a name=304:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case of corrupted truth or true religion, this has been necessarily more difficult, because the judgment of God morally is the basis of it all, see Romans, and it seemed to overturn its base, not to have men immediately responsible to God; but here the human priesthood comes in, and Corban has its place, and the priesthood is charged with the responsibility of the mass, so that their responsibility to God is not destroyed but merged, and, so far as the priesthood do not settle that, it is attached to signs or sacraments with which Corban is associated, and the immediate relationship of the soul with God is merged there.<a name=304:10></a> So far as it is maintained, it is maintained not in the grace which draws near -- the true Corban -- but in the terror of judgment and eternity, which throws their souls, not into the blessings of the divine ways in Christ, the true and only Corban of God, but into the devotions of which we speak, and God's moral being is effectually excluded -- for indeed man cannot approach such a God.<a name=304:11></a>

		What we have to do is not to see this, but to lift up the veil on what God is in holiness -- not in terror, as if He frightened

		away, and others could draw near -- and manifest Him in love; and by the power of the testimony, which brings Him near, connect men with the holiness of God by the grace of Christ, by which, and by which alone, they can be near and know His holiness really, for judgment dreaded, though true, is not holiness known, nor apprehended.<a name=305:1></a>

		LOVE AND HOLINESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The love of God is the source of all our blessings and joys, and God is Love; but in a certain sense His holiness elevates us more.<a name=306:1></a> His love is perfect; we dwell in love, dwell in God, and God in us; it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us -- it is proved by the death of Christ, and so we are to walk in it.<a name=306:2></a> But it cannot be said we are love; God is sovereign in love, "rich in mercy, of his great love wherewith he loved us" -- all this is, objectively blessedness, and in us, and enjoyed by us in communion.<a name=306:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said we are "light in the Lord"; He makes us partakers of His holiness -- partakers morally of the divine nature.<a name=306:4></a> No doubt we love, but we <i>are</i> light.<a name=306:5></a> How blessed this partaking of the divine nature!<a name=306:6></a> And to this we must have respect too in our relationships with God.<a name=306:7></a> We know, thank God, that He is love towards us, and indeed in us; but He is Light, and as this tested man, so, in grace, man is made it, i.<a name=306:8></a>e.<a name=306:9></a>, the new man has this character, "after God, is created in righteousness and true holiness".<a name=306:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I cannot but feel that, in fact, there are souls perfectly sincere, and in Christ agreeable to God, who as to the Word and prayer are in an outside place practically.<a name=306:11></a> The Word is the revelation of God, and, in and by a Man, suited to man, reaching him there where he is; and prayer takes up our wants where we are, and presents them to God -- goes in where He is, according to what He is.<a name=306:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are practically two states -- true states -- as Christians in connection with this; the Word reaches a renewed soul as for man down here, and so it is, but he takes it, and as down here -- it is a light to his feet and a lantern to his path, but he takes it as suited to him down here.<a name=306:13></a> It came he recognises, from God, but it occupies itself with his condition here; it came out from God to him who is outside -- came in grace, and he so received it, and all right.<a name=306:14></a> But, save in owning the grace that gave it, he does not go in where it came from, but is thankful for that which is a light where he is, and so far it is all right, but his spirit remains there, in that which the Word is adapted to; this was properly the character of the law.<a name=306:15></a> In the case I refer to, there is this difference between it and law, that grace is owned in God, and in that given, which is very important; but the man remains outside, and has a

		So in prayers; men are in wants and difficulties down here, and they carry them, as down here, to God, and this is all quite right, and they will be surely heard, and graciously heard.<a name=307:4></a>

		But there are Christians, whom the Word carries in to what it reveals, not what it throws light upon.<a name=307:5></a> Divine wisdom does give here a path, according to divine wisdom, which the vulture's eye has not seen, but it comes from above, takes the heart up to the source from which it comes, and reveals what is there, and causes the soul to live there, and this is another thing.<a name=307:6></a> It does not cease to enlighten the path, and we need it -- God's wisdom in this world, a divine path in it; but Oh!<a name=307:7></a> how much more blessed to have fellowship with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ -- to say "the only-begotten Son who is (<i>ho on</i>) in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him" -- to know where He is gone and the way!<a name=307:8></a>

		Christ is God's way and truth in this world, but He is the way to and revealer of the Father, and the things which God has prepared for them that love Him, the way of knowing the things freely given to us of God; and we may live in them, and understand, for example, the promises to the seven Churches, and a thousand other passages which tell us about what is within.<a name=307:9></a> We have it revealed in John, we are brought into it by Paul, and even by John too.<a name=307:10></a> And so with prayer; I may pray from my wants, and for my wants, and others, too, as we have seen, and it is all right.<a name=307:11></a> But if I am living in the heavenly things, and see the saints in the beauty that belongs to them in Christ, and my prayers for myself and for them are formed in what I am dwelling in, how much higher and more earnest they will be; I am thinking of them, or of myself, with the thoughts of God, and want them to reach them -- my desires are formed by these, and I labour with God in prayer for them.<a name=307:12></a> The Word, through the power of the Spirit, reveals heavenly things -- I see the saints according to God's mind in them, and as with God, and for carrying out His desires, and His thoughts for and in them, I plead with God according to these thoughts.<a name=307:13></a> Oh!<a name=307:14></a> what a different thing it is!<a name=307:15></a> But how near we must be to God so to labour in prayer -- to labour for

		NOTE.<a name=308:2></a> -- It is good sometimes to see the saints, the Church and people of God in their own beauty as viewed of God; it elevates our thoughts, gives God's mind of what is lovely and what we ought to be, but are in God's mind, so that His affections and delight are revealed to us.<a name=308:3></a> Surely it will humble us as to our practical state.<a name=308:4></a> Thus in the parables of the treasure hid in the field, and pearl of great price, we have what they are to Christ -- He sells all He has to have them, gives up His life, everything, to have them, for <i>joy thereof</i> -- what a place to have with Him!<a name=308:5></a> Indeed in a higher scene, when in the form of God, He gave up the outward glory, and made Himself of no reputation, and took on Him the form of a servant -- when He was rich, for our sakes He became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich.<a name=308:6></a> But doubtless the parable specially designates what He possessed as Messiah, but not excluding higher glory.<a name=308:7></a> So He shall see the fruit of the travail of His Soul -- in us -- and be <i>satisfied</i>.<a name=308:8></a> So in the parable of the pearl of great price, He was looking for what was specially lovely and beautiful -- understood it -- was seeking it, according to His estimate of what was beautiful, and that was according to Himself -- His own mind -- and found one specially lovely, and sold all to have it -- the saints in whom He could delight and be satisfied -- so precious to Him, He gives up all for them; how lovely they must be in His mind, for they are indeed according to it -- He loved the Church and gave Himself for it, to sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of water by the Word, to present it to Himself a glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish -- a pearl of great price.<a name=308:9></a> Hence He will be, in the end, glorified in His Church and admired in all them that believe.<a name=308:10></a> How blessed, and what rest it gives the heart!<a name=308:11></a> But even now He says: "And I am glorified in them".<a name=308:12></a>
