		A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		PREFACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The notes, from which this little book is printed, were completed and corrected by him from whose discourses they were taken at Birmingham.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Asked for by several, they are now published, in the consciousness of worthlessness as to all that is merely of man; but in the full assurance, through faith, of the power to bless of Him who has said, "My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness," 2 Corinthians 12: 9.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		GENESIS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this book we have all the great principles of God's relationship with man, without bringing in redemption which makes a people for God and a dwelling-place for God in man.<a name=1:3></a> You never, save in chapter 2: 3, get the word "holiness" in Genesis; and you never have God dwelling with men.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Creation is first treated of; then innocence, lordship, and marriage, the figure of union with Christ.<a name=1:5></a> Next we have the fall, man's sin against God, and then in Cain man's sin against his brother.<a name=1:6></a> There is, at the same time, a witness of certain righteous persons, Abel in sacrifice, Enoch in life, and Noah in testimony of approaching judgment.<a name=1:7></a> You then get the complete corruption of the whole system, and the deluge.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having had in Enoch a figure of the church, we get in Noah deliverance through judgment, and then the new world begins, God entering into covenant with it, and government introduced to prevent violence; but the governor fails, and God's plans as to the races of men are brought out.<a name=1:9></a> We find God making nations, in consequence of man's attempt to remain united so as to be independent.<a name=1:10></a> In the midst of these nations we have, in Nimrod, imperial power, individual and despotic, connected with Babel, the place of man's wickedness.<a name=1:11></a> In point of fact, the division of mankind into nations comes by judgment.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Shem's family having been owned on the earth -- the Lord God of Shem, national existence is recognized as the principle of the constitution of the earth, God's arrangement.<a name=1:13></a> He now begins an entirely new thing.<a name=1:14></a> He calls out from that which He has constituted an individual to be the head of a blest race, whether fleshly or spiritual.<a name=1:15></a> Whatever individual saints there had thus far been, there had been no counterpart of Adam as the head of a race.<a name=1:16></a> This Abraham was.<a name=1:17></a> Election, calling, and promise are connected with this; consequently you have Abraham, a stranger and pilgrim, with nothing but his tent and his altar.<a name=1:18></a> He fails, like everybody, but God judges the world -- Pharaoh's house -- for him.<a name=1:19></a> We then get the distinction between a heavenly-minded and an earthly-minded man; the world having power over the earthly-minded (Lot), and the heavenly one (Abraham) having power over the world.<a name=1:20></a> In connection with this we have in Melchizedek the future priest upon his throne, and that as linked with God's supremacy over heaven and earth.<a name=1:21></a> Abraham's separation from the world having been evinced, Jehovah presents Himself to Abraham as his shield and reward.<a name=1:22></a> We then first get the earthly inheritance and people, that is, in promise.<a name=1:23></a> Abraham looks for the promise in a fleshly way, and that is all rejected.<a name=1:24></a> We have then the promise to Abraham of being the father of many nations, God revealing Himself as God Almighty.<a name=1:25></a> We have also His covenant, as thus revealed, with Abraham, and the principle of separation to God by circumcision.<a name=1:26></a> Chapter 18 gives the promise of the heir, and the judgment of the world (Sodom), and the connection with God, about it, of the heavenly people (Abraham) by intercession; while in chapter 19 we have the connection with the judgment of the earthly people (Lot), saved as by fire through the tribulation.<a name=1:27></a> What follows this, chapter 20, is the absolute appropriation of the wife, whether Jerusalem or the heavenly bride, as the spouse of the Lord.<a name=1:28></a> The old covenant (Hagar) is cast out, and, the heir (Isaac) being come, he takes the land (chapter 21).<a name=1:29></a> Chapter 22 begins another series of things.<a name=1:30></a> The promised heir being offered up, and the promise confirmed to the seed, Sarah dies (chapter 23).<a name=1:31></a> This is the passing away of the old association with God on the earth; and in chapter 24 Eliezer (in figure the Holy Ghost, or His work on earth) is <i>sent</i> to take a wife for Isaac (Christ), who is Heir of all things, and Isaac can in nowise return to Mesopotamia.<a name=1:32></a> Christ, in taking the church, cannot come down to earth; whereas, the moment we get Jacob, we get the head of the twelve tribes, who goes to Mesopotamia for Rachel and Leah, typical of Israel and the Gentiles.<a name=1:33></a> Jacob is the elect, but not the heavenly people; he goes back to Canaan, gets the promises, with all sorts of exercises, as Israel will, but, if he does, he must give up old Israel (Rachel) to get Benjamin, the son of his right hand.<a name=1:34></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the brief notice of Esau's offspring we find the world in vigour and energy before God's people are; and then commences another history, that of Joseph, affording a distinct development of Christ connected with Israel, rejected by Israel, and sold to the Gentiles.<a name=3:1></a> He comes thus to be the head, having the throne, and governing all Egypt.<a name=3:2></a> He has done with Israel, receives a Gentile wife, and calls his children by names typical of Christ's rejection and blessing outside Israel when rejected; but he receives back his brethren in the glory.<a name=3:3></a> This part closes with two distinct testimonies, the will of Joseph about his bones, and Jacob's prophecy that they will all be back in the land and the promises to Israel be fulfilled.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		EXODUS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this book we find God visiting His people; redemption, and the establishment of relationships with His people, whether it be by the testing of law, or the arrangements of grace, by which He could bear with them, with the distinct purpose of dwelling in them, and, moreover, of making them dwell in a place He had prepared for them.<a name=3:5></a> All is connected with four immense principles -- redemption, bringing to God, God's dwelling among them, and consequently holiness.<a name=3:6></a> Priesthood is established to maintain the relationship with God when the people cannot be in immediate relation.<a name=3:7></a> Connected with all this you have, besides the judgment of the world, and the final deliverance of the earthly people.<a name=3:8></a> With Moses, the man of grace, you have Zipporah, who represents the church, but the children are witnesses of Christ's abiding connection with Israel.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the Red Sea to Sinai we find the whole picture of God's dealings in grace in Christ by the Spirit on to the millennium, and the millennium itself.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 19 the people put themselves under law, and get law instead of worship founded on deliverance and grace.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		LEVITICUS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gives us God in the tabernacle, as in the midst of His people, ordering all things that suit their relationship to Him.<a name=3:12></a> The feasts represent Him as in the midst of the people, a circle round Himself.<a name=3:13></a>

	<div class="heading">
		NUMBERS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Treats of the journey through the wilderness, with insight into the inheritance (for us heavenly), and a full prospect of all God's ways in bringing them in, and of Christ Himself as the One who is to reign.<a name=4:1></a> Reference is made in this last remark to Pisgah, and to Balaam's prophecy.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		DEUTERONOMY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A recapitulation of all God's ways and dealings with Israel, as motives to insist on obedience, and to put the people on moral grounds in direct relationship with Himself.<a name=4:3></a> The three great feasts (chapter 16) have this character.<a name=4:4></a> The testing character of the law is stated, and at the same time the purpose of God in blessing, spite of failure under the law, is revealed; closing with the prophetic blessing of Israel, in respect to their then present condition.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		JOSHUA
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The establishment of the people in the land by divine leading and power, according to promise, but through conflict, in which the faithfulness of the people's walk with God is tested.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The career of Joshua begins with crossing the Jordan in the power of resurrection, and has its place of power for conflict in Gilgal -- circumcision - death to the flesh.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They eat of the corn of the land before they have any conflict.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		JUDGES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While Joshua is a book of victorious power, judges is the book of failure in faithfulness, so that power is lost: only that God intervenes in mercy, from time to time, to deliver and revive.<a name=4:9></a> Gilgal is exchanged for Bochim.<a name=4:10></a> Gilgal, the denial of the flesh, though seemingly of little importance, was the place of power; Bochim was the place of tears, but the angel of God was there.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		RUTH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The intervention of the Lord in grace to bring in the promised seed, and the restoration of Israel, but in the way of grace, on a new footing.<a name=4:12></a> On a famine in the land, Naomi, who represents Israel, goes away, and loses everything.<a name=4:13></a> Ruth comes back with her, and Boaz (strength) raises up the inheritance.<a name=4:14></a> It was old Israel, in some sense: the child was born to Naomi, but on the principle of grace, for Ruth had no title to promise.<a name=4:15></a>

		1 SAMUEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The judicial priesthood connection is here broken.<a name=5:1></a> Both judge and priest go in Eli.<a name=5:2></a> The ark is taken -- a total breach.<a name=5:3></a> Power, and the link of connection, are lost.<a name=5:4></a> Then God comes in, in His own sovereign way, by a prophet, as He had before brought them out of Egypt.<a name=5:5></a> (All on the ground of man's responsibility was gone; but sending a prophet was sovereign mercy.<a name=5:6></a>) Before He brings in <i>strength</i> (the king), He brings in <i>prophecy</i> -- a notable thing this.<a name=5:7></a> Before Christ returns in <i>power</i>, it is the testimony of the Spirit and word, by which a connection is maintained between God and His people.<a name=5:8></a> From Eli to David on the throne this is a general principle -- <i>faith</i> and <i>power</i>, not succession.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But flesh required governmental order,<a href="#5:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and gets what it wants; but it breaks down before the power of the enemy.<a name=5:10></a> Then even believers who cling to it fall with it (Jonathan).<a name=5:11></a> If governmental order be established without Christ, they cannot like Christ to come and set it aside.<a name=5:12></a> The one in whom hope is must be content to be as a partridge on the mountains.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saul was raised up to put down the Philistines; Jonathan did subdue them, but never Saul who was destroyed by them.<a name=5:14></a> Jonathan was a believer associated with the outward order.<a name=5:15></a> The place of faith was with David.<a name=5:16></a> It is the place of the power of faith without the king.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		2 SAMUEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saul falls on the mountains of Gilboa.<a name=5:18></a> Then we get the royalty of David, in active power, not in the reign of peace, with the promise of maintaining his house in whatever way they conducted themselves.<a name=5:19></a> God would chasten them if disobedient, but not take His mercy from them.<a name=5:20></a> Then we get David's personal failure when he is king.<a name=5:21></a> There is another element -- the ark and the temple come in question; the relationship with God is re-established first by faith, not according to order, but by spiritual power according to grace, all being -- by that spiritual power according to grace.<a name=5:22></a> The ark was on Mount Zion, and there they were singing, "His mercy endureth for ever": while at Gibeon was the high place, where Solomon went.<a name=5:23></a> There the tabernacle was, but not the ark.<a name=5:24></a> Solomon is not seen at Mount Zion till his return from Gibeon, where God answered him.<a name=5:25></a> Consequent on God's interfering in deliverance and redemption, the place of ordered worship is set up, connected with earth -- the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.<a name=5:26></a> It was after judgment, slaying the people and sacrifice.<a name=5:27></a> God loves Jerusalem, and so stays His hand in judgment, and shews by prophecy the path of reconciliation by sacrifice.<a name=5:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#5:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is quite true that there was a want through the misrule of Samuel's sons. If the spiritual energy failed, there was a want in consequence. The church can only stand in power, so that when it turned to succession all was lost.

		1 AND 2 KINGS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the reign of Solomon, the establishment of Israel in peace, and the building of the temple, the figure of the great Son of David.<a name=6:1></a> This fails, looked at historically, in Rehoboam; and then the book of Kings is the history, not of Judah, but of Israel, with sufficient notices of Judah to carry on the history.<a name=6:2></a> You get the intervention of God by prophets in Elijah and Elisha, in mercy, in the midst of Israel, who had left the temple, one being a testimony to Israel on the ground of their responsibility, the other in resurrection-power.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First and Second Kings continue the history in Judah till the captivity, and then Lo-ammi was written on the nation.<a name=6:4></a> There are, of course, many details -- various characters of faith, etc.<a name=6:5></a>, as Hezekiah of faith, Josiah of obedience, Jehoshaphat of piety, but never, through association with the world, for success.<a name=6:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		JOB
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The possibility of the relationship of a man with God, in the great conflict referring to good and evil between God and the power of darkness; and that connected with the discipline of saints, in contrast with the alleged present righteous government of the world by God; the necessity of a Mediator being intimated, not unfolded; the power of Satan over the world made known, and his character as accuser of the brethren pointed out.<a name=7:9></a> God is seen as the originator of all (not of the accusations themselves, I need hardly say, but of the whole process) for the purpose of blessing His people; the whole being without any dispensational reference, while the conscience is thoroughly searched in those He blesses.<a name=7:10></a> You get in Elihu the wisdom of God in His word (Christ really), and then you have the power of God (also Christ) in God answering out of the whirlwind.<a name=7:11></a> The book <i>may be</i> regarded as typical of Israel, inasmuch as it is in Israel that these ways of God are shewn.<a name=7:12></a>

		The relationship of the affections of the heart of the spouse with Christ.<a name=8:6></a> This, on the ground of the special form of the relationship, is to be realized properly in Israel, though capable of an application, abstractedly, to the church and to the individual.<a name=8:7></a> (What Canticles treats of is not relationship, but desires, faith, getting the joy of the relationship with occasional glimpses, but not established known relationship.<a name=8:8></a> The place of the church, though the marriage is not come, is that of being in the relationship.<a name=8:9></a> Israel will not have this.<a name=8:10></a>)

		THE PROPHETS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these (except Jonah, and, in a certain sense, Daniel) we find the action of the Spirit of God in the midst of His people, to maintain the authority and character of their original calling, testify against their departure from it, and reveal Messiah as establishing them in blessing on a new footing -- sustaining thus the faith of the godly during the departure of the mass, and denouncing judgment on those who persevere in unfaithfulness.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		ISAIAH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here you have the whole framework of God's dealings with Judah, Israel coming in, by the bye, with the judgment of surrounding nations, and especially of Babylon, looking at Israel as the centre, bringing out the Assyrian as the great latter-day enemy, Immanuel as the hope of Israel, and the securer of the land, although rejected when coming as a testimony, being Himself Jehovah -- a sanctuary -- but a stone of stumbling to the disobedient.<a name=9:2></a> We get, in addition, the details of the inroads of the Assyrian, and his judgment in the last days; and, included in the development of all this, we have the blessedness of Israel as re-established.<a name=9:3></a> This is the first part -- chapters 1-35.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the historical chapters (36-39) we get two great principles -- resurrection, and deliverance from the Assyrians.<a name=9:5></a> It is a risen Christ who effects deliverance, which makes it so important.<a name=9:6></a> The captivity in Babylon is here intimated.<a name=9:7></a> This latter lays The ground for what follows.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the last part you have God's controversy with Israel, first on the footing of idolatry, and, secondly, because of the rejection of Christ.<a name=9:9></a> In this Israel is first looked at as a <i>servant</i>; and in chapter 49 the place of <i>servant</i> is transferred to Christ, and, He being rejected, the remnant in the last days take the place of servant.<a name=9:10></a> All through this, though Israel be the object of favour, you get a definite contrast between the wicked and the righteous, and hence the separation of the remnant, and judgment of the wicked -- the declaration that there can be no peace to the wicked, whether Israel or others (end of chapters 48, 57).<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the part that refers specially to the rejection of Christ we get the revelation of the call of the Gentiles, the judgment of the people, the coming of Jehovah, and the full blessing of the remnant of Israel at Jerusalem.<a name=9:12></a>

		JEREMIAH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here the present dealing of God with rebellious Judah, making them Lo-ammi by the captivity in Babylon; next, from chapter 30, the revelation of the infallible love of Jehovah to Israel (Judah and Ephraim), and the certainty of their establishment under David, according to the order of God, in Jerusalem, Jehovah being their righteousness; then, after the history of Zedekiah, and the details of what brought in the captivity, and what passed in Palestine after it, we have the judgment of all the nations and Babylon itself.<a name=10:1></a>

	<div class="heading">
		LAMENTATIONS
	</div>

	<div class="heading">
		EZEKIEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gives the judgment of Jerusalem -- God coming from without, but all Israel looked at, and not specially Judah; the judgment of the nations around, of the ungodly oppressors in and over Israel; the dealing henceforth with individual souls as regards judgment; the setting up of David, and the new birth, as the means of Israel's blessing; the union of Judah and Israel in one stick; and, on their restoration to their land, the destruction of the Assyrian, or Gog, by divine power, in fact, by the presence of Christ; and, in the end, a vision of the restoration of the temple and of the order of the land.<a name=10:3></a>

		DANIEL

		Has two parts -- the history of the Gentile empires, beginning with Nebuchadnezzar, the head of gold; and, secondly, special visions of Daniel (beginning with chapter 7), marking out the condition and circumstances of the saints in connection with the history of these empires more fully revealed, and the coming of judgment to set them all aside in favour of Israel.<a name=10:4></a> But he only comes to the door of the millennium without unfolding it.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		HOSEA
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here the rejection of the house of Israel and the house of Judah distinctively, as Lo-ruhamah and Lo-ammi; the door secretly opened to the Gentiles by it; Israel's long -- enduring deprivation of everything; and then the restoration of the whole under Jehovah and David in the latter days.<a name=10:6></a> Paul quotes chapter 1: 10, and 2: 23; Peter only the latter.<a name=10:7></a> From chapter 4 we get the most earnest dealing with the conscience of Israel, but closing with their return in repentance to the sure blessings of Jehovah.<a name=10:8></a> It is the testimony of the ways of the Lord.<a name=10:9></a>

		LUKE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Luke you get, first of all, a beautiful exhibition of the state of the pious remnant in Israel, at the time of our Lord's first appearing, and the working of the Spirit of God among them, and at the same time the public state of the nation in connection with the Gentiles (chapter 1).<a name=16:8></a> You get the whole political world set in motion to bring a carpenter to Bethlehem (chapter 2).<a name=16:9></a> In connection with this remnant John the Baptist comes, announcing Him who is to baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire (chapter 3).<a name=16:10></a> You now get the genealogy from Adam (having had Israel), and Luke gives us Christ as the Son of man in perfect moral display upon earth, and the grace of God which was displayed in His coming, although still serving in the midst of Israel.<a name=16:11></a> This service is unfolded in the various forms of grace, with particular reference to its moral elements, and shewing its extension to Gentiles, and the breaking up of covenant relations with the Jews, distinguishing not merely the character of the remnant, but the disciples as the remnant, "Blessed are ye poor," etc.<a name=16:12></a> (4-7).<a name=16:13></a> We get (in the demoniac of Gadara) a special picture, consequently, of the healing of the remnant in Israel, of the ruin of the people, and the mission of the delivered remnant, left as a witness instead of going with Him (chapter 8).<a name=16:14></a> In the transfiguration we find special reference to His intercourse with Moses and Elias as to His decease, insistence on the Son of man's being delivered up, and the judgment of self in all its forms, the declaration that the unbelief of the whole generation, including His disciples, will close His whole connection with Israel, and the claim of absolute devotedness to Himself (chapter 9).<a name=16:15></a> Then we see the patient service of Christ to Israel in sending out the seventy, but warning them it was final, and bringing in judgment, and intimating that whatever power He gave them in connection with the kingdom, their delight should be rather that they belonged to heaven.<a name=16:16></a> We then get, further, the principle of grace in dealing <i>as</i> a neighbour, instead of the claim of God <i>towards</i> a neighbour; the word and prayer with the gift of the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him, and the hearing of prayer (this is all transition); the judgment of scribes and Pharisees for the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, by which He had proved that the kingdom of God was come among them, and bound the power of the enemy, so that He could deliver all who were under it; but that now, in the state in which the nation was, He was the test of deliverance and of going right, and they would be left to the power of Satan, of which they spoke.<a name=16:17></a> The hearing of the word was of more consequence than association with Israel according to the flesh -- of more consequence than any fleshly tie.<a name=16:18></a> Thus the men of Nineveh and the queen of Sheba should rise up in judgment against that generation, and the blood of all the prophets should be found in them.<a name=16:19></a> They should be tested by apostles and prophets being sent to them; but these they would slay (chapters 10, 11).<a name=16:20></a>

		He then teaches the disciples to trust in God for everything, and to confess Him, the Lord Jesus, in the presence of all this opposition; and that the Holy Ghost should be given them; so that they who resisted and blasphemed the Holy Ghost in them should be judged as they who did it in Him.<a name=17:1></a> He taught them (the disciples) that all things should be made manifest.<a name=17:2></a> They were to be careful for nothing, but to seek the kingdom which it was the Father's good pleasure to give them.<a name=17:3></a> They were to have their treasure in heaven, and wait for the Lord.<a name=17:4></a> He then gives the character of the faithful and unfaithful servant in His absence -- shews that His testimony will bring in division among men, even into families -- warns the people to take notice of the signs of the times, and that even of themselves they ought to judge what was right; Jehovah being as one going with them to judgment, and they must agree with Him by the way (chapter 12).<a name=17:5></a>

		We have then, in chapters 13 and 14, both in a parabolical way and in direct instructions, the setting aside of Israel, and the letting in of the Gentiles, with a declaration that, in order to follow Him, men must take up their cross, and be the salt of the earth.<a name=18:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapters 15 and 16, the ways of God in grace we have with sinners, still connected with the setting aside of Judaism.<a name=18:2></a> Thus we have, first, grace seeking and receiving sinners; secondly, future hopes substituted for present enjoyments; and, lastly, the veil drawn aside; so that what is heavenly is contrasted with all that had in Judaism been promised to such as were outwardly faithful.<a name=18:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You then get warnings against being an occasion of stumbling to little ones; and, on the other side, if there be an offence, exhortations to forgive it -- the power of faith in the disciples; but that whatever is done, it is no more than duty.<a name=18:4></a> Liberty from Israel is then shewn to be the privilege when the Lord is owned in Christ's person.<a name=18:5></a> The kingdom was among them in His person; but He would come unexpectedly in His glory, and execute judgment, but know how to discern the righteous from the wicked.<a name=18:6></a> In the distress of that day, and at all times, men were to persevere in calling on God, and reckoning on His answer.<a name=18:7></a> Lowliness of mind is urged, both in respect to our faults and in regard to the spirit of meekness.<a name=18:8></a> The danger of riches, as a hindrance to entering the kingdom, is pointed out, and the sure blessing of giving up all for Christ (chapters 17, 18).<a name=18:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He now goes up to Jerusalem by Jericho.<a name=18:10></a> This in all three Gospels is a distinct chronological point when He begins to deal again, and finally, with the Jews.<a name=18:11></a> Even here Luke brings out grace in Zacchaeus; and though a publicans the Lord owns him as a son of Abraham, He is owned as Son of David, yet brings in grace; "for the Son of <i>man</i> is come to seek and save that which was lost.<a name=18:12></a>" Next the parable of the servants to whom money is entrusted differs in Luke, in that the responsibility of man is more brought out.<a name=18:13></a> Each gets the same sum, and a different reward according to what he has gained; whereas in Matthew He gives to each according to his wisdom and the capacity of each; and they all get the same reward.<a name=18:14></a> In His riding into Jerusalem we have to notice the expression, "Peace in heaven," which is peculiar to Luke, and indicates that Christ destroys Satan's power in heaven, and settles peace there, in order to introduce the kingdom.<a name=18:15></a> It is here He weeps over Jerusalem -- the historical place for the incident (chapter 19).<a name=18:16></a>

		In His answer to the Sadducees, when the different classes are arraigned (chapter 20), we have the introduction of the power of the first resurrection, as the proof of being the children of God.<a name=19:1></a> Here, as in Matthew, we get His exaltation to the right hand of God, as that which confounds the Pharisees as to all their expectations of the kingdom.<a name=19:2></a> He judges the scribes, and owns the poor widow who puts in her mite as better than all the rich.<a name=19:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the prophecy (chapter 21) He does take notice, which Matthew does not, of the immediately coming destruction of Jerusalem, and does not speak of the abomination of desolation, but of Jerusalem being compassed with armies; referring, consequently on that first destruction, to the times of the Gentiles being fulfilled.<a name=19:4></a> He enters a great deal more into the spirit in which His disciples are to give their testimony, and meet the difficulties attending it.<a name=19:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find here, at the passover, the extreme evil of man's heart, strife among them which should be the greatest.<a name=19:6></a> There is sifting by Satan, with special reference to Simon, for whom Christ had prayed; with distinct notice of the change of circumstances now from those of the time in which He exercised power, so as to secure them on the earth.<a name=19:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the scene at Gethsemane and on the cross we have the Lord Jesus presented much more fully as man, and His own perfectness, faithfulness, and grace in them.<a name=19:8></a> It is not here Jehovah smiting His fellow, as in Matthew, but we see Him sweating as it were great drops of blood.<a name=19:9></a> It is the man suffering, and the perfection of faith and grace in the man so suffering (chapters 22, 23).<a name=19:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This characterizes Luke all through, You oftener find Him praying, of which I may mention two instances, His baptism and His transfiguration.<a name=19:11></a> Another circumstance may be remarked, as regards Luke's gospel, as characteristic -- the bringing together a quantity of circumstances in a single general expression, and dilating on some particular one which brings out some great moral beauty and truth, such as the journey to Emmaus, and others.<a name=19:12></a> If we have the case of Herod in Luke, and Pilate and Herod becoming friends through their enmity to Christ, we have here also the thief on the cross, His opening paradise to him immediately in contrast with the kingdom, and His intercession for the Jews.<a name=19:13></a> I may add, the uselessness of natural feeling for Christ where He is not followed.<a name=19:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides the detail of the two going to Emmaus, we may remark that He unfolds the scriptures, in chapter 24, to them, and makes Himself known to them in that which was the sign of death.<a name=20:3></a> He presents Himself very fully as the same man, Jesus, and eats in the presence of His disciples.<a name=20:4></a> He again insists on the scriptures as to be fulfilled, and that, as the book which we have in the Old Testament (law, prophets, and psalms) to this day.<a name=20:5></a> He opens their understanding to understand the scriptures, insisting upon this, that thus it is written.<a name=20:6></a> The mission given is that of repentance and remission of sins in His name among all Gentiles, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=20:7></a> They were to be His witnesses, but were to wait for the promise of the Father, the Holy Ghost from heaven; and, in the act of blessing them, He ascends.<a name=20:8></a>

		This epistle unfolds the gospel <i>of God</i> as the testimony of the righteousness of God, and connected with the testimony of His wrath from heaven: but in doing so it begins with the depravity of the Gentiles, the hypocrisy of moralisers, and the guilt of the Jews, concluding thus all under sin, and meeting all this guilt by the blood of Christ through faith; proving at the same time thereby the righteousness of God in bearing with the sins of the saints during the past time, and laying the present foundation of divine righteousness for the time to come.<a name=31:1></a> From chapter 4 the apostle connects faith with the resurrection after Christ's deliverance for our offences.<a name=31:2></a> In chapter 5 he applies this to justification and peace in the assurance of God's love, and traces all up to Adam on one side, and to Christ on the other, as head, the law only coming in by the bye.<a name=31:3></a> In chapter 6 he applies it to a godly life, and in chapter 7 to the law; unfolding in chapter 8 the full liberty the Christian himself obtains by it, connected with the life and presence of the Spirit, God securing all by what He is for us, and how all this is made good to us through Christ, across all possible danger of separation from it.<a name=31:4></a> There are three parts in chapter 8: first, the Spirit as life, going on to the resurrection of the body (verse 1-11); then the Holy Ghost as a separate person, dwelling in us for joy, and sympathy with us in infirmities (verse 12-27); the third part (verse 28 to the end) being God for us -- life, God in us, and God for us.<a name=31:5></a>

		From chapter 9 to 11 inclusive, Paul reconciles special promises to the Jews with the no-difference doctrine of divine righteousness.<a name=32:1></a> In chapter 9, while professing his own love to the Jews, he uses (while recognising all their privileges) the absolute sovereignty of God proved in their own history by the exclusion of Ishmael and Esau though sons of Abraham and Isaac; confirming this by the witness that it was only the sovereign mercy of God which had spared them at Sinai: he uses, I say, this sovereign mercy to prove God's call of Gentiles as well as Jews, confirming this by quotations from Hosea.<a name=32:2></a> He then shews that the rejection of the Jews was foretold by prophets -- that it is founded on a pretension to human righteousness.<a name=32:3></a> He contrasts, in chapter 10, the righteousness of the law with that of faith; shews the title of the Gentiles to the latter -- the call involving preaching to them; and confirms this, as well as the rebellion of the Jews to the call, by their own scriptures.<a name=32:4></a>

		In chapter 11 he raises the question, Is then Israel, finally and definitely, as a people, rejected?<a name=32:5></a> No.<a name=32:6></a> He gives three proofs -- first, in his own person; second, that where there is the declaration that the Gentiles will be called, it is to provoke them (Israel) to jealousy, and therefore not finally to reject them; third, the positive declaration of scripture that the Redeemer would come to Zion, and turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<a name=32:7></a> In connection with this, he puts the Gentiles, introduced on the principle of faith, upon their responsibility; shewing them that if they did not continue in God's goodness, they would be cut off from the tree of promise on the earth, as so many of the Jews then were, and that God could graft the Jews in again; this being the testimony to the wisdom of God, His having concluded all alike in unbelief, that all might be objects of mere mercy.<a name=32:8></a>

		Is the internal ordering of the church by the guidance and power of the Spirit of God in the apostle, putting the assembly on its responsibility, and acting with it, but asserting his authority in case of need.<a name=33:1></a> He begins by owning the power of the Spirit amongst them in gift, and recognising the grace that would keep them to the end; but he presses the power of that Spirit in contrast with the wisdom of the flesh, asserting that we, believers, have the Spirit to search what the eye has not seen nor the ear heard -- that these things are <i>revealed by</i> the Spirit to whomsoever God pleases, <i>communicated</i> by the Spirit, and <i>received</i> through the Spirit.<a name=33:2></a> We have thus revelation, inspired communication, and reception.<a name=33:3></a> (In chapter 2: 13, translate thus, "communicating spiritual things by spiritual words.<a name=33:4></a>") Another important thing is -- we have the mind of Christ (chapters 1, 2).<a name=33:5></a>

		In chapter 3: 20 the point is, that the fulfilment of an absolute promise depends only on the faithfulness of one; but that the law having a mediator, Moses, two parties were implied, but God is only one.<a name=35:3></a> Hence, blessing under the law depends on the faithfulness of another as well as of God, and hence all fails.<a name=35:4></a> The promise was confirmed before God <i>to</i> Christ.<a name=35:5></a> Christ came after the failure, and we rest on the work of the Mediator, and not on the work of the second party.<a name=35:6></a> The law was added to produce transgression, not sin.<a name=35:7></a>

		Is just the way the apostolic spirit of grace enters into details of comeliness of conduct, and does not merely rest on great principles of doctrine.<a name=41:5></a> Leaving the world in all its own recognised authorities where they are, it leads the individual Christian to act as the light of grace in respect of the relationships into which he had been brought by the world.<a name=41:6></a>

		THE HEBREWS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Founding itself on the person of Christ in His divine and human natures, gives to the word the personal authority of divine communication and all human sympathies to the exercise of the priesthood on high, and thus connects the saints walking upon earth with heaven, without constituting them the body of Christ in union with Christ; thus setting aside all ancient Judaism, and giving a present heavenly call, but laying the ground for the after introduction of Israel by the new covenant.<a name=41:7></a> With this view, it puts all in Christianity in contrast, though in comparison and analogy, and a certain connection with what had gone before.<a name=41:8></a> The connection, however, only applies to the first part, the communicated word, because it looks on Christ, as to that, as still on earth.<a name=41:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 we get the groundwork of the authority of the communicated word in the divinity of Christ.<a name=41:10></a> This is continued in chapter 3, adding to it Christ's authority as Son over His own house, in contrast with Moses, down to chapter 4: 13, with the promise of rest to the people of God.<a name=41:11></a> Chapter 2 lays the foundation of future dominion and present priesthood in the human nature of Christ.<a name=41:12></a> This is continued from chapter 4: 14; the glory of it is expounded in chapter 5, as to the person and office of Christ; the impossibility of returning to Jewish elements is thereupon insisted upon, on the ground that if heavenly Christian things were departed from, there was no bringing back by some other power; and that from elements they were to go on to that, God having encouraged them by declaring the immutability of His counsel to the heirs of promise by word and oath, strengthening us thus who look within the veil, where Christ is entered for us as forerunner, a high priest after the order of Melchisedec (chapter 6).<a name=41:13></a>
	</div>

		<a name=42>[Page 42]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This character of Melchisedec involves the necessary setting aside of the whole system of the law, the priesthood itself being changed from dying men to the living Son, the priesthood suiting us, being that of One holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens (chap 7).<a name=42:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 8, having the high priest set on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, offerings are needed: but, before touching on the offerings, the change of covenant is declared on which this ministry is founded, inasmuch as He is the mediator of it.<a name=42:2></a> Now, for the better and heavenly tabernacle, we must have better sacrifices.<a name=42:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the tabernacle itself there was a difference.<a name=42:4></a> The veil was unrent in the Jewish tabernacle, as set up of old; but now the veil is rent, the Holy Ghost thereby signifying, that as long as that first tabernacle had any place, the way into the holiest was not yet opened.<a name=42:5></a> Remark here, that in verses 16 and 17 of chapter 9 alone the Greek word bears the sense of <i>testament</i>; in all the rest of the passage it should be <i>covenant</i>.<a name=42:6></a> The blood of Christ purges the conscience, not merely sins, and cleanses the whole scene of the creature's relationship with God.<a name=42:7></a> The next contrast is, that He had not to offer Himself often to enter into the heavenly tabernacle, for then He must have suffered often; but at the close of all the ways of God to test the world, He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=42:8></a> The apostle then contrasts the lot of man, subject to death and judgment, and Christ, as once offered to bear the sins of many, and coming, without any further question of sin, for salvation to those who look for Him (chapter 9).<a name=42:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then discusses the whole bearing of this sacrifice, alleging that a person once cleansed by it has no more conscience of sins; whereas in the repeated sacrifices, there was a remembrance of sins.<a name=42:10></a> He then unfolds the origin of this sacrifice in the will of God, who prepared a body for Christ, who offers Himself to accomplish it in the same willingness; does accomplish it, and sits down for ever at the right hand of God, instead of standing, like the old high priests, offering often; because by the one offering He has perfected for ever those who are sanctified thereby.<a name=42:11></a> The Holy Ghost bears divine testimony to this, declaring, "their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<a name=42:12></a>" Thus we have the good will of God, the work of Christ, and the testimony of the Holy Ghost, to give us a divine security of unalterable peace.<a name=42:13></a> Thereon he exhorts them to enter into the holiest through the new living way of the rent veil, in full assurance of faith; warning them, that for the same reason, if the one sacrifice be abandoned there remains no other; shewing them that they have need of patience, but that Christ would soon come, and that meanwhile they must live by faith (chapter 10).<a name=42:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To this purpose, he shews that all the saints highly esteemed amongst them obtained their good report by faith.<a name=43:1></a> In this list he first lays down the great principles -- creation, known by faith; sacrifice, offered to obtain righteousness by faith; walking with God by faith in the power of life; and acting on the prophecy of coming events by faith.<a name=43:2></a> We then get two great classes of faith -- trust in God, and patient expectancy of faith, and the active energy of faith.<a name=43:3></a> All the detailed cases are taken when they were not in the land.<a name=43:4></a> He then goes through various sufferings endured of the saints by faith, proving that the world was not worthy of them, and that they died, not having received the effect of the promise, God having reserved some better thing for us, before they could be made perfect (chapter 11).<a name=43:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then introduces Christ as the last great witness, who has overcome, and is set down at the right hand of God, and has there obtained the glory.<a name=43:6></a> He then shews that suffering has the additional character of parental discipline, but that withal they are come to grace, and not law and terror; but, in doing this, he gives the whole millennial result in heaven and earth, as that to which they are come in faith.<a name=43:7></a> He then shews that everything made will be shaken, and insists on their leaving the Jewish camp, that is, the principle of connection between religion and the world; but to go out to Jesus on the ground of His being a sin-offering; because, upon the principle of an effectual sin-offering, they must either be in heaven where the blood is, or outside the camp, or gate, where the sin-offering was burnt.<a name=43:8></a> He closes with a few exhortations (chapters 12, 13).<a name=43:9></a>

		JAMES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In James you get the perfect law of liberty applied to the Christian's path; looking for patience, so that the will should not act, and confidence in God, so that wisdom and strength should be acquired.<a name=44:1></a> If there is evil, it comes from man -- if good, from the unchangeable God, who of His own will begat us by the word of truth (chapter 1).<a name=44:2></a> He then, as he does afterwards, introduces sweeping denunciations against the spirit of the world and of riches.<a name=44:3></a> He speaks of three laws -- the law of God, as to which, if we offend in one point, we are guilty of all; the royal law, "love your neighbour as yourself"; and the law of liberty, by which our conduct is to be judged, and where the will of God and the nature we have got run in one channel together.<a name=44:4></a> Mere faith of the head is treated as worthless, and its producing works is the test <i>for man</i> of its being living faith.<a name=44:5></a> But the works are only viewed as <i>works of faith</i>.<a name=44:6></a> Those he refers to would have been bad works, except upon that principle (chapter 2).<a name=44:7></a>

		1 PETER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistles of Peter, while stating redemption, refer especially to the government of God -- the first to His government in favour of the saints, and the second in judgment of the wicked.<a name=44:13></a> The saints are not seen risen with Christ, but begotten again to a lively hope by His resurrection, and pursuing their pilgrimage, as strangers, towards an incorruptible inheritance, reserved in heaven for them, they being kept by the power of God through faith, but waiting for the appearing of Christ for full deliverances They are spoken of, however, as receiving the end of their faith, the salvation of their souls.<a name=44:14></a> He marks out the progress of the revelation of this: first, the prophets testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories following; then, the same things reported in the gospel preached by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; then, patience till the revelation of Jesus Christ brought these things to them: "Hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=44:15></a>" On this ground they are called on to walk in sobriety, obedience, and holiness, on the double ground, that He who called them is holy, and that they call on the Father, who judges without respect of persons every man's work.<a name=44:16></a> But this is founded on redemption by the blood of Christ, and being born again of the incorruptible seed of the word, while they believe in God through Christ, whom He had raised from the dead, and to whom He had given glory, all flesh being as grass, but the word of the Lord enduring for ever.<a name=44:17></a>

		The persons addressed are the scattered believing remnant of Israel in various countries of Asia Minor.<a name=45:1></a> Hence he distinguishes them as living stones, come to be built on the living Stone, owned of God and of them as precious, but a stone of stumbling and rock of offence to disobedient Israel.<a name=45:2></a> He then applies Exodus 19 and Hosea 2: 23, and hence exhorts them to walk blameless in the midst of the Gentiles who spake against them, which would force them to glorify God in the day of their visitation.<a name=45:3></a> He then exhorts them to suffer patiently, seeing that, like Christ, it was the Christian's place to do good, suffer for it, and take it patiently.<a name=45:4></a> This leads him to refer again to Christ bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, referring to Isaiah 53.<a name=45:5></a><a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, with various exhortations on details of conduct, he refers to the government of God securing us in peacefulness but if they suffered for righteousness' sake they were happy beautifully adding that Christ had suffered once for sins, and that this ought to suffice.<a name=46:1></a> They ought to suffer for righteousness, if they suffered at all.<a name=46:2></a> He then refers to His being put to death in the flesh as the ground of their arming themselves with the same mind, inasmuch as in death there was found the having done with sin.<a name=46:3></a> He then presses the doing everything on the ground of ability from God, and as of God, whether it be spiritual, or in reference to common things.<a name=46:4></a> He then encourages in suffering reproaches for Christ's sake, which is an advance on suffering for righteousness' sake.<a name=46:5></a> (This is the only place where we are called Christians.<a name=46:6></a>) They are to rejoice in it as partakers of Christ's sufferings; but also with the consciousness that the time had come for judgment to begin at the house of God.<a name=46:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We then get exhortations to elders and to the younger, and to humbleness under God's hand, sobriety and diligence, and resistance to Satan, the apostle finally commending them to the God of all grace.<a name=46:8></a>

		2 PETER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this second Epistle, which he writes to the same persons who have received (not the Messiah in glory, but) precious faith as the apostle had through God's righteousness, he shews that in the midst of incoming evil God's divine power had given everything necessary to life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who had called them by glory and virtue.<a name=46:9></a> He then urges them to all diligence in everything that would give them an abundant entrance into the kingdom, and without which they would be purblind as Christians.<a name=46:10></a> He shews them that he must shortly put off this tabernacle; and writes that they might have the testimony after he was gone.<a name=46:11></a> He shews them that the transfiguration had confirmed prophetic testimony of the kingdom they were waiting for, and asserts that all scripture tends to one common purpose, being the fruit of one Spirit, and not of the will of man.<a name=46:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then warns them of false teachers, denying the authority of Christ, whom many would follow, insisting on their wickedness, but shewing that God could deliver the righteous, and reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished.<a name=46:13></a> He gives their character, specially in the working of the will of man in lasciviousness and insubordination; adding to this another characteristic -- their scoffing at the doctrine of the Lord's return.<a name=46:14></a> He thereupon refers to the deluge as a judgment already once executed, and the day of the Lord, in which the judgment by fire would come, and all that nature trusted in disappear, pressing this as a motive of holiness upon the saints.<a name=46:15></a>

		Exhibits to us specially divine life in the person of Christ, but communicated to us, and the traits which serve as a proof that the life is there.<a name=46:16></a> He first speaks of this life as he had known it in Christ on earth; shewing it as the means of communion with the Father and the Son, so that our joy may be full.<a name=46:17></a> But He who was and is this life has given, yea, has been, the absolute revelation of God as light, so that we are placed here to walk in the light as God is in it, the blood of Christ cleansing us that we may do so; and in this we have fellowship together.<a name=46:18></a> But it shews us all sin in ourselves (chapter 1).<a name=46:19></a> Further, the intercession or advocacy of Christ with the Father, founded on His being the righteous one, and the propitiation for our sin, is introduced as the means of restoring us to communion in the light when we have failed in our walk down here through weakness (chapter 2: 1, 2).<a name=46:20></a>

		Obedience to Christ's commandments, or practical righteousness and love to the brethren, are next presented as proofs of the possession of this life.<a name=47:1></a> Before unfolding this, he gives the ground of writing to the saints: that all are forgiven, and that babes in Christ have the Spirit of adoption.<a name=47:2></a> He divides Christians into three classes -- fathers, young men, and babes.<a name=47:3></a> This classification he repeats twice.<a name=47:4></a> The fathers have but one mark; they know Him who is from the beginning.<a name=47:5></a> The young men are strong, are in conflict, have overcome the wicked one, the word of God abiding in them.<a name=47:6></a> They are warned not to love the world.<a name=47:7></a> The little children, while knowing the Father, are the second time carefully warned as to deceivers; but their own competency as having the Holy Ghost, and their responsibility to judge, are pressed upon them (chapter 2).<a name=47:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then shews them, as already sons, that is, as having the same name as Christ, knowing that they will be like Him when He appears, and hence purifying themselves as He is pure.<a name=47:9></a> The contradiction of the new nature to sin is then brought out distinctly, sin being lawlessness (not the transgression of the law).<a name=47:10></a> This new nature is shewn in practical righteousness and love of the brethren.<a name=47:11></a> The obedient person, moreover, dwells in God, and God in him.<a name=47:12></a> The proof of God dwelling in us is, that He has given us the Holy Ghost (chapter 3).<a name=47:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then gives directions to distinguish Him from evil spirits, by referring to owning Christ come in the flesh; but having introduced the Holy Ghost in connection with the new nature, he shews that this new nature is a partaking of the divine nature, which is love; and hence, he that loves is born of God and knows God, for God is love.<a name=47:14></a> This love is displayed in three ways.<a name=47:15></a> First, <i>towards</i> us, by God sending His only-begotten Son, that we might live through Him, and to make propitiation for our sins.<a name=47:16></a> Secondly, as dwelling in love, we dwell in God, and God in us, He having given us of His Spirit, and thus His love is perfected in us.<a name=47:17></a> This is true of every one who really confesses that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=47:18></a> Thirdly, that the love of God is perfected with us, so as to give boldness in the day of judgment; because, Christ being our life, and the Spirit of God dwelling in us, as Christ is so are we in this world.<a name=47:19></a> We love God because He first loved us; and if this be true, we love the brethren as God has commanded us (chapter 4).<a name=47:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then eternal life declared to be given us, and this life to be in the Son, so that he that has the Son has life, and he who has not the Son has not life.<a name=48:3></a> The witnesses for this, that is, that it is in Christ, and not in the first Adam or as his children, are three -- the Spirit, the water, and the blood: the water and the blood coming out of Christ's side in death, and the Holy Ghost given consequent on His ascension.<a name=48:4></a> This gives us confidence for asking everything according to God's will; and so for a brother who has failed, provided it is not a sin to death.<a name=48:5></a> The new nature we have received is incapable of sin; and he who has it keeps himself, and the wicked one touches him not.<a name=48:6></a> Finally, an absolute distinction is made between Christians and the world.<a name=48:7></a> "We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lieth in wickedness.<a name=48:8></a>" Further, we know Him that is true, and we are in Him that is true, that is, in His Son Jesus Christ, who is the true God and eternal life.<a name=48:9></a>

		Next, the earthly agents are seen: the beast, with seven heads and ten horns absorbing the other, receives his power from Satan for 1260 days, blasphemes what is heavenly, and persecutes the saints; a second beast, in the prophetic and royal characters of Messiah, ministers to and exercises his power, and makes the world worship him, doing miracles, giving breath to the image which he has caused to be made to him (chapter 13).<a name=51:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth": this is the opening of the creation.<a name=54:2></a> There is nothing of counsels, but you are before the world, and also get more in the New Testament.<a name=54:3></a> Time begins with the responsible earth, the creation of that in which the first Adam was placed; but there is nothing of the plans of God here.<a name=54:4></a> Promises and ways come afterwards, and the existence of God is assumed very naturally.<a name=54:5></a> His counsels are not brought out.<a name=54:6></a> This is not unimportant to notice: the whole plan of God is not here at all.<a name=54:7></a> There is the sphere first created in which the man was to be put, and the broad fact that God created everything; but even so we do not get everything, for the angels are not here.<a name=54:8></a> Yet we know from Job that, when this took place, "the morning stars sang together, and the sons of God shouted for joy.<a name=54:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject is really the responsible man, though you must have the earth where the man was, and the dust to take and make him out of it.<a name=54:10></a> And when we come to know the truth, this is really important.<a name=54:11></a> The whole of "our glory" belongs to God's counsels.<a name=54:12></a> We had the two things in the cross: Christ made sin for us, which looked back on the responsible or first Adam; and also the foundation for bringing out God's counsels laid in the second Man.<a name=54:13></a> The first part only, as to responsibility, is here, promises come after.<a name=54:14></a> Even of creation it is only in respect of man, and not of angels.<a name=54:15></a> We see how different a sphere grace is from the creation, in that God takes up the first creature of the revelation here, and goes down through his sin below any creature, for it is unto death, and then takes him up far above all creatures in His Son, and so makes a totally new and different thing altogether.<a name=54:16></a>

		The word "created" (verse 1) is right, that is, originally (though used of "great whales," and also said of "man," when it is progressive formation).<a name=55:6></a> But in verse 2 the action is only where the darkness was, on the face of the deep.<a name=55:7></a> The mention of the darkness sweeps away a whole range of geological infidelity, because they say light began here.<a name=55:8></a> But you find ichthyosauri had eyes, and they were created long before.<a name=55:9></a> All that is said is that darkness was upon the face of the deep, and not that there was no light; the contrary rather is implied.<a name=55:10></a> Where the ichthyosauri were, there must be light: and they are found in strata, which, if you take them for anything at all, would shew that thousands of years had passed since they lived.<a name=55:11></a> If you get a thing with eyes, it is fair to suppose that there was light for it.<a name=55:12></a> The deep was chaos, an unformed state of things.<a name=55:13></a> And this was subsequent to a state of light.<a name=55:14></a> I have no difficulty about the light.<a name=55:15></a> As for geology, it is not the object of scripture to teach it.<a name=55:16></a>

		Not a word is heard that beasts were created immortal.<a name=56:5></a> Rather, I suppose, animals were made to be destroyed, because Peter says they were made to be taken and destroyed.<a name=56:6></a> Yet the expression, "beasts that perish," is merely a fact stated; and Peter may possibly only refer to the present state of animals.<a name=56:7></a>

		Here we have a day set apart to God, to which I attach no small importance, and to what the day means also.<a name=59:13></a> In connection with the question, I believe the sabbath-day is an essential part of man's nature and of his rest in God.<a name=59:14></a> I remember saying, outside a town in Germany, when looking at some crows flying, "Well, there is a creature that has nothing to say to God, and to it one day is the same as another.<a name=59:15></a>" But the fact that man has something to say to God proves that he must have a day set apart from the remainder.<a name=59:16></a> It was God's rest here, and man was to have part in it.<a name=59:17></a> According to the commandment, everything men had was to enjoy that day (Genesis 2: 1-3).<a name=59:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man ought to have enjoyed it before Exodus 16, but did not, because the first thing he did was to sin.<a name=59:19></a> The point of this is, that it is the rest of the first creation; and, now that sin has entered in, you cannot have a rest in the first creation.<a name=59:20></a> "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<a name=59:21></a>" How can a holy God have rest in the midst of sin and misery?<a name=59:22></a> What kind of rest can God have here?<a name=59:23></a> That is Christ's answer.<a name=59:24></a> God could have destroyed them as sinners; but if not, He must work.<a name=59:25></a>

		First in creation you have God, Elohim, made this, and that, and the other.<a name=60:16></a> Now we find Him having to say morally to a particular part of His creation; and the moment we come to relative things we get Jehovah, as in chapter 2: 4.<a name=60:17></a> The whole chapter becomes relative now.<a name=60:18></a> Read verses 4-7.<a name=60:19></a> There is the history of the character of man in his great moral elements -- man not made like the beasts of the field, but formed out of the dust of the ground; and when He has done that (and there one sees what death simply is, "dust thou art," and death is going back to it), then I get something that is not dust, something directly from God, and this makes all the difference.<a name=60:20></a>

		The beasts were formed out of the earth, and the man is formed into shape first, and then God says, "I am going to connect this with myself," and breathes into his nostrils the breath of life.<a name=61:1></a> By "connect" I do not mean that the man might not fall away from God in will, for he could; but the breath of life which made him a living soul was directly from God; He was capable of dying, but still he had the breath of life <i>from</i> God immediately, which was a thing distinct from every other animal.<a name=61:2></a>

		"A living soul" means anything that lives by blood and breath.<a name=61:3></a> I say this because it says, "whereinsoever was the breath of life, died"; all animals were living souls.<a name=61:4></a> Man was, and the animal was; but the essential difference was that God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, and <i>so</i> man became a living soul.<a name=61:5></a> This might be separated from his body, and the body return to the dust.<a name=61:6></a> That is what is referred to in "for we also are his offspring.<a name=61:7></a>" As I said to an Annihilationist, Do you mean to call a pig God's offspring?<a name=61:8></a> Neither would Adam have died if he had not eaten of the forbidden fruit.<a name=61:9></a> His body is formed first without life, and the way he gets life is by God's breathing into his nostrils the breath of life; he receives it as a creature, but direct from God.<a name=61:10></a> Adam was not made as other animals were.<a name=61:11></a>

		"This mortal," or "mortal body," leaves the soul by implication immortal.<a name=61:12></a> "Mortal" is always used of the body; and it is clear that death does not touch the soul, for you have the wicked man in hades after death.<a name=61:13></a> I am quite satisfied that it is true to say "immortal soul.<a name=61:14></a>" The opposite thought is founded on the words, "who only hath immortality," spoken of God, of course (that is, who only hath it in Himself); but this does not mean that He cannot communicate it.<a name=61:15></a> So the angels are only immortal by God's making them so, and we the same.<a name=61:16></a> If I were immortal in spite of God, then I might do as I like without fear of death.<a name=61:17></a> In the rich man and Lazarus is a perfectly clear case: the one goes to torment, the other to Abraham's bosom, after death.<a name=61:18></a> But they say "these are only figures.<a name=61:19></a>" "Yes," I reply, "but figures of what?<a name=61:20></a>" I am not going to Abraham's bosom, but I am to Christ.<a name=61:21></a> I asked them this, "Could God give eternal life to a dog?<a name=61:22></a>" Yes.<a name=61:23></a> "But would the dog be answerable for what he had been doing while he was a dog?<a name=61:24></a>" and if he would not be, Christ had not to die for him, and so they destroy atonement.<a name=61:25></a> Put it in another way: if I am a mere brute, only a clever brute, until I get Christ as my life, my responsibility is gone.<a name=61:26></a>

		But there is more than this.<a name=62:14></a> God took the man, and put him in the garden to dress and keep it, gave him one commandment, and then said, "It is not good that the man should be alone.<a name=62:15></a>" So He gives him a wife, and also puts him in the place of authority, which is shewn by bringing everything to Adam to be named.<a name=62:16></a> Giving a name is an act of authority all through scripture.<a name=62:17></a> And Adam says of his wife, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called woman.<a name=62:18></a>" There we get the institution of marriage, but, above all, Christ and the church.<a name=62:19></a> We see dominion which is entirely in Adam, not in the woman.<a name=62:20></a> Dominion belongs to Christ; but, being rejected, and accomplishing redemption, He is exalted on high, and instead of dominion He gets the church, which He associates with Himself now, as well as when He is in the dominion.<a name=62:21></a> This is the place of the church, which is neither the Lord nor the subject creature, but is associated with the Lord over the creation.<a name=62:22></a> God's plans are here in imagery.<a name=62:23></a> Adam was "the figure of him that is to come" (Romans 5: 14) He was head over all things to Eve, who was bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.<a name=62:24></a> We have in this relationship two states, the actual responsibility as created (which Christ was in a certain sense), and then what was historically true, the image of Him that was to come.<a name=62:25></a> Christ gave up everything, leaving father and mother (that is, Israel, if you take it as a figure).<a name=62:26></a> How often we hear it said, that Christ was bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh!<a name=62:27></a> No doubt He did become incarnate; but really it is when He is in glory that we are made bone of His bone, and flesh of His flesh; the other is never said in scripture.<a name=62:28></a>

		Observe, in the account of the fall, that, before a lust comes in, there is another principle shewn, which is, that Adam, like Eve, lost confidence in God.<a name=64:7></a> The devil suggested that God kept something back from her because it would make her like God.<a name=64:8></a> "God doth know" -- this is the reason you "may not eat this" -- you will be as God, "knowing good and evil.<a name=64:9></a>" At this suggestion, that the Lord had kept back the very best thing, Eve lost her confidence.<a name=64:10></a> But mark, when Christ comes into the world, I see Him walking through the world where all the evil is, to shew to man that, no matter how defiled it all is, we can have the fullest confidence in God.<a name=64:11></a> He comes to win back man's heart to God.<a name=64:12></a> There He was reconciling man to God.<a name=64:13></a> Were you, a woman, ever such a sinner, who could not shew your face to a fellow-creature, come to Him, and God will receive you.<a name=64:14></a> But this loss of confidence is just the same in all of us.<a name=64:15></a> If I trusted God to make me happy always, I should always do God's will.<a name=64:16></a> Suppose I do not trust Him to make me happy, then I must turn to myself.<a name=64:17></a> This is just what we see: men do not trust God to make them happy, and so they try to make themselves happy, This is the world.<a name=64:18></a>

		We were speaking of the beautiful character of Christ's coming into the world in humiliation, God coming to win back man's heart to Himself.<a name=64:19></a> This goes beyond the chapter, but it is produced in souls at times before forgiveness is known.<a name=64:20></a> When there is a clear gospel, forgiveness comes out first, but many are like the poor "woman that was a sinner," who had her heart towards God or Christ, though she did not know forgiveness yet.<a name=64:21></a> There was faith in His person.<a name=64:22></a> She was attracted by the grace in Him, and broken down about her sinfulness (Luke 7).<a name=64:23></a> So many a pious soul now does not know forgiveness.<a name=64:24></a>

		The temptation was, "ye shall be as God," not gods, "knowing good and evil.<a name=65:8></a>" Eve takes, eats, and gives to her husband, who eats: thus their eyes were opened.<a name=65:9></a> The counterpart is seen (Philippians 2), and intended as such, in Jesus, "who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; wherefore also God hath highly exalted him.<a name=65:10></a>" That is, Christ in taking the place of the second Adam went exactly opposite to the first one.<a name=65:11></a> Adam was in the form of man, and set up to be as God; Christ is not only a man, but God, and did not set up, like Adam, to take what did not belong to Him, for He was God, but, having laid all aside, He became obedient unto death, the death of the cross.<a name=65:12></a> He goes down all the way, till He comes right down to death, death, yea, death of the cross -- the exact contrast of what Adam did.<a name=65:13></a> You see the progress in Eve, When confidence is lost, the woman saw that the tree was good for food: lust comes in.<a name=65:14></a> It was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise.<a name=65:15></a> Accordingly she eats, and then Adam eats.<a name=65:16></a> He was not deceived; the woman Eve was, and so was in the transgression.<a name=65:17></a>

		As a matter of doctrine, I was led distinctly to notice this in the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=67:24></a> There first it is, "all have sinned"; then, "by one man sin entered.<a name=67:25></a>" Thus it is our condition: what we have done is proof and fruit of it.<a name=67:26></a> Adam cannot be with God at all.<a name=67:27></a> Such is his condition; and then God asks, What have you done?<a name=67:28></a>

		It was God looking for man, perhaps I should hardly say in grace; it was God coming in.<a name=67:29></a> Of course God knew everything; but, speaking as to His manner of dealing, He is expecting Adam to have intercourse with Him.<a name=67:30></a> God could go and walk there, and, according to the principles of His position, expect that Adam would receive Him as his benefactor.<a name=67:31></a> It is, "What has come of you?<a name=67:32></a>" so to speak.<a name=67:33></a> If one expects a person to be there, one says, "Where are you?<a name=67:34></a>" This brings out of Adam what the real state of the case was and when God asks, "How did that come about?<a name=67:35></a>" Adam does a base thing, for he says, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<a name=67:36></a>" It is "whom thou gavest.<a name=67:37></a>" If you had not given me the woman, I should not have done it!<a name=67:38></a> as much as to say, "You may settle with the woman.<a name=67:39></a>" And God says, "Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten": this is what He condemns Adam for.<a name=67:40></a> And whenever we make an excuse, this in fact is what we are condemned for.<a name=67:41></a> Adam listened to the woman instead of to God.<a name=67:42></a> People say, "I was tempted," and this is true; but why did you yield to the temptation?<a name=67:43></a> It was not a lie, in the outward sense of a falsehood; but he had followed the woman instead of God.<a name=67:44></a>

		Now came Cain and Abel (chapter 4).<a name=78:15></a> The question is early raised, whether a man can worship God without Christ.<a name=78:16></a> Cain was a wicked person; but, as appearance went, he was doing what was right in paying what he owed to God.<a name=78:17></a> But really it was bringing the sign of the curse; it was going to God as if nothing had happened; it was the most perfect hardness of heart, because, if I come to God at all, why have I such toil and labour?<a name=78:18></a> why give the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul, except I am away from God, and something as happened?<a name=78:19></a> The whole thing tells its own story.<a name=78:20></a> Man has been driven out, and he cannot come to God on the same footing as if he had not been put away.<a name=78:21></a> When in the garden there was any feeling of God, he goes and hides himself; but now, when outside, he goes hardened to God.<a name=78:22></a> "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.<a name=78:23></a>" But how did he know that this was right?<a name=78:24></a> He knew of these beasts slain for skins, and he may have had more for aught we know.<a name=78:25></a> "By which Abel obtained witness that he was righteous," was by sacrifice as well as by faith.<a name=78:26></a> Both are in the verse, "God testifying of his gifts"; but sacrifice is the least thing referred to.<a name=78:27></a> We see that the man is pronounced righteous.<a name=78:28></a> In Hebrews the point is not God giving a thing to us, but faith carries Christ in hand figuratively, and God says, "you are righteous.<a name=78:29></a>" What is the value and character of my righteousness?<a name=78:30></a> I say, Christ.<a name=78:31></a> Abel is pronounced righteous: but the measure and character of his righteousness is Christ.<a name=78:32></a>

		Besides this and more, another important principle comes out -- the practically self-righteous man rejecting Christ is then turned out; he leaves the presence of the Lord, and dwells in the land of Nod (that is, "vagabond") where his son is called Enoch, and he builds a city, calling it Enoch too, after his son.<a name=80:1></a> Thus he stretches himself in the world, and gives a family name to the town, and the history shews us artisans, and arts, and sciences, all in the train.<a name=80:2></a> He goes out from God, and settles himself in the place of judgment, to do his best with it, in open defiance of God.<a name=80:3></a> God neglects nothing, and Cain cannot get out of the reach of His hand, of course; but in his own will he was entirely outside.<a name=80:4></a> Cain sets to work to make the earth as comfortable as he can without God; Adam did not want all that in paradise.<a name=80:5></a>

		Thus the old world is done with, and certain great principles shewn, and then the new world is set up, being split up into these nations; and with that the beginning of what will be the beast's (that is, in Babel) empire was set up in Nebuchadnezzar, but the germ of it is here.<a name=91:14></a> And we have the sphere in which God's plans and purposes come out.<a name=91:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Where you get "all the families of the earth," it applies to us, although it will be really made good in the millennium in another way.<a name=95:8></a> Galatians 3: 8 says, "The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed: so then they which be of faith are blessed -- with faithful Abraham," and thus we come in.<a name=95:9></a>

		The promise in somewhat different terms is given to Isaac and Jacob; but in Abraham is the root of the olive tree, and therefore all the great general principles are found.<a name=96:1></a> In Isaac the reason is, "Because Abraham obeyed my voice," whilst in Jacob we see God's dealings with Israel, that is, as to mere general principles.<a name=96:2></a> And so about Isaac you have very little given except that he is heir of all his father has, and he is brought up and takes a wife.<a name=96:3></a> In the case of Jacob after Sarah's death, it is an earthly picture; there is no resurrection glory or the like.<a name=96:4></a>

		Now you see Abram had been snared a little in going down into Egypt.<a name=96:5></a> It looks like providence and provision.<a name=96:6></a> But when he gets back, we come to another principle: a person that had been walking with Abram not by his own faith, but by Abram's, is before us, and that kind of thing cannot go on for ever; that is Lot.<a name=96:7></a> And they could not dwell together in the land, so Abram gives up everything.<a name=96:8></a> Lot chooses the world; he is a believer, but he sees "the plain of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto Zoar: then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan.<a name=96:9></a>" There Lot goes and settles and loses everything he has, because he was a believer.<a name=96:10></a> But in Abram's case, the moment Lot has left him, God says to him, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever, and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth," and so on.<a name=96:11></a> It is very striking and definite.<a name=96:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abram did in the famine slip a little into what was not the life of faith, but Lot went quite astray, and he vexed his righteous soul from day to day.<a name=96:13></a> Yet it was no thanks to him that his soul was vexed; if he had not gone there, he would not have been vexed.<a name=96:14></a> And he is no witness either.<a name=96:15></a> They tell him presently, "This fellow came into sojourn, and must needs be a judge.<a name=96:16></a>" He had no business to be a judge in Sodom; and he calls them his brethren.<a name=96:17></a> "I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.<a name=96:18></a>" His whole place was wrong.<a name=96:19></a>

		Then again, "Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.<a name=97:1></a>" There he is living the life of faith, sojourning, and building his altar where he goes.<a name=97:2></a>

		Next, we see in Abram power over the world.<a name=97:3></a> Lot has been taken prisoner.<a name=97:4></a> The four kings beat the five and Lot was carried off.<a name=97:5></a> Abram arms his servants, comes upon the kings, gets the victory and Lot's things back.<a name=97:6></a> But he will not take from a thread to a shoe latchet; he will have nothing to say to it at all.<a name=97:7></a> Here then we get Melchizedek, and a millennial picture.<a name=97:8></a> You have the heir of faith beating his enemies entirely, and then, looking at it as the accomplishment of victory, Melchizedek comes forth to meet him, and says, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be the Most High God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand.<a name=97:9></a>" It is the final triumph in that way, looked at typically, with Christ as Melchizedek coming out to bless upward and bless downward: just what Christ will be in that day.<a name=97:10></a> Thus viewed Abram represents Israel, I have no doubt, in that day; but Christ will come with the armies of heaven.<a name=97:11></a> The history of Lot comes in here by the way, just shewing that the believer, if in the world (or with it rather), has no power against it.<a name=97:12></a>

		Melchizedek's priesthood is special; but we have had an altar before.<a name=97:13></a> There is no establishment of a family priesthood yet.<a name=97:14></a> Abram as the head was the natural person in the family to be priest, and they were all living in families: whoever was head would offer.<a name=97:15></a> Abel was not the head of a family, but he offered as Noah did; and Melchizedek also.<a name=97:16></a>

		In chapter 15 we find Israel.<a name=97:18></a> There is the sacrifice in full first, and then the covenant of Jehovah with Abram, and the communication of special features in Israel's history, the Canaanitish nations to be judged, and limits of the land, besides the prophecy of the deliverance from Egypt.<a name=97:19></a> "Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterwards shall they come out with great substance; and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, thou shalt be buried in a good old age; but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.<a name=97:20></a>"

		We may notice that all that comes out to Abram after Lot is separated is, I will give thee the land, and thy seed shall be innumerable.<a name=98:1></a> Next, in chapter 15, after Lot takes the world, and Abram gives up everything, he then gets the promise a great deal clearer.<a name=98:2></a> Abram, having refused the world, brings in God saying, "I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.<a name=98:3></a>" He had in God the two things he would not take from the world.<a name=98:4></a> "I am thy reward," says God; and then Abram says, "What wilt thou give me?<a name=98:5></a>" Whatever you think of the request, still the Lord allowed and bore with it, answering him most graciously; just as Peter was the occasion for the Lord to bring out blessed revelations, though Peter was not very brilliant in some respects.<a name=98:6></a>

		It will be seen as to faith, if one go through carefully all the uses of the Greek word, that with the dative in the New Testament it is believing in a person, and <i>eis or en</i> gives the ground of confidence.<a name=98:13></a> In the case before us faith is counted to Abram for righteousness; it is the general broad fact that it is imputed or reckoned.<a name=98:14></a>

		But the ministration of imputed righteousness is a monstrous proposition.<a name=98:15></a> If you take it as the value of something imputed, it is the value of faith -- just the way Roman Catholics take it.<a name=98:16></a> If not so, you must take it that God has counted righteousness because of it, which is the principle; but if you try to make it so much made up and imputed, you must make it faith that is imputed.<a name=98:17></a> Abel is counted righteous according to the value of his gift.<a name=98:18></a> Romanists say that faith is counted for righteousness, but charity is greater still -- man's love, not the love of God in Christ.<a name=98:19></a>

		Then in chapter 15 we see righteousness connected with faith for the first time, and also the promise of the seed, a covenant founded on death, with details of the land.<a name=104:10></a> Then in chapter 16 we see a fleshly attempt to have the seed in the flesh.<a name=104:11></a> But in chapter 17 grace acts.<a name=104:12></a> God reveals Himself by His dispensational name to Abram, giving him promise of the seed, and the seal of circumcision on it.<a name=104:13></a> "A father of many nations have I made thee.<a name=104:14></a>" Confirmation is given, followed by Abraham on high in communion with God, and when the world is to be judged, he is a prophet interceding inside with God.<a name=104:15></a> Peter's comment on this is, "the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation.<a name=104:16></a>" This is down below.<a name=104:17></a> So we have Enoch, the heavenly man, and Noah, the earthly remnant; now we have Abraham the heavenly man, and Lot the earthly remnant.<a name=104:18></a> This is a second witness.<a name=104:19></a>

		Now in chapter 20, though I have a little more difficulty in my own mind about it, Abraham is seen failing, in respect of those that were strictly the vessel of promise, to Abimelech who was within the land.<a name=105:1></a> The Philistines have always that character, it would seem, those who were professedly within.<a name=105:2></a> It is failure before those who are outwardly in the place of promise, the denial of the truth of the church of God.<a name=105:3></a> Abraham says, "she is my sister," and not my wife.<a name=105:4></a> It is only in David's time that the Philistines were rightly dealt with and put down ultimately.<a name=105:5></a>

		In the next chapter (21) the son of promise is born, and legalism, or the legal covenant, with the child of flesh is cast out, that is, Hagar and Ishmael; now Abimelech, or the Philistine, who is in the place of promise, the son being born, becomes subservient to Abraham.<a name=105:8></a> The borders of the land are given.<a name=105:9></a> Abraham figuratively takes possession of the land of promise, and worships.<a name=105:10></a> He plants a grove too -- the only time he ever does so.<a name=105:11></a> He was only in a tent before; now he plants a grove, which was Abraham's act, but had specific reference to the seed and taking possession of the land.<a name=105:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac at Mount Moriah begins a new series (chapter 22), which gives us thereon the promise confirmed to the one Seed, not to the numerous seed, but the promise of blessing to all nations (in chapter 12) confirmed to the Seed; and this after death and resurrection, which furnishes a completely new principle.<a name=105:14></a> Abraham has given up the promises according to life here, and taken them in resurrection, "accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead, from whence also he received him in a figure," Hebrews 11.<a name=105:15></a> All was taken up in resurrection, founded upon sacrifice to God.<a name=105:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Isaac being the heir of everything, Abraham sends down what represents the Holy Ghost -- Eliezer -- to get a wife for his risen son.<a name=105:19></a> Isaac is on no account to go back to the old land; he represents the risen Christ.<a name=105:20></a> So Abraham sends down his chief servant to get a wife out of the place of his own family for the heir of promise.<a name=105:21></a> Eliezer confers gifts on her, and brings her out, all things being given to the son and heir.<a name=105:22></a> Abraham sends his other sons away, but Isaac's wife is brought into the place of the vessel of promise, Sarah's tent.<a name=105:23></a> This is all the history of Isaac (chapter 24).<a name=105:24></a>

		Then we get Jacob, who is a poor sample anyhow, but who values the promise, though for the earth, while Esau does not, but forfeits his birthright.<a name=106:6></a> It is by grace Jacob comes in, because he had no title; Esau had title, but in the election of grace the elder was to serve the younger.<a name=106:7></a> In point of fact it comes about by the profanity of Esau, while Jacob does value it, though the means by which he got it were evil.<a name=106:8></a>

		That is a great lesson.<a name=106:9></a> We now have to do with the means.<a name=106:10></a> God secures the result, and all we have to consider is the right means, Isaac could have crossed his hands, or in many a way have acted under God's control, just as Jacob did afterwards with his own grandchildren, without his going and listening to his mother, and deceiving.<a name=106:11></a> Then we have the renewal of the promise to Isaac; at the same time he is forbidden to go down into Egypt.<a name=106:12></a> He has never anything to say to the world in his Isaac character.<a name=106:13></a> He is not to go into it himself, but his wife is to come out of it.<a name=106:14></a> Alas!<a name=106:15></a> he follows his father's example, and denies his wife, not in Egypt, but in the place of the Philistines.<a name=106:16></a> It was his failing in the place of promise.<a name=106:17></a> I think you get Isaac upon lower ground altogether: he digs up again the wells his father first dug, which the Philistines had stopped, and then surrenders them.<a name=106:18></a> You get decay, besides denying his wife; but when he comes into the place which God had given as a limit, to Beersheba -- there they have to own him when he is within his limits.<a name=106:19></a> Before, it was a contention with the spirit of the world where he was, and he has to yield.<a name=106:20></a>

		The great point of the chapter is the call of God, and the principles on which it proceeds.<a name=122:6></a> The <i>calling of God</i> is a cardinal point in His dispensations.<a name=122:7></a> It is identified with grace, and in it there is no repentance; God does not swerve from it.<a name=122:8></a> It expressed His purpose, as it is written, "The gifts and calling of God are unrepented of," Romans 11: 29.<a name=122:9></a> Of this there had been heretofore no mention; individuals may have been called (as assuredly every saint had been from Abel downwards), but until this chapter it does not form the subject of the revelation of God.<a name=122:10></a>

		It is important to consider what subjects the scripture previously presents; they were substantially two -- Adam and Noah; creation, and creation secured by government.<a name=122:11></a> That Adam was placed at the head of natural creation will be called in question by none.<a name=122:12></a> That Noah stood as the representative head of government I learn from the committal of the sword to him, or at least from the revelation of the principle to him, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.<a name=122:13></a>" There might be repentance in these things, though in gift and calling of God there could be none.<a name=122:14></a> He was not declared as the God of Adam, or as the God of Noah; but He was the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; "this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations," Exodus 3: 15.<a name=122:15></a> Creation, in point of fact (as to its existing estate), was repented of -- "God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually; and it repented the Lord that he had made man upon the earth, and it grieved him at his heart; and the Lord said, <i>I will destroy</i>"; and He did destroy, sparing favoured Noah; as it is written, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them," Genesis 6: 5-7.<a name=122:16></a> But God's calling is His purpose, and He hath sworn in His holiness, and He will not repent.<a name=122:17></a>

		The natural good of creation in the hands of the first man had not only proved fallible and corruptible, but it had failed, and become corrupted; and destructive judgment had been executed upon it by the hand of God, few, that is eight souls, being spared, together with what was with them in the ark, out of all in whose nostrils was the breath of life.<a name=123:1></a> To Noah (as I have before said) the principle of government was communicated, in order to restrain evil in its effects; that violence might no more cover the earth, but that in detailed instances the wrath of God might be vindicated against it -- life belonging unto Him.<a name=123:2></a> Sin, however, in its principle, still remains at work, exhibiting itself in the failing of Noah the saint, and in the recklessness of the disrespectful father of Canaan.<a name=123:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards this part of the history previous to Abram (that is, the earth under government), we have the fact recorded of the division of the earth amongst its various nations and families; this we find in Genesis 10, where the fact is stated, the origin of which we find explained only in chapter 11.<a name=123:4></a> But first let us consider the fact -- the earth was divided (a new and not a necessary circumstance for it as placed under government) into distinct nations, separated by place, language, and (as to the various lower branches), we may add, more immediate origin.<a name=123:5></a> Thus, whatever may have been the particular changes since, the earth under government assumed the form which it now bears.<a name=123:6></a> Various indeed, in particular parts, might be the interchange, division, or growth of power; but the characteristic state of things continued to be the same, and in fact its great features were indelibly impressed.<a name=123:7></a> Indeed not only is this the case, but it is interesting to observe, that if we take the list of nations spoken of as gathered together under the wilful king in the latter day, and under Gog in Ezekiel, we shall find ourselves brought back to the same nations, and tongues, and families, which are presented to our view at the outset, as the immediate consequence of the establishment of this principle of government in the hands of Noah, and as formed into actual condition by the sin of Babel.<a name=123:8></a> The rest of the intermediate scripture is the history of calling and grace.<a name=123:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To the sin of Babel I would now turn.<a name=124:1></a> In the history of Babel we have shewn the sin of man, under the circumstances in which the one family of man was then placed; even in assuming the earth to themselves; in seeking to make a name, lest they should be scattered; a city, which they purposed should be an abiding monument and centre of power, but on which God writes <i>Babel</i>.<a name=124:2></a> Until they were scattered abroad, they had one speech, and one tongue, and thus they were practically one family, having a common bond of association.<a name=124:3></a> But the lust of ambitious selfishness was at work, and this union was broken to pieces.<a name=124:4></a> Hence they were separated and (the earth subsequently being formally divided among them, Genesis 10: 25; 11: 18), they became, to every intent and purpose, distinct nations.<a name=124:5></a> Although its origin was sin, and its character confusion, the reaching out of grace was shewn in the testimony of the day of Pentecost, as extended toward the world, and as contrasted with anything towards the Jews merely; this I remark in passing, but it is not on this that I would now dwell.<a name=124:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But although circumstances were thus altered, the principle of government remained untouched; however it might be exercised, righteously or unrighteously, it was placed in the hand of man "not bearing the sword in vain," "the minister of God <i>to execute wrath</i>.<a name=124:7></a>" It might be exercised according to its institution, in repressing evil, although merely by power; but even this in the sin of man was not the case; the result is described in Psalm 82.<a name=124:8></a>

		The judges of the earth had all gone <i>incorrigibly wrong</i> -- they neither heard, nor yet understood.<a name=125:9></a> God was obliged, therefore, to take the matter into His own hands; He was obliged to arise and to judge the earth.<a name=125:10></a> Thus is shewn the failure of power in the hands of man from another part of scripture, as is also shewn in Daniel 7, etc.<a name=125:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus brought before us in Genesis, up to chapter 12, creation, and then its failure and its judgment; next we have government of the renewed earth introduced for its peace, in consequence of evil having been proved in man.<a name=125:12></a> Man's pride, rebellion, and self-sufficiency, are shewn: together with a judgment, which did not alter the principle of the dispensation (for had it been otherwise, evil would have been without check), which was to continue until God should take it into His own hands, but which exhibited how man failed under it, in its common form; how under the consequent judgment it assumed the form of distinct nationality; and how the lust of personal ambition and power, or of obtaining a great name, was associated with the divinely sanctioned principle of government, and thus came into existence the beginning of kingdoms; however unrighteously this principle was exercised, it still continued to be unalterably recognized of God.<a name=125:13></a> Here were all the principles drawn out, and the scene was closed.<a name=125:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The circumstances might vary, but there was no change in the principle till God takes the matter into His own hands.<a name=125:15></a> Countries and kindreds were now formed; and inasmuch as they were separated one from another by the spirit of intelligible association, so much the more were they united in stronger personal and local interests; selfishness became national, and adverse interests became (not simply personal) but those of countries, and peoples, and tongues.<a name=125:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But into the midst of all this there was a new principle introduced.<a name=126:1></a> The calling of God -- a principle and a power which, while leaving these untouched, acted paramount to them all -- to natural relationship, and to formed associations.<a name=126:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee.<a name=126:3></a>" Here is distinctly shewn the calling of the "father of the faithful.<a name=126:4></a>" Country and kindred were recognized as existing; how they were formed in creation, and under government (as established in Noah), and the subsequent circumstances, we have already seen.<a name=126:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were now left just as they were.<a name=126:6></a> They were not meddled with.<a name=126:7></a> In fact, in their own place (though corrupted), and as having instamped upon them that they had been God's ordinances, they were both distinctly maintained.<a name=126:8></a> There is not to this day any abrogation of them, nor indeed ever will be in principle, though they will be transferred to Christ, and under Christ they will be unto righteousness and blessing.<a name=126:9></a> "A king shall reign in righteousness," and although the queen and Jewish partner of His glory shall be taught to forget her father's house (being called through grace, not descent), yet the offspring of the remnant shall be blessed with them; instead of the fathers shall be the children.<a name=126:10></a> However, therefore, evil may have overrun them, both government and relationship, home, etc.<a name=126:11></a>, are principles in no way rejected, nor could they be abstractedly.<a name=126:12></a> But the calling of God acts paramountly to them, or else there could be no other principle, and the prevailing of man's evil in them would be left unremedied.<a name=126:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the wisdom of God, the corrupted state of things was no longer judged or acted upon, but the witness of better things was introduced; had they been judged, then must have been the end in utter destruction, or the premature assumption of all into the hands of Supreme power.<a name=126:14></a> Yet even that by which evil was to be suppressed, that is, government, being corrupted, was now become the instrument of evil.<a name=126:15></a> Hence entirely new hopes could alone be introduced, and not merely a present amendment, for that must have come to the same end; but new principles, not destroying the sanctioned and appointed instruments of God, for such destruction would have proved, not so much the evil of man, the creature, but the evil and foolishness of the Creator's appointment.<a name=126:16></a> This appointment was left just where it was, to be judged in due time upon the maintainers of it.<a name=126:17></a> But in grace another principle was introduced -- the leaving in self-sacrifice all these things for better hopes.<a name=126:18></a> The existing ties of country and kindred are recognized, but in THE CALL OF GOD there is set up a paramount claim: -- "The Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house.<a name=126:19></a>"

		<a name=127>[Page 127]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then, in the calling of God, the assertion of a paramount claim on God's part upon an individual in grace, <i>leaving</i> everything out of which he was called without further change; only calling him out of it.<a name=127:1></a> This is one very strong, distinct, and new principle, not previously revealed, consequent upon, and acting in, an especial and paramount way, in reference to the existing relationships, which had arisen out of what was previously ordered and appointed.<a name=127:2></a> No declaration of blessings or principles to men where they were, but the calling of them out thence, and thus a personal calling is what we find.<a name=127:3></a> The principle further established in it mere personal obedience, upon the ground of this call, to individual responsible action.<a name=127:4></a> "God had said to Abraham, Get thee out.<a name=127:5></a>" Here on the word of God the individual responsibility of obedience attached.<a name=127:6></a> It necessarily and avowedly involved the breaking of subsisting relationships in person, <i>as to his own interest in them</i>, but without affecting them, as they stood in themselves, in the least.<a name=127:7></a> He was to leave his country, and his kindred, and his father's house.<a name=127:8></a> They might still continue just what they were before (they might, or they might not): this was a question of Providence; obedience to the words and calling of God was the only point in grace to Abram, the only point to be considered by him.<a name=127:9></a> The word of God led the way in the direction which was given, and gave the promise to him as that which should encourage him in acting.<a name=127:10></a> "Into a land that I will shew thee"; this was the certain hope of certain faith, by which a man is made entirely a stranger where he was before at home.<a name=127:11></a> It was indeed merely a promise, but it was a promise which involved not only the certainty of God, but also the guidance of God unto the thing promised -- "to a land that I will shew thee.<a name=127:12></a>"

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=128>[Page 128]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us turn more to the detail of this calling of God; we have seen already that its grand distinguishing feature was <i>separation from the world</i>.<a name=128:1></a> "The Lord had said to Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house.<a name=128:2></a>" This was the substance of the present character of the calling, as acting upon a nationalized world; and thus was brought forward the specific character of the church.<a name=128:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was involved then in it the immediate favour of God, not in present comfort, but in personal calling.<a name=128:4></a> The personal revelation of Himself to Abram, as it were, identified him with Himself and with His purpose, and with the blessing of an appointed inheritance.<a name=128:5></a> This calling, however special and personal, however distinguishing in favour, necessarily involved obedience.<a name=128:6></a> The call of blessing to Abraham was a call to get out of <i>his</i> country unto a land which God would shew to him, and thus it necessarily involved obedience.<a name=128:7></a> Whatever the power which acted on his mind might be, obedience was the result; for in the very terms of the call it was manifest -- no obedience, no blessing.<a name=128:8></a> He was (to use the words of scripture) "sanctified unto obedience," for there was nothing else now given but the command, "Go out" -- "the Lord had said.<a name=128:9></a>" It was not to gratify the present selfishness of Abram's nature, saying, "this is thy country," but it was "Get thee out of thy country" -- to go where?<a name=128:10></a> "to a land that I will shew thee.<a name=128:11></a>" It implied, therefore, implicit confidence in God for faithfulness, power, and love.<a name=128:12></a> Taking Him for the security and the portion (as the scriptures reveal it), he went out, not knowing whither he went.<a name=128:13></a> It is on this that the Spirit of God so specially tests as characteristic of his approved faith.<a name=128:14></a> By separation from the world, on the ground of implicit confidence in God, he lost everything, and got nothing but the word of God, scaled of course to his soul (for his faith rested in it) by the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=128:15></a> The God of glory had appeared to him in the matter, and God would shew to him the land.<a name=128:16></a> So Abram departed.<a name=128:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then is the pattern and character of the church, and also of the individual believer; they are called of God in faith out of all that into which the world and nature have been formed (and while not meddling with these things, or disowning them in their place, but recognizing in them God's ordering hand, and moreover the sin of man): trusting in a promise not at once fulfilled, but taking God, and God alone, as the security, the warrant, and the guide; it is faithfulness, as being assured of the present loss of all things, and the present gain of nothing; it is a walking by faith, and not by sight, not only as regards present things relinquished, but also as to things hoped for -- things to come -- "for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?<a name=128:18></a>" But they are sufficiently assured of God; and in Him, and knowing Him, or rather being known of Him, they are ready to give up all for His word.<a name=128:19></a> Thus it was not the reward that was taken as the portion, but God, the promiser of the reward, and therefore it was <i>faith</i>.<a name=128:20></a> The object was as simple as the security.<a name=128:21></a> "They went forth to go to the land of Canaan"; the result was as certain as He who called was sure; "they <i>went forth</i> to go into the land of Canaan, <i>and into the land of Canaan they came</i>.<a name=128:22></a>" Such is the history and the character of the church of God in its calling.<a name=128:23></a> Called out by God into separation from the world, which it leaves just where it was to go into a land of promise -- a land which God will shew it -- it walks by faith, and not by sight, going forth to go thither, and thither surely coming, according to the calling and power of God.<a name=128:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A darker picture now remains -- the actual practical conduct and condition.<a name=129:1></a> There was a famine in the land, and Abram went down into Egypt.<a name=129:2></a> This was not confidence in God, who had brought him thither, nor was the land of Egypt the land of Canaan, as was afterwards well proved.<a name=129:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I would remark, what will, I believe, simplify the use of many types, and be found (at least I have so found it) that <i>men</i> who are types represent the energy of faith, the spiritual energy of the church, under the circumstances in which the type represents it, or perhaps its failure therein; and that <i>females</i> who are presented to us as types represent the state and condition of the church.<a name=129:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abram may act in faith in going out, and he may act in want of faith in denying his wife; Sarah is the New Covenant, Hagar the Old, a free-woman and a bondwoman: one, more or less,, presenting the acting of the Spirit of Christ, the <i>Gibbor</i>, the bridegroom; the other, the estate or condition in the dispensation, whether clothed with the sun or in the wilderness, in bondage or in freedom.<a name=129:5></a> And thus it is that they may vary; thus David, or Ahaz, or Manasseh, would be very differently presented as a type of any individual: but respecting the church or Jewish economy typified by a woman, it was all one (as being the possessor of the throne of David), because the economy, or condition of the church in which they so acted, was all one.<a name=129:6></a> I state this merely to illustrate what I mean; the <i>woman</i> is the state in which the dispensation is; the <i>man</i> is the conduct of faith in it.<a name=129:7></a>

		If Satan gets the church, in its state and condition, into his own house (however mercifully God may preserve it), he will bless the faithless instruments of the betrayal with the things of the world.<a name=132:1></a> Such, then, is the history (not of the calling, but) of the practical conduct of the church: not of the calling of God, which we saw in its sure infallibility before, together with Sarai and all he had, but of the acting of men in the place to which they are called -- in their departure from it, not acting in faith; and such are the results.<a name=132:2></a> The end is not that Abram is honoured, but that the Lord vindicates Himself in plaguing Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai Abram's wife.<a name=132:3></a> He asserts and maintains the title, and Judges and will judge the world for thus taking another man's wife.<a name=132:4></a> The church is the King's daughter, and is taken in the lust of its own dominion by the world.<a name=132:5></a> And this the Lord would, and was entitled to, visit.<a name=132:6></a> But still the sin was Abram's, his blessings all this while were curses.<a name=132:7></a> And it is worthy of remark, that it was an Egyptian handmaid that typified the fleshly covenant of bondage: the world always genders unto bondage, for it is ever opposed to the Spirit of God; and whenever, therefore, the world comes in, it merely produces, and in result is identified with, bondage (where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty).<a name=132:8></a> For the world in its results is developed by bringing an expectation and an endeavour to procure the inheritance by a covenant of works.<a name=132:9></a> Such has been the actual fact in the church, and will be, because the Spirit is opposed to the world; and, that being grieved and absent, the other takes its place, with the indulgence of lusts, resting on works, and union with the world.<a name=132:10></a> But while this was an ultimate result, I would now rest merely upon the picture which is actually presented to us in this chapter, of the cause, character, and consequence of the working of the spirit of unbelief in the church, called out indeed, but looked at as in the hands of man.<a name=132:11></a> In the early part of the chapter we have its calling of God, and its results as well as character.<a name=132:12></a> The latter part shews its conduct in man, the shame, worldly comfort, unbelief, and sorrow; but also the merciful interposition of that God, who, when we have wearied Him with our sins, acts and delivers for His own name's sake, and vindicates.<a name=132:13></a>, in righteous dealing toward the world, what the unrighteousness of man had plunged unfaithfully into its power.<a name=132:14></a>

		HISTORY OF ABRAM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been particularly interested latterly in the history of Abram; and I send you a brief outline of what has struck me in this history as a picture of many interesting elements of the life of faith.<a name=134:1></a> There is a difference between public worship and personal communion brought out in this history, and the intimacy of the latter, and the ground on which it is built, which have especially occupied me.<a name=134:2></a> But I can, on account of other occupations, only give the outline.<a name=134:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His life, in as far as it is presented to us as a life of faith, begins by his calling, when in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charan.<a name=134:4></a> The God of glory appeared to him, says Stephen.<a name=134:5></a> In a word, it was God's revelation of Himself to him, by which he was called into the path of life.<a name=134:6></a> Object of divine election, Jehovah's revelation of Himself to him calls him out of darkness and subjection to the power of Satan (for his family worshipped other gods beyond the flood out of the land of promise), and gives to him the promises, in connection with a faith which set out, on the simple word of God, to be led where God Himself should shew him his country and his home.<a name=134:7></a> He was to quit all for the word and promise of God.<a name=134:8></a> This is the first element and character of the life of faith.<a name=134:9></a> The Lord gives sufficient of the details of this history to shew that, till Abram had fully broken with all God called upon him to leave, he could not, though he had left much, and might plead the best claims of nature for the rest, attain the end for which he had left all the rest.<a name=134:10></a> He had left Ur, come to Charan, and dwelt there.<a name=134:11></a> However, after Terah's death, he left Charan, as the Lord had said to him, and now comes to Canaan.<a name=134:12></a> This begins the second part of the life of faith: that which passes in the place of promise.<a name=134:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In that life we are called on to set out, trusting God towards the place of promise and hope, called by the blessed revelation of God to our souls.<a name=134:14></a> And we are called to walk with God in this place of blessing and communion into which we are entered in spirit.<a name=134:15></a> This is the second part of our Christian life.<a name=134:16></a> It is found here (chapter 12: 6-8).<a name=134:17></a> Abram walks up and down in the place of promise -- to us heavenly places.<a name=134:18></a> The Canaanite, the hostile power of evil, is still in the land.<a name=134:19></a> Joshua will, in time, root them out; but for Abram's walk of faith, they are still in the land, while he walks there in hope.<a name=134:20></a> How true it is, and how far we are from always sufficiently bearing it in mind.<a name=134:21></a>

		The Lord appears to Abram; this is the ground of worship, as well as of walk.<a name=135:1></a> He does not evidently appear to him to cause him to set out, leaving all; for He appears to him when he is, though a stranger there, in the land to which God has brought him.<a name=135:2></a> But He appears to draw out to Himself the affections of him whom He has brought there.<a name=135:3></a> But it is not in that condition Abram is to possess or inherit it.<a name=135:4></a> He would have lost much by such a possession, his being a stranger there led his heart and hope, through grace, to a city which had foundations -- a better country, that is, a heavenly.<a name=135:5></a> We can surely say, it was expedient for us that Christ went away.<a name=135:6></a> Oh, how sweet the heavenly associations and hopes to which He has drawn us, and into which He has introduced us by the Spirit He has sent down on His going up on high.<a name=135:7></a> How truly He has set man in heavenly places with God.<a name=135:8></a> How far better than the establishment of an earthly kingdom, however glorious it may be.<a name=135:9></a> There is something peculiarly excellent and blessed in a life of faith, dependent on God for enjoyment in what is not seen.<a name=135:10></a> A man of the world, one, at least, whose life was passed as such, a sage of their own, has said, "Whatever makes the past, the distant, or the future, predominate over the present, exalts man in the scale of intellectual being.<a name=135:11></a>" How much more so when it is God who fills it all up, and that in the creating and unfolding of affections, which are awakened and formed by Christ and have Him, and the divine perfectness which is in Him, for their object and their source.<a name=135:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to return to the history we are studying.<a name=135:13></a> The Lord appeared -- made Abram feel practically that he was not to have the land -- God, and confidence in Him was his portion -- he was a stranger there; promise as to this, was his proper portion, but in his seed he should inherit it.<a name=135:14></a> There was a settled purpose of God, and this purpose he was thus to know.<a name=135:15></a> How blessed, thus, to rest in God, our heart founded on communications from Himself, and that He can bless us in teaching us to trust Him enough to live the life of faith, to be content with Him.<a name=135:16></a> The heart of a stranger, who has God with him, is, of all, the best in this world; it was, in the perfectest way and degree, Christ's.<a name=135:17></a> judgment God will execute to introduce others into actual blessing; we have all with Him, and now, and indeed for ever, in Himself.<a name=135:18></a> We have no need of judgment to enjoy our portion, though we know judgment will issue and work deliverance for all else.<a name=135:19></a><a href="#135:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This is the church's place, and it is a very blessed one -- she suffers with Christ.<a name=135:20></a> This position in Abram's case drew out worship.<a name=135:21></a> It is its true and real power for us.<a name=135:22></a> It was to the God who appeared to him that he raised his altar: the revelation of Himself by God in the place of promise, draws out worship; as the revelation of Himself, when we are far from it, sets us in the way to the place of rest that God is to shew us.<a name=135:23></a> It is this blessed revelation of Himself by God putting us into conscious relationship with Himself, flowing from what is known to faith only, which forms the ground of worship.<a name=135:24></a> It is His favour, direct interest in us, His having brought us by His revelation into connection with Himself, which in and by this confidence creates worship.<a name=135:25></a> Our worship answers to the revelation we thus have, while it is founded on the grace of it.<a name=135:26></a> The revelation of His purpose, and of the way of the accomplishment of His promise, accompanies and makes part of the revelation on which it is founded.<a name=135:27></a> But this puts the soul into permanent intercourse with God of this kind.<a name=135:28></a> The worship, to Abram, realizes the various parts of the home promised to faith, to be possessed when pilgrimage is over; and when he realizes the enjoyment of it, his pilgrimage, his altar, is renewed.<a name=135:29></a> He goes around the place of promise and hope, where he is yet a stranger; but when he pitches his tent in the enjoyment of it, then he raises his altar too.<a name=135:30></a> This is a sweet and happy picture of the life and occupation of faith.<a name=135:31></a> These two elements -- the setting out on the journey towards the place of promise, and the happy acknowledgement of God in it, form the two parts of the life of faith.<a name=135:32></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#135:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Note how this brings out in its true character the rapture of the church. If my portion is in anyway in this world, evil must be removed by judgment in order to enjoy it. But if I am entirely a stranger and a pilgrim' having no portion here, evidently there is no need of such judgment for my enjoyment of my portion. God Himself is this portion, for I have renounced all here. He has only to take me up to enjoy when the time is come in His counsels to do so.

		The rest of this chapter, on which I do not enlarge, shews the failure of the believer, who is apt, if the place of promise does not afford him all for present need which he wants, instead of consulting God, to go down to the world for help.<a name=136:1></a> This, though accompanied by outward prosperity -- as it has been with the church -- leads to further unfaithfulness.<a name=136:2></a> Abram has no altar here, nor till he returns to the altar he made at the beginning, where he had last had one -- no new communion -- no further acquaintance with the place of promise.<a name=136:3></a> All he can do is through grace to get back to the place he has left.<a name=136:4></a>

		When Abram had returned to the altar he had left to go southward, he again gets into worship.<a name=137:1></a> Here, though perhaps the prosperity of Egypt had given occasion to the strife and sorrow, the conduct of Abram is beautiful and characteristic of one having the heavenly portion.<a name=137:2></a> If Egypt had betrayed him, it had at least taught him a lesson.<a name=137:3></a> Returned with this experience into communion with God, he has enough in this to give up all the rest in grace.<a name=137:4></a> There is a moment when our own faith is put to the test: often we walk by that of others; but our own state must be tried.<a name=137:5></a> Lot, a believer, chooses the world (and contrary to every right feeling), and vexes his righteous soul in the midst of what was the very object of coming judgment.<a name=137:6></a> As soon as the worldly-minded believer and his portion are together, the distinction, made by faith and faithfulness in the disinterestedness of heavenly happiness and grace, where God was a sufficient portion, was given effect to by the worldly wish of Lot.<a name=137:7></a> Abram is told to go over the whole place of promise, and know its length and breadth; northward, southward, eastward, and westward, all its extent -- it all was his.<a name=137:8></a> That is, when once the heart has left all that selfishness would have of what might seem within the limits of the land, but was taken by the carnal heart to please itself, the full extent and blessed details of what we are to enjoy with God is made known to us -- and experimentally.<a name=137:9></a> We have here, then, after the general character of the life of faith, and failure in it, an important experimental element of it: after failure and restoration to communion by grace, and complete victory over, and renunciation of the world, such a sense of the value of the heavenly and unseen things, as frees from the influence of the world.<a name=137:10></a> The consequence is, an escape from being entangled in what is the scene and object of judgment, and a full experimental knowledge of the inheritance of faith.<a name=137:11></a> Note, Abram escapes, and gets the increased privilege by walking in the path of faith, where there is no perception of the consequences.<a name=137:12></a> Abram had yielded through weakness and want of faith in trial; but his heart was right, and after the trouble his fault had occasioned, and his restoration, the very effect of this humbling experience is to give the superiority to all worldly influence which saves him entirely from the fatal mistake of Lot.<a name=137:13></a><a href="#137:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Here the Lord, though He does not appear as when He called, or revealed Himself in the land of promise, speaks to Abram.<a name=137:14></a> And Abram, after removing his tent, builds an altar where he comes to sojourn.<a name=137:15></a> For our worship is in the measure in which we enter into the details of our portion from God.<a name=137:16></a>

		We have here three, in a certain sense four, of these altars, in what we have hitherto read.<a name=138:1></a> Firstly, the one built on the Lord's revelation of Himself in the land, which gives the general character of the worship of faith.<a name=138:2></a> Secondly, one shewing the permanent abiding character of worship in his strangership.<a name=138:3></a> In Egypt, out of the place of promise and faith, none; then (what made me say, in a certain sense a fourth), the return to the place of strangership and worship in the place of promise; and, lastly, when his exercised heart had renounced all but God, and God (the worldly-minded believer having chosen the well-watered plain) had made him realize all the extent of the scene of promise, he builds an altar there to worship the God who had bestowed all on him, assured him in the possession of it, and given him the present knowledge of and enjoyment of it in hope.<a name=138:4></a>

		But renouncing the world is the path to victory over it; the choosing of it is captive subjection to its power.<a name=138:5></a> Lot is carried away captive by the powerful ones of the earth, along with those among whom his worldly propensities had led him.<a name=138:6></a> Abram, free and walking in the faith of God, has more force from Him than all the kings, conquerors or conquered, and delivers Lot and the kings who could not help themselves.<a name=138:7></a> The full victory of faith is here presented -- ours is not with carnal weapons, when it is gained; and what is figured will only be fully accomplished in connection with the Jews.<a name=138:8></a> This brings Abram under Melchizedek blessing, God taking the character, which is properly millennial, of possessor of heaven and earth.<a name=138:9></a> Praise and blessing constitute the priestly work of Melchizedek.<a name=138:10></a> This is the victory of faith, and the full blessing of Christ (priest and king over God's universal dominion) being established -- all enemies being overcome.<a name=138:11></a> But it historically gives occasion, not merely to renouncing the world completely, but to the refusal of the least dependence on it.<a name=138:12></a> Abram depends on God for wealth and everything.<a name=138:13></a> In such a relationship -- receiving from the world, depending on it, for advantage as its debtor, is pollution.<a name=138:14></a> Thus closes this part of Abram's history, and the worship which belongs to it.<a name=138:15></a>

		Details of the most interesting kind are given in what follows; but they are the development of his personal relationship with God.<a name=139:1></a> What we have examined is, in its general characters, the public life of faith.<a name=139:2></a> What follows enters into the private and personal communion which belongs to the life of faith, through the divine grace which visits it.<a name=139:3></a> We do not find worship, but what we may be allowed reverently to call intercourse.<a name=139:4></a> In one place we are told God talked with Abram.<a name=139:5></a> Abram, no doubt, fell on his face, the fitting position in such intercourse; and even when he, in all liberty, pleaded with Jehovah for others, when Jehovah appeared to him in the form of a man, it was with the fullest recognition of the divine glory of Him with whom he spoke.<a name=139:6></a> Still it was not worship, but communications from Jehovah to Abram, and in return Abram's with Him.<a name=139:7></a>

		This has evidently a peculiar character of blessing and privilege -- a grace, an intimacy to which our highest and most adoring attention is due.<a name=139:8></a> And if we have the lovely picture here of this gracious familiarity of God with the earliest and, so to speak, infant movings of faith, surely in the riper knowledge of all His ways, and of all His grace, which we have by redemption, and through the gift of His Holy Spirit, this privilege is not lost.<a name=139:9></a> It may have a deeper character -- a more reverent one, as filled with a deeper knowledge of God -- more confiding, because His love is better known -- less familiar, but more intimate; still it exists, and the gracious picture of it in Abram's case is not lost for our instruction.<a name=139:10></a> It has a Christian, not a patriarchal character; but the same God who loves us, and the same faith that trusts Him, meet through His grace to receive the gracious communications of that love, and to tell our wants and the feelings of our hearts, and the wants of others too, to One on whom we know how to count.<a name=139:11></a> These communications have a very different character, both on the side of the Lord, and (in consequence of that) on the side of Abram, but they were all what I may call personal.<a name=139:12></a>

		The first occasion of these communications from God was Abram's definite refusal to take anything from the world, even where he had rendered it the greatest possible service.<a name=140:1></a> He would have nothing to say to it from a thread to a shoe-latchet.<a name=140:2></a> His faith had got the victory over its power.<a name=140:3></a> His value for his own relationship with God refused its proffered reward.<a name=140:4></a> God meets this in Abram, and says, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.<a name=140:5></a> His defence in battle had been God; his abundant reward, not the poor and perishing gifts of a world, to which its debtor after all always owes something -- at least, acknowledges that he will receive from it -- but the Lord Himself.<a name=140:6></a> Such, in general, is the blessed announcement made by the word of the Lord to Abram.<a name=140:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a difference between the communications of chapter 15 and chapter 17.<a name=140:8></a> God does not, so to speak, personally visit Abram in chapter 15.<a name=140:9></a> He communicates to him what He is <i>for</i> him in a vision, a great and special blessing, but evidently different from the personal revelation of chapters 17 and 18.<a name=140:10></a> The two communications have this essential difference: in chapter 15 God declares what He is <i>for Abram</i>, in chapter 17 what He <i>is:</i> and this last leads to much deeper communion, and a larger unfolding of grace and imbuedness with the mind of God, than the revelation of chapter 15.<a name=140:11></a> This latter makes Abram's wants and desires the measure of His blessings, or, at least, they characterise these latter.<a name=140:12></a> Hence Abram is thrown back upon himself.<a name=140:13></a> God meets him there in full grace, but meets <i>his</i> wants and wishes.<a name=140:14></a> Now this is most precious.<a name=140:15></a> God shews His most tender condescension.<a name=140:16></a> He inspires us with confidence: we can tell Him our wants, open our hearts to Him, in consequence; and all the communication that results, while it makes us know God better, leads us up to that knowledge of Him which makes us see our own littleness in what we have presented to Him as the object of our desires, and gives us to find our joy in Himself, and draw our feelings towards others from Himself, and our assimilating enjoyment of what He is for ourselves.<a name=140:17></a>

		Thus, when God had spoken to Abram of His being <i>his</i> shield, and <i>his</i> reward, Abram says, "What wilt thou give <i>me</i>?<a name=140:18></a>" The first want of <i>his</i> heart is presented to God.<a name=140:19></a> God had told Abram He Himself was his reward; but where our feelings and need are referred to, if God presents Himself as our portion, the human heart will turn, by the very confidence that is produced in it, to its own thoughts and its own desires.<a name=140:20></a> <i>Abram's</i> reward led Abram to Abram's wants and feelings and wishes.<a name=140:21></a> Though God, and even because God, had said <i>He</i> was his reward, the love and goodness was felt, but did not put aside, nor lead Abram, beyond, what Abram desired to have from that goodness, if it was there.<a name=140:22></a> God knew all this, and used it for the occasion of bringing out His own thoughts and purposes.<a name=140:23></a> This is the grace, then, that comes down to the heart of man himself, and draws it out in confidence towards God, but thereby leaves it in the circle of its own wants and feelings; but its wants and feelings, such as they can exist in connection with God; but then, remark, not going beyond this world, beyond what man wants as conscious of his position here.<a name=140:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is much profitable instruction in tracing, in contrast, the characters of Lot and Abram.<a name=145:1></a> Both were saints of God, yet how different as to their walk!<a name=145:2></a> how different also as to their personal experiences in regard of peace, joy, and nearness to God!<a name=145:3></a> And there is ever this difference between a worldly-minded believer and one, through the grace of God, true-hearted.<a name=145:4></a> In the scriptural sense of the term (2 Peter 2: 8), a "righteous man," Lot was "vexing his righteous soul from day to day.<a name=145:5></a>" Abram walked before God.<a name=145:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord cannot but be faithful to His people, still He does mark in their path that which is of faith and that which is not of faith, and Lot's trials are the consequences of his unbelief There is one thing very marked in his course throughout -- great uncertainty and obscurity as to his path, and as to the judgment of God, because of not realizing that security in God which would have enabled him to walk straightforward, whilst there is no hesitation in things connected with this world.<a name=145:7></a> And it is thus with ourselves if we have not taken Christ for our portion heartily.<a name=145:8></a> Abram's was a thoroughly happy life -- he had God for his portion.<a name=145:9></a>

		Lot is seen rather as the companion in the walk of faith of those who have faith, than as one having and acting in the energy of faith himself.<a name=145:10></a> This characterizes his path from the beginning.<a name=145:11></a> Therefore, when put to the test, there is only weakness.<a name=145:12></a> In how many things do we act with those who have faith, before having it for ourselves!<a name=145:13></a> It was thus with the disciples of the Lord, and the moment they were put to the test there was weakness and failure.<a name=145:14></a> The soul will not stand, when sifted through temptation, if walking in the light of another.<a name=145:15></a>

		God's personal call of Abram at the first is mixed with a sort of unbelief in Abram, much like the reply in the gospel, "Lord, suffer me first to go home and bury my father.<a name=145:16></a>" He sets out, but he takes Terah, his father, with him, and goes and lodges in Haran (he could not carry Terah with him into the land of Canaan).<a name=145:17></a> Now God had called Abram, but not Terah.<a name=145:18></a> He left everything except Terah, and entered into possession of nothing.<a name=145:19></a> But he tried to carry something with him which was not of God, and he could not.<a name=145:20></a> It is not until after Terah's death that he removes into Canaan, to where God had called him.<a name=145:21></a> (Compare chapter 12: 1 and Acts 7: 4) "So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him .<a name=145:22></a>.<a name=145:23></a>.<a name=145:24></a> they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan they came.<a name=145:25></a>"

		To arrive at a clear understanding of both these states, as depicted to us in the passage, we must carefully distinguish between Moses and Israel.<a name=179:2></a> Of Moses it is said, "I know thee by name, and thou hast found grace in my sight.<a name=179:3></a>" He stood in grace.<a name=179:4></a> The effect of this I will consider further on; I turn first to Israel.<a name=179:5></a> Israel had just made the golden calf.<a name=179:6></a> As a formal institution they never came under strict and absolute law.<a name=179:7></a> God had spoken to them out of the midst of the fire, and they had undertaken obedience.<a name=179:8></a> But before Moses had come down from the mount, they had made the golden calf, and broken that first link of all.<a name=179:9></a>, "Thou shalt have none other gods but me.<a name=179:10></a>" Moses consequently never brought the two tables of the law given of God into the camp -- how could he place them beside a golden calf?<a name=179:11></a> -- but broke them at the foot of the mount, and left the camp, setting up anticipatively a tabernacle of the congregation outside the camp; and there God met with Moses, and talked with him face to face, as a man talks with his friend.<a name=179:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But he is told to go up to God again in the mount; and here we may look at the state of Israel.<a name=179:13></a> He had told them, "Ye have sinned a great sin, and now I will go up unto the Lord; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.<a name=179:14></a>" He does so, "and Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold; yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.<a name=179:15></a> And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.<a name=179:16></a>" They were put fully under law, each man responsible for his sin, which is most righteous, of course, as law and judgment; but atonement was not made, but personal responsibility left everything on the individual.<a name=179:17></a> Blessed be God, Christ has not said, "I will go up .<a name=179:18></a>.<a name=179:19></a>.<a name=179:20></a> peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin He has made a perfect atonement (and thus gone down), and sat down on the right hand of God.<a name=179:21></a> But this was not so here.<a name=179:22></a> Who indeed could do it but He?<a name=179:23></a>

		However, the people are, through the mediation of Moses, in a measure, as to present dealings, put under grace.<a name=180:1></a> The people humbled themselves, and they are spared, and God's presence goes with them.<a name=180:2></a> God retreats into His own sovereignty to be gracious, and shew mercy.<a name=180:3></a> So surely it always is.<a name=180:4></a> As Jehovah He then declares His name: not the gospel, founded on accomplished redemption, full forgiveness, and acceptance in Christ, who has wrought it; but the terms of God's forbearing mercy in His government of Israel.<a name=180:5></a><a href="#180:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> "Jehovah, Jehovah Elohim, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty (just what God does through Christ by the atonement); visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon <i>the children, and upon the children's children</i>, unto the third and to the fourth generation.<a name=180:6></a>" Such are the terms of God's dealing with Israel, on Moses' intercession, while they were put back under law, and the latter and commandments renewed.<a name=180:7></a> It was, as I have said, a mixture of grace and law.<a name=180:8></a> Grace that spared and, as a present thing, forgave, but put back under law again, under which, as a strict and absolute rule, Israel had wholly failed.<a name=180:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And such is a vast part of current Christianity: admitted failure under a broken law; mercy that has spared and, as a present thing, forgiven; and then men put back under law as a rule of life to keep it.<a name=180:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Moses could not make atonement, and Israel was put back under law, though spared in mercy.<a name=180:11></a> But Christ has made atonement, we all blessedly know; and "when he <i>had</i> by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.<a name=180:12></a>" There was no "peradventure" here.<a name=180:13></a> He finished the work His Father gave Him to do, and is glorified <i>as Man</i> at the right hand of God, in a glory He had with the Father before the world was.<a name=180:14></a> Hence the gospel is a ministration of righteousness -- the righteousness of God is revealed in it to faith.<a name=180:15></a> Men are not under law, but under grace.<a name=180:16></a>

		Remark here that it is the law, here as then added to grace in the ways of God, which the apostle calls the ministration of death and condemnation.<a name=181:1></a> The first time Moses came down from the mountain, his face (the circumstance the apostle alludes to) did not shine.<a name=181:2></a> When he had all God's goodness pass before him, and came down the second time, it did.<a name=181:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still, as we have seen, and as is evident, the people, though spared by grace, were put back under law; and this was the ministration of death and condemnation of which the apostle speaks.<a name=181:4></a> For, in fact, if atonement be not made, grace only makes transgression worse, at any rate in the revelation of God; even in partial glory, with law it must be condemnation to a sinner.<a name=181:5></a> Law after grace, in a word, is what the apostle teaches us is condemnation; law after atonement is worse than absurd.<a name=181:6></a> It is putting away the sin, and then putting under it, or making the law of no authority and no effect.<a name=181:7></a> But vague grace -- sparing, and then law, is the state of multitudes of souls; and that is what the apostle tells us is death and condemnation in its nature, and indeed the veil is soon over the reflection of grace to the soul (that is, the perception that exists of grace is soon lost).<a name=181:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between Moses and Israel is touchingly alluded to in 2 Corinthians 3, where it is said, "When it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away.<a name=181:9></a>" For Moses, when he went into the sanctuary, took it off.<a name=181:10></a> But it is done away in Christ.<a name=181:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people, then, were under law.<a name=181:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now turn to Moses, who had found grace in God's sight.<a name=181:13></a> First we find single-eyed desire towards God and His way.<a name=181:14></a> It was not, a safe way across the wilderness, but, "Shew me now <i>thy</i> way," and that, "that I might know thee.<a name=181:15></a>" This is single-eyed and beautiful (chapter 33: 12, 13), and this is the way, as in John 14, of finding practically grace or favour in our walk, as Enoch did.<a name=181:16></a> But then he can intercede, "This nation is thy people": for he did not separate himself at all from their interests, and wanted God's presence with them.<a name=181:17></a> God meets what is in his heart: "My presence shall go, and I will give thee rest.<a name=181:18></a>" He will not call the people, indeed, "My people," but there will be His presence (through Moses' faith), and then in the way rest.<a name=181:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses at once presses on the manifested grace, "If thy presence go not, take us not up hence.<a name=181:20></a>" He must have God's presence, and he brings the people in.<a name=181:21></a> This only (verse 16) separates evidently a people to God, a notable point.<a name=181:22></a> Thus it is known that favour rests upon them, for Moses is -- emboldened by grace, yet just in word and thought in the place of faith, "I and thy people have found grace.<a name=181:23></a>" It is by his mediation, for that was the true exercise of faith with a heart for God's people; but the same faith will say "<i>Thy</i> people," and that is granted too.<a name=181:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then (for he cannot see the face of God, that for sinners was in atonement, and Christ, the blessed One, alone could do it) the goodness is passed before him, when the glory of his face had passed by, and sovereign mercy, as we have seen, spares.<a name=182:1></a> This is the blessed confidence of grace: only we have to say that now we can look at the glory in the unveiled face of Christ, because atonement is made, and the glory is the witness of acceptance and of sin put away.<a name=182:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is more as to this grace.<a name=182:3></a> We have seen how God is with us in grace in His own way, and knowing Him.<a name=182:4></a> But, we shall see, it meets the evil of our nature.<a name=182:5></a> This is shewn in the most striking way in this passage.<a name=182:6></a> First, God had said, "I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee," "for thou art a stiff-necked people.<a name=182:7></a>" He could not tolerate sin in His presence, and He would not go at all, though He would not let them go up as spared.<a name=182:8></a> This gave occasion to the pleading of Moses, which we have considered, who felt the value of God's presence.<a name=182:9></a> It was everything to him in holy desire; he could not do without it: and holy boldness through the grace shewn him (for he had found grace, and was told so) -- he claims and obtains it.<a name=182:10></a> And now he stood in grace and known goodness; and when all the goodness had passed before him, he says, bowing his head to the earth, "If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord (Adonai, not Jehovah), let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiff-necked people," the very ground God had given for cutting them off!<a name=182:11></a> And could we go?<a name=182:12></a> could we get the better of our stiff neck, of our flesh, and get safely through the wilderness, if God were not with us?<a name=182:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, oh, what a change grace has made!<a name=182:14></a> Here is the very reason for consuming in just judgment, the motive for asking God to be with us.<a name=182:15></a> How complete this grace!<a name=182:16></a> God, in whose present grace we stand, is our resource against the evil in us, which was the just ground in itself of cutting us off.<a name=182:17></a> How very perfect and complete this grace is, and the ground of God's relationship with us!<a name=182:18></a> Here, too, though it rests on the Mediator, as we know it does, yet Moses brings the people fully in -- "go among us; for it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin; and take us for thine inheritance.<a name=182:19></a>" His faith is very beautiful here, and faith knows God and indeed it only.<a name=182:20></a>

		HINTS ON THE TABERNACLE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Exodus 25-34
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Exodus 25 begins the instructions for the tabernacle.<a name=184:1></a> First, they were to bring all the different materials, and then "according to all that I shew thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.<a name=184:2></a>" And again, "after the pattern of all that was shewed thee in the mount.<a name=184:3></a>" These were the "patterns of things in the heavens," or anti-types of things in the heavens.<a name=184:4></a> We must not bring in the highest relationships here; that is, connected with what has been said about priesthood; as "Father" is the highest name for us, so here you find all judicial questions settled.<a name=184:5></a> Such matters as cleansing, and all that was responsible down here, are dealt with, and so on; but no relationships save Jewish ones.<a name=184:6></a> It is this that makes the Psalms, beautiful as they are, mischievous in the use men make of them, because souls get into a false relationship with them.<a name=184:7></a> You never see the Father's relationship to the child in the entire body of Psalms.<a name=184:8></a> It is referred to as an analogy, but not the relationship itself.<a name=184:9></a> There are instructions how to walk in faith in this world, but they never put a person in heaven; the Christian class of relationships could not be, for it was not revealed; but many beautiful expressions of faith, confidence, and piety which apply to us all.<a name=184:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To me it is a remarkable thing that we have here the shadow of good things to come, not the very image of them.<a name=184:11></a> There is a most wonderful exhibition of what is divine, and yet it contains in it provision for a connection or relationship with what is fallen.<a name=184:12></a> Thus what is an altar for?<a name=184:13></a> In heaven you get an altar, and on earth pictured out the heavenly things themselves where Christ is gone; still it secretly kept in redemption, and, by sacrifice upon it, all was provided for, and a certain connection with heaven by means of what is earthly.<a name=184:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The existence of an altar and a laver supposed impurity, yet the third heavens are figured there and the throne of God, but along with that an unrent veil.<a name=184:15></a> There was a holiest, but no way into it; so that it all has a certain character of revelation of God, and yet of a hidden God after all.<a name=184:16></a> Thus we see in it mere connection with heaven before anybody could enter there, and this comes from foreshewing Christ -- the perfect -- by what is imperfect.<a name=184:17></a>

		The first thing described (in chapter 25) is the ark, made of shittim wood, and covered all over with pure gold inside and out; and it is said, "thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee," that is the law.<a name=185:1></a> Now you could not put law in the Father's house; but you could put it where God was in a relationship with man which regarded him in a judicial manner, as I said.<a name=185:2></a> Take the Hebrews, where you have the highest christian expression of all this; and there we have boldness to enter into the holiest, but we are not sitting in heavenly places.<a name=185:3></a> No person ever thought of dwelling in the tabernacle; that is another set of ideas.<a name=185:4></a> God dwelt there, but nobody else.<a name=185:5></a> The moment man dwells there, I must get the Father, and also complete freedom of relationship to Him as such.<a name=185:6></a> The moment God revealed Himself as Father, you get the ground on which the relationship was founded, and then comes priesthood, and also adoption, and heirship of the glory.<a name=185:7></a> This is what frightened the disciples on the mount of transfiguration (I mean the "excellent glory," that is, the cloud, or the Shechinah); "and they feared as they entered into the cloud," that is, as Moses and Elias entered; it was a new thing altogether to the disciples, a new idea, and a fact before them that produced the fear.<a name=185:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Was not Moses in the cloud before?<a name=185:9></a> The cloud came down, and God talked with Moses, but Moses did not enter the cloud; the cloud was more than the holiest.<a name=185:10></a> Moses went up, but he never went into the cloud to talk with God, though the cloud covered God from the people.<a name=185:11></a> It was the sign of God's presence as when Miriam talked against Moses (Numbers 12).<a name=185:12></a> But when you have the cloud on the mount, it was pure law, until Moses interceded with God for mercy; so in itself it was accompanied with thunderings and lightnings -- not grace at all.<a name=185:13></a> Until Moses got the mercy (the second time he went up), he did not go in with God.<a name=185:14></a> If Moses went into the tabernacle, that was approaching God; but still it was not like being children in a house, it was approaching a God who will estimate whether you have a right to approach Him or not.<a name=185:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God was here in a certain character, and if man was not fit, he could not go there, for there was moral estimate of what man was.<a name=185:16></a> Now the Father has sent the Son; but then it was nothing of the kind, it was purely a question of whether man could approach God.<a name=185:17></a> The contrast is brought out in Hebrews, taking Hebrews in the highest way.<a name=185:18></a> We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus: this is what makes us competent; but still for us God is a consuming fire, estimating everything.<a name=185:19></a> The temple was the Lord's house, Jehovah's, and Jehovah was His Father.<a name=185:20></a> We were noticing in Corinthians the three names of God in the passage, "I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord (Jehovah) Almighty.<a name=185:21></a>"

		Christ revealed the Father's name, for He was Son.<a name=186:1></a> It was not that man could go to God, but God was revealed to man; it was not sitting in righteousness to see if man could go near, but God was coming out in grace to take man in to Himself.<a name=186:2></a> Thus you can see what is so terrible in confounding the Old Testament condition with ours; that was only the shadow of good things to come.<a name=186:3></a> Evidently it is a solemn truth, whether we can go to God or not; it is a difference in the starting-point of the whole being.<a name=186:4></a> And more still, it is the Father's eternal love that is thinking of me, though I am a sinner, and that means to give me such a blessing.<a name=186:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Hebrews is more contrast than comparison; you have a veil, but it is rent; priests dying because they could not continue, and One who cannot die; sacrifices that were memorials of sins, and a sacrifice which is such as to be proof that sins are no more remembered.<a name=186:6></a> The Epistle is not the old system christianized, so to speak, but another bearing of things altogether.<a name=186:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You have the blood put upon the ark or mercy-seat.<a name=186:8></a> The mercy-seat itself is of pure gold.<a name=186:9></a> There you see what is absolutely divine.<a name=186:10></a> You see something as to man when the law is put in the ark, because that applies to man, and shittim wood too is in the ark; but the covering is divine righteousness absolutely.<a name=186:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Shittim wood, they say, was a kind of acacia, and figurative, in general, of the human side of things, as gold was of the divine.<a name=186:12></a> For when you have a covenant in the law, man is brought in; but the covering was of gold only, and this was divine alone.<a name=186:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a physical reason in it too, for they could not have carried it else.<a name=186:14></a> There was no appearance of wood, all was gold that was seen, but the covering is pure gold altogether.<a name=186:15></a> Then you have the cherubim, and the whole a throne: "he sitteth between the cherubim.<a name=186:16></a>" The cherubim seem to be symbols always of judicial power.<a name=186:17></a> The seraphim are only in fact named in Isaiah, and there they say, "Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts.<a name=186:18></a>, the whole earth is full of his glory.<a name=186:19></a>" It was judgment looked at in connection with holiness more than with authority and government.<a name=186:20></a> In the Revelation the four living ones are both cherubs and seraphs.<a name=186:21></a> They have six wings and cry, "holy, holy, holy," having the likeness of a man, calf, lion, and flying eagle.<a name=186:22></a> Here the cherubim are connected with the judicial throne.<a name=186:23></a>

		The four faces are the attributes of God in a way.<a name=187:1></a> The ox was called a cherub sometimes, though I do not know why.<a name=187:2></a> In it is the permanence and stability of judgment; the power of it in a lion; the rapidity of it in the eagle; and the intelligence in a man.<a name=187:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was another thing in this divine throne -- the covenant was there; the terms of the covenant were the law.<a name=187:4></a> You have no seraphim here, but it is the throne of judgment just as much.<a name=187:5></a> And there is this fact: the cherubim were of gold beaten out of one piece with the mercy-seat.<a name=187:6></a> They were divine.<a name=187:7></a> And they were together, with their wings stretched out, looking at the covenant, all the attributes of God securing the covenant and judging righteously.<a name=187:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remarkably enough our rationalists in their researches have found in Nineveh winged things, bulls and lions, and images of cherubim, and so on.<a name=187:9></a> It just shews the utter folly of their system, for when Ezekiel has the cherubim, he has these animals sure enough; but they are merely to support the throne.<a name=187:10></a> For God is above; they are mere attributes, and God over them.<a name=187:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here in the tabernacle they were not fully manifested in that way.<a name=187:12></a> It is the throne of God, and the cherubim are of one piece with it, look towards one another but downwards fixedly at the covenant, with their wings stretched out to cover the mercy-seat.<a name=187:13></a> When Solomon puts his cherubim in the temple, they stood up with the tip of one wing touching one wall then two tips met in the middle of the house, and the other tip of the fourth wing touched the wall on the opposite side, and they looked outwards, because all the attributes of God were going out to man.<a name=187:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reason the ark is mentioned as carried then into the temple is because the tabernacle was in ruin.<a name=187:15></a> Once men carried it into Dagon's house (this being an idol, part man and part fish), and when the ark went in, the man fell down, and the fish only was left in place.<a name=187:16></a> This had its meaning.<a name=187:17></a> Now Shiloh was all pulled to pieces when Solomon took the ark and set it in the temple.<a name=187:18></a> The Philistines had taken it, but God maintained His own glory (all else must go for nothing); and He watched over it step by step wherever they led it about, and finally took it from them.<a name=187:19></a>

		It was a cherub at each end and all gold, simply divine, a sign of God Himself, as it were.<a name=188:1></a> "And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark, and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.<a name=188:2></a>" This is first of all, and chief; but no Father sending the Son here.<a name=188:3></a> There is the meeting God in righteousness in a certain way, but it is God dealing with man, responsible man, and setting up His own throne in righteousness.<a name=188:4></a>
	</div>

		Then you find the table of shittim wood, overlaid with gold, and upon it the shewbread always.<a name=188:5></a> Then the candlestick of pure gold with beaten work and seven lamps for burning oil.<a name=188:6></a> These were on the two sides, and in the same place outside the veil.<a name=188:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the altar of incense is not described yet, because this is for approach and not for display.<a name=188:8></a> The description of the vessels is broken in the middle here by the appointing of the priesthood.<a name=188:9></a> First the things that are from God coming out, and then, after the priests are appointed, the things which are wanted for man to go in.<a name=188:10></a> So, in the holy place, there is a table and a candlestick.<a name=188:11></a> The table is "before Jehovah," the number twelve in the loaves on the table, and seven in the lamps (the one being the sign of government in the creature, and the other, of what is divine light in the Spirit); and this is simply divine in its nature.<a name=188:12></a> Twelve is government on earth, as constantly one gets it so.<a name=188:13></a> Seven is what is spiritual, bad or good, but commonly good.<a name=188:14></a> Hence, as to these two numbers, they are both perfection; but one is perfection in a spiritual way, and the other is perfection in a human way.<a name=188:15></a> Seven is the highest prime number, absolutely indivisible, nine may be divided though not by two.<a name=188:16></a> Whereas twelve is the most divisible of the numbers, divisible by all below its half, except five.<a name=188:17></a> Their use (seven or twelve) is a matter of fact, and there is a kind of moral reason why they should be used; twelve apostles, twelve foundations to the city, twelve thrones, twelve patriarchs, twelve tribes, and so on.<a name=188:18></a> Thus there is the divine fight on the one side, and the human order according to God, or God's order in man, if you please, on the other side, in the holy place; not in the holiest of all.<a name=188:19></a>

		Afterwards come the glory itself and the court of the tabernacle.<a name=189:3></a> There are three unities in the tabernacle.<a name=189:4></a> It is Christ Himself; then the church, "whose house are we"; and then it is the heavens.<a name=189:5></a> He was the tabernacle, and the veil was His flesh; and we are His house and then He went "through the heavens" (Hebrews 4: 14).<a name=189:6></a> God dwelt in Christ, "the Father dwelleth in me; in the house the church, God's habitation; and in the heavens.<a name=189:7></a> All we have had was inside the tabernacle.<a name=189:8></a>

		In the ark I have God Himself sitting on the throne of judgment; and in it, as Christ, all that God could require from man was absolutely there, and God was there too.<a name=189:19></a> There is divine judgment, but it is there put into connection with man's responsibility; that is, God's measure of man's righteousness, if you please, not what it is of course, but what it ought to be.<a name=189:20></a> You notice in the Hebrews it is not the temple but the tabernacle that is always referred to.<a name=189:21></a> Scripture says we have "boldness to enter into the holiest"; and so we do in spirit.<a name=189:22></a> The veil is rent; so that, when we go to worship, we go into God's own presence, we go beyond the veil -- inside the veil.<a name=189:23></a> Our position is, that the veil was rent from top to bottom, and we go inside where God is.<a name=189:24></a> What God is shewing under the law, was that man could not go in; "the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest.<a name=189:25></a>" Whereas now the Holy Ghost shews that it is, all Hebrews being contrast in that way between what was and what is.<a name=189:26></a> The rending of the veil in Christ's death has let us into God's own presence.<a name=189:27></a> It did two things, the rending of the veil -- it put away all sins for us totally; and also it opened up the way for us to God; so that now, through the work of Christ, we have all opened up for us into God's own presence, and we are without sin when we get there.<a name=189:28></a> There are other and higher things, even than this, in the Father and common truth; but all this is necessary for us to go to God.<a name=189:29></a>

		Then comes another thing, the laver; this is not washing the body to be made a priest, but here the priest washes his hands and feet; it was not the washing of consecration; but, when consecrated, he must be perfectly pure for God, and he must wash his hands and feet.<a name=194:12></a> Only in our case it is walk, not work, and so it is feet only for us.<a name=194:13></a> He was to wash every time he did any service whatever.<a name=194:14></a>

		As you look at all this, of course, it is quite imperfect as regards our condition; but the provision is clear; and it is most interesting to see God coming out, by table and candlestick and brazen altar, and then man going in to God, with laver and altar of incense.<a name=195:11></a>

		Next they made a golden calf.<a name=195:17></a> Moses was getting all these things for them, and they in his absence make the calf.<a name=195:18></a> It is afflicting, but withal exceedingly beautiful, the intercourse of God with Moses, consequent upon the people making the golden calf -- how, in the midst of all the ruin, faith, under grace, can have closer intercourse than when there was no ruin.<a name=195:19></a> Moses never had so close intercourse with God, as now when the people had made the calf; and it was while the calf was in the camp.<a name=195:20></a> And the way in which God meets Moses is beautiful, "My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.<a name=195:21></a>" And then Moses grows bolder still, and says, "If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.<a name=195:22></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thought: the ground that God gives for destroying the people is precisely what Moses takes for God's going with them, when once grace has come in.<a name=195:23></a> In chapter 32: 9, 10, the Lord says "it is a stiff-necked people, now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them.<a name=195:24></a>" And then, in chapter 34: 9, Moses says "Let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiff-necked people.<a name=195:25></a>" So God's reason for consuming me would be my sin; and my reason for asking God to be with me, now that grace has come in, is that sin is in me.<a name=195:26></a> What infinite mercy!<a name=195:27></a>

		There are two classes of sacrifices: those made by fire for a sweet savour; and the sin and trespass offerings (pretty much the same thing), which were not for a sweet savour, though the fat of them was burnt on the altar.<a name=197:4></a> The three sacrifices of sweet savour are -- the burnt-offering, the meat (or meal) offering, and the peace-offering.<a name=197:5></a> "Peace-offering" is a bad name: "<i>sacrifices de prosperite</i>" they are called in French.<a name=197:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the offerings, they are here given as from Jehovah in their order; they are for men, but still from the Lord, just as Christ was; whereas, when men came to offer, they came, not with the burnt-offering, but with the sin-offering first.<a name=197:7></a> Here the divine statement of them is made, and the sin-offering is last because this is what Christ became when He had offered up Himself.<a name=197:8></a> It is first when persons come by them, and the order in a measure shews the character.<a name=197:9></a>

		We first come in Leviticus 1 to the burnt-offering.<a name=197:10></a> "If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd," and so on.<a name=197:11></a> Sometimes a bullock, and sometimes a goat, or a sheep, but a "male without blemish," representing Christ in His perfection.<a name=197:12></a>

		"Of his own voluntary will" should rather be, "for his acceptance.<a name=197:13></a>" There is one passage made me question it rather, but I believe that is what it should be.<a name=197:14></a> In chapter 22 you may make a difference; in verse 19 it means "free-will," but in verse 29 it should be "for his acceptance.<a name=197:15></a>"

		The offerer puts his hand on the head of the victim.<a name=197:16></a> "And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him, and he shall kill the bullock before the Lord.<a name=197:17></a>" Then the priest was to bring the blood, and deal with that; this is the priest's first act -- to bring the blood.<a name=197:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The special character of the burnt-offering is, that it was not for a committed sin; on the contrary, what is to me a most wonderful thing is, that not only the question of our sins is elsewhere met, but in the burnt-offering it is the question of glorifying God in the place of sin itself -- Christ "made sin.<a name=197:19></a>" And He who knew no sin was made sin, and stood in the place of sin (at the cross) before God, so as to glorify God there; "made sin," which, except in a divine way of wisdom, is impossible.<a name=197:20></a> But Christ was made sin of His own voluntary will, and yet it was in obedience: these are combined; the two things are together.<a name=197:21></a> God "hath made him to be sin.<a name=197:22></a>" God put Him in the place of sin, and He offered Himself for sin (and He is our passover), freely and entirely for it.<a name=197:23></a>

		This is what we may see in John 18, "if ye seek me, let these go their way.<a name=198:1></a>" Christ put Himself forward, "offered himself without spot to God"; but at the same time He is "made sin" -- it is obedience too.<a name=198:2></a> The thing was, to unite this fact of sin being under God's eye, and so to have it there as that God should be perfectly glorified about it.<a name=198:3></a> And only in a victim could this be.<a name=198:4></a> And there was perfectness in bringing it, for it was the giving up of Himself.<a name=198:5></a> Besides the fact of our sins put away there, you get nothing like the atonement.<a name=198:6></a> It is all for us all the while; yet Christ is there "made sin," in absolute obedience and self-sacrifice, but making good the righteousness, and love, and majesty, and honour, and truth of God, and everything else that is in God.<a name=198:7></a> Now it is by this we come; and therefore it is not only that the sin-offering has been there, but in coming by this I come in all the value of that which has glorified God in the very place where I was; I come to God in all the value of this, and get the acceptance of it before God, like Abel.<a name=198:8></a> Nowhere else at all is anything seen like this.<a name=198:9></a>

		Suppose you have a number of worldly people round you, you can ask God to bless them; but you cannot go on with a priestly prayer, less so than you could even with the animals around you.<a name=211:1></a> But if the individual sinned, there was failure in his individual responsibility, but no interruption between God and the people.<a name=211:2></a> The person had got astray, and it was a question of his responsibility, and one that he could so far estimate, so that there is no taking the body outside the camp.<a name=211:3></a> Every man knows that sin cannot do for God.<a name=211:4></a> So it was then in a worldly religion, the brazen altar being the estimate of the evil according to man's responsibility.<a name=211:5></a> But there it came within the limits of man and of the world.<a name=211:6></a> Go and say to a worldly-minded man, You must be partaker of God's holiness; or talk to him about a nature that cannot sin because born of God!<a name=211:7></a> He either hates it, or thinks you raving; but he would perfectly understand that he is not to steal, kill, and so on.<a name=211:8></a> Such was the case with the brazen altar for the Israelite, the law being only a shadow of good things to come.<a name=211:9></a> Now, we must walk in the light as God is in the light; for the veil is rent.<a name=211:10></a> It is not now merely that I must have the sins put away, of which I am guilty in the earth, so as to go on with God in ordinary intercourse, but the claims of God on me are according to the light in which He is revealed in Christ.<a name=211:11></a> So scripture shews distinctly that, though the Christian has a consciousness of failure, he has, when once purged, no more conscience of sins; as typically in Israel the great day of atonement, when the blood was put on the mercy-seat, was the basis of all that went on through the year.<a name=211:12></a> God's character must be met, even to go on with His material government in patience and mercy.<a name=211:13></a>

		In leaven we see the character of sin, not only in the act but in the abstract.<a name=224:8></a> It is well to distinguish between <i>sins as</i> the fruit of our evil nature, and <i>sin</i>.<a name=224:9></a> The Holy Ghost detects not only sins in the act, but sin in the nature.<a name=224:10></a> Thus we are led to the knowledge that we are all alike, all in one condition.<a name=224:11></a> The Holy Ghost lays bare that in nature which the law could only notice in its earliest actings.<a name=224:12></a> The moment I have a new nature, not only do I detect the acts of the old nature, but "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good doth not dwell but I have this comfort, that hating and judging the evil, I know that it is put away.<a name=224:13></a> Not that this should make us careless; no, our privilege is to judge it before it has brought forth the bitter fruits.<a name=224:14></a> Have you judged it thus in the nature?<a name=224:15></a> If it is there, it is condemned.<a name=224:16></a> "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, <i>God</i> sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, <i>condemned sin in the flesh</i>.<a name=224:17></a>" As Jesus was presented in all circumstances like me, except sin, whatever I find in myself, not in Jesus, I know is this condemned thing, sin: but as Jesus was also a sacrifice for sin, it is condemned in grace to me, Jesus having suffered for it, though He had it not.<a name=224:18></a> If you cannot say you are without sin in your nature, living in all the spotlessness and purity of Jesus, you are in yourself lost; but recognizing Jesus as the offering for you (though in yourself a poor failing wretched creature), you can be presented to God even as He is, because you are presented in Him who has glorified God in this very place as made sin for us.<a name=224:19></a> But, beside this, as a living man on earth all was perfect, and all was tested by the fullest trial of God, passed through the fire, and all was a sweet savour.<a name=224:20></a>

		The first-fruits were to be offered but not burnt, because leaven was in them; and they could not be in themselves a sweet savour: hence a sin-offering was offered with them (Leviticus 23: 17-19).<a name=225:8></a> They represent the church.<a name=225:9></a> being (as may be seen in Leviticus 23) the offering of the day of Pentecost; not the church in the unity of the body, but as formed among Jews on earth on that day.<a name=225:10></a> The first of the first-fruits, the corn out of full ears, is Christ risen, offered on the morrow of the sabbath after the Passover; it represents Christ Himself, and hence (Leviticus 23) there was no sin-offering.<a name=225:11></a> If we look at it in Leviticus 2 it is still Christ.<a name=225:12></a> Oil and frankincense are put on it.<a name=225:13></a> It is an offering made by fire without leaven.<a name=225:14></a> It is Christ looked at as man, tried by divine trial of judgment, but perfect to be offered to God.<a name=225:15></a> The expressions are somewhat remarkable <i> -- geresh carmel</i>, "corn mature out of full ears"; it may be, produce of the fruitful field, the latter being the known sense of <i>carmel</i>; the meaning of <i>geresh</i> was certain.<a name=225:16></a> But the general meaning of the offering was pretty plain: Christ in His manhood, sinless and fully proved, presented to God with oil and frankincense of acceptable odour, the firstfruits -- fruits of man to God.<a name=225:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first chapter is the description of the burnt-offering representing the Lord's self-dedication and obedience, even unto death, first coming to do the Father's will, and then offering Himself up without spot unto God; and then, having so offered Himself, a victim of propitiation.<a name=226:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second we have the meat-offering, which shews the perfection of His nature, in its origin and every result, even tried by the fire of God in death, and the detailed character of that perfectness, the memorial of it being offered before Jehovah, and the rest eaten by the priests, and unleavened meat-offering.<a name=226:2></a> Chapter 3 touches on that part of the peace-offering which was offered to God.<a name=226:3></a> There is no mention of what was done with the body of the animal; we must refer to chapter 7 for this.<a name=226:4></a> The fat and the blood, which represent the life and energy of the offered victim, are said to be the food of the offering made by fire.<a name=226:5></a> They may not be eaten, but are presented to Jehovah, and all burnt, by a perpetual statute.<a name=226:6></a> The life belongs to God, and in Christ all was offered up to Him, and for His glory.<a name=226:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, in the peace-offering, the same character as the two former; still a sacrifice made by fire of a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=226:8></a> The peculiar feature in this offering is, that it is that upon which God Himself feeds; it is not merely an offering, but food of the offering.<a name=226:9></a> This gives it a peculiar character, and introduced communion.<a name=226:10></a> The satisfaction and delight, the food of God, is in the offering of Christ.<a name=226:11></a> All He is finds its rest there, is perfectly glorified there; we find our food, our delight, in it too.<a name=226:12></a>

		In chapter 7 we find the remainder of the peace-offering was eaten by the worshipper, excepting the wave-breast and heave-shoulder, which were the priests'.<a name=227:1></a> These three things.<a name=227:2></a> then, we may observe.<a name=227:3></a> The blood is sprinkled, and the fat burned for a sweet savour; the wave-breast was for Aaron and his sons, the heave-shoulder for the offering priest; and the rest for the worshipper to feed on, as an occasion of joy and thanksgiving before Jehovah.<a name=227:4></a> This practice of the offerer's partaking of his sacrifice was followed in the heathen sacrifices to which the apostle alludes (1 Corinthians 10: 18-21); part was offered to the idol, and with the rest they made a feast, being together partakers of it.<a name=227:5></a> Again, when the apostle is giving liberty to the Corinthians to eat what was sold in the shambles, he limits them to that which they ate in ignorance.<a name=227:6></a> "If any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice to idols, eat not.<a name=227:7></a>" They sprinkled the blood on the altar, and then ate the sacrifice; and therefore those who knowingly partook of it were held to be partakers of the altar, this being the way of shewing communion, whether it were with an idol, or between a believer and God.<a name=227:8></a> And this has in it a blessed meaning.<a name=227:9></a> Christ is not only here represented as the perfect burnt-offering wholly given up to God in death for His glory, but also as an offering on which we feed; not only is He God's delight, but He is that of which we can partake with Him.<a name=227:10></a> He is the subject-matter of communion.<a name=227:11></a> "As I live by the Father, so he that eateth me shall live by me.<a name=227:12></a>" The communion is between all saints, the worshipper, the priest, and God.<a name=227:13></a> Not only is it our privilege to see the sacrifice offered to God opening a way of access to Him (as in the burnt-offering and others), but we find the Lord takes delight in communion with us about it.<a name=227:14></a>

		The first thing to be observed in the peace-offering is the complete and absolute acceptance of the sacrifice, so that the Lord speaks of it as His food, that in which His holiness could find intrinsic satisfaction.<a name=227:15></a> The inwards were presented for a sweet savour (as Jesus); they are tried and examined by fire, and found to be food for God Himself.<a name=227:16></a> The fat represents the spontaneous actings of the heart.<a name=227:17></a> The richness of an animal is its fat; we judge of its healthy vigorous state by this.<a name=227:18></a>

		The offering was to be eaten the same day, or at farthest on the second day; it was not allowed to be kept longer.<a name=230:1></a> This marks the communion to be necessarily spiritual, and only to be had in communion with the sacrifice of Christ, not in nature.<a name=230:2></a> If it be the willing state of the soul itself through grace, this may be kept up a longer time; where it is thanksgiving for actual benefits, there is not the same power in it.<a name=230:3></a> It is only in the Spirit that we can have this communion with God.<a name=230:4></a> If the flesh comes in, all is spoiled; it must be burned with fire.<a name=230:5></a> The worshipper must eat his portion <i>in connection</i> with the burnt-offering, and the priests' portion.<a name=230:6></a> If eaten apart from these, having, as it were, from that separation lost the virtue communicated from the others, it becomes an abomination; and the soul that eats must bear his iniquity.<a name=230:7></a> Thus we shall continually find that joy in the Lord is apt to degenerate into that which is merely natural.<a name=230:8></a> For instance, if Christians in gladness of heart come to seek the Lord in communion, the Spirit is present; they forget all grief; the communion between their souls and God is within the veil, and there is no sorrow there; but if they are not very watchful, their joy degenerates.<a name=230:9></a> It overlasts what is spiritual, and becomes joy in the flesh.<a name=230:10></a> The real test and power of this is its connection with the sacrifice offered.<a name=230:11></a>

		CHAPTER 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The offerings in this chapter differ in character from the preceding, being sacrifices made for actual transgressions.<a name=231:1></a> Before, we had the offering of Christ as a sweet savour, and the communion of the believer upon it; but here there is altogether a new revelation.<a name=231:2></a> The three former were delivered under one revelation, which is marked by the words, "Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him" (chapter 1: 1), which are repeated at the beginning of this chapter.<a name=231:3></a> Accordingly we find, that instead of the Lord Jesus being manifested to us as a sacrifice for a sweet savour unto God, we have Him here typified as bearing our sins in His own body -- the sin-offering; Jehovah bruising Him on our account.<a name=231:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The SIN-OFFERINGS were consequent upon positive transgression; the accumulation of guilt was laid upon the head of the victim.<a name=231:5></a> We shall find under this class all the forms of transgression provided for.<a name=231:6></a> There are four different characters of sin-offerings.<a name=231:7></a> In chapter 5 to verse 13, sins are mentioned analogous in nature, but different in circumstance, and a trespass-offering commanded for them.<a name=231:8></a> In verse 14 of chapter 5 begins another revelation from God concerning the trespass-offering for anything done against Jehovah; and chapter 6 mentions trespass against a neighbour.<a name=231:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the chapter before us (the fourth) we have instances of defilements of conscience concerning things which ought not to be done, being against the commandments of Jehovah.<a name=231:10></a> The natural conscience shrinks from murder and open sins but there are other things which, although of a different character, nevertheless, if committed, bring on us defilement before Jehovah.<a name=231:11></a> There are things of positive requirement about which a soul may be ignorant, but neglect of which brings defilement; and, again, there are things which we know to be wrong, by means of the spiritual perception God has given us.<a name=231:12></a> We learn from these details, that trespasses against Jehovah, and wrongs done to our neighbour, though not all of the same importance, yet all require a sin-offering; all recall Christ to us, as taking upon Him our sins, He is our sin and trespass-offering.<a name=231:13></a>

		The first two cases are, "If the priest that is anointed do sin," and "the whole congregation sin": in either case the directions for the offering are the same.<a name=232:1></a> <i>Some of</i> the blood must be sprinkled "seven times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary"; -- "and the priest shall put some of the blood upon the <i>horns of</i> the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah in the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=232:2></a>" This was done, that there might be no interruption to the general communion, for the whole congregation being identified with the high priest, his worship in the sanctuary at the altar of incense would be interrupted by their collective defilement: and again, the priest being the representative of the whole congregation before Jehovah, their exclusion was involved in his.<a name=232:3></a> Their sin is charged upon the bullock that is slain, which (the fat being burnt upon the altar) is burnt without the camp, and this is the ground of their renewed communion with God.<a name=232:4></a> Here is shewn to us, not the perfectness of Jesus as presented to God, but Jesus bearing the defilement of our sin; yet we see the fat is still burned on the altar (verse 8), and that has in it the character of the burnt-offering, shewing that, though made sin for us, yet His offering to God therein was intrinsically perfect; but the whole bullock is burnt without the camp, pointing out to us Jesus as cast out and bruised, on account of His having taken upon Him our sin, as in 2 Corinthians 5: 21: "he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin.<a name=232:5></a>" Having presented Himself in perfectness to God, He is then made sin for us, and it pleased Jehovah to bruise Him.<a name=232:6></a> Marvellous word!<a name=232:7></a> Jesus, the Holy One, who knew no sin.<a name=232:8></a>, is cast out, and numbered with the transgressors.<a name=232:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it was merely an individual that sinned, the order of the service could still be carried on, because the communion of the congregation was not thereby destroyed.<a name=232:10></a> In this instance, the blood was then only sprinkled on the altar of burnt-offering, because that was the place where God met an individual; for he must be reconciled, that he might have his place in the congregation, to hold communion with God, It is only because Jesus bore our sins individually, that we have communion.<a name=232:11></a> But He did it once for all.<a name=232:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In many things we all offend, not only having sin in our nature, but doing things which conscience tells us ought not to be done; and in this state we could have no access to God for communion.<a name=233:3></a> These offences render the offender unfit for communion, and while in this state he could not approach God.<a name=233:4></a> Observe in this chapter, it is not merely sin, <i>but sins</i> that are mentioned.<a name=233:5></a> And here, for a moment, I would speak of the importance of not misquoting (as is often done) the passage, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the <i>sin of</i> the world"; it is not said <i>sins</i> of the world, for if that were true, God could have nothing to charge it with.<a name=233:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is indeed true, that the world as a system shall be restored to God: that <i>place</i> over which Satan has now gained such power shall be redeemed, as it is said in Colossians 1: 20, "By him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven.<a name=233:7></a>" In the hands of the second Adam, the sacrifice is the ground of the restoration of all that was alienated in the first Adam; so that His atonement not only forms a ground upon which every sinner may be addressed, but through it the world shall be restored to blessings.<a name=233:8></a> This result, however, is entirely future, as we know from the present dominion of Satan in this evil world; and, in the mean time, many despise and reject the blessing, for whom judgment is reserved; but to the believer present peace comes, though his be not a portion in the result yet.<a name=233:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the offerings before us, there is not merely this general atonement, but the bearing of <i>sins, the actual transfer of sins</i> to Jesus, the free gift of many offences unto justification of <i>life</i>.<a name=233:10></a> As in Isaiah 53 it is said, "He bare the iniquities of many," as well as "made his soul an offering for sin"; and here we not only see Jesus presented as an offering to God, by virtue of which any sinner may be addressed, but the believer also finds that his sins are laid upon Him.<a name=233:11></a> And the church, in anticipating the great result, finds that it is a saved body, and is brought into the knowledge of that which the apostle declared (Colossians 1: 21), "And <i>you</i> that were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled," etc.<a name=233:12></a> Thus we get full settled peace, for we know that Jesus has borne not merely some of our sins, but we get at this great general truth, that all our sins are laid upon Him and are blotted out.<a name=233:13></a> If we believe that by bearing our sins Jesus has justified us, then we must know that all our sins are gone from the presence of God, as He has said, "Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<a name=233:14></a>" Jesus has endured the penalty.<a name=233:15></a> "He hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling"; and faith is able to look at Jesus as the bearer of all sin for us, and the sin having been charged upon Him, <i>the church</i> is raised out of all the evil it had been in, being by one offering perfected for ever.<a name=233:16></a> What He did was, that He bore the bruising due to us.<a name=233:17></a>

		There is much that is important in the close of the account of these offerings.<a name=237:7></a> In the previous chapters the characters of the sacrifices were brought out.<a name=237:8></a> First, the perfectness of the offering of Jesus unto God: and, secondly, as outcast, treated as defiled, by reason of the sin that was laid upon Him.<a name=237:9></a> This trespass-offering partakes of the latter character.<a name=237:10></a> The Spirit of God is a holy detecter and judge of all that is inconsistent with Himself: nothing of sin can pass unnoticed.<a name=237:11></a> The Spirit does not judge according to the natural conscience, but takes a standard according to the holiness of Jesus in the presence of God, so that our minds do not always discern that which He sees requisite to be judged; but whether we discern or not, the Spirit takes account of the evil in us, and if it were not for the sin-offering and trespass-offering, we should be in a worse case than ever; for there is no atonement for sin made by the Spirit -- this is no part of His work.<a name=237:12></a> The Spirit manifests all righteousness, revealing to us what Jesus taught, but we never read of the Spirit bearing our sins.<a name=237:13></a> This is a point of the utmost importance for our rest.<a name=237:14></a> The Spirit is the spirit of testimony and holiness.<a name=237:15></a> In acceptance and in atonement Jesus <i>alone</i> has any part.<a name=237:16></a> Acceptance came in upon what Jesus had done in the flesh -- by His offering of His body once for all.<a name=237:17></a> "In the body of his flesh through death," etc.<a name=237:18></a> The testimony of the Spirit is to unmingled holiness, bearing witness to our sins, shewing us that in us good does not dwell, and also that peace and rest come by what Christ has wrought.<a name=237:19></a> The effect of this testimony of holiness would be to destroy peace, if the Spirit did not still reveal the efficacy of the blood-shedding; but while it is His office to exalt the perception of the holiness God requires, He still witnesses to us that "the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin.<a name=237:20></a>"

		We have considered in detail the work appointed for Aaron and his sons, as priests to Jehovah; we have now an account of the manner of setting them apart for that office.<a name=239:2></a> They are first washed with water, this signifying the sanctification by the word.<a name=239:3></a> In this the high priest is identified with his sons; even as Jesus says, "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=239:4></a> Thy word is truth"; set apart, as man in glory, as the model of what we ought to be in holiness; and again, "By the words of thy lips have I kept me from the paths of the destroyer.<a name=239:5></a>" And when speaking of the church the language is, He "gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of water by the word.<a name=239:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This being done, the high priest alone is clothed in his robes and anointed; he needed not blood to admit him into the service of God.<a name=239:7></a> He was the representative of One whom God could receive and own as "his servant, his elect, in whom his soul delighted.<a name=239:8></a>" Thus after His baptism we find the Spirit descends as a dove upon Jesus, and a voice comes from heaven, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<a name=239:9></a>" He needed no offering for Himself, but stood as the anointed of God without shedding of blood.<a name=239:10></a> Afterwards Aaron identifies himself with his sons, when sacrifices are brought to be offered for them: thus we see Jesus <i>in one person</i>, as it were, with us, entering the holy place by His own blood, that we might be made His fellows, that we might be qualified to worship with Him.<a name=239:11></a> This enabled Him to say, "I ascend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God and your God.<a name=239:12></a>" And afterwards we find that blessed association with the saints which made Him say, "In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.<a name=239:13></a>" He is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=239:14></a>

		In the case of the leper's cleansing (Leviticus 14) there is an analogy in the application of the blood of the sacrifice: only here it is consecration, there cleansing from sin; and further in the leper's case the application was individual, but here the whole church is presented.<a name=240:6></a> Aaron and his sons fin their hands with the offerings, and they are waved for a wave-offering before the Lord.<a name=240:7></a>

		Provision being made for such defilements of the people as allowed of it, we have the revelation of the general provision for the purification of the sanctuary which was in the midst of a people who defiled it, and for the atonement of the sins of the people themselves.<a name=249:1></a> In general, there are two great ideas; first, that the atonement was made, so that the relationship of the people of God was maintained notwithstanding their sins; and then, in the second place, in the difficulties which surrounded the entrance of Aaron into the holy place, there was the testimony (according to the Epistle to the Hebrews itself) that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest during that dispensation.<a name=249:2></a> It is important to examine this chapter under these two points of view.<a name=249:3></a> It stands alone.<a name=249:4></a> No mention is made anywhere else of what took place on that solemn day.<a name=249:5></a> The sacrifice of Christ, as redemption, was typified by the passover.<a name=249:6></a> It was here a question of drawing near unto God who revealed Himself on His throne, of cleansing defilements, of taking away the sins of those who would draw near, and of purifying their consciences.<a name=249:7></a> Now, while presenting to us in figure the means of doing this, it signified indeed that the thing was not done.<a name=249:8></a>

		As to the general idea of its efficacy, the high priest drew near personally, and filled the most holy place with incense; then he took some blood, which he put on the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat.<a name=249:9></a> Sins were atoned for according to the requirement of the majesty of the throne of God Himself, so that the full satisfaction made to His majesty rendered the throne of <i>justice</i> favourable, grace had free course, and the worshipper found the blood there before him when he drew near, and even as a testimony before the throne.<a name=249:10></a> Then the high priest cleansed the tabernacle, the altar, and all that was found there.<a name=249:11></a> Thus, in virtue of the sprinkling of His blood, Christ will reconcile all things, having made peace through the blood of His cross.<a name=249:12></a> There could be no guiltiness in the tabernacle, but God would cleanse away the defilements, that they might not appear before Him.<a name=249:13></a> In the third place, the high priest confessed the sins of the people over the scapegoat, which, sent off unto a land not inhabited, bore all the sins away from God never to be found again.<a name=249:14></a> It is here that the idea of substitution is presented most clearly.<a name=249:15></a>

		Therefore this devotedness of Jesus, the Son of God, to His glory, this submission, even unto death, that God might be maintained in the full glory of His rights, has given its outlet to the love of God -- freedom to its action; wherefore Jesus says, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished?<a name=251:1></a>" His heart, full of love, was driven back, in its personal manifestation, by the sin of man, who would it not; but through the atonement it could flow forth to the sinner in the accomplishment of God's grace and of His counsels unhindered, and Jesus Himself had, so to speak, rights upon that love -- a position we are brought into through grace, and which has none like it.<a name=251:2></a> "<i>Therefore</i> doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<a name=251:3></a>" We speak with reverence of such things, but it is good to speak of them; for the glory of our God, and of Him whom He hath sent, is found therein established and manifested.<a name=251:4></a> There is not one attribute, one trait of the divine character, which has not been manifested in all its perfection, and fully glorified in that which took place between God and Jesus Himself.<a name=251:5></a> That we have been saved and redeemed, and that our sins have been atoned for in that same sacrifice, according to the counsels of the grace of God, is, I presume to say it, precious and important as it is for us, the inferior part of that work, if anything whatever may be called inferior where everything is perfect; its object at least -- we sinners -- is inferior, if the work is equally perfect in every point of view.<a name=251:6></a> Having considered a little the grand principles, we may now examine the particular circumstances.<a name=251:7></a>

		There are two different ways of viewing the seven feasts.<a name=255:2></a> We may take the Sabbath day by itself, and then begin again, reckoning the Passover and unleavened bread as two feasts, or we may reckon the Sabbath day first, without separating those two.<a name=255:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of these feasts is the gathering of the people round Jehovah for some cause or other, a "holy convocation.<a name=255:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is the Sabbath; and it will be so when the true rest comes: God will have all His people round about Him.<a name=255:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then follows the Passover, with the unleavened bread, together but still distinct; that is, along with the sacrifice of Christ, you have sin taken away practically.<a name=255:6></a> Really, in verse 5, the Passover stands by itself.<a name=255:7></a> First there is a certain definite act, and then seasons.<a name=255:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Sabbath is the grand rest of all the people, but still it comes in as a holy convocation.<a name=255:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Passover is the lamb slain, and its body eaten.<a name=255:10></a> After this, next, we come to the first-fruits.<a name=255:11></a> It is not said exactly when this was to be: -- when the corn was ripe of course -- but on the morrow after the Sabbath it was to be waved.<a name=255:12></a> This is Christ's resurrection; and here notably is no sin-offering.<a name=255:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then they were to count fifty days, seven Sabbaths complete, and to offer a new meat-offering unto Jehovah, "two wave loaves baken with leaven"; for now we have, in fact, the church offered to God, but with leaven in the offering, so that it could not be burnt upon the altar for a sweet savour.<a name=255:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two loaves are an adequate witness, as I take it.<a name=255:15></a> The point here is the church; a witness which is presented, an offering to God with leaven, but then along with and because of this, one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.<a name=255:16></a> We find no such thing with the first-fruits which represented Christ, but here the leaven is met by the sin-offering.<a name=255:17></a> The selfsame day they proclaim a holy convocation.<a name=255:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 22 is a gracious provision: when they reaped their harvest, they were to leave the gleanings for the poor.<a name=255:19></a> It is the heavenly calling (but not properly the church), because there are others who are called.<a name=255:20></a> This is Daniel's heavenly calling, which does not form properly the loaves of God.<a name=255:21></a> There are others, those who are killed by the beast; and if God did not take them up to heaven, where would they be?<a name=255:22></a> So the Epistle to the Hebrews applies to Christians, but may run over to others also.<a name=255:23></a> These things were to be done in Israel, although we (Christians) get all the good of them.<a name=255:24></a>

		Pentecost happens in the space between the Passover and verse 24.<a name=256:1></a> For the blowing of the Trumpets we leap on to the seventh month, and then comes the first day of that holy month as the next appointed time.<a name=256:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First the Trumpets are blown and gather Israel; and then, on the tenth day of the same month, Israel enters into the day of Atonement.<a name=256:3></a> Not that <i>we</i> do not enter into it long before, but here it is for them.<a name=256:4></a> You have had the beginning of Israel again, so to speak, in the Trumpets and Atonement made, and then follows the feast of Tabernacles, from the fifteenth day of the month, seven days unto Jehovah.<a name=256:5></a> The first day is a holy convocation, and the eighth day a holy convocation, that is, an additional day.<a name=256:6></a> When the feast of Tabernacles on earth is come, we shall get the heavenly things too.<a name=256:7></a> It is a "solemn assembly" when God has a complete thing; that is an expression applied here only to the Tabernacles; it is once used in a peculiar manner of the Passover.<a name=256:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It comes after the harvest and after the vintage, that is, after God's separative judgment, and vengeance judgment or the treading the "winepress of the wrath of God.<a name=256:9></a>" Then they shall take boughs of goodly trees, and dwell in booths seven days, bearing witness that they had been strangers but now are fully back in the land.<a name=256:10></a> That is for Israel to do.<a name=256:11></a> We come in between the Passover and the day of Atonement.<a name=256:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Why should the leaven be introduced at Pentecost?<a name=256:13></a> Because we are there.<a name=256:14></a> There is all the value of Christ and of His sacrifice too; but account of evil in us is taken and provided for by a sin-offering.<a name=256:15></a> It is not so where He is typified.<a name=256:16></a>

		The tone and spirit of these things is given in verse 7: "and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, and thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents.<a name=256:18></a>" And he tells them the way in which they are to do it in detail, here calling it a "solemn assembly.<a name=256:19></a>" In verse 3 the unleavened bread is called "bread of affliction," holiness in affliction, when you come to it by the sacrifice of Christ; in 1 Corinthians 5 it is called the "unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name=256:20></a>" It takes the character of self-judgment, and sorrow before God, and therefore, in that state, I have no fellowship with others; so I turn in the morning and go to my tent.<a name=256:21></a> You find bitter herbs as well in Exodus 12.<a name=256:22></a>

		It is quite different when you come to Pentecost: "seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn, and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto Jehovah thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand.<a name=257:1></a>" Here I have the Holy Ghost and I am a free offerer and come up with my gift, and "according as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee" -- it is in the measure of my spirituality I can come with this offering; "and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow that is among you.<a name=257:2></a>" You must have grace going out to the poor and the needy, and then come with a freewill offering according as God hath blessed you.<a name=257:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The feast of Tabernacles goes farther, after "thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine, thou shalt rejoice in thy feast.<a name=257:4></a>" Son, daughter, manservant, maidservant, stranger, fatherless, and widow, seven days keep a solemn feast unto Jehovah their God; "because Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.<a name=257:5></a>" It is not now, rejoice "according to" the measure, but He will bless you in everything, and so you are to rejoice and all with you.<a name=257:6></a> In the booths they were to say they had been strangers in the wilderness, but now they have got all God's promises.<a name=257:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are in Pentecost, not merely on Passover ground; but we come when we have got in a certain sense into the land and "according as Jehovah hath blessed us"; and still in another sense we may say we are sitting in heavenly places in Christ, and so we can "surely rejoice.<a name=257:8></a>" It is joy all the week long -- seven days.<a name=257:9></a> It is real rejoicing all the time.<a name=257:10></a>

		Mark another thing connected with Pentecost which struck me; as long as we are here, "thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.<a name=257:11></a>" In Tabernacles I do not remember that I was a bondman in Egypt; but here I am obliged to be watchful and obey, and remember that I was a thorough slave of sin and of everything else.<a name=257:12></a> And you do not here see the Passover character: the holiness is not "bread of affliction" to me, nor am I eating "bitter herbs.<a name=257:13></a>" All that has its place and must be; I must enter in that way, and so I turn to go to my tent.<a name=257:14></a> I am a redeemed person (that is all holy and true), but I go off by myself to my tent.<a name=257:15></a> It recalls what I was saying about the difference of relationships -- between living in a place, and saying, Thank God, I have got in and am saved.<a name=257:16></a> I must keep the Passover, or I cannot keep Tabernacles, nor yet Pentecost; but I do not call holiness "bread of affliction" now.<a name=257:17></a>

		We might turn perhaps to chapter 26 for a little, though it be aside from the course of the Feasts.<a name=258:1></a> "And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it and dwellest therein" (there we are, in a certain sense, in spirit), "that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth which thou shalt bring of thy land, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to place his name there, and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and shalt say unto him, I profess this day unto Jehovah thy God, that I am come unto the country" -- here I am in heavenly places -- which Jehovah "sware unto our fathers for to give to us.<a name=258:2></a> And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt speak and say before Jehovah thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father" (not I am -- it was an old thing that was passed by and could not come back), "and he went down into Egypt, and was evil entreated, and Jehovah brought us forth, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey; and now behold I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O Jehovah, hast given me.<a name=258:3></a> And" -- when he has recognized Jehovah, he can go and enjoy all the rest -- "thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which Jehovah thy God hath given unto thee.<a name=258:4></a>"

		Then you have the character of holiness in it.<a name=258:5></a> "Thou shalt say before Jehovah thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless and to the widow, according to all thy commandments, which thou hast commanded me.<a name=258:6></a> I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them: I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead.<a name=258:7></a>" To eat in his mourning was profaning himself.<a name=258:8></a> And then follows not "bless me," but "bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us.<a name=258:9></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of the thing that was carried had a different effect in the display of its covering, according to the nature of what was covered.<a name=260:1></a> If I think of the ark, I shall have a certain character of display; if I think of the table, it will be another; and of the candlestick, another.<a name=260:2></a> When Israel set forth, the ark was first covered with the veil, that is, Christ Himself with the veil of His humanity; then came the badgers' skin, and, outside, the cloth of blue.<a name=260:3></a> This is the order: Christ's perfect humanity over the ark; then badgers' skins to protect it; and outside that, the cloth of blue.<a name=260:4></a> The heavenly man comes out, the special character.<a name=260:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The badgers' skin was inside in this case, because Christ kept His perfection absolutely free of all evil, and so the heavenly came out manifestly.<a name=260:6></a> In us it is morally to be realized in the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=260:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was of course no evil in Christ to come out, but as man here, the perfect One.<a name=260:8></a> He uses, for instance, the word to baffle Satan -- in that is the badgers' skin -- just as I ought to keep Satan off through grace.<a name=260:9></a> Thus we need the badgers' skin outside in going through the wilderness.<a name=260:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then came the table of shewbread, with a cloth of blue on it first, then the dishes, bread, etc.<a name=260:11></a>, all covered with a scarlet cloth, and badgers' skins outside; the table itself -- the gold or the divine part -- covered with the blue, the heavenly; then the cloth of scarlet covers the twelve loaves.<a name=260:12></a> Scarlet is royalty, and twelve is connected, we were seeing, with administration on earth.<a name=260:13></a> The badgers' skins are outside, because it is a display in a human instrument.<a name=260:14></a>

		Next the candlestick was to be covered entirely with a cloth of blue, then with badgers' skins, and put on a bar.<a name=260:17></a> Here there is no scarlet; because it was the manifestation of the Spirit, and there is no royalty or glory of man to come out in this.<a name=260:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the first was distinct in character.<a name=262:10></a> Before all the history of the transactions which brought in the rest, or preceded it, the great truth, that there was a rest that remained, was made prominent and conspicuous.<a name=262:11></a> It was the primary and characterizing truth.<a name=262:12></a> Between the three former and the three latter of the six remaining feasts, there is a large gap, a characteristic gap, so that the full course of the year to the seventh month goes on, before the trumpet is blown for the first of the latter three.<a name=262:13></a> This interval had no feast; and one only remark is made as to it, which may be noticed by-and-by.<a name=262:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A similar arrangement we find in the seven parables, in Matthew 13, the prophetic history of the kingdom of heaven, as this is of the earthly dealings in grace with Israel (in many things, we know, by adopting grace with us also): this, the history of what prepared the rest, preceded by the statement of the rest, God's rest, in type; that, of the effects and character of the work, preceded by the generic statement of the workman, and the manner of the reception and result of his labours in principle.<a name=262:15></a>

		The rest of God is that which distinguishes man from the brute, and from being as a brute with hopes and labour ending only here in that which perishes, to say even the best of it.<a name=263:1></a> The promise is left us, says the apostle to the Hebrews, of entering into God's rest.<a name=263:2></a> This is the portion of blessing and communion in which God, in the delight of His works of creation or redemption, refreshed Himself; and into which He introduces us in the riches of His grace, and by His work, into fellowship of delight and joy with Him, whether of heavenly communion or of earthly blessing.<a name=263:3></a> The rest of God is the great end and beginning of thought and desire into which the renewed creature is brought in fellowship now of hope.<a name=263:4></a> Here God and the creature are brought into unity or community of happiness, the creature (even we, by the Spirit) being capacitated for this communion.<a name=263:5></a> The creation also has blessing and rest.<a name=263:6></a> Faith, and patience, and conflict, are now involved in it, and hence the complex character of the believer's mind; for one is sure, is certain, and is his; the other present, and he toiling in it.<a name=263:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Sabbath then, even the seventh day, was the first great characteristic and repeated feast: the seventh day, because the rest was at the close of labour, and rest not known in the flesh, and under the law, until the end of labour; and the rest of the world and of the earth, creation -- rest, was after all the toil and labour that sin had introduced into it had ended and was passed away.<a name=263:8></a> This seventh day was God's creation-rest, and it remained when labour and toil came in to man, the pledge and type (as in the flesh, and having earthly things) of the rest that remained to the world and him.<a name=263:9></a>

		But the saints have nothing in the world; they are crucified to it.<a name=263:10></a> To them resurrection is the beginning, and, withal, the substance and end of their hope and life.<a name=263:11></a> The first day of the week, in which Jesus rose from the dead, is the living witness to them in joyful service (and remembrance of that through which it was purchased) of the rest that remained to them, which they have now in spirit, and go forth from that to toil yet awhile in the world in which they are conversant.<a name=263:12></a> It is not to them creation and earthly rest, but redemption, resurrection, and the hope of heavenly rest, and therefore enjoyed, not on the day of God's rest in creation, but of Jesus (beginning of blessing and glory as head of the church, "the firstborn from the dead") in resurrection, in which He rested, as to work to be done in redemption -- rested save as to everlasting blessing and service to His saints, in which they have joy and communion with Him as their Priest -- the leader of their praises, in which, as in living strength now in spirit, then in body also, they rest not.<a name=263:13></a> Thus in this double type the whole millennial rest is taken in, heavenly or resurrection, and earthly or rest for the flesh; of this, however (save in the great general principle), the earthly rest, creation-rest, is only told of here.<a name=263:14></a> Of this the law maintained the type, though it proved that man could not attain the rest under it; and therefore when the Lord was accused of breaking the sabbath, He replied, "My Father <i>worketh</i> hitherto, and I work," shewing the divine intervention (of the Father and the Son) in grace accomplishing that comfort which the law could not.<a name=263:15></a> do; in which man, in a word, impotently failed;.<a name=263:16></a> and therefore God, in sovereignty and in redemption-glory, as Father and Son, had now manifested Himself as having set Himself to work -- to do -- nor rested; for He was in grace where wretched man found no rest.<a name=263:17></a> Hitherto (for yet man was not delivered) they worked.<a name=263:18></a>

		The offerings recorded in the book of Leviticus (into the details of which, with the Lord's permission, we may enter on some other opportunity), were these: -- The burnt-offering, the meat-offering, the peace-offering, the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering, and in this order.<a name=266:7></a> The first two present Christ offering Himself spotless and perfect to God; the next, the communion of the worshipper in it, and with God by it; the two latter the necessity of the worshipper, as a sinner before God, borne for him by the victim vicariously substituted for him, and treated consequently as himself under and responsible for the sin thus taken upon it.<a name=266:8></a> These are very distinct things in their character, and all true of the death and offering of Jesus.<a name=266:9></a>

		The burnt-offering was the complete surrender of life.<a name=266:10></a>, on which all hung, and this not by virtue of imputed transgression, but His own offering of Himself; not an imposed necessity but of His own voluntary will, as in John 10: "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<a name=266:11></a> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.<a name=266:12></a> This commandment have I received of my Father.<a name=266:13></a>" Now the whole life of Jesus was on this principle; His death was the full accomplishment and exhibition of it -- proved all the rest, "<i>He gave himself for us</i>.<a name=266:14></a>" Of this, that is, His giving Himself, describing Him especially as the Son of God, the Gospel of John is the especial witness; I speak merely as refers to this subject.<a name=266:15></a> There is, besides the quoted passages, no garden of Gethsemane, but, "Arise, let us go hence.<a name=266:16></a>" "I am he," and "they went backward, and fell to the ground.<a name=266:17></a>" "If ye seek me, let these go their way; that the saying might be fulfilled which He spake, Of them which thou hast given me I have lost none;" even of them who all forsook Him and fled.<a name=266:18></a> There was no "My God!<a name=266:19></a> my God!<a name=266:20></a> why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=266:21></a>" not merely as in Luke 23: 46, "he expired," having said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit"; but having said, "It is finished," He bowed His head and "<i>delivered up</i> his spirit.<a name=266:22></a>"

		But connected with this, in the communicating energy by which it and all resulting<a href="#268:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> from it is enjoyed, is the gift of the Holy Ghost, answering to the gift of the law after the redemption from Egypt.<a name=268:11></a> Accordingly, on the morrow after the seventh sabbath, after the former offering of first-fruits (called hence the day of Pentecost), the associate feast was introduced, a new meat-offering was to be offered, the feast of first-fruits.<a name=268:12></a> Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals, they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, they are the first-fruits unto Jehovah.<a name=268:13></a>" These, it is to be remarked, were to be baken with leaven.<a name=268:14></a> The force of this in such case may be seen (1 Corinthians 5: 8).<a name=268:15></a> The leaven mixed with the cakes of first-fruits is spoken of also in the direction as to the meat-offering (Leviticus 2).<a name=268:16></a> "No meat-offering which ye shall bring unto Jehovah shall be made with leaven, for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of Jehovah made by fire.<a name=268:17></a>" As for the oblation of the first-fruits, "Ye shall offer them unto Jehovah, but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.<a name=268:18></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#268:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I say all resulting from it, because, though not brought out in the type as not entering into the heavenlies, in fact (and we know it) the ascension of Christ was necessary to the conference of the gift to the church, letting in the Gentiles, constituting the ground of its knowledge of righteousness (John 16: 10), the character of its life (Col 1: 27; Philippians 3: 20), and the place of its fellowship (Ephesians 2: 6, and indeed the whole of the epistle). And I say "necessary," both from its revelation of the mystery, as stated in the passages, and from the Lord's word in John 20: 17, rejecting the acknowledgment of Him in worship by the Jew, as seen in resurrection, until the accomplishment of His glory in ascension -- the heavens receiving Him till the times of the restitution of all things; and *therefore* Peter, in preaching upon the gift of the Holy Ghost here typified, says, "He being by the right hand of God exalted, has shed forth this which ye see and hear." But these feasts, being in themselves expressions of what took effect upon earth as being to the Jews, though Gentiles might be brought in, do not enter thus within the veil, though the waving before Jehovah expresses the presenting to Him in a general sense.

		There was, however, another remarkable circumstance in the feast of Tabernacles -- there was an eighth day, or, as we should say, a first day of the week, which was not the case with the other feasts.<a name=273:1></a> This is noticed, after the regular history of the feasts which we have been tracing, in verse 39; again, and in connection with another feature, that it was after the gathering in the fruit of the land.<a name=273:2></a> All born Israelites, moreover, we are told in this second notice of it, were to dwell in booths, in witness that they had been made to dwell as pilgrims in booths under Jehovah shadow, as it were in a houseless, homeless wilderness.<a name=273:3></a> It was the feast of ingathering.<a name=273:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But then as to each, out of his belly would be rivers of living water; his own soul, through the Holy Ghost dwelling in him, would be the channel of boundless refreshment; each one that once thirsted would be the source of refreshment to others.<a name=273:15></a> It was not merely he was born of the Spirit; it was not merely that it dwelt in him, as a well springing up in him unto everlasting life; but it should be from his soul as rivers flowing forth of spiritual heavenly things, all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=273:16></a> "Out of his belly," because it was not merely as to the believer a conferred gift, the lowest way in which it would be present -- for Jesus might still say, "I never knew you," -- but from the planting and reforming the affections of his soul, capacitating them, through the energy of the Spirit, for the communicative possession and enjoyment, as well as statement, of all these heavenly joys, which should be accomplished when, in the great eighth day of the feast, Jesus, long hidden and doing things secretly, should shew Himself to the world.<a name=273:17></a>

		Beloved, do our hearts indeed say "We are on our way to God"?<a name=276:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do we believe that, with the innumerable throng of the redeemed, we shall soon sing the everlasting anthem of praise to the Lamb?<a name=276:2></a> It is astonishing the simplicity of heart there is when we believe that "we are on our way to God.<a name=276:3></a>" Whenever the soul has really got hold of this, believing in God, knowing His love, that He has brought us out of Egypt, and that we are on our way to Canaan, there is a spring of heart that surmounts everything.<a name=276:4></a> There may be a great many things by the way to exercise our hearts and thoughts; but if this feeling predominates, they only come in by the way.<a name=276:5></a> If my mind be fixed on present circumstances and present difficulties, and on God's helping me in them, there will not at all be the same spring of joy.<a name=276:6></a> For then I make God to be simply the servant of my necessities.<a name=276:7></a> The heart rests and centres there, and God sinks down into a mere help in time of trouble.<a name=276:8></a> It is quite true that "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in time of trouble" (Psalm 46: 1); but to bring Him down to be only this changes the whole aspect of things.<a name=276:9></a> Himself, as our portion, is infallibly ours.<a name=276:10></a> If our hearts are fixed on being with Jesus in His rest and glory, on being in the "Father's house," our own present difficulties have the character of difficulties by the way; we can then rise over trouble, however felt.<a name=276:11></a> And our thoughts about God are not merely that He will help us in the circumstances in which we are -- our hearts being fixed on Him, we live in the freedom that arises from the constant certainty that all that is Christ's is ours.<a name=276:12></a> It is important for us to have our minds fixed on the hope of glory which is set before us.<a name=276:13></a>

		One form which unbelief takes is the not having this hope fresh on the mind.<a name=276:14></a> Supposing I had to live twenty years, the next thing to my heart ought to be the glory.<a name=276:15></a> In the children of Israel unbelief took many forms; one character of it was that "they despised the pleasant land," chapter 14: 31; Psalm 106: 24.<a name=276:16></a> Now very often there is in our hearts practically, though not wilfully, the despising of the pleasant land.<a name=276:17></a> I am not speaking of any doubtfulness as to the land being ours.<a name=276:18></a> If there were something that a friend had given me as a great treasure, and I was sure of its being mine, and yet I looked at it but seldom and cared to think of it but seldom, this would be a proof (not of uncertainty respecting its being mine, but) that I despised the thing, that I had no real value for it.<a name=276:19></a> This is very often the way we treat the heavenly glory that belongs to us.<a name=276:20></a> We do not question the truth of the promises; but, when our souls are not dwelling upon and delighting in the glory that is set before us, there is a "despising of the pleasant land.<a name=276:21></a>" It is too much the case with the saints.<a name=276:22></a> And no occupation with present things -- with present duties even -- can make up for the loss of peace and comfort there is to the soul from not dwelling on the things which God has laid up in store for them that love Him (1 Corinthians 2: 9) as its own things.<a name=276:23></a> Instead of God's being the strength and fulness of our present joy in the midst of present tribulation, as it is said, "We joy in God" (Romans 5: 11), we only make Him a help in time of trouble.<a name=276:24></a> There is weakness and infirmity instead of rejoicing in God.<a name=276:25></a> The heart being brought down here and kept down, it brings down God after it (so gracious is He, that He will even come down), instead of rising above present circumstances up to God.<a name=276:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing also to notice.<a name=280:9></a> When the children of Israel will not go up in faith into the promised land, Jehovah sends them a long way round the desert.<a name=280:10></a> Two things accompany this: one as the result of it, the other pure grace.<a name=280:11></a> If they have to march round the desert, Jehovah cannot leave them alone; He must go round with them, guiding them by His pillar of fire and of cloud all the way.<a name=280:12></a> His grace abounds over sin.<a name=280:13></a> Secondly, Caleb and Joshua must go the long way round too.<a name=280:14></a> They had not gone with the people in their evil; but as to the pain and trial of the march which the unbelief of the others had caused, they are obliged to go along with the people, and to bear a part of it.<a name=280:15></a> This is what we must make up our minds to.<a name=280:16></a> If the church has failed, we must make up our minds to accompany it in its course of sorrow, though not in its course of sin.<a name=280:17></a> As far as Caleb and Joshua were concerned, there was the exercise of grace, and patience, and love.<a name=280:18></a> It was blessed to them, for God was faithful in keeping them, whilst the rest fell in the wilderness.<a name=280:19></a> Caleb is able to say, at the end of the forty years, that he is as strong for war as at the beginning, "both to go out, and to come in," Joshua 14.<a name=280:20></a> But the faithful, though they had the consciousness that God was with them, were obliged to accompany the unfaithful in their course of sorrow, arising from the position into which they had brought themselves,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is our place.<a name=280:21></a> In the spirit of love, of patience, and of humiliation, we have always to take the place of those who have sinned.<a name=280:22></a> See Daniel.<a name=280:23></a> Though himself personally righteous Daniel confesses the people's sin as his own, saying, "O Lord .<a name=280:24></a>.<a name=280:25></a>.<a name=280:26></a> we have sinned, and have committed iniquity .<a name=280:27></a>.<a name=280:28></a>.<a name=280:29></a> to us belongeth confusion of face," etc.<a name=280:30></a> (Daniel 9).<a name=280:31></a> The sin and evil of those who have sinned should be confessed by the remnant; who, though not partakers of the sin, must yet be partakers of the consequences of it, suffering in all the affliction with true sympathy and fellowship.<a name=280:32></a>

		In applying this practically to ourselves, what was it that led to the very need of their having Jehovah with them on the march?<a name=281:1></a> The soul not being set on (their not having their affections occupied with) the blessings of the promised land.<a name=281:2></a> And that which we have to seek is that our souls may "abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=281:3></a>" The Holy Ghost dwelling in us becomes the earnest of those better things in our hearts; and reveals to us that it is Jehovah's land, the land which He has given us, that He is bringing us into.<a name=281:4></a> If we are able to say, This is the fruit of the land which Jehovah has given us, -- if our hearts affections are dwelling on the land, all the strength of the Anakim is as nothing.<a name=281:5></a> No matter, then, as to preventing us from getting there, what may be the trial and difficulty by the way.<a name=281:6></a> But the moment we lose the consciousness of what is ours, the moment we forget that Jehovah has given us the land, difficulties and trials occupy our mind, and become too great for us; we fall under the power of them.<a name=281:7></a> This results from our losing sight of what belongs to us in hope.<a name=281:8></a> We cannot have our hearts fixed on Canaan without being conscious that Jehovah's strength is with us.<a name=281:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter comes in in a very peculiar manner.<a name=283:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The children of Israel had despised the pleasant land they had quarrelled with the manna, the food given to them by God (chapter 11); they had slighted the promises of God concerning the good land, though an earnest was brought to them by the spies (chapters 13, 14); and in chapter 16 we find them in open rebellion and apostasy, failing away in the gainsaying of Korah.<a name=283:2></a> This was not merely failure, which brought on chastisement, but open rebellion, and God cut them off in their sins.<a name=283:3></a> It is between these two things this fifteenth chapter comes in.<a name=283:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Numbers is the putting God's people in their place and the order of their journeys.<a name=283:5></a> They had departed from the mount of Jehovah a three days' journey (chapter 10: 33).<a name=283:6></a> This was the first time of their starting, and then we find Jehovah goes out of His place in grace.<a name=283:7></a> The people ought to have been round about, taking care of Jehovah, but "the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them.<a name=283:8></a>" Moses wished Hobab to be to them instead of eyes"; but God says, I will be as eyes to you and "the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting-place for them.<a name=283:9></a>" In this we see the actings of extraordinary grace.<a name=283:10></a> "It came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee.<a name=283:11></a> And when it rested he said, Return, O Jehovah, unto the many thousands of Israel.<a name=283:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next step, as we see in chapter 11, is the working of unbelief.<a name=283:13></a> While God is going before them the people complain; and then come out all the various forms and progress of unbelief.<a name=283:14></a> In chapter 14 we see they had to wander in the wilderness forty years.<a name=283:15></a> Chapter 15 gives what they were to do in the land; and chapter 16 the open rebellion and apostasy closing in the forms of unbelief.<a name=283:16></a> But before this apostate character is developed, chapter 15 comes in, full of loveliness.<a name=283:17></a> Rebellion had arisen to a great height, for not only had they despised the pleasant land, but the spies had brought up an evil report of the land.<a name=283:18></a> Caleb and Joshua proved their faithfulness in remonstrating with the people, telling them that Jehovah could bring them in, when this awful rebellion broke out, and "all the congregation bade stone them with stones.<a name=283:19></a>" Then, consequently, "the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.<a name=283:20></a>" God interfered immediately, and tells Moses, "I will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.<a name=283:21></a>" Then Moses interferes, and here we see the devotedness of his character coming out in intercession.<a name=283:22></a> And then God says, "I have pardoned according to thy word," but yet I will chastise them; and to the people He says, "as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you," You shall get the thing your wretched flesh desired, for you shall die in this wilderness (chapter 14: 28, 29).<a name=283:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Putting these two chapters together, we see the grace of God in priestly government, to bring His redeemed through the wilderness, and also the contrast between law and priestly grace.<a name=288:1></a>

		This grace is drawn out by Israel's sin; but grace does not, of course, allow sin.<a name=288:2></a> Law could not bring the people into the land.<a name=288:3></a> Law must have kept the whole nation out, except Joshua and Caleb, who followed the Lord fully.<a name=288:4></a> We see its actings in chapter 16, in the judgment that fell on Korah and his company.<a name=288:5></a> If when redeemed, we were put under the law, we should be no better off than before.<a name=288:6></a> Still, God cannot allow sin.<a name=288:7></a> Neither could He give the people up; for had He not redeemed them?<a name=288:8></a> as Moses pleaded with Him (Numbers 14: 13-16), "And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians shall hear it (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them), and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land .<a name=288:9></a>.<a name=288:10></a>.<a name=288:11></a> saying, Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.<a name=288:12></a>" He cannot give them up; He cannot allow sin; and therefore He brings in priestly grace to meet the difficulty.<a name=288:13></a> To take away their murmurings, He does not use the rod of Moses, but that of Aaron.<a name=288:14></a> The rod of Moses could only judge them for their sin, and thus take away their murmurings by <i>judgment</i>.<a name=288:15></a> But Aaron's does it by priestly grace.<a name=288:16></a>

		God makes it very manifest by whom He will act.<a name=288:17></a> Aaron's rod is chosen out of the twelve, and the remarkable sign of its blossoming and yielding fruit, shewed that priesthood was connected with life-giving power, as well as with intercession.<a name=288:18></a> Both are needed to uphold them, and to raise them when failing.<a name=288:19></a> "The second Adam was made a quickening spirit.<a name=288:20></a>" This is the care and authority by which we are led through the wilderness.<a name=288:21></a> God will allow no other, and no other would do.<a name=288:22></a> The priesthood of Christ alone can carry us through.<a name=288:23></a> It is the rod of authority too: for "Christ is a son over his own house.<a name=288:24></a>" But we see that unbelief cannot avail itself of this (chapter 17: 12, 13).<a name=288:25></a> "And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.<a name=288:26></a> Whosoever cometh anything near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?<a name=288:27></a>" God had shewn them that there was this grace, and they ought to have trusted in it, especially as they had seen the power in Aaron's remaining in among the congregation, and staying the plague.<a name=288:28></a> They had ground for full assurance; but unbelief prevailed.<a name=288:29></a> They were insensible to the value of the priesthood, and their conscience was still under law.<a name=288:30></a> For they did not know God, though at the very moment He was acting for them in priestly grace.<a name=288:31></a>

		No one is led into the place of weeping without getting <i>some</i> joy.<a name=304:1></a> Israel were already God's people: He leads them into the wilderness to humble them; He makes them hunger that He may give them manna; He leads them into trial that He may give them something better.<a name=304:2></a> Some would say, If in the midst of the leeks, onions, and flesh-pots of Egypt God had given them the manna, they would have rejected all other things because the manna was better; but it is not so.<a name=304:3></a> While the flesh is surrounded by that which suits it, it is fed thereby, and will reject the better things.<a name=304:4></a> Day by day, hour by hour, God is leading us to that condition of hunger that He may give us something better, something not discernible by the natural mind, but satisfying.<a name=304:5></a> When I have tasted the manna, there is a <i>reality</i> about it; it is not faith any longer.<a name=304:6></a> If I am hungry in the wilderness and am fed and braced up by the food, do I not know it?<a name=304:7></a> Can power come into my veins and I not know it?<a name=304:8></a> It might be a matter of faith that we are to have the manna to-morrow; but it was a matter of feeling and reality that they had eaten it today.<a name=304:9></a> As we eat and are strengthened, let us say, I <i>know</i> that man doth not live by bread alone.<a name=304:10></a> We feed on Jesus the living bread, the gift of the Father, and we may say that we are miraculously fed from heaven every day by supernatural food, that we might know that man doth not live by bread alone, but by 'every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<a name=304:11></a>'

		JOSHUA 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Book of Joshua we read the history of the taking possession of the land of Canaan, so far as that was carried out; as in the Book of Numbers we follow the same people in their toilsome journey through the wilderness: a journey more toilsome through their own unbelief, but in which a faithful and compassionate God accompanied them all the way, and led them, though by a path of chastening, when they would not go up at once by the path of faith.<a name=310:1></a> Their clothes waxed not old, nor did their feet swell, those forty years.<a name=310:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Both these parts of their history, remark, were after their redemption out of Egypt.<a name=310:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would trace just now the principles on which the path and service of faith, as represented by the history of Joshua, can be securely and successfully trod.<a name=310:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let my reader remark -- what perhaps he has never noticed -- that the conflicts which are recorded in the Book of Joshua are not only after redemption out of Egypt but after crossing the Jordan.<a name=310:5></a> Now Jordan is generally taken for a figure of <i>death</i>, and Canaan of <i>heaven</i>; and I do not doubt justly.<a name=310:6></a> But how comes it that all is fighting after it, and that the man who appears to Joshua comes as captain of Jehovah's host?<a name=310:7></a> <i>War</i> characterizes Israel's state after entering into Canaan; their <i>journey</i> but through the wilderness.<a name=310:8></a> This remarkable feature in the history of those events, which "happened unto them for ensamples [types], and are written for our admonition on whom the ends of the world are [to] come," calls us to enquire what the connection of these events is, and how the passage through death and entrance into heaven leads to a state of conflict and war.<a name=310:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The New Testament makes very plain what is the solution of this apparent difficulty.<a name=310:10></a> It teaches not only that Christ is dead and risen again for us, but that we have, in God's sight as united to Him by the Spirit, died and risen with Him.<a name=310:11></a> "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God," Colossians 3: 3.<a name=310:12></a> He hath quickened us together with Christ, and raised us up together, Ephesians 2.<a name=310:13></a> Thus the Christian himself is viewed as having himself passed through death and being risen again, because Christ who is his life has.<a name=310:14></a> "If ye be dead with Christ," says Paul (Colossians 2).<a name=310:15></a> "If ye then be risen with Christ," Colossians 3.<a name=310:16></a> In this sense we are viewed as having passed through Jordan.<a name=310:17></a> We have died, and are risen, and are entered into the heavenly places.<a name=310:18></a> Hence we have our conflicts there; for the Canaanite and the Perizzite are yet in the land.<a name=310:19></a> So Paul says, "We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with principalities, with powers, with spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.<a name=310:20></a>" He is here referring to Joshua and Israel, who had to contend with flesh and blood -- we with spiritual enemies.<a name=310:21></a> Thus the Christian is looked at as having died and risen in Christ, and called upon to possess the land -- to realize the blessings given by the power of the Holy Ghost, whether apprehending and enjoying the unsearchable riches of Christ, or rescuing from the power of Satan those who are led captive by him.<a name=310:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I turn to the practical principles I have referred to, let me draw my reader's attention to the effect of having thus passed the Jordan.<a name=311:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, there is, and thus only, the death of the flesh, entire death to the world.<a name=311:2></a> Israel was not circumcised in the wilderness: <i>Israel was</i> now circumcised, and the reproach of Egypt rolled away.<a name=311:3></a> To this, as the place of self-judgment, Israel returned after all their victories.<a name=311:4></a> But there was another point: they ate of the old corn of the land, and the manna ceased.<a name=311:5></a> The manna is Christ as come down and humbled -- Christ for the need of the wilderness.<a name=311:6></a> The old corn belongs to the heavenly land -- Christ in His heavenly glory.<a name=311:7></a> This is all ours before any combat -- before a wall has fallen or an enemy is conquered.<a name=311:8></a> We possess all the heavenly blessing by a divine title.<a name=311:9></a> Then, "the man with the drawn sword" -- Christ in spirit -- comes to lead us to conflict, but to victory if we walk under His leading.<a name=311:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads us to the principles on which victory is to be obtained in the conflict in which we are engaged.<a name=311:11></a> All is promised from the river Euphrates to the great sea.<a name=311:12></a> But then comes the question of taking possession.<a name=311:13></a> We must actively take possession of it to enjoy it.<a name=311:14></a> "Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.<a name=311:15></a>" Nothing can be simpler.<a name=311:16></a> You have only to take possession.<a name=311:17></a> But this you must do.<a name=311:18></a> So with us.<a name=311:19></a> Large possessions are before us.<a name=311:20></a> All the unsearchable riches of Christ are ours.<a name=311:21></a> But there must be the diligent occupation of the heart with these things in order to possess them.<a name=311:22></a> Let the reader be assured that there is a large and rich field before him, all that God has given him in Christ to delight in; and he has received the divine nature (for I speak of saints) to delight in these things.<a name=311:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=312>[Page 312]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here conflict comes in, because these spiritual enemies would hinder us from realizing, in a pure and undistracted heart, what Jesus calls <i>our own things</i>; as the things of this world he calls <i>another's</i>.<a name=312:1></a> But these conflicts, though useful for exercise and the experience of God's faithfulness, are no hindrance to our taking possession; but, while testing our own state, only shew how God is with us.<a name=312:2></a> Were the failing of the walls of Jericho and the victories of Joshua a hindrance No.<a name=312:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Holiness and looking to God, in a word, separation of heart to God, are required when the captain of Jehovah's host came up to meet Joshua.<a name=312:4></a> He was to take his shoes off as much as Moses before God in "the bush.<a name=312:5></a>" The Lord in our midst for conflicts is as holy in nature as the Lord in redemption.<a name=312:6></a> Hence, as is known, when there was an Achan in the camp God would not go out with them.<a name=312:7></a> But, when there is uprightness of heart, the word is this: "There shall not a man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life.<a name=312:8></a>" What a comfort and strength is this!<a name=312:9></a> No difficulty in anything.<a name=312:10></a> "If God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=312:11></a>" I cannot think of, or meet with, a difficulty which for a moment stops my course.<a name=312:12></a> I have to be careful for <i>nothing</i>, and, making my requests known to God, in the midst of conflict, <i>God's</i> peace keeps my heart.<a name=312:13></a> And this never fails.<a name=312:14></a> "I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.<a name=312:15></a>" Not only God does not forsake us, but He does not fail us in the strength, grace, wisdom, needed so as to give firmness and power.<a name=312:16></a> In nothing does He fail us.<a name=312:17></a> He is always with us, and with us for, and in, the conflict.<a name=312:18></a> The Lord will make war with Amalek; but it is in Israel, but <i>God's</i> war.<a name=312:19></a> Thus divine strength and power with us, in faithful goodness, is the first and blessed groundwork for our hearts in the conflict.<a name=312:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It leads to another principle: confiding faith, courage.<a name=312:21></a> Be strong and of good courage.<a name=312:22></a>" God calls us to confidence and strength of heart in His strength, for we shall succeed in the work He has given us.<a name=312:23></a> This too is blessing.<a name=312:24></a> Take courage, for you shall do the work.<a name=312:25></a> Why not, if the work be His and He be with us?<a name=312:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this has a special bearing worthy of all note.<a name=312:27></a> You shall divide the land -- "only be thou strong and very courageous no drawing back, no being terrified, shrinking before the power of the enemy.<a name=312:28></a> "In nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.<a name=312:29></a>" Satan is there, but if there we have a free courage, God is there, witness of ruin to Satan's instruments, of sure salvation to those who have God with them.<a name=312:30></a> There is no question (if we are grasshoppers, and our enemies giants, and the walls up to heaven), if <i>God</i> be there.<a name=312:31></a> Of what consequence was the height of a wall, if it fell at the blast of a ram's horn?<a name=312:32></a> What matter that the sea is rough, if Christ is there to make us walk on it?<a name=312:33></a> What good its being smooth, if He be not?<a name=312:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=313>[Page 313]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now mark what courage is shewn in, "Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do all that my servant Moses commanded thee!<a name=313:1></a>" We need courage to obey.<a name=313:2></a> It seems folly.<a name=313:3></a> The world is against us.<a name=313:4></a> There seems no sense, often, in the prescriptions of the word of God.<a name=313:5></a> Our own fleshly ease is interested in not being so particular.<a name=313:6></a> The path is different from all the world.<a name=313:7></a> It supposes a living God, who acts and notices all things, to whom we belong and whose will is everything to us.<a name=313:8></a> Of this the world knows nothing, To do God's will and simply obey His word requires courage in the face of the world, courage with our own hearts.<a name=313:9></a> To this we are called.<a name=313:10></a> "Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do all that Jehovah has commanded us.<a name=313:11></a>" It is the courage of faith which looks to God.<a name=313:12></a> This is the way of prospering in the conflict.<a name=313:13></a> God's strength is employed in helping us in the path of God's will, not out of it.<a name=313:14></a> Then no matter where we go, what the difficulties, how long the journey seems, He makes our way prosperous: Whithersoever thou goest.<a name=313:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads to another and natural consequence, but one of great importance, because it not only informs us of the will of God, but keeps us in His presence, and familiar with the ideas, thoughts, ways, hopes, the whole manner of our God.<a name=313:16></a> "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do all that is written therein, for thus shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou have good success.<a name=313:17></a>" Compare Psalm 1.<a name=313:18></a> This meditation on God's word, of course, makes us know His will.<a name=313:19></a> But it does a great deal more.<a name=313:20></a> It gives the habitual delight of the heart to be in what God reveals, in what He delights in.<a name=313:21></a> We acquire His (that is, the true but divine) way of thinking of things; not the side of the vain show of this world.<a name=313:22></a> Our own hearts are formed by and in this divine and blessed apprehension of things.<a name=313:23></a> Oh what a light it is, and how does the vanity of this world appear what it is!<a name=313:24></a> "Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.<a name=313:25></a>" "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=313:26></a>" Besides, the soul is kept subject to God in meditating on His word: an immense point morally.<a name=313:27></a> Nor is this all.<a name=313:28></a> It secures the communications of His grace.<a name=313:29></a> "I have called you friends, for whatsoever I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<a name=313:30></a>" Owning the word of God is owning God in this world as He has spoken.<a name=313:31></a> But I must pass on.<a name=313:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=314>[Page 314]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next ground Jehovah gives is, "Have not I commanded thee?<a name=314:1></a>" Nothing gives greater confidence than this.<a name=314:2></a> "We ought to obey God," says Peter.<a name=314:3></a> If I am even going right, but do not surely know that I am doing God's will, the least difficulty casts all into doubt, and all my courage is destroyed.<a name=314:4></a> When I know that I am doing God's will, difficulties are no matter, I meet them on the road.<a name=314:5></a> But for obedience to God's will, God's power is there; and the heart, knowing that it is doing God's will, has no distrust.<a name=314:6></a> Uprightness would fear if it might be self, but uprightness fears nothing, hesitates in nothing, when it knows it is doing God's will.<a name=314:7></a> It can appeal to any one if <i>that</i> ought not to be done.<a name=314:8></a> "Have not I commanded thee; be strong and of a good courage.<a name=314:9></a>" And then we have therewith the positive assurance, "Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.<a name=314:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A further principle is brought out in the case of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.<a name=314:11></a> It is given to us in these divine wars to combat for others.<a name=314:12></a> This is an immense privilege.<a name=314:13></a> I have to combat to possess more and more of the unsearchable riches of Christ, to realize more of His life and of the knowledge of Him, to have the vineyards as well as the oliveyards of Canaan, and the old corn of the land; in a word, to possess what is given me in Christ.<a name=314:14></a> But it is given to us to combat in every way for God's people also.<a name=314:15></a> Paul (2 Corinthians 1: 11) was dependent on the poor praying saints, it might be on some poor bed -- ridden widow, for the gifts by which he carried on his active warfare in the Lord's field.<a name=314:16></a> He himself was labouring unceasingly, both in prayer and the ministry of the word, to put God's people in possession of their privileges.<a name=314:17></a> This is an immense privilege.<a name=314:18></a> Not only are we saved, blessed, made partakers of glory, joy in God; but God is pleased to make us partners, co-workers under Him in His own divine privilege of love and blessing.<a name=314:19></a> This is grace indeed!<a name=314:20></a> Surely we must know it, as its objects, to witness it; but God's love in us flows forth in love to make it known to others.<a name=314:21></a>

		Note another thing.<a name=315:1></a> If we are doing God's will and work we may reckon on Him for all that is dear to us, and in which we are interested.<a name=315:2></a> We could not keep it without God were present.<a name=315:3></a> He can keep it without us if we are doing His will and service in love.<a name=315:4></a> The two and a half tribes could leave their little ones and all that they had behind, to go armed to the war to help their brethren.<a name=315:5></a> No doubt, no fear, no hesitation!<a name=315:6></a> Such is the path of faith.<a name=315:7></a> It counts on God in the path of obedience to His known will.<a name=315:8></a> He has divine wisdom for every step, and divine power.<a name=315:9></a> Both are in Christ.<a name=315:10></a> We cannot know wisdom perfectly, nor see the end or the bearing of many things; but He who gave us the word did, and we are guided in the word according to that perfect knowledge.<a name=315:11></a>

		CHRIST AS OUR FOOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joshua 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Would say a word as to the way in which Christ may be considered as our food.<a name=316:1></a> He may be looked at as the food of the Christian in three ways.<a name=316:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, as a redeemed sinner; secondly, in connection with sitting in heavenly places in Christ; and thirdly, as a pilgrim and stranger down here.<a name=316:3></a> But this last is merely accessory and not the proper portion of the Christian.<a name=316:4></a> The Lord said to Israel that He had come down to deliver them from Egypt and bring them into the land of Canaan.<a name=316:5></a> He did not say a word about the wilderness when He came to deliver them from Egypt, because His interference for them there was in the power of redemption and for the accomplishment of His promises.<a name=316:6></a> However, there was the wilderness as well as redemption from Egypt and the entrance into Canaan; and Christ answers as our food to these three things.<a name=316:7></a> Two of them are permanent; for we are nourished by Christ in two ways permanently, that is, in redemption and glory.<a name=316:8></a> The third way is as the manna which we have all along the road.<a name=316:9></a> It is in these three ways that Christ meets His people and nourishes them all the way.<a name=316:10></a> Two of them remain, as we have seen, but the third ceases when the circumstances it was to meet have passed away.<a name=316:11></a> They did eat the passover and the manna until they got into the land, then the manna ceased; but they continued to eat of the passover.<a name=316:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are two ways in which it is proper for us ever to be feeding on Christ.<a name=316:13></a> First, as the passover, for they ate the paschal lamb when the wilderness had ceased and Egypt had been long left behind.<a name=316:14></a> When in Egypt the blood was on the lintel and the door-posts, and the Israelite ate of the lamb inside the house.<a name=316:15></a> The thought they had while they were eating it was, that God was going through the land as an avenging judge; and the effect of the blood on the doorposts was to keep God out, which was a great thing to do, for if brought into God's presence as a judge, woe be to him in whom sin is found.<a name=316:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The state of the one that now eats of Christ is just according as he estimates the value of the cross, through fear of what sin actually merits.<a name=316:17></a> When we have got into the effect of the blood of the paschal lamb, we have got into Canaan, and enjoy the peace of the land as a delivered people, having crossed the Jordan -- not only the Red Sea.<a name=316:18></a> That is, we have passed through death and resurrection; not as knowing Christ dead and risen for us merely, as presented in the Red Sea, but as being dead with Him and entered into heavenly places with Him, as in Jordan.<a name=316:19></a> Then the character of God is known as <i>their God</i>, that is, the accomplisher of all that which He purposed towards them.<a name=316:20></a> It is not keeping God out now, but it is enjoying His love; not looking at God as in the cross pouring out wrath in judgment against sin.<a name=316:21></a> In Jesus on the cross there was perfect justice and perfect love.<a name=316:22></a> What devotedness to the Father, and what tender love to us!<a name=316:23></a> And this is the way the saint who is in peace feeds on the cross.<a name=316:24></a> It is not feeding on it as knowing that he is safe; for Israel's keeping the passover after they got into Canaan was very different from their keeping it when judgment was passing over.<a name=316:25></a> In Canaan they were in peace, and they were able to glorify God in this way, in the remembrance of their redemption from Egypt.<a name=316:26></a>

		<a name=317>[Page 317]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this type we see presented, not the sinner that feels he is safe, but the saint that can glorify God in his affections; his heart confidently flowing out to Him, and feeding on Christ as the old corn of the land -- the last Adam, the Lord from heaven.<a name=317:1></a> We see Christ now by faith at the right hand of God as the glorified man, not merely as Son of God, but as Son of man; as Stephen, when the heavens were opened to him, beheld <i>Jesus</i> at the right hand of God.<a name=317:2></a> We also see Him up there.<a name=317:3></a> We do not see Him as He is represented in the Revelation, seated on a white horse, coming forth out of heaven.<a name=317:4></a> He will indeed come forth and receive us up where He is, and we shall be like Him and be for ever with Him.<a name=317:5></a> But we shall feed on Him as the old corn of the land when we are there, and this is our proper portion now: manna is not our portion, though it is our provision by the way.<a name=317:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joshua sees Jehovah as the Captain of Jehovah's host, and Israel feeds in the land before they fight.<a name=317:7></a> And our portion is to sit down in it before we fight, because God has given it to us, They do not eat the manna in Canaan, because it is for the wilderness.<a name=317:8></a> The manna is not Christ in the heavens!<a name=317:9></a> it is Christ down here.<a name=317:10></a> It is not our portion; our portion is the old corn of the land.<a name=317:11></a> That is, the whole thing, according to God's counsels, is redemption and glory.<a name=317:12></a> But all our life is exercise down here, or sin (excepting that God does give us moments of joy), because, while here, there is nothing but what acts on the flesh, or gives occasion for service to God.<a name=317:13></a> We may fail, and then Christ comes and feeds us with manna, that is, His sympathy with us down here, and shews how His grace is applied to all the circumstances of our daily life: and that is a happy thing.<a name=317:14></a> For most of our time, the far greater part of our life, we are occupied in these things, necessary and lawful things no doubt, but not occupied with heavenly joy in Christ.<a name=317:15></a> And these things are apt to turn away the heart from the Lord and hinder our joy.<a name=317:16></a> But if we would have our appetites feed on Him as the old corn of the land, we must have the habit of feeding on Him as the manna.<a name=317:17></a>

		In Ephesians 4, 5, we see that we are conformed to what we know.<a name=329:14></a> Here is the reasoning of the apostle: you have known what God is in pardon, in love, and in glory; if you have laid hold of that, it is well, but you ought to reproduce it in your conduct.<a name=329:15></a> What is spiritually received in the heart does reproduce itself.<a name=329:16></a> Therefore it is said, Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect.<a name=329:17></a> God loved you when you were only His enemies.<a name=329:18></a> I do not now speak of our perfection in Christ, for it is already accomplished; but it is a question of our realizing on earth that which we know.<a name=329:19></a> John says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of life.<a name=329:20></a>" As much as I enjoy, so much I reproduce.<a name=329:21></a> When I realize what Christ is, it is the joy of my soul.<a name=329:22></a> Without doubt that will judge the flesh; for when Christ enters, all that is contrary to Him is manifested.<a name=329:23></a> We are going to see a little how Christ nourishes, and how one is sustained by Him in ordinary life, so that the power of Christ could not be enfeebled even in the midst of all the worryings which tend to distract us.<a name=329:24></a> If we cannot pass through them, occupying ourselves with the Lord, then, when we would come back to Him, the heart is cold.<a name=329:25></a> His love is weakened in us if we have not that which we used for going through all circumstances with Him.<a name=329:26></a>

		When God visited His people in Egypt, He did not speak to them of the desert they had to cross, but of Canaan.<a name=330:9></a> So, in drawing us out of the world for communion with Jesus, God speaks to us of heaven; He has glory in view for us.<a name=330:10></a> But we are apt to stop and consider our circumstances in the wilderness, but when the Spirit acts, one sees only the end.<a name=330:11></a>

		Paul did not live in the things that are seen, because they pass away, and are null in this sense; but he abode in the things eternal.<a name=330:12></a> Consequently the first requisite for enabling us thus to regard the world as null is to know that we are not of it.<a name=330:13></a> God found us in sin, entirely estranged from Him; and the question is how to place us in heaven.<a name=330:14></a> As He took Christ from the tomb, and set Him at His right hand in heaven, by the same power He has taken us out of our sins to place us in heaven, all the rest being blotted out.<a name=330:15></a>

		In the chapter before us we find two things: the passover and the old corn of the land.<a name=330:16></a> All other things are left aside.<a name=330:17></a> It is a question of being in heaven for leaving the manna.<a name=330:18></a> This is a great deal to say; it supposes not only shelter from the judgment of God, but a place in heaven.<a name=330:19></a> Even when Israel were no longer in Egypt, they did not want the old corn of the land whilst they were in the wilderness.<a name=330:20></a> Pharaoh was no longer there.<a name=330:21></a> Israel was delivered from the bondage of Egypt, nevertheless they did not eat the old corn of the land.<a name=330:22></a> It is just the same for the Christian who has not learnt the salvation he has in Christ.<a name=330:23></a> He is no longer under condemnation, but he cannot glorify God.<a name=330:24></a> He is sheltered from judgment, but <i>he</i> does not know the efficacy of Christ's work for glory.<a name=330:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Returning to the manner of being nourished with Christ, we see that, when the old corn of the land was eaten, the manna ceased; that is, we enjoy redemption in quite a new way.<a name=331:16></a> The principle of the difference lies here.<a name=331:17></a> At the beginning I thought of my sins and of Christ; this is the door by which we must enter.<a name=331:18></a> We must be humbled, and enter by Christ.<a name=331:19></a> But afterwards, knowing that God loves us as He loves Christ, and that His favour rests on us, and knowing all the bearing of redemption accomplished by Jesus, I begin to estimate the love of Jesus as God estimates it' to have the same thoughts as He in this respect.<a name=331:20></a> Then I see Christ in quite another way than before; I am nourished with Him in a way entirely new.<a name=331:21></a> It is no longer a mere question of being sheltered only, but I am united to Christ Himself.<a name=331:22></a> I contemplate all the perfection of the Lamb who is there; and when I think of the abasement He submitted to on the cross, how He abased Himself to make good the character of God, in order that God might be just without giving up love, and that He might act according to love without giving up righteousness, then I adore Christ.<a name=331:23></a> The Son of man has been glorified, because God has been glorified in Him, He has been content to be compromised in order that God might be glorified.<a name=331:24></a> He has renounced all, yet had an absolute confidence in His Father.<a name=331:25></a> "But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.<a name=331:26></a>" He goes to the end, and drinks the cup, that the Father might be glorified and we saved.<a name=331:27></a> Now <i>I</i> nourish myself with all this; not only am I sheltered, but I adore.<a name=331:28></a> What occupies him who is in his sins is to be sheltered; but he who feeds on Christ, while adoring Him, rejoices while contemplating Him, that he is seated in Christ in heavenly places.<a name=331:29></a>

		When I say that we ought to abide in Canaan, it is in Canaan where the warfare is that I speak of There are continual conflicts in the heavenly places represented by Canaan, but it is clear that in heaven by-and-by there will be perfect repose.<a name=332:11></a> As a sinner, the believer was of Egypt; as a Christian he is of Canaan; but he is crossing the wilderness, and sometimes his spirit is still in Egypt, because he gets weary of the wilderness, and the heart then turns back.<a name=332:12></a> The world should be <i>for him</i>, as for Jesus, only a dry land, where no water is (Psalm 63).<a name=332:13></a> Here below we have nothing but a desert, where are fiery serpents; but it must be crossed and passed through with God.<a name=332:14></a> If our affections are capable of being nourished with Christ, we shall be able to endure everything.<a name=332:15></a> I say to myself, Why is it that I am not there?<a name=332:16></a> I know however, that Christ is my Saviour.<a name=332:17></a> Oh!<a name=332:18></a> it is when one does not feed on Christ as the old corn of the land that one does not abide in communion with Him.<a name=332:19></a> The manna is for the wilderness, but the old corn of the land is for Canaan.<a name=332:20></a>

		If the Christian neglects to feed on Christ in this sense, he has no strength to put on Christ here below in his walk.<a name=333:3></a> If he walks ill, if there are falls, he cannot at Gilgal (for we must come there after all) feed on Christ as the old corn of the land, that is, feast in communion with Him, the heavenly rest.<a name=333:4></a> In this case one must be humbled, and settle accounts with Christ, which is an immense difference in the moral state of the soul.<a name=333:5></a> If Christ went up the mountain, then came the transfiguration; it was for Him the old corn of the land; He fed, as it were, on the glory; but if He went down, He found at the foot the power of Satan.<a name=333:6></a> In all the circumstances of the desert, however, Jesus lived on account of the Father.<a name=333:7></a> We too should live on account of Jesus.<a name=333:8></a> It is where we meet with the enemy's power that Jesus is our food as manna.<a name=333:9></a> Jesus could always say, "As the living Father sent me, and I live on account of the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live on account of me.<a name=333:10></a>" As Christ Himself crossed the wilderness, and walked there by faith, we are called to do the same.<a name=333:11></a> In all circumstances He prayed; if difficulties increased, He prayed more earnestly.<a name=333:12></a> He was there as man, and passed through everything with the Father's help.<a name=333:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian feeds on a Christ who has been tried and humbled, and ought to be himself as Christ, crossing the world with all the grace necessary, in order that one should own his Master in Him.<a name=333:14></a> If he walks with Christ, every sort of goodness, mildness, of long-suffering, will be seen in him.<a name=333:15></a> For Jesus, the effect of temptation was to bring out grace.<a name=333:16></a> If I am with Him, and people insult me, I endure; I shall not cease to be meek, because I feed on Him who is such.<a name=333:17></a> It is not that my Christian character obliges me to be in these things, but I have all needful for going through them, and I forget them because I am not of this world, but of elsewhere.<a name=333:18></a> If I walk with Christ in me, if I eat manna in the desert, I feed also on the old corn of the land in Canaan.<a name=333:19></a> Every day one may do both.<a name=333:20></a> The manna is wanted, and daily diligence (for the manna spoilt).<a name=333:21></a> They had need of manna to go to Canaan.<a name=333:22></a>

		GIDEON -- GOD'S MIGHTY MAN OF VALOUR
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The history of Gideon is of much practical importance.<a name=346:1></a> It is the history of one of those revivals in Judges, so peculiarly applicable to the present circumstances and need of the church.<a name=346:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every now and again (as we learn in the previous chapters of this book, which will be seen at once to be occupied throughout with the, failure of Israel, when placed in the land into which Joshua had brought them in blessing) Israel had been sold into the hands of their enemies.<a name=346:3></a> Groaning under the consequences of their sin, they had cried unto Jehovah; and Jehovah ever faithful, had raised up some one, as a deliverer out of the hands of those that spoiled them.<a name=346:4></a> He was grieved with the afflictions of His people.<a name=346:5></a> He judged their sin and evil, yet at the same time pitied and saved.<a name=346:6></a> But then the persons by whom He wrought were always in themselves insignificant.<a name=346:7></a> We do not find revivals beginning from the head.<a name=346:8></a> Very generally, when there has been anything of a recovery from the doctrines and traditions of men, it has taken place through the instrumentality of some obscure individual raised up in the energy of the Spirit.<a name=346:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Such a "saviour" was Gideon.<a name=346:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The children of Israel (we read) did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years," chapter 6: 1.<a name=346:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Midianites knew not that it was Jehovah who had delivered Israel into their hands, yet in reality, they were but the rod with which it pleased Him to punish His people.<a name=346:12></a> As with the Assyrian (Isaiah 10): "O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in thine hand is mine indignation," etc.<a name=346:13></a> When He has done with His rod, He can break it or burn it.<a name=346:14></a> "Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?<a name=346:15></a> or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?<a name=346:16></a> as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, <i>or</i> as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.<a name=346:17></a>" Satan himself is very often the rod used by God for the discipline of His children.<a name=346:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel.<a name=346:19></a>" Nothing could have prevailed against them, had they been faithful to Jehovah.<a name=346:20></a> "And because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong-holds.<a name=346:21></a> And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.<a name=346:22></a> For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came up as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their cattle were without number; and they entered into the land to destroy it.<a name=346:23></a> And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites," verse 2-6.<a name=346:24></a>

		"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah because of the Midianites, that Jehovah sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah God of Israel, I brought you out of Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them forth before you, and gave you their land: and I said unto you, I am Jehovah your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell; but ye have not obeyed my voice," verse 7-10.<a name=347:13></a>

		God had been faithful to Israel, but Israel had not been faithful to God.<a name=348:6></a> This was the point of the prophet's testimony.<a name=348:7></a> He ever vindicates His own conduct, "If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself," Were we walking as He would have us, neither the world, nor the flesh, nor the devil, could prevail against us.<a name=348:8></a> Whenever we find ourselves under the power of our enemies, we must be sure to charge the fault on ourselves, and not on God.<a name=348:9></a> Does Joshua lie on his face because the people have turned their backs before the men of Ai, Jehovah says to him, "Get thee up; wherefore liest thou on thy face?<a name=348:10></a> Israel hath sinned.<a name=348:11></a>" Joshua ought to have known that sin in Israel, not any changeableness in God, was the cause of their being smitten.<a name=348:12></a> Jehovah would not be amongst them any more, until they had put away the accursed thing.<a name=348:13></a> Could He go out to bless iniquity?<a name=348:14></a> Nothing can weaken our hands but sin; "greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<a name=348:15></a>"

		JONATHAN: A WORD ON WORKING WITH GOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Samuel 14
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the doings of Jonathan, we get energy of faith in the midst of sad confusion in Israel.<a name=375:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people of God had sought in a carnal way to establish themselves against their enemies.<a name=375:2></a> A people of no faith to lean immediately upon God, they had asked for themselves a king; and whilst testifying to His own rejection by them, God had instructed Samuel to hearken unto their voice in all that they said, and make them a king (chapter 8).<a name=375:3></a> "Give us a king, to judge us like all the nations," their cry, as again (even after the prophet had warned them as to consequences, in accordance with the divine testimony), "Nay, but we will have a king over us; that we may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles"; the carnal desire is met, and Saul set up to war against Israel's enemies.<a name=375:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the state of things in the midst of which we find Jonathan.<a name=375:5></a> And though he enters not into the full mind of God, he is able to act in the energy of faith,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is hard for faith to endure the afflictions of God's people, and the dishonour done in it to God Himself.<a name=375:6></a> Jonathan endures it not.<a name=375:7></a> He has faith in the God of Israel, and he makes up his mind to attack the Philistines.<a name=375:8></a> He calls to his armour-bearer, and says, "Come let us go over unto the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side," verse 1.<a name=375:9></a> The sin of the people of God may have subjected them to the power of the "uncircumcised," but this cannot subject the rights of God.<a name=375:10></a> Such is faith's reasoning.<a name=375:11></a> And nothing is more simple.<a name=375:12></a> The moment there is separation unto God, a standing with Him, there is zeal for God and strength in His service.<a name=375:13></a> But he confers not with flesh and blood, "he told not his father.<a name=375:14></a>" There was no faith in Saul; and had he consulted him, Saul would most probably only have discouraged -- with faith he would have gone himself.<a name=375:15></a> He would either have stopped or hampered him; when he does act, it is only to trouble.<a name=375:16></a> Faith has to act on its own responsibility.<a name=375:17></a> One way in which we very constantly fail is in asking counsel of those who have not the faith or the light we ourselves have; we thus sink down to their level.<a name=375:18></a>

		All that could give authority, or accredit it, in the eyes of the people religiously too, was with Saul.<a name=376:1></a> The king, the priest, the ark were all there.<a name=376:2></a> But Jonathan waits not for the people.<a name=376:3></a> He has none but his armour-bearer with him; and so much the better for him, for he is not troubled with the unbelief of others.<a name=376:4></a> Where there is a single eye, there is ever confidence in acting and not hesitation.<a name=376:5></a> The flesh may be confident, but its confidence is in self, and therefore only folly.<a name=376:6></a> Faith makes nothing of circumstances, because it makes God all.<a name=376:7></a> It is not that difficulties in themselves are lessened, but that God fills the eye.<a name=376:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Philistines' position is a strong one amidst precipitous rocks: what could human energy avail?<a name=376:9></a> Jonathan has to climb up upon his hands and feet (verse 13).<a name=376:10></a> The oppressors too are there in great numbers, and well armed.<a name=376:11></a> But faith with a single sword counts God sufficient.<a name=376:12></a> "Come," is the unhesitating word, "let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us," verse 6.<a name=376:13></a> The uncircumcised "have no strength when looked at thus they have not the God of Jacob for their help: their hope is not in Jehovah.<a name=376:14></a> Little matter as to the condition of His people, if He be with them: "there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.<a name=376:15></a>" The enemy may be as the sand on the sea shore for multitude: that is nothing -- and faith knows it.<a name=376:16></a> He can give strength to one sword to subdue a host.<a name=376:17></a>

		Jonathan seeks not other help.<a name=376:18></a> Happy in his companion, a man of a kindred spirit (his answer bearing him the witness "Do all that is in thine heart; turn thee, behold I am with thee according to thy heart," verse 7), he at once discovers himself to the Philistines (verse 8).<a name=376:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already remarked on the strong simple confidence of Jonathan in Jehovah's power.<a name=376:20></a> Another thing that characterises his faith is the consciousness of the impossibility of the link between God and His people being broken.<a name=376:21></a> Sad as the condition of that people is -- the Philistines in power in their midst, pillaging a defenceless land; no means of resistance left to them, not a sword or a spear (except with Saul and with Jonathan) found in Israel (chapter 13: 19, 22); the very king they have in their midst, one they have sinned in setting up -- this touches not His faithfulness.<a name=376:22></a> The Philistines are delivered into the hand of Israel<a href="#376:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> (not into his own) in the judgment of the man of faith (verse 12).<a name=376:23></a> In isolating itself with God, faith identifies itself with His people.<a name=376:24></a> It loses sight of self, passes over their desolations, and recognizes all that is theirs in God.<a name=376:25></a> Jonathan is as Jehovah's hand.<a name=376:26></a> And see what boldness!<a name=376:27></a> Though Israel be not able to sharpen a mattock, in the name of the God of hosts, Jehovah, God of Israel, he goes straight on his way.<a name=376:28></a>

		But then, whilst he goes forward thus, conferring not with flesh and blood, there is nothing of boastfulness, no acting in fleshly haste and excitement.<a name=377:1></a> His expectation is from God.<a name=377:2></a> He can discover himself plainly to the garrison of the Philistines, telling them as it were, "Here am I, an Israelite"; but he will wait and see; -- if they say, 'Tarry until we come to you,' he will stand in his place, and will not go up to them.<a name=377:3></a> But if they say, 'Come up unto us,' he will go up; Jehovah hath delivered them into their hand.<a name=377:4></a> There is to be the sign (verse 9, 10).<a name=377:5></a> In other words he will wait for them to come to him, or he will go and throw himself into the midst of their camp, just as Jehovah may bid.<a name=377:6></a> He will not make difficulties for himself; but he will not turn away from difficulties which meet him in the path.<a name=377:7></a> His is the real dependence of faith.<a name=377:8></a>

		The people come to a wood, there is honey upon the ground, yet no man puts his hand to his mouth, for they fear the oath (verse 25, 26).<a name=378:21></a> Jonathan has not heard that oath; wherefore he puts the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dips it in an honeycomb, and puts his hand to his mouth and his eyes are enlightened (verse 27).<a name=378:22></a> And when made acquainted with the curse, and seeing the people faint around him, he at once exclaims, "My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.<a name=378:23></a> How much more if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they had found; for had there not been now a much greater slaughter amongst the Philistines?<a name=378:24></a>" verse 28-30.<a name=378:25></a>

		Happy Jonathan!<a name=379:1></a> Faith is so occupied with its work, and has so the sense of God's love and grace, that it has full liberty, and whatsoever God presents in the way it can thankfully avail itself of, taking it and going on; whilst the carnal zeal of that which is but an imitation of faith, and which never works with God, makes a duty of refusing it.<a name=379:2></a> Had Jonathan not been occupied heart and soul in Jehovah's work, he might have stopped to think about the honey; as it is, he merely takes it for refreshment and passes on.<a name=379:3></a> Through the energy of faith he is carried clean out of the knowledge of the oath (verse 27).<a name=379:4></a> Out of the reach of this unbelief, he can avail himself of the kindness of his God with joy and thanksgiving, and pursue his course refreshed and encouraged, whilst the people (who had not the faith to go with him) are under the curse and cannot.<a name=379:5></a> Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<a name=379:6></a> Saul has put both himself and the people under this miserable restraint (if the flesh puts itself under bondage, it must keep its oath), and in result they are led into sin; for they are so hungry, that when the time of the oath is expired, they fly (verse 32) on the cattle taken as spoil, and slay them, and eat the flesh with the blood thereof, thus violating a direct command of God (Deuteronomy 12: 22, 23).<a name=379:7></a>

		THOUGHTS ON 2 SAMUEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the first book gave us Israel tired of their original relationship with God, and the trial of the king of their choice, ending in the destruction of himself and his house, the second contains the establishment of David as the king, according to God, though failing far more in ease and exaltation than under the oppression and persecution of Saul.<a name=381:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1.<a name=381:2></a> The generosity of David is here apparent, his horror at the Amalekite, who hoped to <i>profit</i> by Saul's death, and his genuine grief over the fallen king of Israel, with his loved Jonathan.<a name=381:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapters 2, 3.<a name=381:4></a> David asks of Jehovah, and is guided by Him; but war goes on humblingly between the men of Judah, round David, and the rest of Israel, round Ishbosheth, who had no real claim to the throne.<a name=381:5></a> It was the more sorrowful a conflict, because, personally, the chief in command for Ishbosheth (Abner) was a better man, by David's own confession, than Joab, his own second in command.<a name=381:6></a> After all too it was Abner's pique which closed the strife, not Joab's prowess or skill; and David has to mourn over Abner, treacherously slain, and to spread Joab's iniquity before Jehovah.<a name=381:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 4 shews us David true-hearted in the matter of Ishbosheth's death inflicting what was meet on the murderers.<a name=381:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 5.<a name=381:9></a> The kingdom over all Israel now turning to David, who had reigned seven years and a half in Hebron, as after thirty-three years in Jerusalem, over all Israel and Judah.<a name=381:10></a> Zion is taken by the energy of Joab, who becomes commander-in-chief.<a name=381:11></a> David is honoured of the Gentiles, has sons and daughters born of his numerous wives and concubines, and defeats the Philistines who assail him.<a name=381:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 6.<a name=381:13></a> David seeks to have the ark brought back, but thought not of what was due to the holiness and the word of Jehovah, who smote Uzzah for his rashness.<a name=381:14></a> But the evident blessing which rested on the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, where the ark rested, touches the king's heart, who now conducts it meetly, and with triumph and with humility too, the more conspicuous because the empty pride of Saul's daughter, Michal, childless till death.<a name=381:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 7.<a name=381:16></a> David desires to build for Jehovah, but learns that it is reserved for his son, the man of peace, as he had been of war.<a name=381:17></a> God, who had called him in His sovereignty, must do all to establish David's house (as well as to bring Israel into rest) when His Son, the Son of God withal, should build the house, and the throne be established for ever.<a name=381:18></a> What an outpouring of David's heart follows!<a name=381:19></a>
