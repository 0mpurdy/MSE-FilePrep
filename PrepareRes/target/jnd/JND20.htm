		NARRATIVE OF THE FACTS, CONNECTED WITH THE SEPARATION OF THE WRITER FROM THE CONGREGATION MEETING IN EBRINGTON STREET
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The following narrative, though constantly demanded by brethren, would have never seen the light, had the work which occasioned the separation been confined to Plymouth, or its activity ceased.<a name=1:1></a> No desire of clearing up one's own grounds of conduct has influenced me, nor would such have induced me to publish any account of what passed.<a name=1:2></a> The best proof is that in a lapse of a year it had not.<a name=1:3></a> But convinced as I am that it is a work of Satan which has developed itself here, and finding that, as Mr.<a name=1:4></a> N.<a name=1:5></a> announced that he would seek to produce everywhere "united hostility" to the brethren who differed from him, the same system at present is carrying on elsewhere to propagate the work, and believing that many true-hearted saints become unconsciously instruments of this, I have thought well that they should be apprised of what passed.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The argument alleged against such an account would be the scandal of it.<a name=1:7></a> But that exists in the division already.<a name=1:8></a> The knowing the grounds of it will rather take it away.<a name=1:9></a> For it is a very serious thing indeed to separate from Christians, and indeed the saints have, in some sort, a right to know why it has been done.<a name=1:10></a> It may be very humbling to the saints concerned; but I do not think this is an evil.<a name=1:11></a> The strongest motive by far -- the one which weighed with me -- was the dislike of publishing evil.<a name=1:12></a> I never should have done it, but left it to the Lord, had the trouble occasioned by it stopped the activity of the evil.<a name=1:13></a> What overcame this motive with me was, that there was just as much activity as before in the evil, and the same unblushing unscrupulousness as to truth.<a name=1:14></a> It may perhaps be thought that I have exaggerated in this account.<a name=1:15></a> Far from it.<a name=1:16></a> None of the facts which did not enter into the public course of events are mentioned, though as numerous and in my judgment as grave or graver than what is here stated; and not only so, but were not similar facts now going on, which are not alluded to here, I should never have published these.<a name=1:17></a> Another motive might act, that is, the general discredit thrown on the brethren.<a name=1:18></a> But this must yield before duty to souls.<a name=1:19></a> I have never seen one who got into the active influence of the system, whose moral integrity was not ruined.<a name=1:20></a> Besides, I believe that this system had so puffed up the brethren, and worldliness had so crept in, that under such discipline as God has sent us, it is only our part to bow.<a name=1:21></a> Indeed the present influence of the spirit of the world is such in the system which has driven me out, that, unless the Lord corrected it, I should be thankful to be entirely free from it.<a name=1:22></a> Lastly, I do not expect to escape what Sir A.<a name=1:23></a> C.<a name=1:24></a>, Mr.<a name=1:25></a> W.<a name=1:26></a>, and others have been subjected to, that is, to have all my statements denied.<a name=1:27></a> I expect it.<a name=1:28></a> But this is no reason with me for not informing brethren if this latter be a duty.<a name=1:29></a> It cannot last long this.<a name=1:30></a>

		It is possible that in a narrative extending over a year and a half, embracing many people, and even places, some inaccuracy of detail which may occasion cavil may have escaped me.<a name=2:1></a> I have given too many names not to give the fullest opportunity of confirmation or correction, indeed always, save where charity demanded their suppression, or in the case of females.<a name=2:2></a> Engaged in such a business I had no need to conceal those of brethren.<a name=2:3></a> They must take their share when they acted in public.<a name=2:4></a> There is nothing here of which I am not assured of my own knowledge, or which were public facts before all, or facts stated already in print by others, or with the authors' names with some exceptions; in a word, nothing of the truth of which I am not thoroughly satisfied.<a name=2:5></a> At all events, what is here related is with other facts that which has led me into the position I am in; and I give them as substantially a thoroughly authentic and true narrative of what has passed.<a name=2:6></a> I have only to add, that the ground of evil doctrine or teaching, and the unsettling the souls of saints on every thing precious and even vital, is acquiring every day <i>very greatly increased weight in my mind</i>.<a name=2:7></a> This from its subtle and fleeting character, though conclusive with me, is more difficult to give.<a name=2:8></a> Some specimens however are here.<a name=2:9></a> The "Examination" of the "Thoughts" gives many though on less important points.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may add one here from a tract sold in the tract shop.<a name=2:11></a> It is there taught that the wicked will rise with their diseased bodies; as that a man that had the palsy would keep it for ever, they would receive again their corrupt and sin-worn bodies, in all their wretchedness.<a name=2:12></a> This is addressed in a gospel tract to the careless.<a name=2:13></a> The tract is printed in London, but it was sold at Plymouth in the depot, nor have I any doubt of its origin.<a name=2:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have communicated this narrative to others, to take all the care I can, that it should be perfectly true; I give no names, as I feel in such a case it is the juster way to let it rest on my own responsibility.<a name=3:1></a> I add here one or two corrections resulting therefrom.<a name=3:2></a><a href="#3:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is all that I can find to correct in what follows.<a name=3:3></a> It is, of course, possible that something may have escaped me.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add another mark of the enemy's work.<a name=3:5></a> It is this: where there is the sudden reception of a whole system, and the authority of the author of it set up at once over the mind.<a name=3:6></a> When truth is received into the soul by the Spirit, it is received and engrafted by God, so that, though a blessed door may be opened by any given truth, we are built up truth by truth, each being wrought into the soul so that there is truth in it, and the consciousness of God's teaching us that, and the instrument of it, if any, is not between us and God as to it, though inspired teachers were of course an authority.<a name=3:7></a> In the case stated the mind is at once shut up into the system, and real progress in divine truth is entirely arrested.<a name=3:8></a> The consequences of having thus taken a system of error for truth is often most deplorable for the whole life, even if the person be delivered from it.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader will find another example of the unsettling the soul as to fundamental truths in the confusion between the life communicated to the saint and the divine nature in Christ.<a name=3:10></a> Thus, "But did Jesus think that the life which was in Him, and which He communicated to others, was not heavenly?<a name=3:11></a>" Did He not Himself say, "The Son of man <i>which</i> is in heaven?<a name=3:12></a> Were they (the angels) ignorant of the existence of a life in earth, which they had known in the excellence of its own uncreated glory, above?<a name=3:13></a> .<a name=3:14></a>.<a name=3:15></a>.<a name=3:16></a> Were they ignorant that this life had, through the Son been communicated to persons chosen from among sinful men?<a name=3:17></a>" (See pages 28, 29, of "Answer to Second Letter.<a name=3:18></a>")
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have felt unable, having reread this narrative after the corrections, to detect any inaccuracy.<a name=3:19></a> As to the expression "He will catch it" (page 58), my memory is so vague that I could not pretend to give it as the word used.<a name=3:20></a> But this perusal has made me feel that such a publication of evil would be entirely unjustifiable, and evil in itself, had I not the conviction, the solemn settled conviction (not, I believe, led to it of man) that there is an active positive work of the enemy <i>going on</i>.<a name=3:21></a> That conviction I have.<a name=3:22></a> I do not publish it to justify myself, for in my own judgment it does the contrary.<a name=3:23></a> I feel, as I have stated in the body of the narrative, that I failed in spiritual energy, through human feeling, in letting the matter drop in April at the instance of others.<a name=3:24></a> I hesitated as to my own being, spiritual enough to do it in public then, though I had acquiesced in doing it in private.<a name=3:25></a> If it be asked why I do it in a worse way now, I answer that it became a public duty to the saints, cost me what it would.<a name=3:26></a> And I do not expect to meddle with such evil without its costing me something.<a name=3:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No one who was present at the meeting lately held in London can doubt that the brethren were brought (may I not in a certain measure say, brought back?<a name=4:2></a>) into the presence of the Lord -- that the Lord has dealt with them in the manifestation of His presence, of His presence and dealings with them.<a name=4:3></a> This is a serious and solemn thought, and (I have felt) ought to take the lead and be as the source and spring of our other thoughts.<a name=4:4></a> I have myself been laid by, unable to read and write, so that, for my own part, I have been necessarily more particularly thrown into His hands, so that things should be more immediately judged as in His presence, viewed as they are seen there, and that what does not become His presence should alarm the conscience, man becoming little, but the saints exceeding precious.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After the meeting my conscience somewhat smote me for not declaring there in the plainest way what I believe to be the Lord's judgment of the work which has resulted in Ebrington Street at Plymouth: and it has been yet more pressed upon my conscience since I have been laid by.<a name=4:6></a> What prevented my doing so will be evident to every one who was there.<a name=4:7></a> The Lord took the meeting so entirely into His own hand, and so gave to it the character, and that of blessing, which He pleased, that I felt my part was to leave it exclusively with the character He had given to it.<a name=4:8></a> If it was a want of faith, my motives will be understood by every one who was there.<a name=4:9></a> But then this return into the presence of the Lord leads to dealing with brethren as in His presence.<a name=4:10></a> It is due to them.<a name=4:11></a> I feel I owe it to them to communicate to them as seen there, so to speak, what may press on my own spirit before the Lord.<a name=4:12></a> Now I believe fully that the work which has resulted in, what I may call in its present state, Ebrington Street, is a direct and positive work of Satan.<a name=4:13></a> And here I entreat brethren not to turn away as if these were mere hard words or a bad spirit.<a name=4:14></a> I mean simply and solemnly what I say.<a name=4:15></a> If such be the case, it is charity, unfeigned charity, to say so, and warn the saints of it.<a name=4:16></a> I so much believe it to be so, that I do not believe any one who meddles with or is within its reach will be safe from its influence till they treat it as such.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This may be always remarked, that where there is a work of the enemy even saints always fall into it if they do not treat it as such.<a name=5:1></a> It has power over the human heart, and where there is not in the soul the power of the Spirit to judge it as the positive mischief of the enemy (and so it will be judged where that power is), there the soul will fall into it, as if it were more perfect truth than what the Spirit teaches.<a name=5:2></a> See the early judaizing of the church, traced and detected in the Epistles to the Galatians and Colossians, and elsewhere.<a name=5:3></a> And see in the Galatian churches how the saints fell into it.<a name=5:4></a> See the same thing in Popery.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I would explain a little further.<a name=5:6></a> It does not follow by any means that there are no truths held by those who fall into such a snare.<a name=5:7></a> Many important truths may be held by them.<a name=5:8></a> Nor is it to be thought for a moment that true saints of God are not liable to fall into these snares.<a name=5:9></a> On the contrary, what makes it important to consider them, is that they affect the saints of God.<a name=5:10></a> Did they not, it might be sorrowful instruction, but no more: just as the awful darkness of heathenism, or the sorrowful condition of a poor unbelieving child of Israel.<a name=5:11></a> Nor does it follow (though it will generally have a legal tinge, because the flesh will in such case more or less resume its power) that many good works will not be done by those under it.<a name=5:12></a> They may abound.<a name=5:13></a> So that in saying that there has been a work of Satan I am not saying there are not many very dear children of God; I am not saying that they do not hold many all-important fundamental truths, as truths, nor that they may not be doing a great many good works.<a name=5:14></a> All this will be fully found in the system of Popery, for example, as it was in the Galatians, the earliest form perhaps of that amazing and deluding system.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a further point which it is right to notice.<a name=6:1></a> Truly godly people may be the instruments of helping on a system which is truly Satan's.<a name=6:2></a> No one can doubt that Cyprian, who laid down his life for Christ's name, that Augustine, that Bernard, were godly men.<a name=6:3></a> Yet, though one opposed Rome episcopally, and the last declared Antichrist was risen there, no one can doubt that they helped on most eminently Satan's work in Popery.<a name=6:4></a> They did not perceive the bearing of certain points on the meaning and testimony of the Spirit of God.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, I do not call every evil I find a direct and positive work of Satan.<a name=6:6></a> Of course his hand is there.<a name=6:7></a> A saint I call a work of God, though Satan may mar it.<a name=6:8></a> Thus I believe there are serious defects and faults in the Establishment; but I believe it to have been a work of God, marred and spoiled by human considerations, which led those who framed it, to adapt it to circumstances and to the then state of the population, and to introduce principles which lay it now <i>open</i> perhaps to that work of Satan which is commonly called Puseyism.<a name=6:9></a> In that too itself, I dare say, several good men are labouring, because they do not by spiritual power discern Satan's craft who has a lovely religion for the flesh, a religion fairer to men's judgment and loveliest natural feelings than God's, which acts entirely on the conscience and gives all glory to Christ.<a name=6:10></a> So with Dissenters: I believe that was a work of God; with many defects, I judge, but still a work of God.<a name=6:11></a> And so of others.<a name=6:12></a> But Popery and Puseyism are the work of the enemy, though you may, and doubtless would, find many dear persons among them.<a name=6:13></a> Of course the degrees of evil or power may vary.<a name=6:14></a> I speak of its character and source merely.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Satan originates nothing.<a name=6:16></a> This is God's prerogative.<a name=6:17></a> The work of Satan is to mar and break down what God has wrought, when this is left, as an effect produced, to the responsibility of man.<a name=6:18></a> God created Adam.<a name=6:19></a> Satan spoiled the work through man's folly.<a name=6:20></a> There was but One whom he could not touch down here; in whom, having laid his defiling hand on all else as prince of this world, he could find nothing.<a name=6:21></a> He can originate nothing, but he can build up with vast sagacity an immense system, out of the corruption, suited to the evil which is in us; yea, and stamped with the character of the evil that is in us to which it is so suited.<a name=6:22></a> What would money be without avarice?<a name=6:23></a> or worldly power without ambition?<a name=6:24></a> or superstition without a natural principle of religiousness in the heart of man?<a name=6:25></a> Such a system may be a vast fact in the economy of divine government considered as a judgment, as Mohammedanism; or a subtler corruption, as Popery, pregnant with greater mischiefs, but where the enemy of souls has not been permitted to blot out in the same way the great facts of Christianity, as to the manner of the Divine existence and incarnation, nor the historical truths of the gospel; or it may be a marring where, in the main, truth abides; or it may be the ruin of some special testimony of God as far as it goes.<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A testimony of some special truth may decay, or be lost, or lose its power by becoming mere established orthodoxy; but I do not call this directly or properly a work of Satan.<a name=7:1></a> I call it a work of Satan, when, blessing and testimony having been brought in by the blessed Spirit of God, a systematic effort is made, producing a regular system; an effort which takes up the truth whose power has decayed as to faith really carrying the soul out of the influence of present things, or some neglected truth generally, and, while it seems to adopt it as it stands in its basis as a fact, subverts and sets it aside; throwing the soul back on ground which is no longer a test of faith, though it be truth (for there Satan can adopt truth for a time), and bringing in apparent additional instruction, but really subversive of the power of what the Spirit taught, and making the authority of this teaching sectarian, or superstitious, or both, though they will not last together.<a name=7:2></a> I am not speaking here of Satan's work in open infidelity.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now many may be quite unable to detect Satan working in this way, but there will be always enough, through the faithfulness of God, to guard souls really waiting on Him from falling in; or if listened to, through grace to bring them out.<a name=7:4></a> But then it will be and must be judged as evil, not dealt with as a mere measure of better and worse.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a distinction which may yet be made.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two distinct characters of work which Satan does, which may nevertheless merge one in the other.<a name=7:7></a> Of these however one, if alone, will be ephemeral, the other lasting.<a name=7:8></a> First, where power is not the true power of the Spirit, so as to detect and judge Satan's imitation, there he can easily set up the imitation of power, and that even where there is a measure of true faith and owning of God, but subjection, intelligent subjection by the Spirit to the word as of the Spirit, is not found.<a name=7:9></a> Where this is connected with the establishment of arranged human authority, this latter may subsist, but the work itself is ephemeral.<a name=7:10></a> Such a work as this will probably be connected with some of the most right-feeling, if not right-judging, persons among Christians, who have the strongest feelings of the decay which occasions it, but there will be generally shipwreck of the faith in some point or other.<a name=7:11></a> Yet it will afford exceeding difficulty to those who cannot discern the work of the enemy in the midst of this right feeling.<a name=7:12></a> I would instance as examples of this kind of evil work of the enemy, the Montanists, the Irvingites, and, in some respects, the Quakers or Friends.<a name=7:13></a> As to these last it is well known that what I now refer to has passed away, and that they remain amongst men a most quiet and, in many respects, most estimable body of persons.<a name=7:14></a> I speak of their early history.<a name=7:15></a> What remains is the authority that was settled among them, though with the old Friends very much defect in doctrine.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that this work began in a right feeling about the want of spiritual power.<a name=8:1></a> This may be easily seen in Dell's works.<a name=8:2></a> But no one who has read the remarkable history of George Fox, Naylor, and many of Penn's writings, or known much of the doctrines of Friends, can doubt the inroad of the enemy.<a name=8:3></a> I have added a few words on this because it was a more mixed and ambiguous case.<a name=8:4></a> I would not pass it over because it is one instructive to the church.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another form of Satan's working.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this orthodox truth is in general maintained.<a name=8:7></a> Any pretension to the possession of spiritual power is based on church position, not on any particular manifestation of power, and thus seems to honour the institution of the church and Christ in it.<a name=8:8></a> God is alleged to have set there, in that institution, the seat of blessing, and this also is an acknowledged truth, and the unity of the body of Christ is thereon connected with the institution.<a name=8:9></a> But the sovereign operation of the Spirit of God is set aside, and that which acts outside the actually formed institution is condemned as denying the authority of God's institution and schismatical sin.<a name=8:10></a> Thus the actual possessors of the power of the institution, in its then state, really take the place of God.<a name=8:11></a> His power is vested in them as far as it acts on earth.<a name=8:12></a> Divine condemnation attaches to all who act independently of them.<a name=8:13></a> Direct dependence upon God is unallowable.<a name=8:14></a> And thus whatever puts individual faith to the test (for going with the crowd under authority does not) is condemned as self-will and presumption.<a name=8:15></a>

		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The system which so judges is alleged to maintain the unity of the church.<a name=9:1></a> This may exist in different degrees, and in different circumstances; but it always attaches divine authority more or less to official position, and thus puts man in the place of God by attaching His name to man.<a name=9:2></a> It is not spiritual energy in man putting souls through Christ in direct relation with God, with the Father.<a name=9:3></a> There spiritual affections are happy and blessed.<a name=9:4></a> It is man eclipsing God, getting between Him and the soul.<a name=9:5></a> Not man revealing God, but the authority of God attached to man.<a name=9:6></a> Hence full love and grace will never be known.<a name=9:7></a> The Spirit of adoption and blessed assurance of salvation in the knowledge of Him will never be.<a name=9:8></a> It may survive such a system for a time, but it cannot be identified with such a system when matured.<a name=9:9></a> To be with God, while always rendering the soul submissive, must render it independent of man; that is, it asserts no rights, but when the need is, it says, "we ought to obey God rather than man.<a name=9:10></a>" The first of these works of Satan then is the pretence to the extraordinary operation of the Spirit.<a name=9:11></a> That is ephemeral.<a name=9:12></a> It is suited to the ill-directed but righteous cravings after that manifestation of spiritual power which was and is the only true source of living blessing on the earth, when that power has faded away.<a name=9:13></a> The other is the orderly establishment of men in the place of that power.<a name=9:14></a> This lasts.<a name=9:15></a> It is suited to unbelief, and in its full development it always generates it.<a name=9:16></a> Montanism is passed.<a name=9:17></a> The spiritual pretensions of Irvingism are in fact passed; the system of men and ordinances set up by it abides.<a name=9:18></a> So practically among the Friends.<a name=9:19></a> This is common to both, as far as they go, that the manifestation of Christ in living power for the peace of souls, and the truth as to Him, is weakened and set aside more or less.<a name=9:20></a> Orthodox truths may, as we have seen in one of the cases I have supposed, be maintained; but (as it is the work of the Holy Ghost alone to present Christ to the soul, so that it should be in the power of that living faith which sets the soul in blessed fellowship with the Father in true joy, leaving the impress of its own everlasting nature upon it, which the Holy Ghost can alone give, and the Holy Ghost alone maintain) the consequence is that such communion with Christ is lost, and the conscience ceases to be before God.<a name=9:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the former of the cases I have supposed Christian truth is generally lost, that is, saving truths connected with the person of Christ, and error substituted on these points.<a name=10:1></a> The Spirit's alleged presence eclipses, instead of revealing, them.<a name=10:2></a> In the latter they are plausibly subverted in their effect on the soul rather than set aside.<a name=10:3></a> As justification by faith in the Popish system, where, while every orthodox truth is maintained, the love and work of God in Christ is as to its efficacy denied by it as a system, as effectually as it could be by Socinianism itself.<a name=10:4></a> We are enabled in this case to speak of the full and awful maturity of this abiding corruption of the enemy; but those most conversant with history, and most spiritual, know how much spirituality it requires to detect its commencement and early growth: and that it sprang really from the best persons and most apparently godly principles that appear after the record of scripture; so that, though there were counteracting principles which Protestants can justly cite, yet full-grown Popery can quote the earliest fathers to establish in principle her claims, and support her pretensions.<a name=10:5></a> The blessed and perfect word of God reveals in one word this history: they began in the Spirit, and ended in the flesh.<a name=10:6></a> If you inquire who were the persons who laid the basis of this amazing evil, it will be found that it was those who insisted on good order and unity; yet it was not in the power of the Holy Ghost (<i>God</i> is not the author of confusion, but of order in the churches), but in arrangements which attached to office the authority necessary to maintain it.<a name=10:7></a> There may have been fleshly workings which gave occasion to it; but the remedy was not spiritual acting on the conscience and affections of those astray, for this is what we see in the epistles, but the authoritative arrangement of order, because power was so much gone, and spiritual discernment to know it.<a name=10:8></a> Hence the effect produced by the power, the institution itself, the church as an ordered system (not the church as redeemed by Christ), became the object presented, and was made the guard as an institution, instead of being guarded by spiritual care.<a name=10:9></a> Hence when the outward institution became the positive enemy of Christ and of His people, it retained its claims, and used its power as His.<a name=10:10></a>

		I feel satisfied that, as to the principle of it, a similar work has been going on at Plymouth.<a name=11:1></a> It will be ever founded on practically setting aside the power of that truth which has been, in any given case, the gathering principle, and the testimony of God to the world.<a name=11:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not exactly expect that in itself every one could see through such a work; but, as I have already said, there are sufficient proofs always afforded of God to the single eye: there will not, and cannot be, to others.<a name=11:3></a> I shall add here some of the points which seem to me to mark the presence and influence of the enemy in general.<a name=11:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first sign of weakness is the gathering itself becoming the object of attention instead of their being a people enjoying the blessedness of their position by the relationship and fellowship it gave them with Christ, who had become and was their abiding object, revealing withal God the Father.<a name=11:5></a> But I would speak with more detail, for this is rather the occasion of Satan's power than the fruit of it as a positive word Where this last is, you will find holy spiritual affections broken and set aside to give place to the claim of the institution.<a name=11:6></a> And so are even natural affections, whilst the latter are given all their natural force and weight in practice to hold persons in the institution, and even largely used for this purpose.<a name=11:7></a> In the same manner people are won and brought under the influence that acts there by them.<a name=11:8></a> The activity and zeal will be for the system.<a name=11:9></a> It will be to make proselytes, and establish them in what will keep them there, not to save souls or lead them on in Christ.<a name=11:10></a> There will generally be a good deal of acting <i>against</i> or depreciation of others who even hold the faith of Christ.<a name=11:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paramount importance will be attached to the views which distinguish that institution, not to what saves or to what brings faith to the test by the revelation of Christ.<a name=11:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Good works will be found generally much pressed, and that in a systematic way in which it works for and into the system.<a name=11:13></a> Truth I mean truthfulness will ever be lacking.<a name=11:14></a> This I have always found where the work of the enemy is.<a name=11:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Connected with this is the pressing much certain doctrines, when it is safe, which form the bond of the institution, and denying them in the alleged meaning, or explaining them away, when they are pressed on them by those who detect the evil.<a name=11:16></a> This any one conversant with the subject cannot but have noticed.<a name=11:17></a> The denial of the doctrine positively stated where the influence exists, as held in any such sense or its explanation, is the very thing that marks the power of evil.<a name=11:18></a> With this will be found the attributing to those who hold the truth, every kind of doctrine they abhor, where there is influence enough to have their statements believed.<a name=11:19></a> Popery is the plain example of this.<a name=11:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another mark, whatever the apparent devotedness, yea, and real devotedness sometimes, is that the spirit of the world is acquiesced in.<a name=12:1></a> The poor will be nursed as instruments, and the rich (and so the clever) flattered for support.<a name=12:2></a> Another mark is the extreme difficulty of fixing them to any definite statement, save as they have power to enforce it; and then it is bound on others; and there is the sternest rejection of all who do not bow.<a name=12:3></a> Calumny of the saints, and of their doctrines has been known from the testimony of the blessed Lord Himself onward.<a name=12:4></a> The influence of females and of money will be found also largely employed.<a name=12:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In cases of the second character of evil I have noticed, the combinations of a party will always be found.<a name=12:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another mark, often incomprehensible to one not under the influence, and that is an incapacity of conscience to discern right and wrong, an incapacity to see evil where even the mere natural conscience would discern and an upright conscience reject it at once.<a name=12:7></a> I speak of this incapacity in true saints.<a name=12:8></a> The truth is, the soul is not, where under this influence (for it may be upright in other things), at all in the presence of God, and sees everything in the light of the object which governs it; and, as to these things, the influence of the enemy has supplanted and taken the place of conscience.<a name=12:9></a> The moral marks will be found to attach to every case of evil power.<a name=12:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am satisfied that I have seen these principles distinctly at work in what has produced the system established at Plymouth.<a name=12:11></a> Some may think I have copied it for the picture.<a name=12:12></a> I have not.<a name=12:13></a> Let them, if they have ever been conversant with it, recall what the ways of Popery are, and they will easily find the same there.<a name=12:14></a> It is not because there are no saints among them, but because there are many and very dear ones, that I speak of it.<a name=12:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But having stated these general principles, a statement which I leave to work its own effect, I shall briefly narrate what I may call the public facts which have come under my knowledge; for much never has.<a name=12:16></a> I have never done so hitherto.<a name=12:17></a> I did not feel led to do it, and certainly had no inclination.<a name=12:18></a> I do not think a mind for which holiness has any charm at all will ever love the detailing or publishing evil: and, if one has any heart, most surely not what has passed among those he loves: but God's truth and His church are sacred things.<a name=12:19></a> I shall still endeavour to pass over in silence the private facts which seem to me to be evil.<a name=12:20></a> They might be called for in a case of discipline; but here they would only aggravate, without increasing, intelligent apprehension of the evil.<a name=12:21></a>

		I will not detail the origin of the "brethren," but certainly that which characterized their testimony at the outset was the coming of the Lord as the present hope of the church, and the I presence of the Holy Ghost as that which brought into unity, and animated and directed, the children of God; and they avowed their dependence upon it.<a name=13:1></a> The distinct condition of the saints of the present dispensation, as filled with the Spirit abiding with them and risen with Christ, marked their teaching, while the great truths of the gospel were held in common with other true Christians, only with the clearer light which God Himself directly, and these other truths, afforded.<a name=13:2></a> The distinct heavenly character of the church was much insisted on.<a name=13:3></a> Though the "brethren" insisted on a spiritual ministry, and the recurrence to the original principles of ministry were urged, they did not, for the same reason, pretend to appoint ministers, nor organize any church or special membership; for they held the unity of all saints.<a name=13:4></a> Themselves outside the camp, whatever saints had faith to follow them were companions in their position, and they were not separated in life, love, or essential unity, from those who could not, though blamed by them.<a name=13:5></a> In this spirit they walked for a good while.<a name=13:6></a> I now turn to details.<a name=13:7></a>

I might here refer to the testimony of an intelligent brother, a physician, who plainly states that Mr. N. ten years ago pressed the principles I have done now, and which he resists; but then he declares he always thought them a delusion, that he joined the "brethren" as a sect, and continues with them as such. Loudly, as this is denied, a sister, whose zeal for Ebrington Street would not be questioned were I to name her, said to me that it was quite evident there were two systems among the "brethren" which would produce their fruits and gatherings everywhere. My reply was, I did not doubt it, and respected her sincerity. I would that others had the honesty to own it: they were all assuring me there was not.

		On my returning from abroad, about six years ago, I was spoken to by brethren well known amongst all as to certain letters written by Mr.<a name=16:33></a> Newton, and circulated in MS.<a name=16:34></a> far and wide,<a href="#16:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> begging me to read them, as it had excited the feelings of many brethren, and made them very uneasy.<a name=16:35></a> I replied that I did not want to enter into these questions, that I had hitherto acted as a peacemaker, and sought to link and unite by going with all, and I had rather now keep out of the question.<a name=16:36></a> It was urged upon me that I must take a part in it, as the letters were making brethren uneasy everywhere.<a name=16:37></a> Thus urged, I read the letters.<a name=16:38></a> They were an elaborate argument on Mr.<a name=16:39></a> N.<a name=16:40></a>'s prophetic views, denouncing all who held the views of the rapture of the church before the end, and insisting on the evils of applying any part of the New Testament to any but the church, or of supposing that there were saints on earth, subsequent to the church's rapture, who could be spoken of in it prophetically.<a name=16:41></a> In these (besides accusing the brethren of rejecting "all<a href="#16:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> the Gospels," if they held principles contrary to his interpretation of Matthew 24, for this was the only and avowed ground, as may be seen in the passage in the note) he declared that, if they were listened to, "the foundations of Christianity were gone.<a name=16:42></a>" And will the reader believe the reason which so many have swallowed down?<a name=16:43></a> for this is the grand cry at Plymouth still.<a name=16:44></a> It is this, "for the foundations of the city are the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<a name=16:45></a>" He presses the duty on all, that a categorical reply should be received as to this from all that professed to teach, because ambiguities were to be avoided in the church.<a name=16:46></a><a href="#16:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> "With respect to such passages, we have a right to expect a clear unhesitating answer from all who teach in the church.<a name=16:47></a>" Meanwhile brethren who took the opposite view were carefully kept away from Plymouth,<a href="#16:f4"><sup class="footnote-link">++++</sup></a> and letters in one unceasing stream went out from the sisters against the brethren who did not receive these views, and everything was said to discredit them to those who visited Plymouth.<a name=16:48></a> The whole teaching there was to settle people in them.<a name=16:49></a> In this no pains were spared, as to either strangers arriving or those who had leisure at Plymouth.<a name=16:50></a> The sisters in particular were carefully taught, and held meetings in their respective districts to retail what they had heard at the principal meetings held for that purpose.<a name=16:51></a> The poor were in general starved as to feeding them with Christ.<a name=16:52></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#16:f3"><sup>+++</sup></a>It is well that it should be known that, though this is the ground still taken as the reason for denouncing the "brethren," Mr. Newton has entirely given up the main point of his prophetic views, insisted on in these letters. The whole of the second letter, to refer to nothing else, is occupied with the proof of the saints of the Christian church being in tribulation. Indeed every one conversant with these matters, knows that it was a test of the holding of Mr. Newton's views. We were told what a mercy of God to prepare us for it by testimony. Indeed the fact is too well-known to require further proof. People were planning leaving the limits of the Roman earth, to be out of it; Mr. Newton now (both by argument in the "Thoughts on the Apocalypse," and in express terms in the "Thoughts on the End of the Age") declares that they will not.

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#16:f4"><sup>++++</sup></a>I am well aware that this is denied by the five signers of the letter to the brethren in London. But in the first place it is perfectly well known to multitudes of the brethren. Moreover Mr. Newton had been spoken to about it before I arrived at Plymouth. He answered, that he could not help their breaking bread, if they came, but it was a yoke he was obliged to put up with, and that they would have no welcome from him. Anyone can understand the effect of conduct answering to such language, unless a person came to contest the point with Mr. N. Mr. H. was asked, when saying at the last meeting in April that he should invite the Irish brethren, could he give them this invitation from the others at Plymouth, and he could not say he could. Further, confession, public confession was made of it by two of those who signed that paper by one with "if any have been kept away," by another without. It was owned in private by one of these, and Mr. N. was spoken to by him about it, saying that they had done so, and that he had participated in the sin. I am fully aware everything will be denied But this must not arrest the plain statement of facts for brethren. The writing of letters by the sisters discrediting the brethren was attempted to be called in question too; but brethren being present in the April meeting who had seen them, and having declared that heretic was too good a name for the Irish brethren in their letters, it was no longer attempted to be disputed.

Though I have a perfect recollection of these words being used, yet as being in animated conversation and a general representation, it is desired to correct this by saying that what Irish brethren held and taught was spoken of as heresy.

		When speaking was really impossible for unallowed brethren, some of these read a chapter in the Bible sometimes.<a name=24:10></a> This was stopped as hindering the ministry.<a name=24:11></a> This happened to three different brethren; to one of them it was one of the ruling sisters who went.<a name=24:12></a> The brother, a reserved and blameless brother, was told that he could read his Bible at home, and that he hindered the ministry.<a name=24:13></a> He read no more.<a name=24:14></a> In another of those cases Mr.<a name=24:15></a> Newton himself interfered, and when asked whose ministry had been hindered, and having stated, the brother went to that person, who replied that it had only been hindered by Mr.<a name=24:16></a> Newton.<a name=24:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the teaching I heard in Ebrington Street from Mr.<a name=24:18></a> Newton, the one undeviating object seemed to be to teach differently from what brethren had taught, no matter what, so that it set their teaching aside.<a name=24:19></a> This was so marked in many cases as to draw the attention of others besides myself.<a name=24:20></a>

		And now as to the circumstances connected with rule and authority.<a name=24:21></a> It is alleged that we are radicals, and look for democracy.<a name=24:22></a> I trust brethren will seek nothing but the guidance of God's blessed Spirit.<a name=24:23></a> But what are the facts?<a name=24:24></a> There was a meeting from the earliest period called the Friday meeting, where those who laboured habitually among the saints and were occupied with their concerns met to consult together, instead of acting apart or isolatedly; and where many little things, such as arise everywhere, were settled in the fear of God, while what became matters of public discipline were presented to the assembly at large.<a name=24:25></a> There may be trouble between brethren happily terminated without the need of shewing them up in public before a whole assembly.<a name=24:26></a> If public discipline be needed, then it is clear from scripture the assembly must judge, and act to clear the consciences of all, <i>their own consciences</i>.<a name=24:27></a> But then this is a very painful case.<a name=24:28></a> However such a meeting there was, and, with the difficulties and trials incident to all things, went on with the confidence of the saints.<a name=24:29></a> Latterly, but after the lapse of a good many years, when Capt.<a name=24:30></a> H.<a name=24:31></a>, Sir A.<a name=24:32></a>C.<a name=24:33></a> and myself were no longer at Plymouth, Mr.<a name=24:34></a> Newton absented himself: only, when any case arose on which he had formed an opinion, and wished to interfere, he came down at the close of the meeting, inquired how it was settled, and insisted on its being judged his own way, setting aside what had been done where it did not accord with his mind.<a name=24:35></a> Mr.<a name=24:36></a> R.<a name=24:37></a>H.<a name=24:38></a> remonstrated once or twice against this procedure.<a name=24:39></a> This was received with great anger by Mr.<a name=24:40></a> Newton, and the practice being still followed, Mr.<a name=24:41></a> R.<a name=24:42></a>H.<a name=24:43></a> told Mr.<a name=24:44></a> H.<a name=24:45></a> that it was idle their meeting if things went on thus, and left.<a name=24:46></a> It lingered on awhile and finally closed about two years ago, it being impossible to bring them together again.<a name=24:47></a> Mr.<a name=24:48></a> H.<a name=24:49></a> however laboured at its restoration, but in vain, the following circumstance having occurred.<a name=24:50></a> On the occasion of the burial of a poor person on Sunday (which the poor always desire as their attendance is more easy, and which had been disallowed at Ebrington Street), the son of the deceased insisted on it.<a name=24:51></a> He came from a distance.<a name=24:52></a> Mr.<a name=24:53></a> S -- s, who was habitually the resort of the poor in similar cases, sent him to Mr.<a name=24:54></a> H.<a name=24:55></a> He was away.<a name=24:56></a> Mr.<a name=24:57></a> S -- s then told him to go and get the grave dug, and on Sunday morning he mentioned it to the assembly at the close of the meeting.<a name=24:58></a> Mr.<a name=24:59></a> Newton went over to him in great anger and told him it was impossible to go on with him any longer, etc.<a name=24:60></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#31:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The doctrine decidedly taught there was that the Holy Ghost, who was sovereign, wrought in the body by members, and that these members were the gifted teachers. I am aware that the five brethren who signed the circular letter say, "we do not hold that the Holy Spirit resides only in the teachers." I am aware they do not. But they did teach that it was by gifted members He acted in the body, that is, by teachers. And every one knows, that anyone's taking a part in the meeting as led of the Spirit to do so was denounced as "impulse." Moreover I know that, since this has been under press, it has been pressed at Plymouth, that it was by instruments prepared before they went to the meeting that God acted in it. And long ago, when praying and hymns were urged as not being gifts, it was admitted, but answered that only gifted persons would take part in either. It will be remarked in the statement referred to, that it is carefully avoided saying, that the Holy Spirit acts in the assembly. But on this hereafter.

		The other thing which formed the subject of charge was this.<a name=35:1></a> Mr.<a name=35:2></a> Newton published the first letter of the five, which had been circulating six years in MS.<a name=35:3></a>, denouncing the brethren, with the following advertisement: "The following letter was written some years ago, in reply to the inquiries of a friend, who resides in Norfolk.<a name=35:4></a> It is now published with some omissions and alterations, but in substance it remains the same.<a name=35:5></a>" What was my astonishment to find, on comparing it, that a quarter nearly of the printed matter was not in the MS.<a name=35:6></a> letter at all; partly mixed up, but chiefly added at the end; and that the new matter consisted of reasonings against the doctrines he was charged with holding now as to the authority of teachers.<a name=35:7></a> So that these charges appeared most wanton and unfounded, inasmuch as six years ago the person charged had actually written against the things he now was charged with.<a name=35:8></a> This is all woven in at the end of the letter, so as to form part of it.<a name=35:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An aged person, whom it is needless to name, who had long been opposed to and kept aloof from brethren, who himself preached, but whose congregation had died away, came into communion and began to minister on Sunday morning.<a name=37:2></a> He did not do so, strange to say, in general, when Mr.<a name=37:3></a> Newton was not there; at least when I was.<a name=37:4></a> I cannot answer for other occasions.<a name=37:5></a> But I heard him on week evenings.<a name=37:6></a> Though there was nothing unorthodox or wrong in his teaching, yet I did not at all think he was led of the Spirit of God in it, and when he came to speak to me about these things afterwards, I told him so.<a name=37:7></a> I was not at Plymouth when he joined, but I told Mr.<a name=37:8></a> H.<a name=37:9></a> I thought his joining was, under the circumstances, a chastisement; but if they put away the chastisement instead of the thing they were chastised for, they would have worse.<a name=37:10></a> Mr.<a name=37:11></a> H.<a name=37:12></a> spoke to him with no adequate effect at any rate.<a name=37:13></a> But Mr.<a name=37:14></a> B.<a name=37:15></a> one Sunday morning, being left (practically) in charge of the meeting as was customary, the other chief leaders being absent, the old gentleman got up to speak while the alms box was going round after the communion.<a name=37:16></a> Mr.<a name=37:17></a> B.<a name=37:18></a> pulled him back to his seat by the tail of his coat, and on the return of the box closed the meeting.<a name=37:19></a> A brother, well known and esteemed, long suffering under the state of things, remonstrated; and another urging, just after when the first was not listened to, that the first had said that if this went on he must leave, Mr.<a name=37:20></a> B.<a name=37:21></a> replied, Let him.<a name=37:22></a>

		This person however was not to be daunted by this; and one day, when he got up to speak at the Sunday morning meeting, the sisters tried to put him down by scraping with their feet.<a name=37:23></a> At this period I sat among the communicants, taking no part in general publicly in the service, though I once said something on a week evening.<a name=37:24></a> I was quiescent.<a name=37:25></a> That Sunday I was present.<a name=37:26></a> The next I was not, and then, as he rose to speak again, the sisters and some brethren began leaving, and before the close of the meeting one sister came and patted him on the back and told him, if he went on that way, all would leave.<a name=37:27></a> The Sunday following, before the brother who broke bread reached his seat to sit down, Mr.<a name=37:28></a> N.<a name=37:29></a> jumped up so as to prevent anyone's speaking.<a name=37:30></a><a href="#37:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

I give the statement therefore as to the remonstrance merely as I heard it just after, of which I have an absolute certainty. The fact of the teaching is unquestionable. I will add here the ground on which it was based: Christ's prayer could not but have been answered; hence He could have asked it only for the apostles in their time; that we have the heavenly blessing in this respect; they had the heavenly and earthly. It will be seen how entirely this confirms what is stated as to the assertions made as to unity in the letter of the five to the London brethren commented on.

		To pursue the subsequent facts.<a name=74:1></a> You have all seen the letter of Sir A.<a name=74:2></a>C.<a name=74:3></a>, and the way in which the judgment of the brethren was utterly rejected in principle.<a name=74:4></a> I need not repeat here his plain statement.<a name=74:5></a> Mr.<a name=74:6></a> C.<a name=74:7></a> on another occasion alleged the passage in Matthew 18.<a name=74:8></a> "Tell it to the church," and not only tell it to the church but "if he neglect to <i>hear</i> the church.<a name=74:9></a>" This also was rejected.<a name=74:10></a> If told to the church, it was said they could not act on it as a body, though individuals might come and state their judgment.<a name=74:11></a> To Mr.<a name=74:12></a> W.<a name=74:13></a> the same principle was maintained, by another who acts as teacher and ruler, on the occasion of taking up the chapel in Raleigh Street.<a name=74:14></a> Mr.<a name=74:15></a> W.<a name=74:16></a> stated that if there could be any appeal to any from the alleged evil which had driven away many long-known brethren, he would seek still to go through with the matter in Ebrington Street.<a name=74:17></a> He was told there was none, he had only to submit if those who held the place of rulers were concerned and did not act, and this even if it were a crime they were charged with themselves.<a name=74:18></a> Since then it has been taught openly that it is wrong for the church to act judicially, and that it could call no one to its bar; and the other two, not included in the previous statements, who have assumed the place of teachers or rulers, or both, confirm the principle that it must be left to the rulers, and that the church must judge by its representatives.<a name=74:19></a> Such is the way godly conscientious persons have been met.<a name=74:20></a> At any rate it is notorious that, in whatever terms it may have been expressed, the principle has been deliberately and systematically acted upon, when there was evil enough judged to be there by many godly brethren to drive them away.<a name=74:21></a> There was no remedy.<a name=74:22></a> Here then I get at the broad principle of the congregation meeting in Ebrington Street: -- <i>the church cannot judge evil</i>.<a name=74:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another has been brought clearly out by the presence of these brethren.<a name=74:24></a> They were not allowed to interfere because they were strangers and not of the congregation in Ebrington Street.<a name=74:25></a> This was distinctly asserted and maintained: -- <i>the unity of the body is denied</i>.<a name=74:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a third point which has been brought out by the visit of these brethren.<a name=74:27></a> Mr.<a name=74:28></a> Newton has declared, in substance, that he would pursue what would produce everywhere <i>united hostility</i> in every gathering to the teaching of the brethren whose doctrines he disapproved of.<a name=74:29></a> Now with this I can have no fellowship, nor sustain it by public association with those who seek it.<a name=74:30></a> Until it be openly and distinctly judged by the assembly, they are parties to it now that it is avowed either acquiescing in it under the plea of preserving unity, or at least helping it on unconsciously.<a name=74:31></a> I could be no party to their doing either.<a name=74:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=75>[Page 75]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while party sectarianism is avowed, and for this alone I should feel bound (separate from evil, and identifying myself in heart with its low estate) to take my place in the unity of God's true church and away from what I believe to be thus avowedly sectarian, still I would not dwell farther on this now.<a name=75:1></a> There are other principles in the facts I have mentioned which I present to the consciences of brethren.<a name=75:2></a> The fact that these brethren known to all, who came from elsewhere, were not allowed to meddle with the affair here, because they were not of Plymouth or of the gathering in Ebrington Street, is a direct denial of the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=75:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a question of deference for those habitually here: I never heard the brethren who came accused of want of that.<a name=75:4></a> It is a question of principle.<a name=75:5></a> From the outset their interference was rejected on this ground.<a name=75:6></a> The unity of the body is therefore denied, and any gift or wisdom which other brethren who do not reside here possess cannot be exercised freely in the body.<a name=75:7></a> The gathering in Ebrington Street is a sectarian party everywhere, or an independent church, and the true unity of the body of Christ is denied there.<a name=75:8></a> It is useless to say that all saints are admitted to communion.<a name=75:9></a> So they would be in any other independent church in the kingdom.<a name=75:10></a> The real unity of the body as a whole is denied.<a name=75:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, the judgment of evil is positively refused to the church in defiance of direct plain scriptures.<a name=75:12></a> "Do ye not judge them that are within?<a name=75:13></a>" "If he neglect to hear the church.<a name=75:14></a>" "Put out from among yourselves that wicked person.<a name=75:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here comes out another principle.<a name=75:16></a> The teacher and his authority are set above the written word.<a name=75:17></a> The word says "judge.<a name=75:18></a>" The rulers say you must not judge, and the fact is no judgment takes place.<a name=75:19></a> Perhaps, if the rulers bring a member before the body, the body may be suffered to excommunicate him; they have, that is, an executive and not a deliberative capacity.<a name=75:20></a> That is, when the rulers have deliberated and resolved (for I suppose there is to be some deliberation), the body is to execute; but the exercise of conscience or spiritual judgment by the Holy Ghost working in the body is not for them at all.<a name=75:21></a> This is what in principle has actually taken place.<a name=75:22></a> If those who have assumed the place of rulers <i>commit even a crime, there is no remedy</i> but to leave it to the Lord -- none in any way.<a name=75:23></a> The body cannot judge: and if brethren, ever so gifted, come from elsewhere, they cannot be allowed to interfere, for they are strangers.<a name=75:24></a> There is an absolutely irresponsible body of rulers who have assumed the place to themselves (for who placed them there?<a name=75:25></a>) who can sin as they think fit till God is pleased to interfere.<a name=75:26></a> The gathering in Ebrington Street, besides being sectarian is really an independent church which has no power to judge evil, with irresponsible rulers who have assumed this place, and cannot be judged by anybody for anything they do.<a name=75:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=76>[Page 76]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For these two reasons, my brethren, I cannot own a table in Ebrington Street in any way.<a name=76:1></a> I look for two things especially as constituting distinctively the table of the Lord.<a name=76:2></a> First, the unity of the body of Christ -- we are one body as partakers of one bread; secondly, that it should be a holy table.<a name=76:3></a> Both are denied in Ebrington Street.<a name=76:4></a> I do not mean that there are not individuals who believe in the unity of the body, and who are holy persons and desire holiness; I do not the least doubt it.<a name=76:5></a> I speak of the principle for which they are responsible there.<a name=76:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence further, I fear nothing of the charge of a second table.<a name=76:7></a> There are many tables in Plymouth, and where dear saints too go conscientiously: but they do not, I judge, rightly own (in terms they would admit it as much as Ebrington Street) the unity of the body.<a name=76:8></a> Now I doubt that in any of them the friendly and gracious intervention of known brethren to help them through a trying case would have been rejected, as it has been in the gathering here; and certainly none would hold that there was no remedy at all for evil in their rulers but to leave it to the Lord.<a name=76:9></a> But I do not judge, we do not judge, they are what we seek for at the Lord's table; and I do not go there, and you do not go there.<a name=76:10></a> I act then as I acted seventeen years ago, believing that, where two or three are gathered together in Christ's name, there He is.<a name=76:11></a> I do not speak of a second table as regards Ebrington Street, more than I should say a fifth or sixth, if I began to break bread where there were four or five other dissenting bodies already established in a place.<a name=76:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have given, in principle, my reasons why I do not own Ebrington Street at all, though I love, and look to God for grace to continue to love, the saints who go there.<a name=77:1></a> God forbid I should not: for I count them members of Christ's body, however they may divide it.<a name=77:2></a> I appeal <i>now</i> to their judgment as saints.<a name=77:3></a> But while the unity of the body is denied in fact, and the judgment of any evil doers is refused to the body, I cannot recognize their way nor them as the body of Christ at all as to their actual position.<a name=77:4></a> Do you really think, beloved brethren, that absolute irresponsibility as to evil for all who can assume the place of rulers is the principle of the church of God, being neither remediable within, nor others allowed to interfere?<a name=77:5></a> "I speak as unto wise men; judge ye what I say.<a name=77:6></a>" You will find, and it is worthy of note, that in the first to the Corinthians, where directions are given as to these things, they are addressed to all saints, and no rulers or elders are mentioned in the matter.<a name=77:7></a> The point was to have the conscience of the body clear.<a name=77:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe then, that the two great principles of the church of God -- unity and holiness -- have been denied at Ebrington Street; not as to individuals, I mean nothing of that, but I speak of that on which the table spread there is based as a principle.<a name=77:9></a> I cannot therefore own it.<a name=77:10></a> I do not recur to what made me leave it, but to the judgment which what has passed since leads me to form of it.<a name=77:11></a> Till judgment of evil and unity were rejected I could be in suspense.<a name=77:12></a> Now they are rejected.<a name=77:13></a> But I shall say what I judge as to the whole matter, and as to the brethren who came here.<a name=77:14></a> As regards those who came here or who acted when here in a determined party spirit -- to them I say that all I desire is, that, if their consciences do ever recognize this, they may be assured that they have my full and hearty forgiveness, as I do not doubt that they will then have the Lord's: but as to the brethren in general who came -- there are several whom I love and value very highly, and whose judgment in ordinary cases I should be most thankful to have and generally would rather have had than my own; but I judge that with one or two exceptions, which of course I do not name, their faith<a href="#77:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> was not equal to the emergency in which they found themselves.<a name=77:15></a> They might have confined themselves to obtaining information for the guidance of their own conduct, or they might, as members of the body of Christ, have identified themselves with the body here, and strengthened and acted in and with it according to their gift and grace.<a name=77:16></a> They did neither; they went beyond one, and they failed to do the other.<a name=77:17></a> They will forgive my putting this my judgment plainly before them and the brethren.<a name=77:18></a> Still the Lord ordered all for good, however painfully.<a name=77:19></a> Their coming has made the state of things and principles quite plain to every heedful conscience.<a name=77:20></a> The Lord is always faithful and cannot leave His people, however miserable they are.<a name=77:21></a> I believe He never shewed Himself so much in favour of the brethren and their principles as His, as in this matter, but it will decidedly sift all and elsewhere too in a great measure as well as here.<a name=77:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally I admit that it is a very serious thing to quit any body of Christians; but it is equally serious to remain where the table is based on principles which make it not the Lord's in truth.<a name=78:18></a> Moreover unity with Ebrington Street is not unity with the body of Christ; nay, it is the contrary now to me.<a name=78:19></a> And the insisting on the doctrine of unity to prevent the judging of evil, and that by the consciences of the saints, and assuming it into the hands of the rulers, is one of the very worst forms of evil, if not the very worst form which exists.<a name=78:20></a> Unity is insisted on by Rome, and on that account evil within is not allowed to be judged by the consciences of the saints.<a name=78:21></a> The representatives and rulers have that in their hands, though they may and do associate to themselves the body in doing it.<a name=78:22></a>

		ACCOUNT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT RAWSTORNE STREET, IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, 1846, WITH AN ANSWER TO THE "REASONS" CIRCULATED IN JUSTIFICATION OF THE REFUSAL OF MR. NEWTON TO MEET THE BRETHREN

	<div class="heading">
		PART 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it be a sad thing to be engaged in such an affair as that which occupies the saints at this moment, it is a matter of great comfort to be directed of God in it.<a name=81:1></a> It has been the conviction of the saints in Rawstorne Street, that they could not enter into reasons for not clearing their own consciences in the matter of evil charged against a brother who had refused to meet them on those charges; and that they must act on the fact of his refusal, when every means had been used to induce that brother to retract it and meet them; the rather, as they understood, that these reasons, as is now evident, would force them into the whole question of what had passed at Plymouth, and the merits of the case, as it had occurred there.<a name=81:2></a> This they felt under the circumstances incompetent to enter into.<a name=81:3></a> Mr.<a name=81:4></a> Newton was not present to reply for himself; witnesses as to the facts were not there.<a name=81:5></a> Had I made a statement, they could have only judged of its correctness <i>ex parte</i>.<a name=81:6></a> Moreover it was not what they had to do.<a name=81:7></a> They had to act on the repeated refusal of Mr.<a name=81:8></a> Newton to satisfy their consciences; and on that ground and that alone they did act, having come to the conclusion that if he refused to satisfy them, he could not come to communion with them till he did.<a name=81:9></a> That refusal was finally given; and they thereupon wrote a letter to inform him, that he could not communicate till there was a full investigation.<a name=81:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think they were bound to act so, and that the Lord guided them.<a name=81:11></a> Still I felt, having acted as the discipline of the church of God required, it would be satisfactory if the "Reasons" alleged for refusing to meet them came before the saints and were fairly examined; and I thought of applying to those who had attached their signatures to them to print them, and then I could reply.<a name=81:12></a> This thought was in my mind only the morning after the meeting at which the final letter to Mr.<a name=81:13></a> N.<a name=81:14></a> was drawn up, when I found, on going out, that they were already widely circulated in print among the brethren in London, before the letter communicating the judgment of the brethren had been closed by those entrusted to sign and send it.<a name=81:15></a> This publication of the "Reasons" has given full opportunity for entering into them; and it is to me a source of unfeigned satisfaction, though at the same time of sorrow, that the whole thing has come out into the light.<a name=81:16></a>

I need hardly say, as you are acquainted with the contents of my note to Mr. Newton, I was a good deal surprised to receive a letter in reply from Mr. S. and afterwards one from yourself. Under other circumstances, of course, it would have afforded me nothing but pleasure to hear from either of you. I have not yet received the papers you speak of; but I suppose they may reach me to-morrow, however unavailable in my hands for the purpose for which I suppose they are sent. Indeed I have already acted on Mr. S.'s note as definitive to my own mind, on the only point about which I communicated with Mr. Newton. He tells me that he and others have counselled Mr. Newton to *decline* my proposal; and this I communicated to the saints at Rawstorne Street (as I did his refusal to meet the request of ten brethren who had written to him on the preceding Thursday evening), expressing at the same time most fully my thoughts and judgment about such a course. I now leave the saints there to act further in the matter as the Lord may give them wisdom and grace. In entering upon this matter, which I did at the request of dear Dr. C., it was my determination by the Lord's grace to act simply if I could not act wisely: so that Mr. Newton may judge my surprise and disappointment at the way in which he has treated my letter. He might have remonstrated against it if he had thought fit; but at least he should not have supposed I would express a purpose as strongly as I knew how today, and then act upon the very opposite to-morrow. All I can say is, if he or the brethren thought fit to send reasons at all, it ought to have been evident to them that I was not the person to whose hands they should be committed. My letter was a sufficient warning as to that. I can quite understand the assigning of reasons against a person's being condemned unheard, or against partiality in judgment: but I see no place for reasons why a person who has been charged with guilt should not answer at all. At my declining, therefore, to read any reasons that may come to me to the saints at Rawstorne Street, you must not be grieved, as it is only declining in act what I had already done by letter. I might speak of the sorrow of my heart in this matter, but this is known to the Lord. <p>"Yours, affectionately, in Christ, <p>"W. H.

It was not without or against the wish of those who labour among them; but quite the contrary. In many cases those who do so have felt able to present the matter at once to the body, as being very simple: in other cases, where it involved in a more anxious way the consciences of all, this previous communication to all has been made.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am exceedingly thankful for the publication of these papers.<a name=98:1></a> The saints have now Mr.<a name=98:2></a> Newton's "Defence," and his friends' "Reasons" for his not meeting the saints.<a name=98:3></a> In a word they have the case before them.<a name=98:4></a> While the brethren in London were discussing the question of how to judge the case before them, I refrained from taking any part whatever.<a name=98:5></a> In the last two meetings, after Mr.<a name=98:6></a> Newton had refused to meet them at all, I felt free to take a part, because the merits of the case were not in question, but the competency of saints to clear their consciences of evil; but though provoked by multiplied assertions of proofs of innocence and reasons, I refrained from all answer whatever to these, and refused to say a word on the merits of the case or on the "Reasons" (though it was very trying to me), because it would not have been fair on my part.<a name=98:7></a> The printing and distribution of the "Reasons" and "Defence" have set me perfectly free as to this.<a name=98:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are one or two general remarks which I would make.<a name=98:10></a> In the first place these documents set up my narrative on the highest ground of fairness.<a name=98:11></a> For this reason -- three things are here alleged<a href="#98:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> as clearing Mr.<a name=98:12></a> Newton, namely, the acquittal by the brethren who went down, which he suppressed; the letter written by a certain number of them, here published; and the acquittal by the four who sign the "Reasons.<a name=98:13></a>" Now I have stated all these things in the "Narrative.<a name=98:14></a>" The letters of Mr.<a name=98:15></a> R.<a name=98:16></a> and Lord C.<a name=98:17></a> I could not give, because I had them not, but I have stated their existence.<a name=98:18></a> The alleged acquittal, suppressed by Mr.<a name=98:19></a> Newton himself as ruining him, so that he declared he would go to Canada if it came out, I felt to be the best thing for him which he had got, as he now feels it to be; and I stated that there was such a document, and its substance, although he had got it suppressed.<a name=98:20></a> I will discuss it farther on.<a name=98:21></a> I allude to it now as a proof of the fairness of the "Narrative.<a name=98:22></a>" I have stated also the acquittal by the four who sign the "Reasons.<a name=98:23></a>"

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#98:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Nothing else indeed is alleged save the fact of investigation by the four signers of the "Reasons," who present themselves as being the persons who addicted themselves at Plymouth to the ministry of the saints. On this two questions arise. Are they the persons who stand, and stand alone in this place as the persons to whom the conscience of the church is to be entrusted (they deny that the body itself can inquire)? Are they really those who exclusively could assume the place in which, without supposing a possibility of question by any, they set themselves up here? and secondly, if they are, did they really make such inquiry as they pretend? This I shall examine farther on. For the present I refer to the acquittals themselves, which Mr. Newton professes to have already received previously. I have stated these in the "Narrative" already. Whatever could be said in the "Narrative" in this way for Mr. N., all he has said here of acquittals given by others, I have stated there. (See pages 74, 79, and 80.) Their value we will inquire into here. If anything could place my "Narrative" above suspicion it is this defence. For all that is alleged here of testimony in Mr, Newton's favour is found there already.

		But I must now draw the saints' attention to what they do say.<a name=100:1></a> After stating that the four who sign are implicated in the main bulk of the charges in the "Narrative," they continue: -- "The only exception is in the case of the charges of personal untruthfulness.<a name=100:2></a> Of these specific charges our brother Newton is the only object.<a name=100:3></a> Now as to these: it might be quite sufficient for us to refer you to his own paper, entitled 'A Defence<a href="#100:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> in Reply to the Personal Accusations of Mr.<a name=100:4></a> Darby,' a copy of which accompanies this letter.<a name=100:5></a>" .<a name=100:6></a>.<a name=100:7></a>.<a name=100:8></a> "Now we understand your letter to refer only to these last-mentioned charges.<a name=100:9></a>" .<a name=100:10></a>.<a name=100:11></a>.<a name=100:12></a> "These charges were" -- and then they give their statement of the charges alleged to have been made at the meeting at Ebrington Street in November, 1845, and <i>never notice the charges in the "Narrative" at all</i>.<a name=100:13></a> God is my witness, brethren, that I wish I had never heard of them again, and that they were all proved untrue.<a name=100:14></a> I would bear the shame with joy, if it could be so; but that is not the question here.<a name=100:15></a> The plea here against meeting them is, that they have been inquired into, and the accused acquitted of them.<a name=100:16></a> Of what?<a name=100:17></a> Of the charges in the "Narrative"?<a name=100:18></a> No: but of the charges at Plymouth in 1845, which appear<a href="#100:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> indeed in the "Narrative," but are by far the smallest part of the matter.<a name=100:19></a> And the reason why these only were mentioned then is evident.<a name=100:20></a> These particular matters were the reason for my leaving, and therefore I mentioned them alone at the meeting in Ebrington Street.<a name=100:21></a> I avoided anxiously every aggravation, and stated only what had led to my leaving, for this was what I was called upon to state.<a name=100:22></a> In my "Narrative" I stated the facts in general, avoiding private ones.<a name=100:23></a> In the "Reasons" these four go back to the Ebrington Street meeting, and declare that the charges <i>made there</i> were disposed of, and never make the smallest allusion to the charges in the "Narrative.<a name=100:24></a>" These remain untouched; the most important of them were not alluded to in the meeting at Ebrington Street, nor in the inquiry which followed; and some of them happened after both 'the meeting' and 'the inquiry,' though in the affairs connected with them.<a name=100:25></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#100:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>You would suppose, reader, I dare say, that this "Defence" referred to the contents of the "Narrative." Not at all. It was written nearly a year before the "Narrative" came out, and alludes to only two of the charges contained in it. The word "these" in paragraph 3 of page 1 of the "Reasons" refers to the charges in the "Narrative." But "these" in "Now as to *these*," in paragraph 4, which would be supposed to be the same, refers only to those alluded to in the meeting at Plymouth in 1845, and not to those in the "Narrative." The unsuspecting reader thinks that they are the same, and that he has in the "Defence" an answer to the charges in the "Narrative," whereas about a quarter of them only are referred to. The others had not then been made, the "Defence" having been written nearly a year before the charges in the "Narrative" came out. The reader must judge for himself of such a procedure.

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#100:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>Indeed only two of those found in the "Reasons" appear as charges in the "Narrative." Four are alleged to have been made in 1845. As to two of them (which I disown however as charges) so far from being acquitted, one of the reasons for which Mr. N. got the paper (now alleged to be an acquittal by the ten brethren) suppressed was, that he was not cleared of these two. Of course these two do not appear as charges in the "Narrative," for I have never allowed them to be such. So that it is only two out of the charges mentioned in the "Reasons," which appear amongst those found in the "Narrative" from which Mr. N. is said to be acquitted.

		The reader may here mark the difference of the two replies one has to deal with.<a name=102:1></a> Mr.<a name=102:2></a> Newton (in the letter to the ten) comes forward with a plain untruth, namely, that the other charges affect all at Plymouth.<a name=102:3></a> It will be answered, that the detection is so evident that he could not mean to deceive.<a name=102:4></a> (Mr.<a name=102:5></a> Newton uses this same plea in his defence.<a name=102:6></a>) But this is a mistake.<a name=102:7></a> Few carry the facts in their mind so as to detect the falsehood.<a name=102:8></a> If Mr.<a name=102:9></a> Newton's plausible statement is accredited, he appears an injured and aggrieved man; the fairest words are used: the person gets under his influence; once there no contradiction is listened to, no exposure read, a partisan is gained.<a name=102:10></a> The tact of the writer of the "Reasons" is more subtle.<a name=102:11></a> He states generally, "The only exception is, in the case of the charges of personal untruthfulness.<a name=102:12></a> Of these specific charges our brother Newton is the only object.<a name=102:13></a>" This seems fair enough.<a name=102:14></a> Then in page 2 a history is given of my conduct and charges at <i>Plymouth</i> in 1845, as to prophecy, sectarianism, and, finally, Mr.<a name=102:15></a> Newton's veracity.<a name=102:16></a> And then it is said, "Now we understand your letter to refer only to <i>these last-mentioned charges</i>.<a name=102:17></a> For of none others could it, in any way, be said that they are brought against our brother Newton only, and not against others.<a name=102:18></a> It is to satisfy the consciences of the saints as to <i>the things charged against his veracity</i><a href="#102:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> therefore, that we suppose you ask our brother Newton to appear before the saints in Rawstorne Street, etc.<a name=102:19></a> Now, we think it impossible that such a proposition could have been made by you, had you been aware of the way in which <i>these charges</i> have already been met and examined into in this place.<a name=102:20></a> <i>These charges</i> were," etc.<a name=102:21></a>; and then comes an elaborate account of what they allege to have been my charges in 1845 at Plymouth.<a name=102:22></a> Now the reader will naturally suppose -- he is left to suppose -- that the charges in page 2, thus entered on, are the same as those spoken of in page 1, and that Rawstorne Street had specifically these, and these only, before it.<a name=102:23></a> He would hardly suppose that "these specific charges" in page 1<a href="#102:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>, and "these charges were" in page 2, are quite a different matter, two only of the latter being found amongst the former.<a name=102:24></a> Page It refers to the charges in the "Narrative of Facts," which is thus subtly attempted to be swamped in what passed at Plymouth in 1845, where, as I have said, I confined myself (when called upon to state what led to my leaving) entirely to what had led to this, not wishing to bring charges, though I already knew of many other things; but they had not led to my <i>leaving</i>, and I said nothing about them.<a name=102:25></a> The alleged charges of 1845 are thus quietly assumed to be "the things charged against his veracity," and that "of none others could it be said that they are brought against Mr.<a name=102:26></a> Newton only.<a name=102:27></a>" But I turn to page 1, and I say with it there are "specific charges" in the "Narrative of Facts" -- of which three (besides two of those found here) may be read in one page of the "Narrative," besides others in other parts of it.<a name=102:28></a> And in a following page of the "Narrative" it is distinctly urged that they regard Mr Newton alone.<a name=102:29></a>

In answer to this I stated my complaint to him, whereupon he withdrew, in his reply, all the kindness expressed in his first. My note had accepted and returned the kindness, and stated "with sorrow of heart" the complaint I had to make; declaring that "as to difference of interpretation on points of scripture," objections could be stated if needed, but that when the need did not exist, I felt "a measure of difference comparatively immaterial, and but an exercise of grace."

		<a class="footnote" name="#106:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> These events were about five years ago, since which time these letters have been circulated. At that time I had, at the instance of brethren, remonstrated with Mr. Newton about them, but he persevered. As this matter is referred to in the "Defence," I shall state the circumstances, and give Miss J.'s account to me, which differs in its moral bearing from Mr. N.'s. I was invited to spend the evening at a married sister's of Miss J., which I accepted, as for common edification. When there, I found a large meeting, to my great surprise, exclusively of sisters. Brethren who came were sent away unknown to me. Miss J. said to me, You will speak to us on such prophetic points (those contained in the MS. letters). I was rather disgusted, and replied, Whatever the Lord may lead me to. Finding however their minds bent upon this, I thought well to let it go on, and presented the difficulties I had in receiving their views, ascertaining clearly myself that they had learned them from man and not God. Miss J., in my interview with her, after the meeting in 1845, told me she had met Mr. N. in Frankfort Street after the meeting at her sister's, and told him there were difficulties raised she should like to be satisfied about. Could Mr. N. furnish her with answers to them? Mr. N. thereupon furnished her with my letter to him containing the different objections, and shewed her how much she might copy, and gave her his answers. These objections and answers form the Appendix. Miss J.'s account of the copy books, which I first suggested to her however did not satisfy me, but as I attached no importance to it, I left it as it was, and published it at the end of the next thing I printed.

		All I said at the meeting was this, that "the first thing that made me uncomfortable was the renewed circulation of these letters, two of them being wanting" (I cannot answer for the word "suppressed"; I may have said in a copy in which two of them were "suppressed"), and in which an appendix was added as belonging to the first letter, which referred in a material part to one of the letters which was not in the book.<a name=107:1></a> My only words in pursuing the history of what led to my leaving were, "the first thing that made uncomfortable.<a name=107:2></a>" The facts are just exactly as I stated them.<a name=107:3></a> My charges <i>were quite distinct</i>.<a name=107:4></a> I shall go into them in a moment.<a name=107:5></a> It is possible this rested on Mr.<a name=107:6></a> N.<a name=107:7></a>'s mind with pain, as a charge, from Miss H.<a name=107:8></a>'s writing to him about it.<a name=107:9></a> I will touch on this when I come to it.<a name=107:10></a>

		First, as to the fact of the investigation by these four; they allege an investigation by the natural guides of Plymouth, and besides that by other brethren.<a name=109:7></a> There is a long statement contained in pages 3 to 8, to the effect that those co-operating in ministry (designated in the rest of the statement by the word "we," that is, the four who sign the "Reasons") felt that the charges "demanded a prompt and searching inquisition," and that this was gone into.<a name=109:8></a> It is then added in page 8, "But investigation into this matter has not been confined to the saints living here.<a name=109:9></a> The presence here, in December, 1845, of many brethren from other places (who came indeed expressly to investigate what was transpiring here) afforded an opportunity for yet farther inquisition into these personal charges; and these brethren did in a very patient protracted way go into the whole matter.<a name=109:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that there was a prompt and searching inquisition by the four ministering brethren at Plymouth,<a href="#109:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> which proved the charges were so groundless they were not worth communicating to the church, but the result of which was at last communicated to them, and satisfied the church; and there was a yet farther inquisition, in which other brethren did in a very patient and protracted way go into the whole matter.<a name=109:11></a> Now let us see on their own shewing how it was done.<a name=109:12></a> And let us consider first "the prompt and searching inquisition" by those who co-operated with Mr.<a name=109:13></a> Newton in ministry, that is, the four who sign the "Reasons," before we touch on the yet farther inquisition.<a name=109:14></a> Turn to page 3.<a name=109:15></a> "The first step towards such an inquiry (that is by the four ministers) was indeed taken by our brother Newton himself, though with our full and entire concurrence.<a name=109:16></a> He proposed that he should name four brethren, and our brother Darby other four, and that these eight should investigate the case, and report the result of their investigation to the church.<a name=109:17></a><a href="#109:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> Our brother Newton accordingly nominated four -- our brethren M.<a name=109:18></a>, Lord C.<a name=109:19></a>, Dr.<a name=109:20></a> C -- y, and W -- r; but our brother Darby declined to accede to this mode of investigation.<a name=109:21></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#109:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>This is not true. It was a proposal "to meet four nominated by him," and there is nothing said about the church; the words are "and report on the charges." On Mr. N.'s principles it could not be to the church as thereon judging it. Indeed, as appears in a subsequent letter, there was no thought of the church. They say, "We also differ from you entirely in thinking this a question of conscience to be referred only to the church of God. We regard it as a matter of fact, a simple question of evidence to be best dealt with by a few competent persons." Thus is just what I felt was the object, and to which I could not agree. In the same letter also, they say, "a given number of persons, one half to be named by yourself, the other by him." It will be at once seen by the letters given farther on, how this attempt to withdraw it from the church acted on my mind.

		I confess I was astounded at this (not at the fact, which, corrected as in the note, is true, unless it be the concurrence of the four who sign the reasons, which I know nothing about; but) that the first step of the co-operating ministers to make a prompt and searching inquisition was Mr.<a name=110:1></a> Newton's nominating four <i>other</i> persons to conduct it (a step taken by himself), and with four to be named by me, to report it, when closed to the church.<a name=110:2></a> That can hardly mean the inquiring ministers.<a name=110:3></a>

		What I believe<a href="#123:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> to have been the fact as to the paper, is this: -- Most of the brethren were satisfied as to the sectarianism, and thought it might be got rid of, but found the moral charges stood in the way -- Mr.<a name=123:1></a> Newton would listen to nothing else.<a name=123:2></a> I do not say all the brethren.<a name=123:3></a> M -- s and R -- s insisted after this on the clerical principle; and the latter openly deprecated the principles of brethren.<a name=123:4></a> But Lord C.<a name=123:5></a> says now, to all who will hear him, that he would not go to Ebrington Street, though he condemns my proceedings.<a name=123:6></a> He has declared to me, that he had not believed the sectarianism and clericalism charged till he went down, but then he did; and that he would not break bread there now.<a name=123:7></a> This being more or less felt by several, and the moral charges, "a dreadful encumbrance to the real question," several of the brethren having left, Sir A.<a name=123:8></a>C.<a name=123:9></a> thought he could bring it to an issue by going as far as possible in clearing Mr.<a name=123:10></a> Newton; and at the same time quieting me by saying he had laid himself open to the charges; and insisting besides on a full investigation before the church, which, in a subsequently published tract, he has stated he did, and indeed so informed me soon after the transaction, during which I was myself absent, the investigation being over.<a name=123:11></a> It was in my judgment an unadvised act, though with a godly intention, and God in fact set it aside altogether.<a name=123:12></a> I was not at Plymouth.<a name=123:13></a> I left it all to the Lord when not called to answer, which I seldom was -- only once by the whole number of brethren.<a name=123:14></a> Indeed (while many of these brethren I look up to and love most dearly and value much for both godliness and a wisdom I should far prefer to my own in their service in the church in most cases) in this matter my sober judgment is, that they came without the wisdom of God, remained without the strength of God with them, and departed without the honour of God upon them.<a name=123:15></a> How far my answer to P -- r contributed to this I do not pretend to say.<a name=123:16></a> However God interfered, as He overrules all; and though it went, no doubt, far beyond any other document in Mr.<a name=123:17></a> N.<a name=123:18></a>'s favour, he insisted on the suppression<a href="#123:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> of this paper.<a name=123:19></a> Sir A.<a name=123:20></a>C.<a name=123:21></a> withdrew it -- a strange procedure, if it were a solemn act of acquittal by the ten brethren.<a name=123:22></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#123:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>Let me notice a little here two things to the saint who reads this First, what was going on. A verdict is drawn up (now alleged by Mr Newton to be an acquittal of him by all) and signed by some of those inquiring, and then *submitted to Mr. Newton for his judgment on it*. [I do not know that Sir A.C. joined in this.] He rejects it as not good enough for him, and it is withdrawn! I am not impugning the integrity of the persons concerned; I have no more doubt of it than of my own. But any one will feel that it must have been a tolerable trial to have seen what I had been anxiously seeking to serve God in get on this kind of ground. Did they ever think of submitting anything to me? Never a moment, and they were quite right. I complain nothing of this. And now see, secondly, the good of trusting God. These brethren never troubled themselves about me in the matter. They were anxious to get rid of the charges of untruth, in order to deal with the sectarianism they met with; and prepared to swamp the other question as an encumbrance, and quiet me, without consulting me, by some general expressions, at the same time Sir A.C. quieting his own conscience by demanding, as he has publicly stated he did, an open investigation. All this I knew nothing of, good or bad, till afterwards, nor indeed of anything that passed. One would have thought it a fine opportunity for Mr. Newton to quash the charges and all inquiry. These brethren were anxious to get rid of them (indeed they told me so twenty times, that they stood altogether in the way). God would not allow it, and employs Mr. Newton himself to suppress it. They would have gone as far as ever they could to clear him, in order to get rid of the question: God steps in, and the very person they were going to clear He employs to set aside all their plan. How wonderful are His ways!

page 20, he had been speaking in the old part of the body gathered on the Abrahamic basis.<a name=128:30></a> Thus begins the new, "It would be happy if we could pursue the history of this new family of faith, and find that it preserved its likeness to Abraham its father.<a name=128:31></a>" "The succeeding chapter, the thirteenth of Matthew," etc.<a name=128:32></a> "The commencement of the history of the present professing Christian body by the personal ministry of the Lord," etc.<a name=128:33></a> "It would be strange if such a parable should belong to some other body, and not to the visible church at all .<a name=128:34></a>.<a name=128:35></a>.<a name=128:36></a> .<a name=128:37></a> I may also observe, before I conclude, that the almost invariable effect of the Jewish principle of interpretation [the general topic is here continued of the tract], is to throw into such a state of perplexity, etc.<a name=128:38></a>, into felt inability to divide the word, etc.<a name=128:39></a>, or else induces the adoption of the dictum of some favourite teacher under the shelter of whose name, etc.<a name=128:40></a>, and what is more to be deprecated than this?<a name=128:41></a> It would be, as if the Spirit of God resided only in the teachers, as if the saints could not for themselves prove all things, and hold fast that which is good.<a name=128:42></a> It would introduce one of the worst forms of Popish evil.<a name=128:43></a>" The tract then goes on warning against upsetting universal consent; thus gradually interweaving the original six-years-old subject had done it six years ago, the charge of shutting out the Spirit; and sustaining the doctrine of universal consent.<a name=128:44></a> Now, while spun out of the old, all this is new matter.<a name=128:45></a> I repeat again, I say nothing of intention; but is the thing honest at a moment of controversy on these points, in which he says he was charged with these very things?<a name=128:46></a> Others may think it honest; I confess, I have not much respect for his judgment of honesty who thinks it is.<a name=128:47></a> But the truth is, we have no need to speak of any judgment of honesty.<a name=128:48></a> Mr.<a name=128:49></a> N.<a name=128:50></a> first speaks largely of his charity in making the omissions which nobody said anything about, and then says, he added two paragraphs negativing charges made.<a name=128:51></a> Now any person accepting this answer could not (assuming him to be honest) have examined for himself the tract, <i>because there is nothing to be negatived at all</i>.<a name=128:52></a> The writer continues his discussion of the principles he is treating of in the tract, and his arguments against the principles of interpretation he is opposing, and, as <i>illustrating</i> this, shews that certain consequences follow in the mind which demonstrate the danger: which consequences (here of course to be taken as very evil) were the things he was charged (or says he was charged) with; and it was left to be supposed that he could not hold doctrines which he here treated as serious evil consequences.<a name=128:53></a> But though it really <i>was</i> another subject, it is carefully linked into the matter of the tract as a whole.<a name=128:54></a> There is no negative of anything; and then the doctrine of universal consent as a rule of faith, which had been objected to as of Popish tendency, is not negatived, but set up upon its legs again in a more subtle covert way, it having damaged their position when openly avowed previously.<a name=128:55></a> Now that I have the "Defence" to read, and have re-read that which I charged with unfairness, I have only to say, that I think very much worse, and on deeper grounds, of the thing I so charged: but I do see reason to credit what Mr.<a name=128:56></a> D.<a name=128:57></a> stated at the time, that it was he got Mr.<a name=128:58></a> Newton to add it; for the closing paragraph is very subtilely and covertly propping up Mr.<a name=128:59></a> D.<a name=128:60></a>'s argument in favour of <i>universal consent</i> as a rule of faith.<a name=128:61></a>

		Saints will judge whether there was need of being on one's guard, when I repeat to them the fact that, when, on urging the authority of teachers in one place, a brother replied, "But, after all, it is said, they were more noble, because they searched the scriptures whether these things were so," it was answered, that this was Jews searching Jewish scriptures; but that now that God had established gifts in the church, and raised up teachers, all that was changed.<a name=131:1></a> When the Plymouth system had reached this point, I judge it was high time to talk about popery.<a name=131:2></a> The truth is, it had ripened out of Plymouth more than the cautious leaders in Plymouth would put forward there; and I put the brethren on guard against the system.<a name=131:3></a> My attention had really in this been drawn to facts elsewhere, and not to Mr.<a name=131:4></a> Newton, as many brethren know.<a name=131:5></a> If Mr.<a name=131:6></a> Newton's conscience tells him that he was the guilty person, I shall not dispute it; for I believe, and have no doubt he was the source of it, but not a single word is said about it in the tract which is in answer to Mr.<a name=131:7></a> D.<a name=131:8></a>, <i>but the contrary</i>: and that is the question here.<a name=131:9></a> Mr.<a name=131:10></a> Newton's statement in the "Defence" is not true.<a name=131:11></a> I printed no charge against him.<a name=131:12></a> I was really thinking of something else much more important than charging him -- the safety of saints against an evil system which was ripening elsewhere.<a name=131:13></a> As to insinuations, I do not think anybody will charge me with its being my way.<a name=131:14></a> Mr.<a name=131:15></a> Newton's easy way of avoiding them would be to face the saints, and have it all out before himself.<a name=131:16></a> He has certainly thus far succeeded in putting one into a difficult position.<a name=131:17></a> One must let him go on, doing every kind of mischief, without taking notice of it, or speak of it behind his back; for as to coming fairly forward, he cannot be got to do it.<a name=131:18></a> If he thinks, that when saints see infinite mischief doing, they are not to speak what they think about it, he is mistaken.<a name=131:19></a> Or if he thinks his denial of it will be of any avail, when they know that it has been going on, he is mistaken in that too.<a name=131:20></a> Hundreds of saints are not to be exposed to subtle evil, because the person implicated in it chooses to complain of its being charged upon him when he denies it.<a name=131:21></a> I admit the difficulty is greater; that it is harder to walk in the fear of God, and not to step out of a perfectly just path.<a name=131:22></a> When one is dealing with such a course, one has to watch oneself the more as to the means used in convicting those guilty of it.<a name=131:23></a> But faith, which will always feel our own unworthiness, and not dare to walk out of the covert of God, will find the way, because it trusts God, who will bring every secret work into judgment, whether in our own consciences or otherwise, and make manifest the counsels of the heart, and take care of His beloved people.<a name=131:24></a>

		PART 3 -- THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An important general principle yet remains.<a name=137:4></a> In page 12 of the "Reasons," we find the following: "It is well known that we have always refused to acknowledge that the scripture recognises the whole body of assembled saints, as invested with authority and capacity to examine witnesses and debate<a href="#137:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> their verdict.<a name=137:5></a> This the church does, we believe, through those of its members capacitated by God for such service.<a name=137:6></a> It is in the sense just defined, that we have always denied that the congregated church is a deliberative assembly.<a name=137:7></a> Thus we have always maintained a testimony against the principles of the dissenters.<a name=137:8></a> If therefore from the period of our first gathering together in this place until now, we have steadily and invariably acted on this principle, can it be expected that we should depart from it in this matter?<a name=137:9></a>" It is evident this is of all importance.<a name=137:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And first, let me recall the fact, already noticed, that these four persons (who are quietly telling us what they did from the beginning) were not <i>there</i> in the beginning.<a name=137:11></a> Mr.<a name=137:12></a> S.<a name=137:13></a> was not converted till years after; and Mr.<a name=137:14></a> B.<a name=137:15></a> and Mr.<a name=137:16></a> D.<a name=137:17></a> joined years after; Mr.<a name=137:18></a> C -- w earlier, but a considerable time after, and he, for a very long time certainly, did not "addict himself to the ministry.<a name=137:19></a>" That is quite a new thing.<a name=137:20></a> So that "<i>we</i>" may pass with those who know nothing of Plymouth; but with me, who was there before the beginning and at it and after it, their putting themselves in such a place bears a very strange aspect.<a name=137:21></a> And there is another thing somewhat strange.<a name=137:22></a>

		These four were the persons charged, not indeed with the particular points of untruth -- but they were involved in all that which was connected with them, led to them, and followed them, and as to which these two charges of honesty were merely collateral.<a name=138:1></a> If the reader is not sure of this, I beg him to refer to page 1 of the "Reasons": "The main bulk of the charges affect us as much as they do him"; nay, as to the whole case, they say more, "We are, and we wish to be, closely identified with our brother in his present position.<a name=138:2></a>" They spoke too of the accusations, personal and others, as being made against them all, in their first letter to the four brethren who invited them to the London meeting, which was held in April last; alleging these accusations as a ground for not coming up and joining in it.<a name=138:3></a> And the fact is, at the time in which in these "Reasons" they profess <i>to have been inquiring</i> -- that is, as we have seen, while the brethren were down at Plymouth to do so -- these four appeared before them as associated with Mr.<a name=138:4></a> N.<a name=138:5></a> If I am not misinformed, he did not and would not appear without them.<a name=138:6></a> This inquiry included the charges of untruth.<a name=138:7></a> Is it not a little singular that persons, as to the bulk of the things charged, implicated as much as Mr.<a name=138:8></a> N.<a name=138:9></a> -- and, as to all of them, then associated and now closely identified with him -- should be the persons who were solemnly to investigate these very charges, so as to bind the church of God that it could not even debate its verdict?<a name=138:10></a> And let the reader note who it was that asked them.<a name=138:11></a> They state, and Mr.<a name=138:12></a> N.<a name=138:13></a> confirms it in letters already given, that he did.<a name=138:14></a> Everybody knows, that with the exception certain particular untruths, they were involved as accessories in the charges; nay, as to the letter on which one of the charges was made, one of them, Mr.<a name=138:15></a> C -- w, had got it written to himself, and got it printed (having been at the April meeting too, of which it gave an account); and Mr.<a name=138:16></a> D.<a name=138:17></a> declared that he got Mr.<a name=138:18></a> Newton to put the addition complained of in the charge as to the other printed letter; and that they had gone down to Mr.<a name=138:19></a> R -- e's, and had it added while the letter was in the press.<a name=138:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now as to the principle.<a name=139:11></a> I deny unqualifiedly that such was the method from the beginning; and I was conversant with it a long time before even Mr.<a name=139:12></a> Newton himself; who, though there indeed in the vacation and taking part, remained a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford a considerable time -- I cannot be precise as to how long.<a name=139:13></a> It is quite true that verdicts were not always, nay, very seldom debated, never <i>debated</i> that I know of.<a name=139:14></a> There was most happy confidence in those labouring; and, the Spirit of God working in them and the body happily, their judgment commended itself habitually to the consciences of all; and the cases of discipline were simple.<a name=139:15></a> But such a thought never was entertained (I cannot answer for Mr.<a name=139:16></a> N.<a name=139:17></a>) as imposing a verdict on the body, which it could not debate.<a name=139:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I would indeed remark, that Mr.<a name=139:19></a> Newton avowed to me, both alone, and as it has been recalled since to me, in the presence of Mr.<a name=139:20></a> Edward W -- d of Kendal, that his principles were entirely changed as to those very points of ministry, rule, and government.<a name=139:21></a><a href="#139:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> How then can those who now adopt his present ones have had those of the body from the beginning?<a name=139:22></a> But the fact is, the labouring brethren did habitually inquire, for to them the cases were constantly brought; and they used to meet on Friday; and all this seems very blameless and desirable.<a name=139:23></a> But they always communicated the result of their inquiries to the body, and their convictions, or the conclusion they came to; but as to imposing it as an undebatable verdict, it is wholly false.<a name=139:24></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#139:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It has been stated to me that Mr. S. declared that, had the principles on these points been what they were at first, he would not have stayed.

		I remember two cases of discipline.<a name=140:1></a> In one, a brother rose, and said he thought there had not been proper inquiry, and that there was a feeling against the person.<a name=140:2></a> The brother who communicated the case said, he thought the brother who rose could hardly be acquainted with the facts and say so.<a name=140:3></a> The latter at once felt himself alone in the meeting (as indeed, the case was a dreadful one, and most patiently investigated), and he sat down at once.<a name=140:4></a> In another case, a godly grave brother said, there was a want of clear information on one part of the case, or a deficiency of it, which could be supplied, and the case was suspended and nothing done.<a name=140:5></a> I repeat, the imposition of a verdict was never thought of.<a name=140:6></a> General acquiescence was true in fact; and it is happy when it is so.<a name=140:7></a> Indeed, most cases are known and simple, and have only to be communicated to the body, and there can be no question with any, if they believe the testimony of those who have taken it up.<a name=140:8></a> At Plymouth, those who laboured had confidence in the Lord, and in the body, and acted towards it with confidence, and hence the body had confidence in them.<a name=140:9></a> That this may have been abused by Mr.<a name=140:10></a> N.<a name=140:11></a> to the assumption of unscriptural authority, when he had driven away the counterpoise of others, is very likely, and, to my mind, an undoubted fact.<a name=140:12></a>

		Further, I recognize that guides, elders if you please in principle, can inform and clear up the consciences of a body of Christians.<a name=140:13></a> No doubt, if by reason of use they have their senses exercised to discern good and evil, and are deeply acquainted with God's ways in the scriptures and with the human heart, it is just their service in such case, and, I believe, God's order; and saints will be always thankful for it, as far as I have seen.<a name=140:14></a> One may have spiritual discernment to suggest what all may have spirituality enough to see is right when suggested, but never would themselves have thought of.<a name=140:15></a> An engineer makes a road of which every waggoner understands as well as he the goodness when it is made, though he could not have made it.<a name=140:16></a> But it is by no means necessarily a teacher that does this.<a name=140:17></a> I know brethren who never teach, whose spiritual judgment I would far rather have than that of any teachers I know.<a name=140:18></a> It used to be the effort, I well remember, to insist strongly against the absorption of all gift into the teacher and teaching, as may be seen in the "Christian Witness" -- a book Mr.<a name=140:19></a> N.<a name=140:20></a> justly designated for his purposes the most mischievous book that ever was written.<a name=140:21></a> But to impose a verdict which cannot be debated is the most monstrous thing that ever was heard of.<a name=140:22></a> It is pure unmasked popery -- the clergy dictating to the conscience of the church, which can only register and give their weight to its decrees.<a name=140:23></a> Is the conscience of the church to be disposed of thus by others, be they ever so wise?<a name=140:24></a> A thing may be urged on the church, insisted on; let it be that rebuke be given; but it is always to <i>bring the conscience of the church up to the right level</i>.<a name=140:25></a> This Paul did with Corinth, where, note, elders never appear at all; but he never acts for them without it.<a name=140:26></a> "You have proved yourselves clear in this matter.<a name=140:27></a>" This is the principle the apostle goes on.<a name=140:28></a> No doubt he could guide and rebuke them too, and tell them that he had judged the case already; but to impose a verdict on their consciences<a href="#140:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> they could not debate, not an apostle even attempts.<a name=140:29></a> How could that be proving <i>themselves</i> clear?<a name=140:30></a> It is monstrous.<a name=140:31></a> No one who reads scripture can question, however weak we may be now, that there were guides, leaders, who watched for souls as accountable to do it, men of reputation, and at that time appointed elders.<a name=140:32></a> But it is a very different thing to govern, or rule, or guide the church, which is scriptural, and to govern instead of and for the church, which is popish (and this is the claim these principles very distinctly set up), and then call the scriptural principles democracy.<a name=140:33></a> And even so the apostle declares he was as a nursing mother with the saints.<a name=140:34></a> And the government of the church is not a setting of points right, but of souls right, and therefore nothing is done unless the conscience of the church is carried into the act.<a name=140:35></a> It is evident that the apostle did bring the whole church round to separate from evil which he had already judged himself.<a name=140:36></a> Had he not done it, the Corinthians would not have been set right at all, they would have remained associated with the incestuous person.<a name=140:37></a> Had their consciences not heeded his appeal, he might in the exercise of apostolic authority have used severer means, and come with a rod.<a name=140:38></a> But he is anxious to shew, that whom <i>they forgave</i> he forgave; and if he forgave, it was for their sakes, so that they might act together, and Satan get no advantage over them by dividing them from him about a point of discipline.<a name=140:39></a><a href="#140:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#140:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I shall here give an extract of a letter of Mr. N.'s, intended for the perusal of others, and read publicly in a gathering of saints. "It may however be well to inform you of the outline of circumstances that followed on Mr. Darby's personal accusations of me. When I heard of their having been publicly made in the meeting at Ebrington Street, I felt that it was open to the brethren watching over the saints to interfere, if they pleased, in their church capacity. If there was a case of discipline against me, it was quite open to them, after investigation, to bring it before the church, and *require* that I should be withdrawn from or excommunicated." The nicest casuist could not draw a line between this and the daily conduct of the popish priesthood in Ireland.

		And now as to the dissenters' principle.<a name=142:1></a> I do not doubt many dear conscientious saints, from whom we might learn much, are amongst them.<a name=142:2></a> But the principle here alluded to, I believe should be utterly and entirely rejected, for the same reason that I reject that here proposed, namely, that the presence of the Spirit in the body is not owned by it.<a name=142:3></a> Among the dissenters they vote, and though there may be happy unanimity, and the Lord guide them, as I doubt not He often may, yet they do vote on the questions, and a majority determines the matter.<a name=142:4></a> Now it is quite evident a minority may be the most spiritual.<a name=142:5></a> In the case of Corinth all, as far as appears in public, were gone wrong, and allowed, and were puffed up about, evil.<a name=142:6></a> A majority, judging as such, cannot be said to have the Holy Ghost guiding them, because they are a majority.<a name=142:7></a><a href="#142:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This is quite manifest.<a name=142:8></a> It is a mere human principle, such as the world is obliged to act on, because it has no other way of getting out of its difficulties.<a name=142:9></a> But the church of God has.<a name=142:10></a> It has the presence and guidance of the Holy Ghost.<a name=142:11></a> The dissenting principle (for I doubt not in practice they are often guided by the Spirit according to the grace of the gospel), their <i>principle</i>, I say, denied this presence and guidance; they acted on another.<a name=142:12></a> The brethren believed this guidance of God could be reckoned upon.<a name=142:13></a> Hence they denied the necessity of the other human extreme -- the popish one of a clergy settling the matter among themselves, and announcing it publicly, and the church having nothing to do but add its weight by its acts to a decision pronounced by the authority of others, which they were bound to receive implicitly, and as a conclusion arrived at for them, which could not be debated.<a name=142:14></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#142:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is worthy of note that this is the ground taken in the "Reasons." These are their words, page 7: "And the fact that the great majority of those then in communion were fully satisfied, that the judgment their brethren had formed was a sound one; and have from that hour to this regarded our brother Newton with unaltered affection and confidence is, it appears to us, *a public and sufficient expression of the judgment of the church on this question*." The truth is, even unanimity is not in itself a proof of the mind of God's Spirit. At Corinth they were, till roused by the testimony of that Spirit by the apostle, unanimous in letting the incestuous person go on. Nor would two or three evidently carnal persons rightly hinder the body in acting in any given case. were it so, two or three undetected accomplices in sin might hinder the bounden judgment of the church of God in the case of murder or incest. The apostle declares, having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your "obedience is accomplished": that is, when the full work of the spirit had had its way, he would treat the others still resisting as disobedient to the Spirit, negativing the doctrine of unanimity as well as of a majority, on which those who sign the "Reasons" profess here to have acted. The truth is, the body must answer to God for following the guidance of the Spirit in these cases. Those who do, God will justify. If the body do not, God will not sanction their act. We have not the apostle's power, it is true, but we have the promise of God by His Spirit to help and certainly guide us if we wait upon Him. God must be ultimately the judge. <p>In the case before us they had the most slender ground to go upon. All those who originally laboured at Plymouth decline to break bread at Ebrington Street; and some 150 or 200 left, unable to endure the state of things any longer. Four persons, who came amongst them comparatively recently, declare that they, being supported by a "great majority," have in their own act a public and sufficient judgment of the church of God. I press the question of principle on these plain facts on brethren's consciences. It might seem inconsistent to base the judgment of the church on a majority; and yet maintain the principles of popery. But the fact is so, and very simple. They assert as a doctrine, that the elders in their church capacity are to debate the verdict, and that the church cannot. But as a fact, though in doing this, and by the means they used for it, they drove away all the original labourers still at Plymouth, and some 200 others; they did keep the majority, of whom many were thoroughly imbued with their principles or under their influence, and some did not know what to do; and then they as a fact claim the acquiescence of this majority as the judgment of the church. There is no consistency in evil. They seek much to distract the minds of brethren from their subversion of principle; but time will open the eyes of those whose eye is single towards God.

It is bound up in what it cannot question. Private meetings were held (public are refused), in which certain things were read for, and answers given by the accused party: but inquiry, or other testimony, is positively, on principle, refused. And then the church is declared to have *itself* searched. What were Mr. R. and Lord C. but witnesses on one side, if they were anything? Again, page 5: -- "It soon became evident ... that it would be absolutely necessary to *inform* the saints of all *we knew and thought on the subject*." Now, this is given in (what is presented as the judgment of the guides on a full investigation, though it was really no such thing) a letter of Mr. S., countersigned by the three others, set up as a definite verdict of acquittal by the guides, to be received by the body.

Only one of these six had been at any previous meeting. [There was besides present, *at that meeting*, one brother from Plymouth, but now of the gathering, who objected.

It was a hand behind moved the springs: first, the enemy, I believe, to destroy; but, behind that, I believe, God, to approve and vindicate the cardinal principle -- that the church must judge evil if it comes before it, or that it ceases to be the church before Him, must prove itself clear -- and to shew Himself with them in it however weak.

They said, when it was communicated to them by Dr. C., "If we let this pass, it will be as if he was ready to clear himself, and we would not hear him"; and they thereupon took it up. Secondly, the "Reasons" seek to make it appear that the saints in London applied themselves to the charges in question at Plymouth in 1845: as to which Mr. N.'s friends think they can allege a previous examination. This is wholly without foundation -- an unworthy attempt. The brethren referred to the whole case, "considering before the Lord the unhappy circumstances that have arisen among us."

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To say that silence (page 4) was the ordinary mode of acting in ordinary cases of unfounded accusation is surely monstrous: I mean, the pretence that they acted on this ground, when there had been repeated meetings of fifteen brethren about matters out of which this arose.<a name=154:9></a> Mr.<a name=154:10></a> H.<a name=154:11></a> had refused ministering; I had left communion; Messrs.<a name=154:12></a> H.<a name=154:13></a> and N -- r had gone and told Mr.<a name=154:14></a> N.<a name=154:15></a> his account was untrue; ten brethren were there from a distance for investigation; some two hundred or so, though not having formally separated, had ceased going to the Lord's table; and these four (who, if you will believe them, ought to govern the consciences of the congregation without a debate) feel, after a public statement to three hundred impugning Mr.<a name=154:16></a> N.<a name=154:17></a>'s moral character, that they had nothing to do.<a name=154:18></a> The pretension indeed 'of these four to be in this position is quite sufficient to make any statement after it possible.<a name=154:19></a>

		Next it is said Mr.<a name=154:20></a> Newton had in such things the confidence of the whole body.<a name=154:21></a> As to those without, I say nothing: people must ask those without.<a name=154:22></a> But this I affirm, he had not in such things the confidence of the whole body.<a name=154:23></a> The fact was this: very many took all he said in statement or doctrine;<a href="#154:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> the majority exercised no conscience at all.<a name=154:24></a> But there were intelligent, godly, independent minds, who were long and thoroughly dissatisfied "in <i>such</i> things": and this the signers of these "Reasons" know as well as I do.<a name=154:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One would have thought that if a person were seriously and credibly charged with evil, and he <i>refused</i>, when called on, to satisfy the conscience of the church of God, it would have been sufficiently simple to the mind of every one that he could not come to the table till it was cleared up.<a name=156:8></a> Such a course was certainly plainly understood and acted upon, till prejudice as to persons interfered with moral understanding.<a name=156:9></a> The truth is, the person has himself practically refused to hear the church.<a name=156:10></a> Put the contrary case: a person is credibly charged with thieving, or with murder, or with drunkenness, and instances are alleged.<a name=156:11></a> The church take it up, feeling that it must be investigated.<a name=156:12></a> This is refused.<a name=156:13></a> It is alleged that the party's conscience is to be respected, and that it is against his conscience to be judged by the church.<a name=156:14></a> If every one could say this, it is very clear there is an end of all discipline.<a name=156:15></a> A person has only to plead conscience as to any mode of investigation, and every kind of sinner can maintain his place at the Lord's table in spite of the church of God.<a name=156:16></a> Such a principle is monstrous upon the face of it.<a name=156:17></a> There may be cases so clear as, for example, a person caught in the fact of sin -- that no inquiry is called for, unless to discriminate as to the circumstances, how far they are to be dealt with in compassion, or with fear; or the church may be satisfied of the guilt of the party without his appearing, or in spite of his denial of it, and act on that guilt.<a name=156:18></a><a href="#156:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> But further, if the case be not so clear, or be denied, the church of God is entitled, <i>nay bound</i>, to use every means, not in themselves unrighteous, so that it may have a just and holy conscience in acting.<a name=156:19></a> No doubt it has to act in grace, and with consideration, in this; but it is bound to act for God in truth.<a name=156:20></a> It may be able to judge without parties and witnesses meeting: if not, it is bound to have them.<a name=156:21></a> The refusal of the party accused is really of no weight at all, save against himself.<a name=156:22></a> The offer of the party accused to give his own account of the matter, and the plea that this should satisfy the church of God, is too great an outrage on common decency of dealing between man and man (not to speak of the holier judgment of the church of God) to be listened to.<a name=156:23></a> But, further, it may become impossible to excommunicate such a person for his guilt.<a name=156:24></a> The church, by a just feeling, may refuse, in given circumstances, to conclude absolutely that he is guilty, without hearing him; but he refuses to come.<a name=156:25></a>

		It cannot therefore receive him, till he either comes before them, or the matter is fully investigated, or cleared up.<a name=158:1></a> The act in such a case amounts to this: "You must come, if at all, <i>through an investigation</i>, to the table.<a name=158:2></a>" Now this is what has been done.<a name=158:3></a> The church is bound to be satisfied where such charges lie.<a name=158:4></a> They have said, "Satisfy us.<a name=158:5></a>" It is replied, "No.<a name=158:6></a>" Now it is clear that if the party were proved innocent in any other way, to the satisfaction of the conscience of the body so acting, the barrier is gone.<a name=158:7></a><a href="#158:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> And this is what has been said: "they feel precluded meeting you at the table of the Lord, till the matters in question have been fairly and fully investigated.<a name=158:8></a>" This, as has been shewn, they never have been: the greatest part of them were in no way whatever inquired into.<a name=158:9></a>

		This then is what has been done.<a name=158:15></a> There has not been an excommunication upon proved guilt, but there has been, when the occasion arose, the maintenance of that judgment of evil by the church, without which it ceases to exist as the church of God at all.<a name=158:16></a> And I now solemnly declare -- though I never did while it might have looked like a threat, or like pressing the point, or using personal influence, which I should account a sin -- that had Rawstorne Street not done so, I should have left Rawstorne Street as I left Ebrington Street.<a name=158:17></a> They acted -- and I bless God for it -- happily, freely, and under the Lord's guidance: but the question had come evidently to a solemn point, in which God would direct the state of things one way or another; and my mind was made up.<a name=158:18></a> Most thankful I am that the very opposite of such a step was called for.<a name=158:19></a> Poor and feeble as the brethren may have been, God was with them: and He whose strength is made perfect in weakness has vindicated His own ways.<a name=158:20></a>

		I do not think sectarianism the main point, though an important one: and by sectarianism is here meant having actually made a sect of Plymouth, that is, of Ebrington Street.<a name=160:1></a> Not to speak of deeper principles evidently involved, the broad fact that the claim is now openly put forth, that four persons who think proper to claim the ministry among themselves can form a judgment among themselves of every case, and can impose this on the church as binding and conclusive judgment, is of yet greater moral importance, and involves much deeper consequences.<a name=160:2></a> In letters not published, not to speak of well-known teachings, the same thing is fully claimed as to ministry, even for a single minister.<a name=160:3></a> I have seen one with a long and subtle preface, condemning all the early course at Plymouth, as if it were modest self-condemnation, and seeming to own the Holy Ghost in gift, but assuming the regulation into a single minister's hands, so that not a hymn should be given out, nor a chapter read, nor any one pray, till parties had the minister's allowance on his ascertaining their qualifications.<a name=160:4></a>

		For my own part, while conscious in this affair of no fault nor want of charity (I do not say no want of power), I have ever found that dealing with the sin of others awakens my conscience to all my own before God; and while, through mercy, enjoying that mercy unclouded, the very thought of want of power itself, and the whole course of the matter, has served most healthfully to sift my own soul, and to cause it to repass before God all that may have contributed to it, and discover to me all my own failures.<a name=162:1></a> Here I have found abundant cause for humiliation, though yet more for admiring and owning and adoring the faithfulness and grace of God.<a name=162:2></a> As between me and the brethren who judge my path in this particular matter, I can appeal, without a shade of distrust in my heart, to the judgment of One above us both; I shall not accuse them in it; I await the grace and work of God.<a name=162:3></a>

		"It is only right and courteous to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of December to the saints at Rawstorne Street, though brethren labouring there have decided not to read it publicly, on the ground (amongst other reasons) of its not being a truthful statement of the matters on which it treats, and which are now before the saints.<a name=162:7></a>

		The following account of the meeting which took place in Rawstorne Street, in February, 1847, is evidently not written for brethren dwelling in London, unless they choose to have a record of what took place, as the matter contained in it passed in their presence, and there is no need to recall it to them.<a name=178:1></a> It is an account which was actually sent elsewhere, where there was need of it.<a name=178:2></a> I give it as it really was, my account of what passed.<a name=178:3></a> For my own sake I have however shewn it to many present, so as to make sure that there should not be any material inaccuracy.<a name=178:4></a> I am aware that many will object to its being published now.<a name=178:5></a> They must allow me to act on my own judgment as to that.<a name=178:6></a> Many saw no need in, and blamed me for, many things of the urgency of which they are now convinced.<a name=178:7></a> What was necessary for the brethren in London may be necessary for brethren elsewhere.<a name=178:8></a> What was said publicly there, can with equal reason be presented to other consciences.<a name=178:9></a> The affectation which pretends to more charity than others possess does anything but commend itself to my conscience or judgment.<a name=178:10></a> I avow frankly to those who pretend to it, I do not give credit to their pretensions, nor does the pretension do credit to them.<a name=178:11></a> Many would wish the question to be confined to principles and doctrines.<a name=178:12></a> Though these are becoming daily plainer, I do not agree with them, and this is my reason.<a name=178:13></a> I am perfectly satisfied that the persons here in question, over whom I deeply sorrow, are direct instruments of Satan; that their work <i>is the work of a seducing spirit</i>, to which many may, and several have, given heed.<a name=178:14></a> I repeat, of a seducing spirit, of a devil.<a name=178:15></a> They are subverting and undermining the truth of God, being unsound on the Person of Christ, on the sufferings of Christ, on justification, on the position and calling of the church, and as to its hope.<a name=178:16></a> I know this both by what has been published, by what I have heard myself, and by what others have heard.<a name=178:17></a> Every kind of extravagant statement<a href="#178:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> calculated to unsettle the soul as to all truth -- preached up as deep knowledge, and the whole structure of truth diligently and assiduously undermined.<a name=178:18></a> Many souls may be puzzled by this.<a name=178:19></a> It may be and is denied, if detected after being taught; all the subtlety and craft of Satan may be in play, and is, to disseminate and at the same time to conceal it.<a name=178:20></a> It is the character of heresy to be brought in privily.<a name=178:21></a> Every one the least acquainted with the facts of the case knows it is so here.<a name=178:22></a> And in general such cases are accompanied by attractive or imposing natural qualities, some of the instruments may be even Christians walking in the flesh.<a name=178:23></a> Such was the case in Irvingism.<a name=178:24></a> It is not the gift of every one to detect such subtleties, and to be uninfluenced by natural qualities which attract.<a name=178:25></a> But God is faithful not to permit His feeblest children to be tempted above that they are able, but will with the temptation give a way to escape, that they may be able to bear it.<a name=178:26></a> He gives proofs of Satan's power, obvious to every soul which does not choose delusion and a lie.<a name=178:27></a> Satan is the father of lies, and when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own.<a name=178:28></a> God has not permitted it to be otherwise here.<a name=178:29></a> I repeat distinctly (and I have additional evidence since I said it before), I do not know one who has embraced systematically this system, that has not fallen into open and systematic untruth; some of them persons, I gladly add, as incapable of it as any of us, as to their habits as men.<a name=178:30></a> But if Satan be using them in the flesh, what can be expected?<a name=178:31></a> Why, that the simplest and most unpractised would commit themselves the most.<a name=178:32></a> And so it has been.<a name=178:33></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#178:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Thus it has been taught that it will be as much a matter of sorrow to Christ to give up the kingdom to God the Father (1 Corinthians 15), as to have come down into this world of sin. None have a conception, if they have not themselves seen or heard them, of the extraordinary and outrageous statements put forth, shewing Christ to be sacrificed to a notion, to the credit of a system. The difficulty is, that while carefully propagated, Mr. Newton not having put his name, on their being shewn to be frightful they are denied. This has been the case with the notes on the sufferings of Christ, when Mr. N. has been applied to in private. I leave every righteous mind to judge of the unprincipled iniquity of such a system. In the Lord's mercy he has been forced to publish in his own name. Notes of Mr. Newton's Lectures, carefully drawn up, are circulated with the strictest injunctions not to shew them to others than those to whom they are confided. This was the case with regard to the paper on the sufferings of Christ, since published by Mr. H., than which, for those who can judge of its bearing, it is hard to conceive anything more diabolically wicked. Mr. N. has since published a tract on the sufferings of Christ, pretended by some of his followers to have no reference to Mr. H.'s publication, though the first sentence proves such a statement false. In this of course, such passages as those in the secret notes, which must rouse the sorrow, indignation, and disgust of every one not yet blinded by Satan, are avoided. But the second tract, from its deliberate and careful character, seeking to gloss over the statements of the first, proves, I judge, a great deal more than the first; either a deliberate purpose of subverting the whole foundation of the eternal truth of the gospel, or a total and complete absence of all spiritual knowledge of the very kernel or essence of that truth. I say more than the former, because carefully written to justify and guard his views, referring to what had passed as to the former without a word to withdraw or condemn what ought to revolt the heart of every saint as to the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. It is easy to say he will not answer: he will answer to God if he will not to man. I shall take notice of it further on, and I entreat the reader to weigh what I have said in this note. I have well weighed it before printing it.

		TWO LETTERS AS TO PLYMOUTH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		[Received February 5th, 1846.<a name=189:1></a>]
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved Brother, <p>I was glad to get something from you, and glad to get this letter.<a name=189:2></a> In reply to it I can only say, without answering for every expression in it, after running it over, instead of quarrelling with it as an objection, as to the general bearing and object of it, I believe that it is having departed from what has suggested itself to your mind which has been the weakness of the brethren.<a name=189:3></a> I believe that churches have been merged in the mass of ecclesiastical popular hierarchism and lost; but I believe that the visible church, as you call it, has been merged there too.<a name=189:4></a> Still there is a difference, because churches were the administrative form, while the church as a body on the earth was the vital unity.<a name=189:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I felt from the beginning, and began with, was this: the Holy Ghost remains, and therefore, the essential principle of unity with His presence, for (the fact we are now concerned in) <i>wherever</i> two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.<a name=189:6></a> When this is really sought, there will certainly be blessing by His presence.<a name=189:7></a> We have found it so, most sweetly and graciously, who have met separately here.<a name=189:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When there is an attempt at displaying the position and the unity, there will always be a mess and a failure.<a name=189:9></a> God will not take such a place with us.<a name=189:10></a> We must get into the place of His mind to get His strength.<a name=189:11></a> That is now the failure of the church.<a name=189:12></a> But there He will be with us.<a name=189:13></a> I have always said this.<a name=189:14></a> I know it has troubled some, even those I specially love; but I am sure it is the Lord's mind.<a name=189:15></a> I have said we are the witnesses of the weakness and low estate of the church.<a name=189:16></a> We are not stronger nor better than the others, dissenters, etc.<a name=189:17></a>; but we only own our bad and lost state, and <i>therefore</i> can find blessing.<a name=189:18></a> I do not limit what the blessed Spirit can do for us in this low estate, but I take the place where He can do it.<a name=189:19></a> Hence government of bodies in an authorized way, I believe there is none; where this is assumed, there will be confusion.<a name=189:20></a> It was here; and it was constantly and openly said that this was to be a model, so that all in distant places might refer to it.<a name=189:21></a> My thorough conviction is that conscience was utterly gone, save in those who were utterly miserable.<a name=189:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=190>[Page 190]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only therefore so far seek the original standing of the church, as to believe that wherever two or three are gathered in His name, Christ will be; and that the Spirit of God is necessarily the only source of power, and that what He does will be blessing through the lordship of Christ.<a name=190:1></a> These provide for all times.<a name=190:2></a> If more be attempted now, it will be confusion only.<a name=190:3></a> The original condition is owned as a sinner, or mutilated man, owns integrity of conscience or a whole body.<a name=190:4></a> But there is a most important point that comes in: I cannot supply the lack of human arrangement or wisdom.<a name=190:5></a> I must be dependent.<a name=190:6></a> I should disown whatever was not of the Spirit, and in this sense disown whatever was -- not short of the original standing, for that in the complete sense I am, but -- what man has done to fill it up, because this does not own the coming short, nor the Spirit of God.<a name=190:7></a> I would always own what is of God's Spirit in any.<a name=190:8></a> The rule seems to me here very simple.<a name=190:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt that dispensed power is disorganized; but the Holy Ghost is always competent to act in the circumstances God's people are in.<a name=190:10></a> The secret is, not to pretend to get beyond it.<a name=190:11></a> Life and divine power is always there; and I use the members I have, with full confession that I am in an imperfect state.<a name=190:12></a> We must remember that the body must exist, though not in a united state, and so even locally; I can thence therefore own their gifts and the like, and yet my warrant in two or three united for blessing promised to that.<a name=190:13></a> Then, if gifts exist, they cannot be exercised but as members of the body, because they are such, not by outward union, but by the vital power of the Head through the Holy Ghost.<a name=190:14></a> "Visible body," I suspect, misleads us a little.<a name=190:15></a> Clearly the corporate operation is in the actual living body down here on earth; but there it is the members must act, so that I do not think it makes a difficulty.<a name=190:16></a> I believe, if we were to act on 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, farther than power exists to verify it, we should make a mess.<a name=190:17></a> But then the existence of the body, whatever its scattered condition, necessarily continues, because it depends on the existence of the Head and its union with it.<a name=190:18></a> In this the Holy Ghost is necessarily supreme.<a name=190:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The body exists in virtue of there being one Holy Ghost.<a name=190:20></a> There is one body, and one Spirit, even as we are called in one hope of our calling.<a name=190:21></a> Indeed this is the very point which is denied here.<a name=190:22></a><a href="#190:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Then Christ necessarily nourishes and cherishes us as His own flesh, as members of His body; and this goes on "till we all come," etc.<a name=190:23></a> (Ephesians 4).<a name=190:24></a> Hence I apprehend we cannot deny the body and its unity (whatever its unfaithfulness and condition), and (so far as the Holy Ghost is owned) His operation in it, without denying the divine title of the Holy Ghost, and the care and headship of Christ over the church.<a name=190:25></a> Here I get not a question of the church's conduct, but of Christ's, and the truth of the Holy Ghost being on earth, and His title when there, and yet owning of Christ's lordship.<a name=190:26></a> And this is how far I own others.<a name=190:27></a> If a minister has gifts in the Establishment, I own it as through the Spirit Christ begetting the members of His body, or nourishing it.<a name=190:28></a> But I cannot go along with what it is mixed up with, because it is not of the body, nor of the Spirit.<a name=190:29></a> I cannot touch the unclean, I am to separate the precious from the vile.<a name=190:30></a> But I cannot give up Ephesians 4 while I own the faithfulness of Christ.<a name=190:31></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if we meet, yea, and when we do not meet, all I look for is that this principle should be owned, because it is owning the Holy Ghost Himself, and that to me is everything.<a name=191:1></a> We meet and worship; and at this time we who have separated meet in different rooms, that we may in the truest and simplest way, in our weakness, <i>worship</i>.<a name=191:2></a> Then whatever the Holy Ghost may give to any one, He is supreme to feed us with -- perhaps nothing in the way of speaking, and it must be in the unity of the body.<a name=191:3></a> If you were here, you could be in the unity of the body, as one of ourselves.<a name=191:4></a> This Satan cannot destroy, because it is connected with Christ's title and power.<a name=191:5></a> If men set up to imitate the administration of the body, it will be popery or dissent at once.<a name=191:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is what I see of the visibility of the body: it connects itself with this infinitely important principle, the presence and action of the Holy Ghost on earth.<a name=191:7></a> It is not merely a saved thing in the counsels of God, but a living thing animated down here by its union with the Head, and the presence of the Holy Ghost in it.<a name=191:8></a> It is a real actual thing, the Holy Ghost acting down here.<a name=191:9></a> If two are faithful in this, they will be blessed in it.<a name=191:10></a> If they said, "We are the body," not owning all the members, in whatever condition, they would morally cease to be of it.<a name=191:11></a> I own them, but in nothing their condition.<a name=191:12></a> The principle is all-important.<a name=191:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ has attached therefore its practical operation to two or three, and owns them by His presence.<a name=191:14></a> He has provided for its maintenance.<a name=191:15></a> Thus in all states of ruin it cannot cease, till He ceases to be the Head, and the Holy Spirit to be as the guide and the Comforter sent down.<a name=191:16></a>

		God sanctioned the setting up of Saul, He never did the departure from the Holy Ghost.<a name=192:1></a> The "two or three" take definitely the place of the temple, which was the locality of God's presence, as a principle of union.<a name=192:2></a> That is what makes all the difference.<a name=192:3></a> Hence, in the division of Israel, the righteous sought the temple as a point of unity, and David is to us here Christ by the Holy Ghost.<a name=192:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My Very Dear Brother, <p>I suspect many brethren have had expectations, which never led me out, and which perplexed their minds when they were not met in practice.<a name=192:11></a> I never felt my testimony, for example, to be to the ability of the Holy Ghost to rule a visible body.<a name=192:12></a> That I do not doubt, but I doubt its proper application now as a matter of testimony.<a name=192:13></a> It does not become us.<a name=192:14></a> My confidence is in the certainty of God's blessing and maintaining us, if we take the place we are really in.<a name=192:15></a> That place is one of the general ruin of the dispensation.<a name=192:16></a> Still, I believe God has provided for the maintenance of its general principle (save persecution); that is, the gathering of a remnant into the comfort of united love by the power and presence of the Holy Ghost, so that Christ could sing praises there.<a name=192:17></a> All the rest is a ministry to form, sustain, etc.<a name=192:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Amongst other things government may have its place, but it is well to remember that, in general, government regards evil, and therefore is outside the positive blessing, and has the lowest object in the church.<a name=192:19></a> Moreover, though there be a gift of government, in general, government is of a different order from gift.<a name=192:20></a> Gift serves ministry, hardly government.<a name=192:21></a> They may be united as in apostolic energy; elders were rather the government, but they were not gifts.<a name=192:22></a> It is specially the order of the governmental part which I believe has failed, and we are to get on without that, at least in a formal way.<a name=192:23></a> But I do not believe that God has therefore not provided for such a state of things.<a name=192:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do believe "brethren" a good deal got practically out of their place, and the consciousness of it, and found their weakness: and the Lord is now teaching them.<a name=193:1></a> For my part, when I found all in ruin around me, my comfort was that, where two or three were gathered together in Christ's name, there He would be.<a name=193:2></a> It was not government or anything else I sought.<a name=193:3></a> Now I do believe that God is faithful and able to maintain the blessing.<a name=193:4></a> I believe the great buildings and great bodies have been a mistake: indeed I always did.<a name=193:5></a> Further, I believe now (though it were always true in practice) the needed dealing with evil must be by the conscience in grace.<a name=193:6></a> So St.<a name=193:7></a> Paul ever dealt, though he had the resource of a positive commission.<a name=193:8></a> And I believe that two or three together, or a larger number, with some having the gift of wisdom in grace, can, in finding the mind of the Lord, act in discipline; and this, with pastoral care, is the mainspring of holding the saints together in Matthew 18.<a name=193:9></a> This agreeing together is referred to as the sign of the Spirit's power.<a name=193:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt that some may be capable of informing the consciences of others.<a name=193:11></a> But the conscience of the body is that which is ever to be acted on and set right.<a name=193:12></a> This is the character of all healthful action of the kind, though there may be a resource in present apostolic power, which, where evil has entered, may be wanting; but it cannot annul "where two or three agree it shall be done.<a name=193:13></a>" So that I see not the smallest need of submission to popery (that is, carnal unity by authority in the flesh), nor of standing alone, because God has provided for a gathering of saints together, founded on grace, and held by the operation of the Spirit, which no doubt may fail for want of grace, but in which every remaining gift has its scope; in which Christ's presence and the operation of the Spirit is manifested, but must be maintained on the ground of the condition the church really is in, or it would issue in a sect arranged by man, with a few new ideas.<a name=193:14></a> Where God is trusted in the place and for the place we are in, and we are content to find Him infallibly present with us, there I am sure He is sufficient and faithful to meet our wants.<a name=193:15></a> If there be one needed wiser than any of the gathered ones in a place, they will humbly feel their needs; and God will send someone as needed, if He sees it the fit means.<a name=193:16></a>

		LETTER ON THE CONFESSION OF ERROR BY SOME
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved Brethren, <p>Most if not all of you are aware of the existence of certain papers, such as the "Narrative of Facts," and "Account of Proceedings in Rawstorne Street," which I have circulated relative to the circumstances which have taken place at Plymouth, and containing certain charges against different brethren.<a name=198:1></a> There was also a "Summary of Proceedings at Rawstorne Street," which however has not been on sale for some time, and a part also of a notice of the retractation by Mr.<a name=198:2></a> Newton which referred to the same subjects, the last<a href="#198:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> urging that the confession of error did not set aside the original charges.<a name=198:3></a> These with the abridged account, "What Investigation has there been at Plymouth?<a name=198:4></a>" are all I recollect which contain or insist on the charges made against the brethren who for a long time supported Mr.<a name=198:5></a> Newton, but have now ceased to do so.<a name=198:6></a> I write to apprise you that, as regards the brethren who have acknowledged the evil in which they were involved, all these papers are entirely withdrawn, and I do so in order to give the fullest efficacy to the act of withdrawal.<a name=198:7></a> If anything remains which has escaped me in other tracts, I beg it to be understood as equally withdrawn as to them.<a name=198:8></a> The evil being given up, I withdraw all charges as against them.<a name=198:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And in saying this, beloved brethren, you will of yourselves understand me that, as regards these brethren who have acknowledged the evil, the whole matter is entirely buried and set aside.<a name=198:10></a> When God forgives, He remembers no more; and though it be not a question of my forgiving, for I take it as no wrong done to myself, yet as on confession God forgives, so our part is then to act in full love.<a name=198:11></a> I desire also further to explain some points respecting it.<a name=198:12></a> I have withdrawn the tracts from sale because (as far as confession has been made) I desire to give the plainest testimony of my putting it all aside.<a name=198:13></a> It is this which makes some explanation necessary; because, where confession has not been made, all remains as it stood.<a name=198:14></a><a href="#198:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> Further I wish it to be distinctly understood that my judgment of the evil is entirely unchanged unless it be to think still worse and worse of it.<a name=198:15></a> But so far as others have judged it too, I consider them as free from it as I am.<a name=198:16></a> If in anything even I found any evil influence remaining unconsciously where sincere confession has been made, it would not remain in my mind as a charge, but as any other evil in myself to be corrected.<a name=198:17></a>

It is merely their standing out against the confession and holding fast to the evil which maintains any charge.

		Any supposition of withdrawing on my side these papers because other parties had withdrawn theirs, as if it was a personal question and controversy, I repudiate altogether, or concession on one side met by concession on the other, and (I am bound to add) so did Mr.<a name=200:1></a> S.<a name=200:2></a> It would be in my judgment an immorality in a question of right or wrong.<a name=200:3></a> Further, I do not admit that, having a matter to prove, I made the worst of things.<a name=200:4></a> I did nothing of the kind.<a name=200:5></a> On the contrary I omitted everything that made against individuals if it did not bear on the general point.<a name=200:6></a> I refused all through to search out any evil.<a name=200:7></a> I acted on what the Lord thought fit to bring before me.<a name=200:8></a> A long course of small circumstances often proved more than anything what was going on.<a name=200:9></a> I was quite aware of the difficulty this put in my way.<a name=200:10></a> I faced it with my eyes open because I trusted God, and never allowed myself to put in any evil that merely dishonoured persons without bearing on the public facts in question.<a name=200:11></a> Further, without pretending to have been perfect in manner or in anything, I never had any other motive whatever in publishing the "Narrative" but the good of the church of God; had I, I surely should not have done it.<a name=200:12></a> I was as fully aware as I am now of all it would bring upon me.<a name=200:13></a> I did so because it was attempted to introduce the Plymouth evil system into a district where there were a large body of newly converted souls; and, as it was thus active, I felt the saints must know what it was.<a name=200:14></a> A considerable time had elapsed after matters had closed at Plymouth.<a name=200:15></a>

		As to indifferentism, take a case: Socinian blasphemies against Christ are concerned.<a name=205:1></a> If you insist on walking in communion, helping others to go there, though not holding Socinian views and believing them to be a denial of Christ, you thereby maintain constant regular communion with them, not for yourself only but for all Christians; for, as it is no personal right, there must be equal liberty for all with yourself Thus general communion with Socinians as a body should be an allowed path in the church of God.<a name=205:2></a> It is no question of opinion or way of dealing with the evil, but of the existence and standing of the church of God, which is <i>nothing</i>, or the pillar and ground of the truth as to Christ.<a name=205:3></a> The question is as to the church's path: is it to acquiesce in principle in all her members having communion with the deniers of the Lord and her too?<a name=205:4></a> This is indifferentism as to Christ.<a name=205:5></a>

		THE CHURCH WHICH IS HIS BODY -- A LETTER ON A.R.D.S FEW THOUGHTS AS TO THE POSITION OF SAINTS GATHERED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <p>Somebody has sent me A.<a name=209:1></a>R.<a name=209:2></a>D.<a name=209:3></a>'s tract.<a name=209:4></a> It produces upon me the painful effect of one who has learned a great many truths, but has not the centre which binds them together: they have not been inwrought into his conscience to meet the need of his soul.<a name=209:5></a> It is a speculation, but a speculation upon holy things.<a name=209:6></a> It may meet acceptance where the mind shrinks from a faithful walk, or perhaps puzzle those who are ignorant of scripture, but much more those who are afraid of subjecting themselves to the bonds of truth.<a name=209:7></a> But one soberly exercised in scripture must be surprised at such a production, or a clear mind with such a mass of contradiction.<a name=209:8></a> It is arbitrary in its statements, which do not even hang together, and slovenly to the last degree even in small things.<a name=209:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first paragraph, "the assembly" is the only expression to be used; in the second, "a temporary purpose" is "to be fulfilled by the church.<a name=209:10></a>" And here is one of the eggs of "the nest of errors" in the word ["church"].<a name=209:11></a> Is this "the one body of Christ risen and ascended"?<a name=209:12></a> No; in that sense "the assembly has no true position on earth at all," yet we are told a purpose was "to be fulfilled by the church pending its completion," that is, of course, the completion of the body of Christ composed of the <i>all</i> of paragraph one.<a name=209:13></a> The members were to "constitute a manifest assembly on earth.<a name=209:14></a>" "It is in this character it" -- what?<a name=209:15></a> -- "is spoken of in 1 Timothy 3: 15, as the house of God.<a name=209:16></a>" It must be the church, the body (not complete, of course), which is thus the house.<a name=209:17></a> Thus a J temporary purpose was to be fulfilled by the true body of Christ (that is, the part which is on earth), that of being the house of God.<a name=209:18></a> It was the church, the body, applied to a temporary purpose on earth, where it has no true position at all.<a name=209:19></a> Yet it is already in this paragraph the "professing church.<a name=209:20></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now on this point the tract turns; and, if we keep it in mind, the consequences will be found, the natural consequences of this confusion, though inconsistent with it.<a name=209:21></a> Already in this same paragraph, in a phrase excessively loose in expression, we are told that "as to their responsibilities, the members of the body together on earth, or in any particular assembly, are looked at as the body," 1 Corinthians 12.<a name=209:22></a> First then the body is the instrument for fulfilling the temporary purpose of a manifest assembly on earth; and secondly, as to their responsibilities, the members on earth are looked at as the body.<a name=209:23></a> Now the whole tract is to shew that the assembly on earth is the only unity we have to do with (though apostasy has for us set this aside), and to distinguish it carefully from the body.<a name=209:24></a> And, secondly, already the members on earth, as to their responsibilities, are looked at as the body, though that body, as the body of Christ, has no true position on earth at all.<a name=209:25></a> What its responsibilities are, if it has no true position, I am at a loss to know.<a name=209:26></a>

		I shall be told the first paragraph speaks of an "aspect" of the assembly.<a name=210:1></a> Well, and what means "looked at as the body" but its aspect as the body of Christ?<a name=210:2></a> No, this passage is an effort to get rid of, in seeming to allow, the force of a passage that stood terribly in the way of A.<a name=210:3></a>R.<a name=210:4></a>D.<a name=210:5></a> These saints are addressed as to their responsibilities as the body; and the whole object of the tract is to shew they are not, and cannot act on any such.<a name=210:6></a> And A.<a name=210:7></a>R.<a name=210:8></a>D.<a name=210:9></a> knows very well, and (if I mistake not) has a theory formed for the occasion, that what is there spoken of "as the body" is no doubt in a certain sense a particular assembly, but withal "all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=210:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will speak of the ruin.<a name=210:11></a> But we have the whole church of God, a particular assembly especially in view treated in its responsibilities as the body.<a name=210:12></a> The assembly, in which the apostles and gifts of healing on earth were set, is treated as the body of Christ.<a name=210:13></a> And, note, it is so truly the church, assembly, and body on earth, that when I think of being members of Christ in heaven (for a body in heaven is never spoken of that I can remember), there can be no responsibility at all.<a name=210:14></a> We are perfect in Him.<a name=210:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to their responsibilities then, the body is and can be only looked at on the earth; and as to their responsibilities, A.<a name=210:16></a>R.<a name=210:17></a>D.<a name=210:18></a> tells us they are looked at as the body -- I suppose therefore are to act in these responsibilities, and to look on themselves as to their responsibilities as the body.<a name=210:19></a> If this be admitted (and I am taking A.<a name=210:20></a>R.<a name=210:21></a>D.<a name=210:22></a>'s statements), his whole tract falls to the ground unless he denies my responsibilities because of the ruin (a most anti-scriptural principle, letting us off by our own wickedness); or invent some other kind of responsibility besides that which he himself tells us scripture teaches.<a name=210:23></a>

		But I will go into a little more detail.<a name=211:1></a> We find that the body of Christ is spoken of abstractedly without reference to place; and this is but twice; as for example, Ephesians 1, "to the church which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=211:2></a>" Whenever any place is spoken of, it is invariably and exclusively spoken of as on earth.<a name=211:3></a> So utterly unfounded is the assertion that it has no true position on earth at all.<a name=211:4></a> I should not have made any difficulty as to saying the church, as in Christ, is viewed in heaven; because universally we speak of a whole as meaning all its parts.<a name=211:5></a> But when a great system of doctrine is founded on an expression, then its inexactitude becomes important.<a name=211:6></a> You have only to take a Concordance and verify what I say.<a name=211:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall now follow some of the author's statements.<a name=211:8></a> The assembly becomes after Pentecost contrasted with the body.<a name=211:9></a> This is alike arbitrary and false, but all the argument depends on it.<a name=211:10></a> "There are therefore two bonds that bound saints together: first, the body, or rather the one Spirit; and then the circle of the assembly" (page 7).<a name=211:11></a> But this assembly on earth, we are told (page 3), is spoken of in 1 Timothy 3: 15, as the house of God, the pillar and stay of the truth.<a name=211:12></a>" This assembly, now in apostasy, is what A.<a name=211:13></a>R.<a name=211:14></a>D.<a name=211:15></a> calls always "the assembly," which has its unity contrasted with the unity of the Spirit, or "the body," which has its unity: the latter having no true position on earth, the former being now inconsistent with the unity of the Spirit (page 8).<a name=211:16></a> Hence as "the body" has no real unity on earth, and "the assembly" is apostate, of course there is no unity at all.<a name=211:17></a>

		GOD, NOT THE CHURCH, THE TEACHER BY HIS WORD; BEING A LETTER ON DR. MANNING'S SERMON BY A STRANGER PASSING THROUGH HEREFORD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Sir, <p>Dr.<a name=223:1></a> Manning's sermon, and the account of the consecration at Belmont, have been published in the <i>Hereford Times</i>.<a name=223:2></a> On the latter I make no remark.<a name=223:3></a> I should call it a very poor thing morally, but I dare say attractive to a curious public.<a name=223:4></a> But the sermon contains some principles and assertions to which I will venture to draw the attention of those who will condescend to read these lines.<a name=223:5></a> We must make allowance for a report, and possible mistakes.<a name=223:6></a> In one sentence God is put for body evidently, and doubtless there are others; but there is plenty sufficiently clear and accurate to enable us to measure the doctrines and statements of the sermon.<a name=223:7></a> It is hardly to be expected that the public should be well acquainted with ecclesiastical history, nor, by their knowledge of facts, be able to meet the assertions or omissions of the preacher.<a name=223:8></a> I cannot, where I am, have recourse to learned books, to give always precise dates or the like; but my memory suffices to deal with many of the preacher's statements, as the word of God will with others, and of his arguments we all can judge.<a name=223:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me begin with his text, and the groundwork of his discourse.<a name=223:10></a> Christ stood up to read, and after reading, declared, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.<a name=223:11></a>" That is, He did not interpret it at all, but presented Himself as the fulfilment of it.<a name=223:12></a> It required no interpretation: Messiah was already the expectation of the Jews according to it.<a name=223:13></a> But He was the Messiah; He declared the object of faith actually come.<a name=223:14></a> Either Dr.<a name=223:15></a> Manning's whole argument is utterly without foundation, or he puts the church in the place of Christ as the object of faith.<a name=223:16></a> Now the latter, which is next door to blasphemy and apostasy, is pretty much what he does.<a name=223:17></a> He declared, at the close of the discourse, that the Catholic church is the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=223:18></a> Now this is a statement found in the Hebrews, and spoken of the blessed Lord: "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=223:19></a>" He is the immutable object of faith, and they were not to be carried about with divers and strange doctrines.<a name=223:20></a> But it is the one unchangeable glory of the Lord Jesus Christ which is in question; not the church, in any sense, to which the preacher, in a way akin to blasphemy, refers it.<a name=223:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A sober Christian will weigh this.<a name=224:1></a> It is the more striking in its evil character because the groundwork of the whole sermon is turning the presenting of the person of the Lord Jesus as the fulfilment of a passage into its interpretation; as to which there was no question.<a name=224:2></a> The beginning and end of the sermon (indeed its whole theme is that) substitute the church for Christ.<a name=224:3></a> The truth is, Dr.<a name=224:4></a> Manning's discourse puts him on both horns of the dilemma at once.<a name=224:5></a> There is no ground at all in the text for his argument.<a name=224:6></a> The Lord does not interpret but presents Himself as the fulfilment of the passage; and this discourse is akin to blasphemy by the substitution of the church for the blessed and divine Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, "the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=224:7></a>" Still I will just look into some of his facts and assertions.<a name=224:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two facts on which his argument is founded I admit entirely.<a name=224:9></a> The apostles preached before the New Testament scriptures were written; though the church was founded before they began to preach by the descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, and the same Holy Ghost made the believers one and endued them with power.<a name=224:10></a> As regards the Gentiles, Peter expressly gave up his office to Paul (Galatians 2: 9) and Barnabas; and Paul became the apostle of the Gentiles, and the one who alone insists on the unity of the body, the church.<a name=224:11></a> The other fact is that baptism and the Lord's supper embody some precious truths.<a name=224:12></a> The latter point does not affect our present inquiry.<a name=224:13></a> The Lord Himself instituted them, so that though recorded in the scriptures they were before the church or New Testament scriptures, or ministry of the apostles subsequent to Pentecost.<a name=224:14></a> The former point tells entirely against Dr.<a name=224:15></a> Manning's argument.<a name=224:16></a> The apostles, as did Stephen and Philip and probably others, preached the gospel -- Peter to the Jews, Paul to the Gentiles, and Jews settled amongst them, joining Silas, Timotheus, Titus, and others with him in his service.<a name=224:17></a> Of others we have little or no authentic account outside Jerusalem.<a name=224:18></a> Doubtless late in the history they travelled in other countries, but we have no early or sure account of it.<a name=224:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In general we know that He who was mighty in Peter to the circumcision wrought in Paul towards the Gentiles, and the apostles agreed that that work should be Paul's.<a name=225:1></a> I shall be told -- Yes, but afterwards they taught and watched over the church.<a name=225:2></a> Doubtless they did, they taught the church.<a name=225:3></a> But whom did the church teach?<a name=225:4></a> Nobody.<a name=225:5></a> Gifted individuals amongst them, teachers and pastors whom God had raised up, aided in their place according to the measure of the gift of Christ; but the church never taught: gifted members taught it.<a name=225:6></a> The church's teaching is a mere delusion; it denies ministry and falsifies the whole idea of the church, which is the whole body of faithful people.<a name=225:7></a> They taught viva voce, and they taught by writings, and their writings we have.<a name=225:8></a> But to whom were they addressed?<a name=225:9></a> We have twenty-one epistles in all; three are addressed to fellow-labourers of Paul, the rest to the faithful, in one the bishops and deacons being added.<a name=225:10></a> The apostles taught the church, or people of God in these epistles by their inspired gifts; but the church taught no one.<a name=225:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But more than this.<a name=225:12></a> Paul assures us that after his decease the flock would not be spared, and commends them to God, and the word of His grace which was able to build them up; that already all sought their own, not the things of Jesus Christ; that in the last days perilous times would come, there would be a form of piety denying its power.<a name=225:13></a> He also commends the saints to the scriptures, as able to make them wise unto salvation, and to the knowing of whom we have learned things as we do when we read the writings of the apostles, and as we do not when we are told the church teaches.<a name=225:14></a> Dr.<a name=225:15></a> Manning tells us of the collected reason of Christendom.<a name=225:16></a> Where am I to find that?<a name=225:17></a> Did Paul do right when he addressed his teaching to all the saints for their own use and direction?<a name=225:18></a> or did he do it badly?<a name=225:19></a> or could someone else come and interpret it to them?<a name=225:20></a> They received it themselves as he wrote it to themselves.<a name=225:21></a> Besides, the mystery of iniquity was already at work and would go on, the apostle tells us, and there would be a falling away.<a name=225:22></a> But further the church did not maintain the faith.<a name=225:23></a> To use Jerome's expression, the world awoke and was surprised to find itself Arian.<a name=225:24></a> It was merely a few hunted individuals who kept the faith; and the Pope himself, Liberius, signed a semi-Arian creed; and another, Honorius, was condemned by a council held to be a general one by Rome itself as a heretic, and the decree confirmed by the Pope.<a name=225:25></a>

		And where am I to find this teaching church?<a name=226:1></a> I must go to the priest.<a name=226:2></a> Is he infallibly right?<a name=226:3></a> No.<a name=226:4></a> But the bishop will watch over that.<a name=226:5></a> Is he infallibly right?<a name=226:6></a> No.<a name=226:7></a> But the Pope will watch over that.<a name=226:8></a> Is he infallibly right?<a name=226:9></a> It has been held so for three years; but the fact was so grossly opposed to the known history and teaching of former ages, that hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics have left him and have established a separate body -- got a bishop and a settled constitution.<a name=226:10></a>

		Half the respectable authorities of the Roman Catholic world resisted to the utmost, protested against the way in which the council was conducted and deprived of all true liberty and now forces others to hold it.<a name=226:11></a> But big words take wonderful effect on people's minds.<a name=226:12></a> Dr.<a name=226:13></a> Manning talks to us of the universal or Catholic church spread over the world.<a name=226:14></a> But let us get at the facts?<a name=226:15></a> We have, say, 140 millions of Roman Catholics in the world, but some 60 or 70 millions of Greeks, the oldest churches in existence, denounce them as false in doctrine and the papal authority to be wholly unfounded; and the chief doctrinal point of difference is a dogma repelled by the Greeks, which one of the greatest popes that ever lived declared ought not to be introduced into the creed, as indeed a general council had forbidden anything to be added; and this Pope put up silver tablets in the principal church at Rome that it might not be added.<a name=226:16></a> Rome has added it since.<a name=226:17></a> Dr.<a name=226:18></a> Manning knows this as well as I do.<a name=226:19></a> But further, nearly 100 millions of Protestants are outside.<a name=226:20></a> So that we have more than half professing Christendom outside (what I must say impudently calls itself) the Catholic church, a body denounced by the oldest churches, and so horribly corrupt that a very large part indeed of what was under its authority broke loose from it; and now, on the very point of infallible authority in interpretation, it is completely divided, and hundreds of thousands have left it because the vote was carried by oppression.<a name=226:21></a> We can understand this.<a name=226:22></a> Large numbers of respectable Roman Catholic prelates resisted the decree, from America, Ireland, France, Germany, etc.<a name=226:23></a>, who presided over flocks numbering by millions; but there were crowds of prelates in Italy, some 130 in the Papal and Neapolitan states with some few millions of inhabitants, and a number of what are called bishops <i>in partibus</i> removable by the Pope, who made all resistance vain on the part of those who represented ten times their number.<a name=226:24></a> But it has cost the papacy another split off, which appeals to the ancient records and historical facts of the church such as none can deny.<a name=226:25></a> And note, all the professors of divinity of these seceders always taught what they hold and have acted on now.<a name=226:26></a> Where then was the church's teaching?<a name=226:27></a> And what am I to hold to be the church which teaches?<a name=226:28></a> -- the Pope all alone, decreed to be infallible three years ago, who is certainly not the church?<a name=226:29></a> or is the Greek church, older than he?<a name=226:30></a> or the Protestants who appeal to Paul's teaching and Peter's, etc.<a name=226:31></a>?<a name=226:32></a> Where is this church?<a name=226:33></a>

		And mark this; the question is not whether Peter and Paul and the rest did not teach the truth before the scriptures, but what is it that has preserved to us what Peter and Paul taught?<a name=227:1></a> The answer is, not the varying traditions of the church, but the writings of Peter and Paul themselves.<a name=227:2></a> They were addressed to the people, and, save three short epistles, entirely to the Christian people.<a name=227:3></a> It is not that the apostle's teaching was derived from the New Testament, but it is found embodied there -- recorded there.<a name=227:4></a> They did interpret the Old indeed, and their teaching is found in the epistles of the New, addressed to Christian men -- their epistles, where else should I find them?<a name=227:5></a>

		Dr.<a name=228:1></a> Manning tells us the church alone can tell us which are the genuine scriptures.<a name=228:2></a> Not the church of Rome: till the fourth century she would not receive the Epistle to the Hebrews, which she now, as other churches then did, receives as scripture.<a name=228:3></a> But this is an unfortunate subject for Rome.<a name=228:4></a> Pope Damasus employed Jerome to translate the scriptures, because the translation used in the churches was incorrect.<a name=228:5></a> He did so, and added a preface to his translation, commonly called the Vulgate, and that preface, called <i>prologus galeatus</i>, is habitually printed with the Roman Catholic editions of the Vulgate.<a name=228:6></a> This preface declares the books we call Apocrypha were not to be read as any foundation for faith, and they are not in the Hebrew; the Council of Trent declared them authentic inspired scripture like all the rest.<a name=228:7></a>

		He tells us the faith was preached, and filled the world, before the New Testament was written.<a name=228:17></a> The whole revelation of Christ was known to the church, and preached by the church, for generations before the New Testament was written.<a name=228:18></a> Indeed!<a name=228:19></a> My good readers, shall I tell you why I do not believe this?<a name=228:20></a> It was those who preached it thus who wrote the books.<a name=228:21></a> I suppose they were of the same generation as themselves.<a name=228:22></a>

		There are some things so absurd in the sermon, I must suppose error in the reporter.<a name=230:1></a> Thus the date of John's Gospel was somewhere about ninety: therefore there could be no scriptures for the first ninety years.<a name=230:2></a> Probably the preacher said or meant, that there could not be a collection of the four Gospels before.<a name=230:3></a> That is certain, and the argument amounts to this -- the four Gospels could not be collected before the four were written.<a name=230:4></a> No doubt all the books, having each perfect authority in itself, the piety of Christians moved them to collect them all to profit by them all; but this added nothing to their authority.<a name=230:5></a> Their authority rested on the inspiration of the writers who wrote each book.<a name=230:6></a> I believe in the perfect wisdom of God in it as a whole; but the authority of each book rests on the inspiration of its author.<a name=230:7></a> If it has that, the church can add none.<a name=230:8></a> The authority and inspiration of the writer came from Christ and the Holy Spirit, not from the church.<a name=230:9></a> The reception of the testimony of their blessed witnesses came from grace, and the Holy Ghost; and so it does now, and so only.<a name=230:10></a> The church had its existence from this only.<a name=230:11></a> Church, till faith was there, there was none; and if there were such in the neighbourhood, they had no power or influence over the heathen mind to make them receive the testimony; it was always, and is, the grace of God, and the operation of His blessed Spirit.<a name=230:12></a>

		A few more evidences of the groundless assertions of Dr.<a name=230:13></a> Manning I will add.<a name=230:14></a> Baptism contains within itself the incorporation and the records of the doctrine that sin after baptism needs to be cancelled and forgiven by the power of absolution.<a name=230:15></a> How so?<a name=230:16></a> Where is it incorporated in baptism?<a name=230:17></a> The Roman doctrine as to baptism is rather strange.<a name=230:18></a> They get forgiveness of sins when there are none, and, when there are, then it is by man's absolution and penance, if at all.<a name=230:19></a>

		As regards confession, Dr.<a name=231:1></a> Manning says, "Whose sins ye forgive, they are forgiven.<a name=231:2></a> Where is the church which practises confession as inculcated by these words?<a name=231:3></a> Confession is not inculcated, that I see, in the words at all.<a name=231:4></a> The Catholic church, he assures us, never relaxed this practice, because it never lost its faith.<a name=231:5></a> Now confession to a priest was never made obligatory till 1215 years after Christ, in the Third Council of Lateran, under the Pope under whose auspices the Inquisition was established.<a name=231:6></a> History shews it was not in any way usually practised.<a name=231:7></a> There was public confession before the whole church, and sometimes voluntary confession to a presbyter, where a person was so disposed.<a name=231:8></a> At Constantinople a presbyter was appointed to receive it, if any one was disposed to make one.<a name=231:9></a> But a great scandal arising from a confession thus made, Chrysostom abolished it, and told people to confess to God.<a name=231:10></a> At first there was only confession before the whole church, obligatory when they were excommunicated and they stood as penitents.<a name=231:11></a> Voluntary confessions began soon to be made in private.<a name=231:12></a> At Rome it was only under Leo the Great, in the latter part of the fifth century, that offenders were relieved from public confession and allowed to confess to a priest.<a name=231:13></a> Could Dr.<a name=231:14></a> Manning be ignorant of all this?<a name=231:15></a>

		Transubstantiation was decreed in the same Lateran Council, and never before, that is, in 1215.<a name=231:16></a> The word betrays itself.<a name=231:17></a> It is the expression of the adoption by the schoolmen of the heathen Aristotle's doctrine of substance and accidents, a kind of substratum of each being with qualities of colour, form, etc.<a name=231:18></a>, attached.<a name=231:19></a> It was denied however by most famous doctors in the church, also of those days, as John Scotus Erigena, the great doctor of Charles the Bald's Court, by Ratramn or Bertram, and others, but established as an article of faith in the Third Council of Lateran.<a name=231:20></a> This is quite true, that the most magniloquent terms were used as to the Eucharist, and as to baptism too, when the idea of sacramental grace supplanted spiritual life in the church, as the apostles had predicted.<a name=231:21></a> A change was spoken of in the water, as well as in the elements of the Eucharist, the visible water was changed (<i>metastoicheiountai</i>) into a certain divine and ineffable power.<a name=231:22></a>

		But transubstantiation was not the earliest doctrine even after these high views came in, but expressly that after invocation two things were there, Christ and the bread, so much so that the fact of this double state was triumphantly used by the early fathers against the Eutychians, who denied two natures in Christ.<a name=232:1></a> The opposite to the Romish doctrine is positively taught on this point by the earlier fathers, and I might even say Augustine, though the strongest rhetorical expressions are used as to it.<a name=232:2></a> And it is difficult to think Dr.<a name=232:3></a> Manning could be ignorant of all this.<a name=232:4></a>

		I close my review.<a name=232:5></a> I should have many points to notice, were I formally discussing the whole sermon at large.<a name=232:6></a> I cannot be expected in a brief paper reviewing this sermon to discuss the whole circle of Romish doctrine.<a name=232:7></a> I have merely taken up prominent points and assertions in Dr.<a name=232:8></a> Manning's discourse, to shew how he must have counted on unacquaintedness with ecclesiastical history naturally found in a large mixed congregation, with what good faith my reader must determine.<a name=232:9></a>

		I have not sought to deceive or mislead him.<a name=232:10></a> I believe in the very early corruption of Christianity, a corruption existing in the apostles' days, when the mystery of iniquity did already work, and all sought their own and not the things of Jesus Christ, as the apostle tells us.<a name=232:11></a> I do not doubt that Christ will have His body complete in spite of Satan's efforts; but the apostle has led us to expect that, when he laid the only true foundation, others would build wood and hay and stubble; and history has shewn that this took place.<a name=232:12></a>

		PREFACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dr.<a name=233:2></a> Manning having corrected and published his sermon delivered at Belmont, the following notice of it is added as a second part to the reply already published to what appeared in the newspapers.<a name=233:3></a> The immediate occasion is now somewhat remote; but the principles are of abiding importance, and Dr.<a name=233:4></a> Manning's sermon is a suitable occasion to bring them under the eye of Christians.<a name=233:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since the previous tract was written, Dr.<a name=233:6></a> Manning has revised the report of his sermon and had it published, so that there can be no question as to the authenticity of the statements contained in the pamphlet given out under his name.<a name=233:7></a> The principle is of course the same, the assertions equally unfounded, the reasons equally inconclusive.<a name=233:8></a> The desperate error of putting the church in the place of Christ is Dr.<a name=233:9></a> Manning's error; the unbelief hidden under his statements is the unbelief of the Roman system as of Dr.<a name=233:10></a> Manning himself; the contemptible arguments throw back their contemptibleness on their author.<a name=233:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dr.<a name=233:12></a> Manning begins by telling us that in the middle ages mass would have been said in the cathedral of Hereford, and lights burning in the Ladye Chapel, and this because persons believed in the teaching of the church, that is, of the Roman clergy.<a name=233:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of this there is no doubt.<a name=233:14></a> In the middle ages the worship of the mass existed, a flagrant denial of the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice once offered, and of the authority of the word of God, which declares there is no more offering for sin, when Christ had been offered once for all.<a name=233:15></a> The Roman clergy were, with all the rest of the priesthood, eminently responsible for this blasphemous and vain pretension of renewing Christ's sacrifice, in which, to be of any avail, Christ (as is taught in Hebrews 9: 25, 26) must often suffer.<a name=233:16></a> This horrible wickedness did exist, and the clergy are answerable for it.<a name=233:17></a> This much I admit: there would have been degradations of Christ's sacrifice as to its efficacy, and there would have been superstitious idolatrous worship of the Virgin Mary.<a name=233:18></a> Thus far I agree with Dr.<a name=233:19></a> Manning.<a name=233:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=234>[Page 234]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what are the principles on which Dr.<a name=234:1></a> Manning would restore this?<a name=234:2></a> Let us see.<a name=234:3></a> "What I affirm is this," he says, "that the letter of the scripture without the voice of the church, through the perverseness of men, killeth; and that the letter of the scripture, with the living voice of that church, quickeneth" -- that is, giveth life.<a name=234:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I remark first here, that the sermon and the Roman system put the church instead of Christ as the object of faith.<a name=234:5></a> What Christ was in the synagogue, the church is according to Dr.<a name=234:6></a> Manning; and he puts the church instead of the Spirit as the author and power of faith.<a name=234:7></a> The teaching of Dr.<a name=234:8></a> Manning in the first two pages (and it is the substance of the sermon's teaching) sets aside Christ and the Holy Ghost for the church.<a name=234:9></a> The word of God says, Christ is the same yesterday, today, and for ever; Dr.<a name=234:10></a> Manning, that the church is (page 15); that as Christ stood in the synagogue with the scriptures, so the church stands now.<a name=234:11></a> The word of God says it is the Spirit that quickeneth, and that Christ's words are spirit and life; Dr.<a name=234:12></a> Manning, that the letter of scripture without the church kills, but that with the living voice of the church it quickens.<a name=234:13></a> It is a frightful denial of scripture truth and Christianity to set up his church on their ruin.<a name=234:14></a> Such is the main thesis of Dr.<a name=234:15></a> Manning's tract.<a name=234:16></a> As proof, let us examine his arguments.<a name=234:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He says, "It is a self-evident fact," "true, admitted by every one, and impossible to deny, that the whole revelation of Christianity was preached and believed throughout the world before the New Testament was written.<a name=234:18></a>" "This is a fact so certain, so self-evident, that no calm honest man, who gives himself time to consider it, can for a moment doubt it.<a name=234:19></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to call it self-evident is simply nonsense.<a name=234:20></a> No such facts can be self-evident.<a name=234:21></a> Why, or how, is it so?<a name=234:22></a> It is a matter of history and testimony.<a name=234:23></a> The testimony of the ancient historians and fathers of the church in some respects contradict it.<a name=234:24></a> They state that Matthew wrote his Gospel to leave it in Palestine before he went out to preach in the world.<a name=234:25></a> So far from being self-evident, the writings prove that most of them were written by their authors in the course of their service.<a name=234:26></a> For example, the Epistle to the Romans was written professedly before ever the apostle had been there; the Corinthians also, before he had been at Rome, but after he had been at Corinth; the Thessalonians, when he had just left Thessalonica, before he had begun his work at Corinth or Rome.<a name=234:27></a> Matthew's Gospel, if we are to believe the authority of the fathers, was written very early indeed, before there had been any preaching perhaps out of Palestine; John's very late indeed.<a name=234:28></a> It is not really the question to be settled.<a name=234:29></a> The question is, What place do the scriptures hold now?<a name=234:30></a> But the statement of Dr.<a name=234:31></a> Manning is neither certain nor admitted, and to say it is "self-evident" is impudent nonsense.<a name=234:32></a> Hard words, it may be said; but it is well to speak the truth sometimes.<a name=234:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=235>[Page 235]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another point which makes the whole statement utterly irrelevant, and that as Dr.<a name=235:1></a> Manning's own statement shews.<a name=235:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The revelation was made to the apostles and prophets.<a name=235:3></a> The former especially went to the Jews and heathen, and preached the gospel to them.<a name=235:4></a> The church had nothing to say to it.<a name=235:5></a> If the church had pretended to have authority over the idolatrous heathen, or the unconverted Jews, they would have laughed at them, or perhaps put them in prison for their pains.<a name=235:6></a> It is "self-evident" that the church had no kind of authority, real or pretended, over the heathen or over the Jews.<a name=235:7></a> Those sent of God went and preached to them, and when the Spirit of God (wholly apart from the church, which in such case was not formed there, and had no authority over the unbelievers if it had begun to be formed) wrought through grace in the hearts of the hearers, there was faith produced, and the foundations of the church laid by the testimony being received.<a name=235:8></a> Dr.<a name=235:9></a> Manning's real meaning is that the clergy should have power in the church when it is formed, which is quite another point.<a name=235:10></a> We have known them too well.<a name=235:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the baptized, he tells us, "received the full illumination of Christianity from the living voice of the apostles.<a name=235:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is equally unfounded.<a name=235:13></a> It is confounding conversion to Christ with teaching and building up.<a name=235:14></a> When by preaching (not by the church or its authority) heathens had been converted, then the apostles and others, as Apollos, etc.<a name=235:15></a>, proceeded to build them up in the truth and godliness of walk; and to this especially served the Epistles, as they do for believers now.<a name=235:16></a> That Christianity was preached and believed throughout the world before the New Testament was written is a mere fable, for it is not done yet.<a name=235:17></a> If in saying so it is merely meant that the gospel was no longer confined to Palestine, but had gone out among the Gentiles before the New Testament was written, no one denies it; but it was no interpretation of the church, no work of the church, no authority of the church, which did the work or gave power to do it.<a name=235:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the church had no authority with Pagans: they recognized it in no way.<a name=236:1></a> Individuals sent by God carried the revelation God had given them by the Holy Ghost, and carried the revelation of Christ where it had never been, where there was no church.<a name=236:2></a> And Paul boasts of this, that he did carry it where it was not known, and that he had what he preached, not from the church at Jerusalem, but from the Lord Himself.<a name=236:3></a> In every respect he boasts of what Dr.<a name=236:4></a> Manning says.<a name=236:5></a> (Romans 15: 20; 2 Corinthians 10: 14, 15; Galatians 1 and 2.<a name=236:6></a>) And even as to the Jews, when he had preached at Berea the Jews there searched the scriptures to see if these things were so; therefore many of them believed, and they are called "noble" for doing so.<a name=236:7></a> But the church is nowhere referred to; the church had no authority; the church interpreted nothing: there was no church to do it.<a name=236:8></a> The church came into existence in each place by the labours of the apostles and others employed by God, who carried the revelation of His grace, and wholly without the church, by the word of God and by the operations of the Spirit of God.<a name=236:9></a> Grace wrought with the testimony of God, and by it the church came into existence.<a name=236:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is "self-evident" that the church could not interpret among the heathen, for it was not then in existence; and, according to Dr.<a name=236:11></a> Manning's own statement, the scriptures were not there to be interpreted, so that his whole argument is not worth one straw.<a name=236:12></a> In the case of the Jews at Berea, who had the scriptures, they studied them to see if the apostles were founded in what they said; while their church, if church it is to be called, rejected the Lord utterly, and would have hindered every one receiving Him if they could; but they searched the word for themselves, and by grace believed.<a name=236:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is impossible to have anything more directly opposed to the facts and the truth than the statements of Dr.<a name=236:14></a> Manning.<a name=236:15></a> Dr.<a name=236:16></a> Milner, in his "End of Controversy," is obliged to own there was special grace for the heathen, as of course the church was nothing for them.<a name=236:17></a> I suppose he would have us believe that there is none for Christians, or that blessing came by grace and the Holy Ghost for heathens, but does not do so for Christians.<a name=236:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=237>[Page 237]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is not true that the whole revelation of God was communicated to Christians on their conversion.<a name=237:1></a> Not that anything was concealed, but they were not able to bear it; they were babes in Christ, and the apostles were "to give them meat in due season.<a name=237:2></a>" It is not even true that the apostles received it all at once.<a name=237:3></a> Paul had revelations and communications from heaven all along his course.<a name=237:4></a> He tells the Corinthians that he could only feed them with milk, not with solid food, because of their carnal condition; 1 Corinthians 3: 1, 2.<a name=237:5></a> The Hebrews were blamed because there was still need to teach them the first elements; Hebrews 5.<a name=237:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All Dr.<a name=237:7></a> Manning's statements are mis-statements.<a name=237:8></a> But I repeat, because it is the main point, that nobody denies that the apostles and others went preaching the gospel to the heathen; but this is just the proof that the church (which the heathen did not acknowledge, and which did not exist where the messengers of Christ preached) had nothing whatever to do with the matter -- interpreted nothing -- for there was nothing yet to interpret.<a name=237:9></a> Dr.<a name=237:10></a> Manning insists that the New Testament did not exist yet.<a name=237:11></a> How then could the church interpret it?<a name=237:12></a> What is proved by this fact is that the word is brought home to the heart by the power of the Spirit of God, and by this they are drawn into the place of blessing so as, when gathered, to become the church.<a name=237:13></a> But the work is done without the church.<a name=237:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Am I not right in saying that Dr.<a name=237:15></a> Manning's argumentation is contemptible?<a name=237:16></a> The scriptures did come after the first work, as they may now as to individual souls.<a name=237:17></a> The preached word works in them, and they turn to the written word for "the certainty of the things" they believed, as stated in Luke's Gospel, "that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed.<a name=237:18></a>" Thus the written word gave the certainty when the instruction or the living voice had been there.<a name=237:19></a> It was <i>not</i> the instructor interpreting and giving living power to the word, but the word giving certainty as to what they had been instructed in.<a name=237:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dr.<a name=237:21></a> Manning says (page 8), "the divine teacher from whom the scriptures come is always in the midst of us (Christians).<a name=237:22></a> They love Him and interpret His writings in His presence and by His word.<a name=237:23></a>" There is confusion of Christ and the Spirit here, but let that pass.<a name=237:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=238>[Page 238]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now to deal with the question of Christians and not of heathens.<a name=238:1></a> Did the church stand and interpret the scriptures when they were written to the faithful?<a name=238:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I must beg my reader to note the ambiguity of this word 'church,' and the false meaning hidden under it by all Romanists and those who follow their principles.<a name=238:3></a> The church is the assembly of God upon the earth, united to its Head, and the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost come down from heaven.<a name=238:4></a> This, though he would add a head on earth and a hierarchy uniting it, Dr.<a name=238:5></a> Manning would himself admit; at any rate it is true.<a name=238:6></a> How does this universal body on earth teach itself?<a name=238:7></a> Dr.<a name=238:8></a> Manning blasphemously says (page 9), "the church is the interpretation of that book, just as Jesus Christ in the synagogue of Nazareth was the interpretation of the book of the prophet Esias in His own person.<a name=238:9></a>" He adds (page 10), that Christ "claimed also to be the interpreter of the same -- so now the church.<a name=238:10></a>" To say that the church is the interpretation of the scriptures is blasphemous nonsense, when it is put instead, and taking the place, of Christ as it is here, and distinct from being the interpreter.<a name=238:11></a> It is one subject spoken of there; but the revelation of the Father in Christ, redemption, salvation, the presence and operation of the Holy Ghost are primary objects of the New Testament; and to put the church in the place of Christ, <i>as is expressly done here</i>, is, I repeat, blasphemous nonsense.<a name=238:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But my subject now is the interpreter.<a name=238:13></a> Now does this whole, if you please, organized body (though I should deny historically Dr.<a name=238:14></a> Manning's statements as to this) interpret to and for itself?<a name=238:15></a> That is not what is either meant or said when Romanist teachers explain themselves.<a name=238:16></a> They mean and say the teaching part of the church, the clergy, which teaches all the rest.<a name=238:17></a> "The church" sounds very fine, teaches, etc.<a name=238:18></a>; but it is all clap-trap.<a name=238:19></a> It means, the clergy teach the church; and all are to submit to them.<a name=238:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, what was the fact as to the scriptures?<a name=238:21></a> Dr.<a name=238:22></a> Manning says, There they were like Isaiah in the hand of the blessed Lord, and the church is now, instead of Him, the interpretation and the interpreter.<a name=238:23></a> What was the fact?<a name=238:24></a> The Gospels were written for the faithful -- one, immediately for a certain Theophilus, that he might know the certainty of the things he had been instructed in.<a name=238:25></a> He had the instruction, and this was to make all quite certain to him.<a name=238:26></a> There is simply no interpreting church at all.<a name=238:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=239>[Page 239]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the case of the Epistles is if possible clearer.<a name=239:1></a> The apostles wrote to churches and Christians; and these persons were to receive and abide by what they wrote -- to receive them as "the commandments of the Lord"; those who did not heed the words of the apostles were to be noted and avoided.<a name=239:2></a> That is, the scriptures were the things addressed authoritatively and immediately to the body of ordinary Christians, and they were bound to receive, and believe, and obey, and act upon them, without an interpreter or any one who might pretend to come in between the authority of that written word and their souls.<a name=239:3></a> The scriptures bound them by apostolic authority, bound them directly, were the addresses of authority to the Christian people, who were bound to obey them and bow to them.<a name=239:4></a> In one place it is charged to be read to all the holy brethren.<a name=239:5></a> Any one coming in between these scriptures and the conscience of the Christian people, they receiving them, bowing to them, acting on them because they so came, would have been coming in between the apostles' (that is, divine) authority and the people who were bound to bow to them, and to receive their writings as addressed to them by that authority.<a name=239:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such a case is recorded in the Third Epistle of John.<a name=239:7></a> This apostle wrote to the assembly, and Diotrephes stepped in to hinder the people from receiving and <i>bowing</i> to the epistle.<a name=239:8></a> John declares he will remember him and his prating words if he comes.<a name=239:9></a> If I send a letter of orders to my servants, he who steps in and takes the letter and does not allow it to reach directly and as my orders <i>to</i> them and <i>addressed</i> to them, is meddling not merely with the servants' rights (though, as regards the meddler, the servants being under the obligation to follow their master's orders, they had both a right and were bound to have them themselves because they were responsible to act on them as so sent <i>to them</i>), but he is meddling with the master's right and wisdom in sending it.<a name=239:10></a> It was sent to the servants, not to the meddler, and the servants are bound to take it; it was sent to them, and they are responsible.<a name=239:11></a> Now this is the place an interpreting clergy take.<a name=239:12></a> They meddle with God's rights, and impugn God's wisdom in sending these scriptures to the Christian people.<a name=239:13></a> They cannot take away the responsibility of these servants; they cannot deny that the scriptures, all save a very small part, were addressed to the Christian (of old to the Jewish) <i>people</i> by the inspired persons ordained of God.<a name=239:14></a>

		It is important to see this clearly.<a name=240:1></a> Speaking of the Epistles, there was no church to explain; they were addressed directly to the church, no scriptures existing already as to which the church had to exercise such an office.<a name=240:2></a> The scriptures are the writings themselves, sent by inspired persons (that is, by God) to the persons who were to use them, exactly what they wanted; and these persons were bound to use and submit to them, and responsible for not doing so if they did not.<a name=240:3></a> The Epistles were the communication and divine wisdom of inspired teachers, the apostles, whom God had sent, addressed directly to the heart and conscience of the Christian people.<a name=240:4></a> In their very nature they were immediate addresses or treatises so to speak for all, and what concerned all.<a name=240:5></a> Three small epistles alone are an exception, though in these there is abundant instruction for all too.<a name=240:6></a> But then this is an additional proof of what I insist on.<a name=240:7></a> For the special servants of the Lord the apostle wrote to those servants themselves, for the people he wrote directly to the people.<a name=240:8></a> He had in no case the idea of putting his Epistles in the hands of one set of people to be used by them for another set.<a name=240:9></a> This is Dr.<a name=240:10></a> Manning's theory, putting to this end the church in the place of Christ in the synagogue.<a name=240:11></a>

		Now Romanism and the clerical system have done this.<a name=240:12></a> These have taken the scriptures out of the hands of the Christian people, and given them what they liked; a deadly offence against God and His authority who sent them to the Christian people -- heinous wickedness.<a name=240:13></a> And what has been the consequence?<a name=240:14></a> The dark ages -- a state of things in what was called the church, which no horrors of heathenism ever equalled.<a name=240:15></a>

		What is now the result of these facts as to this part of our subject, in reply to this wicked pretension of the church, that is, the clergy, holding the scriptures in their hand as authorized interpreters, according to the system of Dr.<a name=241:1></a> Manning?<a name=241:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the Jews, there were the Old Testament scriptures, and the apostles appealed to them; but there was no church to interpret them authentically.<a name=241:8></a> The Jews owned neither nor apostles, but, when they were through grace well-disposed, searched the scriptures to see if these things were so.<a name=241:9></a> And many believed and judged the apostles true and became part of the church.<a name=241:10></a> But it is again the hearers in whom grace acts, and no thought of authoritative interpretation.<a name=241:11></a> As regards Christians, so far from the church being an interpreter of the scriptures for them, these scriptures themselves are what are sent to <i>the Christians themselves</i> as the direct and authoritative expression of the divine mind which they were to follow.<a name=241:12></a> When the church should have decayed, and have fallen into ungodly ways (as at present, when this system is urged), we are told to turn away from these ungodly formalists and have recourse to the scriptures.<a name=241:13></a>

		And this last principle is most strikingly enforced in the churches of the Apocalypse, where, when Christ is judging the state of the churches, the individual saint is called upon to hear, not what the church says, but what the Spirit says <i>to</i> the churches, the judgment passed upon them by the Lord.<a name=241:14></a> The church is the subject of the judgment, and the individual Christian is to listen, IF HE HAVE EARS, individually, to what Christ judges of it -- is bound to hear, for Christ speaks and calls him to hear.<a name=241:15></a> Every fact and every instruction that God has given is exactly the opposite of Dr.<a name=241:16></a> Manning's, which is not of God, but that corrupt work of the enemy, which has set aside the authority of what God has said.<a name=241:17></a>

		Besides, history makes known (nor are facts wanting now to confirm it, though not so glaring as before the Reformation) that this pretended living organization was the most vile, wicked, corrupt, immoral body that ever existed; sunk in profligacy of every and of the worst kind; cruel, persecuting, and ambitious, and notoriously worse than the heathen whom it supplanted.<a name=242:18></a> Is that the "living organization" of which Christ is the Head?<a name=242:19></a> It is impossible to defile one's pages with the habitual course of conduct of what Dr.<a name=242:20></a> Manning refers us to as taking the place of Christ, and as a living organization under Christ as its Head; and I speak on the authority of their own historians.<a name=242:21></a> Baronius, their great historian, a cardinal and a Jesuit, declares that for a century he cannot own those who filled the See of Rome as legitimate popes -- put in, as they were, by the mistresses of the Marquis of Tuscany, and not chosen by the clergy or even approved by them.<a name=242:22></a> It is well people should know that never was any body of people on earth so depraved as Dr.<a name=242:23></a> Manning's "living organization"; and the human head on earth, at the head of the depravity, often fighting for this seat of power, and, if one turned another out, declaring all the consecrations and ordinations null and void, so that a book had to be written to shew there were still sacraments.<a name=242:24></a> All was in such confusion, and often two and even three popes at a time, and Europe divided as to who was the true one, each excommunicating the other and all that owned him.<a name=242:25></a>

		There is no such history in the world for iniquity and confusion as that of Rome.<a name=243:1></a> I dare Dr.<a name=243:2></a> Manning to deny it, or, if bold enough to do it, to disprove it from history.<a name=243:3></a> Indeed the evil state of what is called the church began before Rome's supremacy, though it ripened under it.<a name=243:4></a> Let anyone read Salvian, "De gubernatione Dei," accounting for the judgment coming on the Roman empire, declaring that virtue was to be found among the heretics and heathen, and nowhere among Christians; Cyprian "De Pudicitia," or Chrysostom's "Two discourses on the Virgins," both shewing the extent of depravity already existing in what was afterwards matured in the Roman system, in the boasted holiness and real depravity of monks and nuns.<a name=243:5></a> The assistance of God the Holy Spirit is always with His church and people; but is that a reason for taking the chief leaders in debauchery and wickedness -- and such were the popes and clergy, I defy denial -- as the vessels of that Spirit to interpret the scriptures with authority as Christ did?<a name=243:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now let us see, in passing, some of Dr.<a name=243:7></a> Manning's arguments.<a name=243:8></a> The New Testament was not the source whence Christianity was derived (page 7).<a name=243:9></a> Fully admitted: it was derived from God through the revelation given to the apostles.<a name=243:10></a> But that is not the question.<a name=243:11></a> The question is, Are the writings of the apostles and the inspired instruments of the Holy Ghost, addressed to the Christian people at large, the best means of knowing what they taught, or Dr.<a name=243:12></a> Manning's interpretation of them, and that of other such persons who set themselves up to preach themselves and call themselves the church?<a name=243:13></a> Specially when the apostle declares that the professing church would become as bad as possible (2 Timothy 3), and that then the scriptures were the resource of the man of God.<a name=243:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again he tells us (page 9), "If we are compelled to depend upon the church for this knowledge that the scripture was ever written, and that these scriptures are the identical books which the apostle wrote -- if we must depend for this upon the testimony of the church -- where is the consistency of the man who says, I will take all this from you, but I refuse to accept from you the meaning of that book?<a name=243:15></a>" Supposing my banker keeps my will safe, and that the witnesses to it testify to its being the true will of the testator, therefore the banker and the witnesses are the only interpreters of the will?<a name=243:16></a> Now I do not admit Dr.<a name=243:17></a> Manning's principle or fact; but his argument is nonsense.<a name=243:18></a>

		But further he tells us that this living organization is also before the apostle's mind when he says that when Jesus ascended into heaven, "He gave some apostles .<a name=244:1></a>.<a name=244:2></a>.<a name=244:3></a> for edifying of the body of Christ," which last he justly speaks of as the church (page 14).<a name=244:4></a> But this upsets all his reasoning, for it is not the church which teaches or interprets, but which is taught and edified -- the very point I have insisted on.<a name=244:5></a> And this distinction is very important; because "the church" carries with it an amazing idea of solemnity, authority, divine competency to hold a special place of authority, which is a mere lie of the author of lies.<a name=244:6></a> The church is edified.<a name=244:7></a> God's word has authority.<a name=244:8></a> God employs instruments and responsible instruments of His choice to edify it.<a name=244:9></a> The inspired teachers, whose teaching we have in the scriptures, had and have authority because they were inspired.<a name=244:10></a> Others are useful in the degree in which they hold fast to the word, and labour with the power of the Holy Ghost working with them.<a name=244:11></a> But they may, we are expressly told, build wood, hay, and stubble, and their work will be burned; as they have done and worse, so that it will be burned.<a name=244:12></a> There may be those, as popes and Romanist teachers, who labour to corrupt the church; they shall be destroyed.<a name=244:13></a> But this house of God does not edify but is edified.<a name=244:14></a> There is indeed a sense in which it edifies itself; but then it is by every member in its place "compacted together by that which every joint supplieth, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.<a name=244:15></a>" But this more than ever destroys the false statements of Dr.<a name=244:16></a> Manning, because it is not the church which teaches.<a name=244:17></a>

		But it is not true that Rome has not varied in saying this is inspired, this is not.<a name=249:1></a> Rome for three centuries and more did not receive the Epistle to the Hebrews; and Rome receives the Apocrypha now, books which her own doctors in former ages rejected as not inspired, and which are not found in the Hebrew.<a name=249:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two great principles remain for the sincere Christian.<a name=249:3></a> It is positively revealed (2 Timothy 3), that the church would fail and become as bad as heathenism; and the Christian is directed to turn away from the evil and turn to the scriptures, and Christ (Revelation 2 and 3) is revealed as judging the state of the churches, and the individual is called to listen to what He says as to judging the churches; so that the church cannot have authority over the Christian, for he is called to listen to Christ judging it.<a name=249:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, listening to the apostles <i>themselves</i> is made a test of the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.<a name=249:5></a> "He that is of God," says the apostle John, "heareth us, and he that is not of God heareth not us.<a name=249:6></a>" Now it is admitted by all that we have what they have said in their Epistles.<a name=249:7></a> I am bound therefore to listen to the scriptures, or I am not of God.<a name=249:8></a> And this responsibility rests on the individual Christian, and He cannot escape it.<a name=249:9></a> He that is of God listens to what the apostles have said.<a name=249:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it is alleged that, in listening to what Fathers and traditions say, we must be more likely to have the truth, as they were nearer to the source.<a name=249:11></a> But we have the source itself, that is, what the inspired teachers themselves have taught.<a name=249:12></a> It is not what (as Tertullian says) is <i>prius</i>, or earlier, must be truer.<a name=249:13></a> Paul says, that after his decease, grievous wolves and perverse men would arise.<a name=249:14></a> But the word of scripture is express: "Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard <i>from the beginning</i>.<a name=249:15></a> If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.<a name=249:16></a>" What we read in scripture is certainly from the beginning; what we read or hear elsewhere certainly is not; it may or may not be confirmed to it, but it is not from the beginning, so that I can judge by it.<a name=249:17></a> I have to judge if it is.<a name=249:18></a> He that is of God heareth us.<a name=249:19></a> And the reason is obvious.<a name=249:20></a> Those teachers are, what they tell us is, divinely inspired; what is said by other teachers is not.<a name=249:21></a>

		Finally we do need the grace of the Holy Spirit to use the scriptures; but it is said to the babes in Christ to guard them against the seductions of false doctrines, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things," and "the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.<a name=250:1></a>" Not that there may not be teachers; John was teaching them this.<a name=250:2></a> But when there is a question of seducing teachers, the weakest saint is referred to what was from the beginning, the apostle's own teaching, and assured that they, the weakest, had the Holy Spirit, and that thus by His grace and the scriptures, or what was "from the beginning," the apostle's own and inspired teaching, they would be kept from error and seduction, and so only.<a name=250:3></a>

		DISCIPLINE AND UNITY OF THE ASSEMBLY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two principles seem to be at work at the present moment which it may be well to notice in connection with the title of this publication -- <i>The Present Testimony</i>.<a name=251:1></a><a href="#251:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> We are living in a time when all things are in question, and principles of every kind are abroad.<a name=251:2></a> If there are such as seem to destroy the very position of the saints as a testimony in the midst of Christendom -- a conscious and intelligent testimony -- it is not amiss that attention should be drawn to them.<a name=251:3></a> The two principles I refer to are --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the denial of the obligation of a Christian assembly to maintain purity in order to be owned as such, or rather, the denying that if it allow evil within itself, it becomes defiled; and
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, the denial of the unity of the body as regards the church here on earth.<a name=251:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have heard in such various quarters, both as to morals and doctrine, that no assembly of Christians can be defiled by any evil in it, and even that it has to go on and leave it to the Lord to lay His hand upon the evil and put it out, that I must suppose it to be a principle generally admitted.<a name=251:5></a> And what has been often alleged in individual argument on the second point noticed above is now maintained in a tract which has been voluntarily sent me, I suppose for my edification, and which I therefore now take notice of.<a name=251:6></a> I am ignorant who is its author, and discuss its principles briefly as a subject that it is well to bring before the minds of many.<a name=251:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A tract has also been sent me on the first point.<a name=251:8></a> I have heard by report who is its author, but shall here simply discuss its principles.<a name=251:9></a> The two questions are, Can there be corporate defilement by allowed evil in morals or doctrine?<a name=251:10></a> and, Is there any unity of the church of God upon earth?<a name=251:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been openly contended that, if fornication be allowed in a body of Christians, it is no ground of separating from it.<a name=251:12></a> This has been met by others; indeed exposing it in daylight was the best way of meeting it.<a name=251:13></a> To say that Christians were to separate from the world, to detach themselves from the great body of the professing church because of ecclesiastical evils, and then to affirm that positive immorality did not defile their community, but that, supposing it was allowed, saints should still own such a meeting all the same, was a proposition so monstrous, such a preference of ecclesiastical notions to the unalterable morality of God in the gospel, that one can only wonder how it was possible any Christians could have got into such a state of moral darkness.<a name=251:14></a> It was a solemn witness of the effect of false principles.<a name=251:15></a> With the individuals or their meeting we have of course nothing to do, save as the charity of Christ demands.<a name=251:16></a> We speak of principles; and let us see where these would lead.<a name=251:17></a> Those who are inside such a meeting of Christians are not allowed to break with them.<a name=251:18></a> They are bound to accept the companionship of sin, bound to accept disobedience to the apostle's rule, "Put out from among yourselves that wicked person.<a name=251:19></a>" They must live in constant communion with evil, and constantly in the most solemn act of Christianity affirm the fellowship of light and darkness.<a name=251:20></a>

		But this is not all.<a name=252:1></a> In such kind of meetings a meeting in one place receives, as did the scriptural churches, those in communion in another, and, when formally done, by letters of commendation.<a name=252:2></a> Suppose the fornicator, or even those who have maintained his continuing in the meeting (another allowance thus of sin), to be commended, or to come in communion from the supposed meeting; and if they receive him deliberately at home, they must of course give him, so far as they are concerned, the same title abroad, and he is received elsewhere; and thus the deliberate wickedness of a majority of the meeting to which he belongs, or of the whole of it, if you please, obliges thus every Christian meeting, and, when the church of God was in order, we might say every church of God in the world, to put its seal on communion with sin and evil, and say that sin could be freely admitted at the table of the Lord, and Christ and Belial get on perfectly well together; or break with the meeting or church, that is, disown its being such at all.<a name=252:3></a> But if they ought, those who have any conscience in the meeting itself ought.<a name=252:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The national Establishment is incomparably better than this.<a name=252:5></a> There there is no pretension to discipline; each one is pious for himself.<a name=252:6></a> Here sin, and communion with sin at the Lord's table, is sanctioned on principle.<a name=252:7></a> And if it is admitted that it ought not to be allowed, it is declared, that if it is deliberately allowed, every one must acquiesce in it, the meeting is not defiled, and the disobedient sinners have a right to force the whole church of God to accept it, if not in principle, in practice, and deny their principles.<a name=252:8></a> It is the church of God securing as such, and by its special privilege and title, the rights of sin against Christ.<a name=252:9></a> How it would be possible to conceive anything worse I cannot imagine; it really seems to me the most wicked principle that possibly can be thought of And it is not merely the habits of a particular class of Christians which lead to this; the scriptural order of the church of God, as shewn in the scriptures, involves this sanction of sin if the theory be true.<a name=252:10></a>

		No person can deny that saints passed from one assembly to another, and, if belonging to one, were received in another.<a name=253:1></a> It was not an organization of churches, such as Presbyterianism or Episcopacy, which I name here only to be understood, but it was a full recognition of them as expressions of the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=253:2></a> We see the saints going from one, and received as such in another, and that in virtue of letters commendatory.<a name=253:3></a> It was because each assembly was owned as representing the body of Christ in its locality that others were bound to receive those who belonged to it as being members of that body.<a name=253:4></a> Each local assembly was responsible within itself to maintain the order and godliness suited to the assembly of God, and was to be trusted in it; it is not disputing the competency of the local assembly, but owning it, when I receive a person because he belongs to it.<a name=253:5></a> If I do not receive a person who belongs to it, I deny its being a competent witness of the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=253:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is exactly in this place the Spirit of God puts the local assembly at Corinth; not denying the unity of all saints on earth in one body, but owning the local assembly as so far representing it.<a name=253:7></a> "Ye are the body of Christ, and members one of another.<a name=253:8></a>" Now if I own the assembly at Corinth or anywhere else to hold that place, surely I must receive a person belonging to it as a member of the body of Christ -- other membership I do not own.<a name=253:9></a> I quite agree that scripture owns no other; but for that very reason, when the apostle says, "Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular," and "we are all one body, for we are all partakers of that one loaf," I am bound to own the assembly as representing the body, and those who partake of the one loaf as members of the body.<a name=253:10></a> If I do not, I fall into the principle of a mere voluntary association, which makes rules for itself, and does what it pleases.<a name=253:11></a> Am I then to recognize, as representing the unity of the body, and acting by the Spirit with the Lord's authority, an assembly which sanctions sin, and says it is not defiled by it?<a name=253:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, suppose such an assembly, say at Corinth, had put out from among themselves the wicked person, and another assembly received him, the latter thereby denies that the first has acted in the character of an assembly of God, representing there the body of Christ.<a name=254:1></a> It denies the action of the Holy Ghost in the assembly, or that what has been bound on earth has been bound in heaven.<a name=254:2></a> It is a mere sophism to suppose that, because an organization formed of assemblies is disowned, the responsibility of each assembly to the Lord is disowned, and its competent action by the Holy Ghost in the matters of the church of God.<a name=254:3></a> If a person were put out at Corinth, and received at Ephesus, the action of the Holy Ghost in the body at Corinth was denied, or Ephesus refused the action and denied the authority of the Holy Ghost and of Christ; that is, the assemblies were owned because each did in its locality act under the Lord and by the Holy Ghost.<a name=254:4></a> No doubt they might fail; Corinth would have failed but for the intervention of the Spirit by the apostle.<a name=254:5></a> But such is the scriptural principle, and that which we have to look for in an assembly; and the assembly is owned because it acts by the Holy Ghost under the authority of the Lord.<a name=254:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This point being cleared (and 1 Corinthians seems to me not to leave a trace of doubt on it), I would turn to another -- the consequent responsibility of the Christians who compose it.<a name=254:7></a> They are to act for Christ by the Holy Ghost.<a name=254:8></a> "Put out from among yourselves that wicked person.<a name=254:9></a>" Paul forces it on the assembly; so in cases of wrong it is finally told to the assembly, and the "without" and "within" refer to it; that is, I get the body responsible as well as competent.<a name=254:10></a> The Lord, who knew all the coming history of His church, has extended this in His grace to two or three gathered in His name, and connects this with discipline and being heard.<a name=254:11></a> When two or three are gathered in His name, there is He in the midst of them.<a name=254:12></a> Thus, while fully admitting that all the saints in a locality constitute properly the one assembly in a place, if they will not unite, the responsibility and the presence of the Lord are found with those who do, and their acts, if really done as met in His name, have His authority; that is, another such assembly must own the assembly and their acts, or disown their connection with the Lord.<a name=254:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=255>[Page 255]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not mean that, if they fail in any particular case, they may not be remonstrated with, entreated, and so on; but, in a regular way, one assembly owns the action of the other, according to the promise of the Lord's presence, because if it be a true assembly it owns the Lord's own action in it, its own Lord's action and the assembly as His.<a name=255:1></a> It is not a voluntary church, but a scriptural divine assembly; if they are not so gathered, and do not own the unity of the body, the power and presence of the Holy Ghost, and the presence of Jesus as so gathered together in His name only, I do not own the assembly, though I may the saints who compose it.<a name=255:2></a> In the other case I am bound to do so.<a name=255:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further, we find that the assembly at Corinth did not put out the wicked person, and the apostle set about to correct this, and, indeed, would not go there while they were in this state, unless it were to exercise rigorous severity.<a name=255:4></a> His words, in speaking of it in the second Epistle, shew the thought that they were involved in the evil by allowing it -- "Ye have proved <i>yourselves</i> clear in this matter.<a name=255:5></a>" His complaint was that there was sin, leaven -- not merely a sinner, but sin among them; and, ignorant as yet of discipline, they had not grieved so as that God should have removed the evil-doer from their midst; and he tells them to purge out the old leaven (not merely to put the person out, which was his practical direction) that <i>they might</i> be a new lump as they were unleavened.<a name=255:6></a> They, acquiescing in the sin, were involved in it; they were viewed in Christ and their true standing as unleavened; but they were to put out the old leaven that they might be a new lump, that their actual condition and standing might agree: otherwise they, the assembly, were not a new lump.<a name=255:7></a> Hence, in the second Epistle, when the first had produced its effect, the apostle says "that they had proved <i>themselves</i> clear in this matter"; but, if acquiescing in it, they were not clear.<a name=255:8></a> The assembly was not a new lump, and the members of it were not clear, if they accepted the principle of allowing sin in their midst.<a name=255:9></a> To use the title of our standing as a sanction for acquiescing in sin in fact in the assembly, saying it cannot be defiled, is a most evil and pestilential doctrine; and that persons in it, not guilty of the sin in act, are clear though they acquiesce in it, is a thoroughly wicked principle, and directly contrary to scripture.<a name=255:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, more, an assembly which admits such a principle has forfeited its tide to be owned in the way I have spoken of above.<a name=255:11></a> We have seen it is a common point agreed upon, that the particular assembly met truly in the Lord's name represents the body of Christ, and Christ is to be looked for in their midst.<a name=255:12></a> But I cannot own an assembly which admits or acquiesces in sin, which takes this ground that sin does not defile it, to represent the body of Christ, or to be met in Christ's name.<a name=255:13></a> It is to make Christ acquiesce in the sin -- "a minister of sin.<a name=255:14></a>" God forbid!<a name=255:15></a> Christ's body (and we declare by "the one loaf" that we are one body) is a holy body; I cannot say I am one body with sinners.<a name=255:16></a> That a sinner or hypocrite may have slipped in, we all admit; but I do not own him.<a name=255:17></a> But if a body admit or acquiesce in sinners being there, it ceases to have the character of Christ's body altogether, or Christ's body is compatible with known sin; that is, the Holy Ghost and Christ present, admit and allow the sin.<a name=255:18></a> This doctrine (of the assembly not being defiled by known sin being there) is a direct denial of the presence of the Holy Ghost making them one, and of the authority of a present Lord.<a name=255:19></a> Does He accept sin in the members of the body?<a name=255:20></a> If not, those who do are acting as a voluntary meeting, acting on their own rules, not admitting the animating power of the Spirit of Christ; for it is a blasphemy to say He admits sin in those who belong to Him: an assembly which has this doctrine is not an assembly of God at all.<a name=255:21></a> Carelessness there may be -- it should be corrected; but he who, as a principle, owns the existence of sin in the assembly, and denies it is defiled, denies its unity and the Lord's presence; that is, it is not an assembly met in His name at all.<a name=255:22></a> What I think essential in this matter is the promised presence of the Lord, and the acting of the Spirit of God.<a name=255:23></a> If this be so, if I own the Lord, I must own the assembly and its acts; if it has a principle contrary to the presence of the Lord and the action of the Holy Ghost, I cannot own it as His.<a name=255:24></a>

		These extracts will suffice to give the writer's mind.<a name=259:1></a> I affirm that, with the exception of the fact that local assemblies were formed, every statement of it is in direct contradiction with scripture, and that the very truth which the Spirit of God has been rescuing from the corruption of ages is laboriously denied in it.<a name=259:2></a> The best way to shew this will be to quote scripture as I have quoted the author.<a name=259:3></a> Our author quotes Romans 12: 4, 5; Colossians 2: 17, 19; and Ephesians 4; and 1 Corinthians 12; and says, "Why, it may be profitable to ask, is an assembly of believers such as the assembly at Corinth, to whom Paul wrote, united in faith and love to the Lord Jesus, and united by ties of love and sympathy to one another, compared to the human body?<a name=259:4></a>" (page 16).<a name=259:5></a> "To whom, then, was this comparison designed to apply?<a name=259:6></a> Was it designed to apply to the mystical body of Christ, or to what is sometimes called the holy catholic .<a name=259:7></a>.<a name=259:8></a>.<a name=259:9></a> church, which, correctly viewed, is the same thing; or was it designed to apply to an individual assembly of disciples?<a name=259:10></a> It was designed, we apprehend, to apply to both" (pages 16, 17).<a name=259:11></a> It is then he states what has been already quoted, "But the mystical 'one body' of Christ is nowhere to be seen in this world; nor is the church universal anywhere to be seen on earth as one body, except by representation.<a name=259:12></a> Where, then, is that representation given?<a name=259:13></a> It is given, scripture answers, by every scripturally constituted church" (page 17).<a name=259:14></a>

		Now I have already recognized the responsibility of each local assembly in faithful discipline and unity as locally representing the whole body, because the Spirit and the Lord are there; so that they act by an authority which necessarily is binding on every other assembly, save allowance, as all make, for human failure, if the assembly be a true one.<a name=259:15></a> The question is, Is any one body recognized on earth?<a name=259:16></a> We are told "it formed no part of the commission which the risen Saviour gave the apostles to execute -- that they should form all those of whom by the preaching of the gospel they made disciples into one visibly connected religious community" (page 3).<a name=259:17></a> This assertion is easily disposed of.<a name=259:18></a> It is wholly beside the mark in every respect.<a name=259:19></a> There is not a word about churches, church, community, or communities, in the commission of the apostles.<a name=259:20></a> The mission or missions given by the risen Saviour had nothing to say to them.<a name=259:21></a> Either the gospel was to every creature unto salvation or condemnation, or repentance and remission of sins to be preached among all nations, or the nations were to be made disciples of.<a name=259:22></a>

		There is a church spoken of; but the Lord is the builder or adder to it: this is never said of churches.<a name=260:1></a> But even when the apostles' work in this respect is spoken of, it is in general, or the whole assembly of God is spoken of, not particular assemblies, though such we know were formed, and in a practical sense in their own sphere represented the whole assembly.<a name=260:2></a> But the denial of an assembly as one whole on earth is a great and mischievous error: we will consult the scriptures.<a name=260:3></a> The author distinctly states, "We read afterwards, accordingly, not of one church or religious community, but of numerous distinct religious communities independent of each other" (page 3).<a name=260:4></a> This is in the teeth of scripture.<a name=260:5></a> "Scripture teaches that it is the bounden duty of every one who becomes a disciple of Jesus openly to profess his faith, and unite himself with a company of his fellow disciples" (page 33).<a name=260:6></a> I deny this entirely.<a name=260:7></a> Scripture NEVER teaches anything of the kind; they were added to <i>the</i> assembly; nor is there such an idea in scripture as uniting himself with <i>a</i> church.<a name=260:8></a> The writer does not tell us where scripture teaches it -- for the best of reasons, because he cannot.<a name=260:9></a> Nor can any one be called on to prove a negation; but we shall find that scripture speaks quite otherwise on the subject.<a name=260:10></a> Disciples were added to the Lord, and became thus a part of the assembly.<a name=260:11></a>

		Let us now take up scripture, and see how <i>it</i> speaks on the subject.<a name=260:12></a> The first place the assembly is spoken of is in Matthew 16: "On this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of hell [hades] shall not prevail against it.<a name=260:13></a>" Now building the assembly is not even a mystical union of individuals with the Head in heaven.<a name=260:14></a> It supposes a system established on earth -- a building -- one assembly.<a name=260:15></a> The end of the clause is the plainest proof of this: a promise that the gates of hades should not prevail against mystical union with Christ in heaven, to the exclusion of the conditions of a church on earth, is an interpretation which condemns itself.<a name=260:16></a> The gates of hades have nothing to say to individual mystical union with Christ in heaven.<a name=260:17></a>

		We may now turn to the church's dealings with them when they were within.<a name=261:23></a> The first Epistle to the Corinthians will here afford us divine light.<a name=261:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first of Corinthians it is of moment to remark because it is the epistle in which a local assembly is spoken of as practically in certain respects representing the whole assembly of God, that the epistle is addressed to all believers everywhere -- all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=261:25></a> We get a church-character, but the apostle in his address is careful to associate all Christians with those at Corinth.<a name=261:26></a> Hence, if one was put out as a wicked person by the assembly at Corinth, he was "without," that is, outside the whole church of God (not of the body of Christ vitally, but the assembly on earth).<a name=261:27></a> Nor can you indeed read the entire epistle without seeing that what was said by the apostle, and consequently done by the assembly at Corinth, was an act valid for the whole body of saints on earth; that they are viewed as involved in it, as indeed they are expressly mentioned.<a name=261:28></a> To say he was only outside the particular assembly, when he was put out of it, is a monstrous and mischievous perversion.<a name=261:29></a> When the apostle says "them within" and "them that are without," to say that he only means within or without a particular body ("do ye not judge them that are within?<a name=261:30></a> them that are without God judgeth"); it is clearly "within," or "without," <i>on earth</i>; and it is clearly not within or without a particular assembly; the difference is between Christians and men of the world.<a name=261:31></a> Within and without, that is, applies to <i>the whole</i> assembly of Christ on earth; they were the fornicators of this world, or one called a brother.<a name=261:32></a> In Corinth, to be of the assembly they must be of the local assembly, unless in schism; but if called "a brother," they were of the assembly, not because they had joined that particular body, but because they were Christians not excluded by just discipline.<a name=261:33></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to chapter 12, which will make the matter as clear as possible; and, while it shews that a local assembly, viewed in association with all Christians everywhere on earth, practically represents and acts for all saints with the Lord's authority if gathered in His name, yet it shews that the apostle has in mind THE assembly, not <i>an</i> assembly.<a name=262:1></a> "But all these worketh one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will; for as the body is one, and there are many members, and all the members of that body being many are one body, so also is Christ.<a name=262:2></a> For by one Spirit we have all been baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free, and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.<a name=262:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The tract tells us, "Every member of Christ's 'one body' forms a constituent part of a great church or assembly, of which the Head is in heaven (page 21) .<a name=262:4></a>.<a name=262:5></a>.<a name=262:6></a> .<a name=262:7></a> The universal church of Christ may therefore be correctly viewed as <i>one</i> in reference to Him, its supreme Head in heaven, but it is not one community on earth" (page 21).<a name=262:8></a> Again, "Its true spiritual unity has reference to its future existence and appearance in glory" (page 21).<a name=262:9></a> In another place we are told "it applies to the mystical body of Christ -- the church universal; but that it applies also to a particular assembly of believers" (page 17).<a name=262:10></a> Now, I affirm that the passage can apply to neither (save so far as the church universal itself is seen on the earth), and solely to this last.<a name=262:11></a> The subject of the chapter is spiritual gifts, and the figure of the body is not used in view of mere personal union with Christ (important, yea, yet more important, as that doctrine surely is), but of the Holy Ghost come down from heaven.<a name=262:12></a> The church universal is not viewed as in heaven in its Head, but as on earth in its members; they have all been baptized with that one Spirit to make one body: the members are the gifts.<a name=262:13></a>

		All are members and the Holy Ghost distributes as He will.<a name=263:1></a> Where are these gifts exercised, and to what do they belong?<a name=263:2></a> They are exercised on earth, that is a clear case; there is no evangelizing nor healing of the sick in heaven.<a name=263:3></a> But they do not belong to a particular assembly, but to <i>the</i> assembly; and God hath set some in the assembly: first, apostles; secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers; after that miracles, then gifts of healing, etc.<a name=263:4></a> Now nothing can be plainer or more positive than this.<a name=263:5></a> These gifts are exercised on earth; they are set in the assembly; they were not even all exercised in an assembly as apostles might be preaching to the world.<a name=263:6></a> Miracles might be wrought in the world, or healing take place; but they were members of the body who wrought; they were set in the assembly.<a name=263:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter shews in the distinctest manner possible that, while scripture clearly owns local assemblies whose responsibilities and acts we have already considered, the action of the Holy Ghost is viewed as forming and acting in one assembly on the earth, and is viewed <i>only</i> as on earth -- to the exclusion of what it will be in heaven, as is evident from the exercise of the gifts, and their nature.<a name=263:8></a> The whole scriptural view of the Holy Ghost's operation is denied by the teaching of the tract, as indeed the true nature of a local assembly is also.<a name=263:9></a> If Apollos taught at Ephesus, he taught when he went to Corinth.<a name=263:10></a> He was a Christian, and thereby necessarily belonged to the assembly of Christians at Corinth, because it was the assembly of the Christians who were there.<a name=263:11></a> This does not hinder discipline, but makes the discipline valid as to the whole assembly of God.<a name=263:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I turn to the Ephesians, more especially consecrated to the instruction of Christians on the highest privileges of individual saints, or of the church, I find the same truth.<a name=263:13></a> "Ye are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit"; that is, Jews and Gentiles were reconciled in one body to God by the cross.<a name=263:14></a> It was growing to its full result, but there was on earth a habitation of God through the Holy Ghost.<a name=263:15></a> Here unity is a great point -- one body, one Spirit, one hope.<a name=263:16></a> But where is this?<a name=263:17></a> On earth.<a name=263:18></a> Gifts are given to every one according to the measure of the gift of Christ.<a name=263:19></a> When ascended Christ gave gifts to men -- apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, <i>till we</i> all come, etc.<a name=263:20></a>

		Thus, again, the future heavenly state is excluded.<a name=264:1></a> Yet we are to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, for there is one Spirit and one body.<a name=264:2></a> The Head being ascended, He has given gifts -- not in a church; apostles and evangelists exercised their ministry, the first partly, the latter exclusively, in the world, and the apostles as such clearly belonged to no particular assembly.<a name=264:3></a> The idea of <i>the members of an assembly is wholly unknown to scripture</i>.<a name=264:4></a> It is used as a figure, and in reference to the human body.<a name=264:5></a> We are likened to a body, but that body is the body of Christ; an assembly is not His body, though it may locally represent it.<a name=264:6></a> I read, "The assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=264:7></a>"<a href="#264:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		Now that predicted confusion has come in I certainly am the last to deny; a confusion which makes one feel doubly the comfort of the promise, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.<a name=264:8></a>" But this becomes a mere self-regulated voluntary association whenever the unity of the body on earth is not owned.<a name=264:9></a> They cannot take the scriptures for their guide, they have begun by denying them in the point which established their own position.<a name=264:10></a> We are God's husbandry, God's building.<a name=264:11></a> Alas!<a name=264:12></a> wood and hay and stubble have been built upon the foundation, and perverse men have crept in, and wolves have come, ordinances and legalism have perverted Christendom; but that does not alter God's truth.<a name=264:13></a> God has foreseen all, and provided the path of obedience in the word, and grace for it.<a name=264:14></a> And when we deny a scriptural truth, we may be sincere Christians, and do so from prejudice and ignorance; but we deprive ourselves of the blessing and character of sanctification attached to that truth.<a name=264:15></a> So where the unity of the assembly on earth is denied, the blessings attached to it are lost, as far as our personal profit goes, and these benefits are nothing less than the action of the Holy Ghost on earth, uniting us as members to Christ and acting as He sees right in the members down here.<a name=264:16></a> To deny the defilement of the assembly by the allowance of sin, and the unity of the body on earth by the presence of the Holy Ghost, is to destroy all the responsibility of the one, and all the blessing of the other, and in these points to make void the word of God.<a name=264:17></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#264:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Compare too 1 Timothy 3: 15. It is monstrous to say, that a particularly voluntary assembly, which "Christian disciples have thought it advantageous" to form, is the pillar and ground of the truth, though a local assembly of Christians ought to represent the church in this also, a truth which comes strikingly out in this passage; while, along with 1 Corinthians 12, it shews that the apostle, in speaking of a particular assembly, never loses sight of the one assembly, and always views it as representing that. See another remarkable instance of that in Acts 20: 22.

		Dear Mr.<a name=266:1></a> -- -- <p>Baptism is not communication of life.<a name=266:2></a> Resurrection may (though all critics do not) be attributed to it, according to Colossians 2; it depends on the construction of <i>en o</i>, and it is in a certain aspect more than life, because it is being transported from alienation from God, into the place of blessing which He has constituted on earth; it is figuratively washing away sins.<a name=266:3></a>

		I suppose the chapters alluded to are John 3 and 6.<a name=267:1></a> Now the latter chapter proves conclusively that it does not refer to the Lord's supper, for it affirms that every one is surely and finally saved who so eats of Christ.<a name=267:2></a> Christ Himself is the bread of life, and he that eats of it lives for ever (verse 51).<a name=267:3></a> The sacrament is nothing more; but more particularly, He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day -- that is, he has present and final salvation.<a name=267:4></a> We have, too, <i>ephagon</i> as well as <i>trogo</i>-original faith as well as present exercise of it.<a name=267:5></a> In chapter 3 we have only entering into the kingdom, nothing even attributed to water, whatever it means; and then life distinctively attributed to the Spirit, only as communicating a nature, is spirit -- is water would be simple nonsense.<a name=267:6></a> I have no doubt that it is the word as in Ephesians 5 and John 15, and the necessary sense of chapter 6 confirms it; but in any case it has nothing to do with the communication of life, and verse 6 shews it; and a reference to Ezekiel 36, to which it so very plainly alludes, leaves no doubt, I think, of its force; hence verse 10, and the expression, earthly things, in verse 12.<a name=267:7></a>

		I may refer to another chapter, perhaps, as none is mentioned: communion of the blood and body of Christ in 1 Corinthians 10; but as it is the same word as partakers and fellowship in what follows, as in verse 18 (not 17), there is no kind of difficulty or uncertainty.<a name=267:8></a> It is moral identification with what is set forth there; see verse 20.<a name=267:9></a>

		It is a sorrowful thing to see the Protestantism of the country frittered away, and by those who should maintain it; and the only use made of the authority which is in the hands of such as should be its natural leaders (perhaps I should say the influence, for authority they seem to have none) that of damping the energy of what life there is, and suppressing that which the love of the truth would arouse in some.<a name=270:13></a> Popish doings they tolerate and screen, Protestant truth -- and I mean by this the truth drawn from scripture by what is called Protestantism, what gives it an evangelical character -- this they discountenance and suppress.<a name=270:14></a> Positive truth of their own they have none.<a name=270:15></a> That gives energy and would tell itself out.<a name=270:16></a> Error is become impudent and boisterous and even threatening.<a name=270:17></a> The only object of ecclesiastical leaders is to keep things together, and hence the energy of truth must be suppressed if possible.<a name=270:18></a>

		But Dr.<a name=272:7></a> O'Brien produces at the very utmost two passages of scripture.<a name=272:8></a> One affords him no proof whatever unless upon the authority of the "ancients" -- an interpretation of the Fathers, who, if any ever did, darken counsel by words without knowledge, of whom the great body previous to Nice were unsound on the deity of Christ, let men plead what they will; not one of whom believe really<a href="#272:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> in justification by faith; who exalted ceremonies at the expense of truth, and sanctioned immorality and superstition to win over the Pagans, putting <i>deliberately</i> the saints instead of the gods and demigods; and cultivated an asceticism which, in affectation of purity, pursued practices which called from shame at last repeated reprehension.<a name=272:9></a> Dr.<a name=272:10></a> O'Brien avowedly in the book rests his argument on these authorities.<a name=272:11></a> "From the Bible alone," is on the title-page alone.<a name=272:12></a>

		Further, all his argument outside scripture is based on using a word as equivalent to another, or to a phrase which means a totally different thing, and where the whole force of his argument depends on their meaning the same; or again, on the grossest begging of the question on the very point in hand by the use of unscriptural words.<a name=273:1></a> As to any positive truth, you must not expect it.<a name=273:2></a> A teacher with authority must not commit himself to truth.<a name=273:3></a>

		Dr.<a name=273:4></a> O'Brien assumes a multitude of principles which may embarrass others who accept tradition, but which I should formally deny.<a name=273:5></a> He copies the style of Butler, which calculates the possibilities of facts and the probabilities of truth from evidence, and investigates with much power of analysis, how far a proof goes, and what may be, though some apparent denial of what is alleged to be truth may exist; but there is no positive truth.<a name=273:6></a> To see how far this may lead I will only say that Butler says there must be what scripture calls sin (Butler 'propensions') in heaven, or that there could not be happiness; on the Aristotelian principle that for happiness there must be habits of virtue, for virtue conflict, consequently propensions to overcome.<a name=273:7></a> Such is theology.<a name=273:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The argument of the writer is this: all the ancients say that the passage implies baptism; therefore we must conclude that we have the Lord's own authority for assuming that it is in baptism that the new birth takes place!<a name=275:17></a> How what the ancients say gives the Lord's own authority is hard to tell -- the ancients who have not one word of solid truth, and are full of error and folly, who corrupted the church by Platonism, as every one who has reach church history knows, even to the obliterating the divinity of Christ.<a name=275:18></a>

		We forget that the apostle assures us that in his time all sought their own, that after his decease perverse men would arise; another, that there were many antichrists; another, that those had arisen who were to be judged at the coming of the Lord; another, that the time was come for judgment to begin at the house of God.<a name=275:19></a> The Christian is warned by one to abide in what he had heard <i>from the beginning</i>; by another, that one must know from whom one had learned anything, and that the scriptures were the security of the saint in the perilous times.<a name=275:20></a> Another was obliged to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints; another warns, there should be false teachers and many follow their pernicious ways; and again, Paul, that there were many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, men who subvert whole houses, that the time would come when they would not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts heap to themselves teachers.<a name=275:21></a> What security does this afford me?<a name=275:22></a> The word of God does.<a name=275:23></a> I know of whom I have learned in learning of Paul, and John, and Peter, and that all scripture is given by the inspiration of God.<a name=275:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence too, when the Lord speaks of what livingly subsists as born, He says only "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit," and speaks no longer of water.<a name=276:10></a> Water cleanses what is, life begins when one is born.<a name=276:11></a> And if we give heed to the Lord's words, who tells Nicodemus that as a master in Israel he should have known these things, we cannot doubt that the Lord alludes especially to Ezekiel 36: 24-27: "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you.<a name=276:12></a> A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you," etc.<a name=276:13></a> That is to say, there is a moral practical cleansing, typified by the word 'water,' <i>and</i> a new life given by the operation of the Spirit of God.<a name=276:14></a> No one could say that which is born of water is water; it has no sense.<a name=276:15></a> That which is born of the Spirit is spirit; it is the communication of life, like in its nature to its source; but that we are born of the Spirit by the means of the water, there is not the slightest hint of.<a name=276:16></a> And even "our church" has sense enough to see this when it has its eyes open: "Sanctify this water to the mystical washing away of sin.<a name=276:17></a>" Hence the scripture speaks of baptism as being for death, not life; as in Romans 6, Colossians 2, where at the utmost you make speak of resurrection being involved in it, after the death, unto the likeness of which we have been planted, through the faith of the operation of God who raised Him from the dead.<a name=276:18></a> Hence, if we take baptism as a figure, it is as, to the water, a figure of death -- Christ's death; being born of the Spirit, a communication of new life.<a name=276:19></a>

		But I have another question to ask Dr.<a name=278:4></a> O'Brien.<a name=278:5></a> He tells us (page 25) that baptism is administered to the penitent and believing adult.<a name=278:6></a> Now we read in scripture that we are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=278:7></a> One who has repented and believed is most certainly born of God.<a name=278:8></a> I am aware that it is prayed that they may be born again, but this only shews the gross confusion which arises from this false doctrine.<a name=278:9></a> Were it only that adults or children were formally admitted by Christ's institution into the place where all God's ordered privileges and blessings were, I should have nothing to say.<a name=278:10></a> If the word 'regeneration' were employed in its scriptural sense (though modern use would make it dangerously equivocal) one might have nothing to say; but in a statement quite unscriptural, asking they may receive the Holy Ghost that they may be born again (which is never true, for it was after being baptized for the remission of sins they were to receive it, Acts 2), and with this additional error, it is asked that they may be thus born again after having repented, and believed.<a name=278:11></a> And to confirm and increase the error, it is taught in the Catechism that they are not only made children of God (ascribed to faith in Galatians) but members of Christ and inheritors of the kingdom -- another blunder, for we are in it.<a name=278:12></a> By one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, and in every case in scripture the Spirit was given apart from baptism: the apostles, those Peter spoke to, the Samaritans, Cornelius, and the twelve men in Acts 19.<a name=278:13></a>

		Further, the writer rests all his argument on infant baptism being a divine institution.<a name=279:1></a> He admits that it would have no force if it were not (page 25), and this last <i>solely</i> on the fact that Jewish habits of thought would so require.<a name=279:2></a> He leaves out the passages Paedobaptists use, such as Matthew 28, 1 Corinthians 7: 14, relegates into more than doubt historical testimony, denies the validity of other passages they claim as proofs, and rests all on no one scripture, but the contrary (page 11).<a name=279:3></a> He rests all on his own conclusion that with a Jew it must have been forbidden not to be practised.<a name=279:4></a> This, which has been often alleged to confirm the Paedobaptist view, stands alone with Dr.<a name=279:5></a> O'Brien.<a name=279:6></a> Scripture he has none, save to deny its application and from "this foundation being now," he says, "as I hope, securely laid," he goes on to prove we are born again in it.<a name=279:7></a> And this is a plea from the Bible alone!<a name=279:8></a> It is impossible to conceive anything weaker.<a name=279:9></a> Many things are assumed, but I do not dwell on them, such as the Christian covenant, the new covenant being made with us, all which is unscriptural (though we get the spiritual blessings of it); yet really all his argument is founded on this traditional error.<a name=279:10></a> But if Christianity were the new covenant, which it is not, the Holy Ghost is the seal of faith now as circumcision was then.<a name=279:11></a> Matthew 28 was never carried out.<a name=279:12></a> The mission to the Gentiles was given up to Paul explicitly (Galatians 2) who was not sent to baptize, and the mission in Matthew was from resurrection, not ascension, and did not apply to Jews but to Gentiles only -- was not to every creature as Dr.<a name=279:13></a> O'Brien says, but only to Gentiles.<a name=279:14></a> But all this would lead me too far.<a name=279:15></a>

		I would but add, as regards forgiveness in baptism, this much: the Homilies of the Anglican body declare that that only is a sacrament in which the forgiveness of sins is annexed and tied to the visible sign; the full-grown Puseyite, that the forgiveness of sins after baptism (when there are none to forgive) is next to impossible -- may be had by severe penance perhaps; the moderate Puseyite or full Anglican, that they receive it on taking the sacrament, and remain between each occasion unforgiven.<a name=281:6></a> What absolution may do, I do not say!<a name=281:7></a> This is Judaism, in contrast with Hebrews 9 and 10 where the subject is fully treated.<a name=281:8></a>

		REMARKS ON A BOOK ENTITLED, "IS MODERN CHRISTIANITY A CIVILISED HEATHENISM?"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I recognize that this writing is calculated to produce serious thoughts; but it is as marking coming judgment.<a name=292:1></a> As a judgment of the state of things, the writer is sadly right; but he has not got a step beyond the conventionalities of the church of England.<a name=292:2></a> The testimony of Christianity is in its effects; but of Christianity itself he is <i>wholly</i> ignorant.<a name=292:3></a> His highest idea is asceticism, and fine Gothic buildings, when he comes to the positive side.<a name=292:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if I take the precepts of Christianity, he lives not in them, but in his own natural thoughts.<a name=292:5></a> It is just as much a precept of Christianity -- "when thou prayest, enter into thy closet and shut to thy door," and that on the deepest moral ground, as to be separate from the world, not in a chancel with the door open.<a name=292:6></a> "The Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands.<a name=292:7></a>" "They that worship God must worship in spirit and in truth.<a name=292:8></a>" It is equally a precept, "when thou fastest, be not of a sad countenance, anoint thy head and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast.<a name=292:9></a>" All this inward part of Christianity is gone; nay, the opposite is required to win the world to believe.<a name=292:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is more.<a name=292:11></a> We cannot too fully recognize that the friendship of the world is enmity against God; and he that will be the friend of the world is the enemy of God.<a name=292:12></a> We are crucified to the world and the world to us.<a name=292:13></a> But Christianity and consequently conscience and heart are both wanting.<a name=292:14></a> It is, humanly speaking, a just satire (though it is, say they, "an ill bird that fouls its own nest"); let us hope the end shews some conscience.<a name=292:15></a> But Christianity is not a satire; it is grace.<a name=292:16></a> See the difference: "For many walk of whom I told you before, and now tell you, <i>even weeping</i>, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, who glory in their shame, who mind earthly things.<a name=292:17></a> But our conversation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour.<a name=292:18></a>"

		The man, to use the strong Irish expression, is "to make his soul" by asceticism and praying in agony in a cathedral where anybody that likes may see him.<a name=293:1></a> No trace of love in God, no need of another and divinely given life in Christ -- no trace of either is found in the book.<a name=293:2></a> This is so true, that it is not merely that the world hated Christ (which is most true, because He testified of it that the works thereof were evil -- light came in so that all without exception were condemned); but he makes Christ hate the world!<a name=293:3></a> I read, "I beseech you therefore by the mercies of God, that ye yield your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service; and be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.<a name=293:4></a>" In this book the mercies of God are <i>wholly unknown</i>; nonconformity to the world is insisted on by the heathen mind and natural conscience; transformed by the renewing of your mind is wholly ignored.<a name=293:5></a> Now nonconformity to the world, without the other too, is the pharisaism he says the Saviour came to judge.<a name=293:6></a> The picture of highest good is being scorned by the world, like Christ.<a name=293:7></a> Good in God, or in Christ, never crosses his mind.<a name=293:8></a> It is imitation: I know what it is.<a name=293:9></a> Earnest men may try it, when they have no knowledge of God or redemption, and be driven, under grace, to know they need a Saviour.<a name=293:10></a> He has no idea but of one lying stretched at the foot of the cross, loving Him with a love all the world can see.<a name=293:11></a> God in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, then making Him to be sin for us, he knows not at all.<a name=293:12></a> "He took upon Him human flesh that we might know for certain how human creatures ought to live, who died on the cross to win for us the power to imitate His brave contempt," etc.<a name=293:13></a>

		But further his statement as to heathenism is false.<a name=293:14></a> See Romans 1, where the apostle only touches on the mountain tops of the evil, hiding justly in the dark shade what grew in baleful luxuriance beneath.<a name=293:15></a> He denies positively in terms the apostle's statement in Romans 1: 19, 20; and his argument as to a final cause is wholly illogical.<a name=293:16></a> We cannot help believing causation; that is, when we see an existing thing expressing a thought, we believe there must be one who has caused it.<a name=293:17></a> Consequently we cannot know God, because He exists without a cause.<a name=293:18></a> We know that He <i>must be</i>; but what makes us do so shews we cannot know Himself.<a name=293:19></a>

		The writer has with rude hand torn the veil from his own sphere of life, but has substituted nothing which supposes good in God, and labours through fear of hell to make peace, if he can at last, with a righteous Judge, glad to win heaven by suffering and despising the world like Christ.<a name=294:19></a> Mind and natural conscience have judged, as an infidel can, of inconsistency with profession, in conformity to a world which is enmity against God; but there is a total ignorance of God revealed in Christ, of redemption and Christianity.<a name=294:20></a> This is for him a "distinct revelation of God's will," but no revelation of God.<a name=294:21></a>

		First, allow me to say that the assemblies of so-called "Plymouth Brethren," far from calling themselves the "assembly" or "the church of God" in a particular place, have always formally opposed the title.<a name=296:23></a> So little truth is there in the insinuation, that it is principally this which has hindered these brethren from forming part of the Rochat flock.<a name=296:24></a> They believe that they alone are assembled upon the true principle of the church of God, which I in no wise doubt: but they believe that the church is in ruins, and that the pretension to be the church of God in a place would be a false pretension.<a name=296:25></a> J add that, if all the Christians in a place were to be found gathered together which would form (according to order) the assembly of the place, I would not give it that title, because the universal church is not gathered; and I do not believe in independent churches.<a name=296:26></a> I believe that there were formerly local churches representing in a certain sense the whole in their localities; but we are very far from that now.<a name=296:27></a> All who have taken the trouble to inquire know, or might have known, that from the first the brethren in question have taken their stand upon the principle of Matthew 18 as a resource given of God in the general ruin.<a name=296:28></a> The pretension to be the assembly of God has always been rejected by the brethren we speak of.<a name=296:29></a> Every assembly gathered by the will of God around the Person of Jesus or in His name is <i>an</i> assembly of God, if it be only a question of the force of words; but when it is a question of being <i>the</i> assembly of God in a locality, it is not so in the true sense of the word, and could not be so, considering the state of the universal church.<a name=296:30></a> It may gather together on the principle of the church of God, may find the promised blessing, may be the only one gathered according to that principle in the place, and may attach immense importance to it (and it ought to attach immense importance to it, if it desire to be obedient and faithful); but it is only the witness for God so far as by its separate walk it testifies to the faithfulness of God, to the divine principles which govern its walk and to the true state in which the church is found as a whole.<a name=296:31></a> In this case it will be God's witness; certainly it ought to be so.<a name=296:32></a>

		1 Corinthians 12 makes the doctrine of the word of God perfectly clear with regard to this.<a name=298:1></a> The body of Christ on earth is composed of individuals and not of churches.<a name=298:2></a> Now if this be the case, there is unity only in the whole; there is none in any local assembly if it be detached from the whole as a whole.<a name=298:3></a> If it be regarded as an independent church, it has nothing to do with the body, it is not in principle an assembly of God.<a name=298:4></a> At the beginning of the first Epistle to the Corinthians it is said, "to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Jesus Christ, saints by calling, with all those who in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.<a name=298:5></a>" Thus the apostle could say, "Ye are the body of Christ.<a name=298:6></a>" The assembly at Corinth represented at Corinth that one and only unity, that of all individuals united to Christ in one body by the baptism of the Holy Ghost.<a name=298:7></a> Everything had a connection with the one body, composed of all the members of Christ.<a name=298:8></a> There was no action which did not relate to the whole body, no suffering of one member which was not felt by all the members of the body: 1 Corinthians 12 leaves no doubt upon this point.<a name=298:9></a> The gifts were exercised in this whole (1 Corinthians 12: 27, 28).<a name=298:10></a> Their object was first the perfecting of individuals, then the edification of the body of Christ; Ephesians 4: 12.<a name=298:11></a>

		Irenaeus was a Christian worthy of respect, though not sound in the faith after all, but our question with him is as an historian.<a name=311:9></a> Now the first point to be remarked is, that he had a controversial object in his facts, which alters the force even of his testimony: but we shall besides find that he states on the subject what certainly is not the fact.<a name=311:10></a> I do not doubt he believed it.<a name=311:11></a> He was tormented, as was the whole church, with Gnosticism, which denied that the true God of the Christians was the Creator, and he appeals to the universal faith of the churches everywhere, and specially of Rome, to prove that such a notion was never held amongst Christians.<a name=311:12></a> And he traces back the list of prelates, particularly at Rome, to prove this, that it was handed down by these worthy men from the beginning.<a name=311:13></a> He appeals to the scriptures, but, the heretics cavilling and appealing to tradition too, finding himself baffled by their cavils (instead of doing as the Lord did when Satan quoted scripture to Him, answering by another plain scripture), he turns to the common faith of the churches, and what the most esteemed leaders of the church had held, and hence gives their succession; but I am sorry to say, he himself was, what Rome and all orthodox persons would call, a heretic.<a name=311:14></a> But his appeal is really to meet the use of it by the Gnostics who pleaded, as Rome does now, that there were doctrines known by tradition, not contained in scripture.<a name=311:15></a><a href="#311:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> He answers, None of these successors of the apostles had such as you allege.<a name=311:16></a> What I have just said as to his testimony to tradition is clearly stated, lib.<a name=311:17></a> 3, c.<a name=311:18></a> 2, 3.<a name=311:19></a><a href="#311:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> We have only a very bad translation of most of Irenaeus' works.<a name=311:20></a>

		The result is, first, that scripture refutes episcopacy and established another kind of official authority, which this sets aside, just as much as if a republic was changed into a monarchy: the monarch is not added, the state has ceased to be a republic.<a name=316:11></a> I do not say the church was a republic or that authority came from the people -- I do not think so; what I say is, that the addition changed the government which was scriptural.<a name=316:12></a> Episcopalians and Puseyites do claim for the church the title to change its government.<a name=316:13></a> I do not agree, but I do not discuss it; I only say that the episcopal government is not the scriptural one, but sets it aside.<a name=316:14></a> Further, ecclesiastical history confirms the fact and does not recognize episcopal government; and we have the most learned Fathers of the church declaring presbyter and bishop were the same at the outset, and that church-custom only had made the honour valid.<a name=316:15></a> I conclude with Jerome that episcopacy does not come from <i>veritate dominicae dispositionis</i>.<a name=316:16></a>

		CHURCHES AND THE CHURCH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You ask me, Were there not churches in scripture?<a name=318:1></a> I answer, there were; but what are churches?<a name=318:2></a> The effect of the question is to bring out the state of the mind.<a name=318:3></a> Most Christians would immediately think of what are called churches in the religious world, perhaps in Christendom at large.<a name=318:4></a> They would think of the Presbyterian church, or Congregational and Baptist churches, or else of the church of Rome, or the like.<a name=318:5></a> The person who lived habitually in the mind of scripture would think of Corinth or others which we meet with in scripture.<a name=318:6></a> Are then the facts which exist in Christendom, or the thoughts there current, different from the facts found in scripture, or the thoughts formed by it?<a name=318:7></a> Let us inquire into this, not with a haughty heart, but if we find all gone far away from the scriptural state in principle and practice -- if we find all ruined, instead of power in the Holy Ghost and unity -- a fair show in the flesh, let us mourn in heart, and cry to the Lord.<a name=318:8></a> He will meet us in our need.<a name=318:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What were churches in scriptural times?<a name=318:10></a> "Church" means simply an assembly, or, from local use in Greek, an assembly of privileged persons, of citizens.<a name=318:11></a> The whole multitude of believers gathered into one by the Holy Ghost formed the assembly or church.<a name=318:12></a> Only here of course it was God's assembly; of course those in Rome or Corinth could not meet in Jerusalem.<a name=318:13></a> Hence there were assemblies in different places, forming each locally God's assembly in the place.<a name=318:14></a> It may be well very briefly to examine how the assembly is viewed in scripture as a whole, before we speak of local assemblies.<a name=318:15></a> It is viewed as the habitation of God; and also as the body of Christ, and first of the former.<a name=318:16></a> In one sense the church is not yet formed, not complete.<a name=318:17></a> All that shall be united to Christ in glory form part of it.<a name=318:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"I will build my church," says Jesus, "and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<a name=318:19></a>" This will be infallibly accomplished.<a name=318:20></a> So Peter, evidently alluding to this, "unto whom coming, as unto a living stone, ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house''; so Ephesians 2, "in whom the whole building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.<a name=318:21></a>" This is yet unfinished, and still goes on; and, though at first a public and evident body (the Lord adding daily to the church such as should be saved), it is become what is called the invisible church.<a name=318:22></a> It is invisible: though if it was to be the light of the world, it is hard to tell the value of an invisible light.<a name=318:23></a> If it is acknowledged to have fallen for ages into corruption and iniquity, a very Babylon in character, that has not been the light of the world.<a name=318:24></a> The persecuted saints -- for God has surely had a people -- gave their testimony; but the public body in the world was darkness, not light in it.<a name=318:25></a>

		But there is another way in which God's assembly is spoken of, and still first as the house, a habitation of God, that is, as established by the instrumentality of man, and under the responsibility of man.<a name=319:1></a> "As a wise master-builder," says Paul, "I have laid the foundation, but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereon.<a name=319:2></a>" There is human instrumentality and human responsibility.<a name=319:3></a> It was a large body formed on earth which was God's house or temple, the Holy Ghost dwelling in it down here as descended on the day of Pentecost (1 Corinthians 3), not the body: there can be no wood and hay and stubble, which is to be burned, in that.<a name=319:4></a> Again, "Ye are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit," Ephesians 2: 22.<a name=319:5></a>

		This is a very interesting and precious truth, I mean God's dwelling down here in His house prepared for Him according to His will.<a name=319:6></a> God never dwelt with Adam innocent, though He visited him, nor with Abraham though He visited and singularly blessed him; but the moment Israel was redeemed out of Egypt, God came and dwelt among them.<a name=319:7></a> The dwelling of God with men is the fruit of redemption.<a name=319:8></a> (See Exodus 29: 46.<a name=319:9></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The true redemption has been accomplished, and God has formed a habitation for Himself where He dwells by the Spirit.<a name=319:10></a> It is so indeed as to the individual (1 Corinthians 6); but I now speak of the assembly, the house of the living God.<a name=319:11></a> This is now on the earth, the habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=319:12></a> He dwells and walks among us.<a name=319:13></a> We are God's building.<a name=319:14></a> Man may have built in wood and hay and stubble; but God has not yet executed judgment to remove the house out of His sight, though judgment will begin there.<a name=319:15></a>

		The assembly is also the body of Christ; Ephesians 1: 23.<a name=319:16></a> It is by one Spirit we are baptized into one body.<a name=319:17></a> This though the final completeness of it will be in heaven, yet is established on earth, for the baptism of the Holy Ghost was His coming down -- the day of Pentecost (Acts 1: 5; 1 Corinthians 12: 13).<a name=319:18></a> That this is on earth is further clear, for in the same chapter we find He has set in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, where we have miracles, gifts of healing, clearly on earth.<a name=319:19></a> Where, remark also, that they are set in the whole church, members of such or such a kind in the one whole body.<a name=319:20></a> Such is the church or assembly as depicted in scripture.<a name=319:21></a>

		What were churches or assemblies?<a name=320:1></a> These were local.<a name=320:2></a> The apostle could say, "To the church of God which is at Corinth.<a name=320:3></a>" It represented the whole unity of the body in that place.<a name=320:4></a> "Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<a name=320:5></a>" Two bodies of Christ, even in one place, representatively there could not be.<a name=320:6></a> In Galatia, which was a large province, we read the churches of Galatia.<a name=320:7></a> So in Thessalonica, a city of Macedonia, we have the assembly of the Thessalonians.<a name=320:8></a> So in the seven churches; so John writes to the assembly.<a name=320:9></a> So everywhere there was God's assembly in any given place which could be distinctly addressed as such.<a name=320:10></a> In Acts 20 he calls for the elders of the assembly.<a name=320:11></a> There were several appointed by the Holy Ghost to be overseers of God's flock.<a name=320:12></a> Hence Titus was left in Crete to ordain them in every city.<a name=320:13></a> We have (Acts 11: 22) the assembly which was in Jerusalem, though it was exceedingly numerous; in Acts 13 the assembly that was at Antioch.<a name=320:14></a> So Paul (Acts 14: 21-23) returns to Lystra, Derbe, and Iconium, and chooses for them elders in every assembly.<a name=320:15></a> All scripture clearly shews there was one assembly in a place, which was God's assembly.<a name=320:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Churches as buildings they had none: the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; and hence they met in houses where they could; but all formed one assembly, God's assembly, in that place, the elders being elders in the whole as one body.<a name=320:17></a> The local assembly represented the whole assembly of God, as 1 Corinthians shews us plainly.<a name=320:18></a> The position which Christians who composed it held was that of members of Christ, of the whole body of Christ.<a name=320:19></a> The only membership known in scripture is membership of Christ's body; as an eye, a hand, etc.<a name=320:20></a>; ministry was directly connected with this last thought.<a name=320:21></a> When Christ ascended up on high, He gave gifts to men, apostles, prophets: they were the foundation (Ephesians 2); evangelists, pastors, teachers: these were set in the whole church or assembly; 1 Corinthians 12.<a name=320:22></a>

		But my main object now is to shew that it was as gifts in the whole assembly of God everywhere that they who possessed them acted.<a name=321:1></a> Elders were local and were not a gift, though aptness to teach was a desirable qualification.<a name=321:2></a> Still all had it not; 1 Timothy 5: 17.<a name=321:3></a> Elders were elders in a given city of God's assembly there.<a name=321:4></a> Gifts were exercised as set in the whole body, wherever the gifted member was, according to scriptural rules.<a name=321:5></a> The result of the examination of scripture is, that there was one assembly of God in each town where there were Christians; that these were members of the body of Christ -- the only membership known in scripture; and gifts were exercised in the whole church, or one assembly of God in the whole world, as members and servants of Christ, by the operation of the Spirit, according to rules given in scripture.<a name=321:6></a> Eldership was a local office to which persons were chosen and appointed by the apostle or his deputy; and they were elders in the one assembly of God in the place over which the Holy Ghost had made them overseers (Acts 14: 23; Titus; Acts 20: 17-28).<a name=321:7></a> It was not a gift, though one gift was desirable to make the office more effective; but the chief requisites were qualities which made them fit to be overseers.<a name=321:8></a>

		The exhortations in the Epistle to the Ephesians have a large scope and a higher aim than those of most of the epistles, though nothing can surpass the importance of details of godly practice in their place; that in walking according to them God may be glorified, the Spirit ungrieved and the heart free to receive and enjoy all His communications from the word.<a name=326:1></a> These exhortations are founded on, and refer to -- as indeed in every epistle -- the doctrine which forms the subject of the first part of the epistle.<a name=326:2></a> But there is an exceptional subject in this epistle: the unity which flows from the full revelation of God, the necessary centre of all; and more especially from the exaltation of Christ, in whom, according to the mystery, all things are to be headed up; and the presence of the Holy Ghost on earth uniting the saints to Christ, the Head of the body on high, and assembling men by His power to the confession of His name upon the earth.<a name=326:3></a>

		I have called this an exceptional subject, because it is not the first and proper doctrine of the epistle, but is introduced as an extraordinary revelation of an especial state and relationship into which the saints are brought.<a name=326:4></a> The primary relationships spoken of are individual ones with the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: we are chosen in Christ to be holy and without blame before God in love, and predestinated to the adoption of children.<a name=326:5></a> The exhortations founded on this doctrine begin with verse 17 of chapter 4, and are first and mainly referred to the name of God, passing into the relationship of children in the first verse of chapter 5.<a name=326:6></a> It is natural they should; because, while special affections are drawn out by the name of Father, the character of God Himself is that after which we are to be formed.<a name=326:7></a> Definite relationships are entered on in chapter 5: 22; and there again the relationship of the church with Christ is introduced.<a name=326:8></a>

		It is not to be passed over that, whatever the corporate blessings of the church (and they are very great and eminent) the individual relationship of the saint holds the first place, and that the action of the members of the body as such is for the perfecting of the saints individually.<a name=326:9></a> Indeed, seeing the place that God must have, and the unutterable obligation and relationship in which we stand to Him -- we may add, the very place Christ Himself has with God as man -- this could not be otherwise, whatever peculiar privileges the counsel of God gave to us in union with Christ.<a name=326:10></a>

		Thus, in the first chapter of Ephesians, we find saints presented in relationship to the names and nature of God as revealed in that He bears toward Christ, as denoting our proper calling, and what characterizes us as saints -- our relationship to that which is above us.<a name=327:1></a> And then, all things being centred up in and gathered into one under Christ, we become joint-heirs, so as to have the glorious place due to God's children towards that which is below us.<a name=327:2></a> It is only at the close of the chapter, where he speaks of the power exercised towards those that believe, that he introduces (after the exaltation of Christ Himself raised from the dead) the union of saints with Him, their identification with Him as objects of the operation of the same power by which He was raised and exalted.<a name=327:3></a> They are not merely morally and gloriously like Him; they are raised up together with Him, His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.<a name=327:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The general purpose of God had been stated in verse 10 of the chapter.<a name=327:5></a> This especial part of it, the union of the body with the head, and the unity of the body itself, and the forming of a dwelling-place of God on the earth by the Holy Ghost, with its various consequences and aspects, and the obligations that flow from this great fact, are unfolded from verse 22 of chapter 1 to the end of verse 16 of chapter 4.<a name=327:6></a> The whole of the second and third chapters, and the fourth down to the end of verse 16, may be considered as a kind of parenthesis, in which the doctrine of the church is richly developed with the exhortations which flow from it; not separated of course from the doctrine of the whole epistle, but forming a special body of teaching within it.<a name=327:7></a> We are not viewed as the fruit of Christ's redemption individually before God, but as the associates of Christ's position in union with Him.<a name=327:8></a> It is at the same time remarkable, how, through the vastness of the place and counsel of God, these truths are interwoven.<a name=327:9></a>

		It is the name, in reference to which we are individually children, which forms the groundwork of the prayer in this part of the epistle, which generally treats of the church; and it is the name of God with whom we are individually in relationship, because it is in grace, which lays the foundation for the union of the church with Christ, because of that <i>divine</i> power which has raised Christ, and us with Christ, from the dead, to form one new body in a heavenly condition before Him -- a condition in which no middle walls of partition could arise; for what barriers of ordinances to exclude shall be found in heaven?<a name=328:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The name of the Father, in which we are brought into nearness of communion and relationship, gives its character to the prayer of chapter 3 (compare John 17: 26).<a name=328:2></a> But under the name of Father of our Lord Jesus Christ every family in heaven and earth comes, and we are heirs of all.<a name=328:3></a> And the apostle seeks our blessing according to the riches of glory individually of Him who possesses all.<a name=328:4></a> In order to the present enjoyment of this, Christ, who fills all things, must dwell in our hearts by faith, through the strengthening of the Spirit in the inner man (compare -- as regards hope, which is the form in which it is enjoyed in Colossians; for they were not holding the Head firm -- Colossians 1: 27); and this is what the apostle seeks here.<a name=328:5></a> All things depend on the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and form the sphere of His glory.<a name=328:6></a> With the name Jehovah, Israel alone, of all the families of the earth, was in relationship.<a name=328:7></a> It alone was thus known by God; Amos 3: 2.<a name=328:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On this name every family in heaven and earth depends; but then, according to the whole wide extent of His glory, in which He has given us a place, and as Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, He strengthens us by His Spirit, so that Christ should dwell in our hearts by faith, and that as rooted and grounded in love.<a name=328:9></a> This is the power of realization, that we may comprehend the extent of glory in the sphere of creation on the one hand, and have the intimate knowledge of Christ's love in us, which passes knowledge, on the other; so as to be filled to all the fulness of God, whether in the display of His glory, or the blessedness of His nature.<a name=328:10></a> Now it is the exercise in us of power which surpasses all our thoughts, which produces the great result and binds all together for His glory in the church by Christ Jesus.<a name=328:11></a> It is power in us which fills us to all the fulness of God; but this power necessarily binds us together in a nearer and closer sphere -- the church of God; and hence, while setting us to look out to the whole sphere of His glory in Christ, and binding us in the intimity of knowledge to the love of Christ Himself, the Spirit brings us to God's glory in the church.<a name=328:12></a> Indeed, it could not be otherwise; because, Christ the Head of the body, fills all things; and the body, as associated with the Head, is placed in connection with the whole scene; and He dwells in us, so as to give the power of going out unto it all as His, under the Father; and to know His love, too, by His dwelling in us.<a name=328:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the previous part of the chapter, and the admission of the Gentiles as one of the families, leads to this prayer.<a name=329:1></a> Now the church has a double aspect and character, both of which are presented to us in this epistle.<a name=329:2></a> It is looked at also in two ways; as indeed is the case in every dealing of God with man and this lower creation, with this peculiar difference, that the church is the nearest and most immediate object of His thoughts nest to Christ, forms no part of the ages and dispensations of this world, and has no existence but by the full display of God, as He is the true light now shining, and of man to God, according to His glorious counsels in the Person of Christ in glory on high, and the consequent presence of God on the earth in the Person of the Holy Ghost dwelling in men, and in the habitation God has formed for Himself here below amongst men.<a name=329:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Notwithstanding this difference, however, the same great general principle is in play as to the church, as in the case of other dispensations of God; because, though not of the world, and the object of God's counsels before the world was, the church is displayed, and has her place and service in time in the world.<a name=329:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the double aspect of all the objects of God's dealings here below is the display of God's power and perfect wisdom in results, and the placing of the realization of it in man's hands under man's responsibility, before God's bringing it about by power according to His own mind.<a name=329:5></a> The very creation has been subjected to this principle: there will be a new heaven and new earth, where righteousness will dwell according to the thoughts and counsels of God; whereas that which now is groans under the bondage of corruption which sin has brought in.<a name=329:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not go farther than the earth, though my subject partly leads there, because the higher part of creation above is the proof of God's preserving care and grace; as we, of His restoring power by redemption and reconciliation.<a name=329:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as to this earth, everything trusted to man and for which he has been responsible will be accomplished finally according to the mind and purpose of God.<a name=330:1></a> Man himself failed in Adam, and will be perfect and glorified in the second Adam.<a name=330:2></a> Man was entrusted with the law: it will hereafter be written in his heart, and he will be made to walk in God's statutes.<a name=330:3></a> David's royalty failed; it will be perfected in Christ.<a name=330:4></a> Man, entrusted with sovereign power, failed in ruling over all: but Christ will reign over the whole earth in equity and truth, and glorify Jehovah.<a name=330:5></a> The very promises were presented in Christ, and man would have none of them.<a name=330:6></a> They will all be shewn to be Yea and Amen in Him.<a name=330:7></a> The church and the individual saint ought to glorify the Lord; they too have failed.<a name=330:8></a> But Christ will be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believed, and the church itself be fully glorified with Him.<a name=330:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So with the church.<a name=330:10></a> It will be presented perfect, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, as the bride of Christ by Him to Himself; as God did Eve to Adam.<a name=330:11></a> But it is set in the world as responsible to display by the Holy Ghost His character and glory now.<a name=330:12></a> There must be this difference, which I have already alluded to, that the church knows its own perfectness already in its Head, to whom it is already united by the Spirit; whereas Adam was the first man, and the Jew evidently never had Christ in the promised kingdom.<a name=330:13></a> It knows the perfect love of God, which has been revealed in all its fulness, and is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.<a name=330:14></a> It has the knowledge of its present union with Christ, and knows of the character of its <i>existing</i> relationship with Him, as His body and bride.<a name=330:15></a> Israel could not know, as a present thing, the reign of Christ in any sense.<a name=330:16></a> Love being perfectly revealed, the work of redemption accomplished, and our union with Christ a present truth, this difference must necessarily exist, though the great full result is yet to come, and we have the treasure in earthen vessels.<a name=330:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, having noticed this, I turn now to the distinctive characters in which the church is set before us in the Ephesians.<a name=330:18></a> No doubt responsibility attaches to us as to both; but the failure of man is displayed more particularly in one, as being the proper sphere of his responsibility; while, though he may fail as to the other, its proper nature is in itself unalterable.<a name=330:19></a> The two characters of the church of which I speak, are found in the close of chapter 1, and of chapter 2 of the epistle -- the body united to the Head on high by divine power; and the building on the earth, the habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=330:20></a> The body as united to the Head cannot fail, nor can any form part of it but true members of Christ.<a name=330:21></a> But it implies unity on earth amongst those who are there: and here there may be failure, that is, in maintaining the manifestation of unity on the earth as a witness.<a name=330:22></a> But the body itself cannot and never will fail.<a name=330:23></a> God has given Christ to be Head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fulness of Him who filleth all in all.<a name=330:24></a> That, of course, is necessarily made good.<a name=330:25></a> It would otherwise be as if something should fail of Christ's fulness.<a name=330:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=331>[Page 331]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the aspect of the church presented to us at the end of the second chapter is a different one.<a name=331:1></a> It is viewed as formed on earth.<a name=331:2></a> Jews and Gentiles are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=331:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now of course the thought of God, and the proper work according to God as far as He has wrought, is to put right stones in this building.<a name=331:4></a> The house is a real thing; but there is no such statement as in the end of chapter 1, where the essence of the truth was a glorious Head and living members of a living Head: God had given Christ to be Head over the body.<a name=331:5></a> Here the divine point was God in the Spirit dwelling in a house.<a name=331:6></a> He is Himself joined to nobody.<a name=331:7></a> It is a mere dwelling-place which is formed, and in which He is found.<a name=331:8></a> The fact is stated; the principle on which it is formed, namely, Jews and Gentiles both received and built on the apostles and prophets of Christianity, Jesus Christ Himself being the cornerstone; but who did it is not said, and, though naturally it is supposed to be real, the qualities of the stones are not in question; but the principles on which they are received, and the object -- the dwelling of God there -- not in Israel.<a name=331:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I see no reason to doubt, that at first the body and the house were the same, but not necessarily so.<a name=331:10></a> If, of the three thousand added in the day of Pentecost one had been the victim of his imagination, or a hypocrite, he clearly would not have been a member of Christ's body, save in a mere nominal way; but the Holy Ghost would have dwelt just as really in the house formed, as if all had been true saints.<a name=331:11></a> When Simon Magus was received, when false brethren came in unawares, they were no members of Christ; their baptism did not in any way constitute them such.<a name=331:12></a> It is not its office in any way.<a name=331:13></a> But the Holy Ghost did not cease to dwell in the house of which they formed a part.<a name=331:14></a> It is not, be it so, the theory of God.<a name=331:15></a> But we are on earth, and the result there is mixed up with the responsibility of man.<a name=331:16></a> No one can be a member of Christ unawares; because that is in its nature a living, real, divinely-wrought thing; whereas the formation of the assembly or house on the earth, in which the Holy Ghost dwells, is partly the work of man, though God may operate therein.<a name=331:17></a> The theory was living stones built upon the Living Stone, a spiritual house.<a name=331:18></a> The practice soon diverged from this; but the Holy Ghost did not for that reason forsake the house.<a name=331:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=332>[Page 332]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This fact, I suppose, can hardly be denied, that is, the presence of the Holy Ghost where false brethren and unconverted persons already formed part of the public assembly of Christians, where the Holy Ghost dwelt.<a name=332:1></a> This indeed was so truly the case, that in Hebrews 6 an unconverted person is supposed to have come under His influence, and to have been made a partaker of Him.<a name=332:2></a> So we find in 1 Corinthians 10, the apostle suggests that many who partook of baptism and the Lord's supper God might judge and reject.<a name=332:3></a> That which the house is responsible for, for which it is placed in the world, is to be the pillar and ground of the truth: that is, to maintain and hold it up in its public profession before the world.<a name=332:4></a> A true member of Christ may be in error, without ceasing to be a member of Christ; but the house, as such, is called to be the public professor of the truth.<a name=332:5></a> The church does not teach.<a name=332:6></a> The teacher does that.<a name=332:7></a> The church is taught.<a name=332:8></a> But it professes the truth.<a name=332:9></a> The providence of God will preserve this till the great apostasy in the main; but it is connected with the responsibility of man, so that all has to be judged.<a name=332:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another passage in which the house is spoken of (Hebrews 3), which I ought not to pass over: "Whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.<a name=332:11></a>" This speaks of the house as the ultimate result, "the end.<a name=332:12></a>" Of course, if any one abandoned this hope in Christ, he had no part in the matter.<a name=332:13></a> This was the danger of the Hebrews.<a name=332:14></a> I do not think, if the object of the epistle be understood, the passage offers much difficulty.<a name=332:15></a> In result the house at first, not necessarily absolutely but in fact, was composed of living members of Christ.<a name=332:16></a> In the end it will be, according to God's own purpose and heart, the tabernacle of God.<a name=332:17></a> Meanwhile, like every dealing of God, it has been left under the responsibility of man.<a name=332:18></a> The result, without its ceasing to be the house as to its place and responsibility, has been what it always has where the creature is in question.<a name=332:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think, in Ephesians 4 (and therefore, it was I dwelt on what preceded), we have in connection with this, three characters of unity to which the Spirit draws our attention.<a name=333:1></a> The exhortation of the special part to which I have alluded, in which the church is treated of (chapters 1: 22 to 4: 16), refers to the fact of the dwelling of the Holy Ghost in the church looked at as formed on earth, her activity and energy of gifts; the body is referred to chapter 4: 7-16, but in its individual members.<a name=333:2></a> Christ is viewed as the Giver; and gift and blessing is spoken of, not responsibility; nor is even the working consequently of the Spirit present on earth but of Christ the Head in heaven.<a name=333:3></a> The work is complete in power in the Person of Christ; and in virtue of that He confers gifts for the perfecting of the saints first of all, and to the edifying of the body.<a name=333:4></a> There is an effectual working in the measure of every part according to the measure of the gift of Christ.<a name=333:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is somewhat different in verses 1-6.<a name=333:6></a> There responsibility and duty are spoken of, an endeavour through grace, and that in connection with the Spirit of God, whose presence gives power to and characterizes our unity here below.<a name=333:7></a> The exhortation, as all exhortations must do, applies individually.<a name=333:8></a> God had brought them into His presence in peace, and dwelt among them; and Jew and Gentile were bound to have towards each other, for very different reasons, yea, every saint one toward another, that bearing which the presence of God would surely produce.<a name=333:9></a> The unity was by the Spirit, not in flesh (there the enmity had been), and they were to strive to maintain practically, in the bond of peace, the unity in which they stood in Christ; but the apostle then proceeds to refer to various characters or aspects of unity, the force of which I do not think has been generally seen, and which connects itself with the general subject of which I treat.<a name=333:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		There is, says the apostle, one body and one Spirit, as we are called in one hope of our calling.<a name=333:11></a> There I find what is essential and of vital reality in the church of God -- the body of Christ necessarily as such composed of living members, whatever responsibility those who pretend to be of it may be under; but here the apostle speaks of the unity in its true nature: one Spirit, which is the bond and power of this unity, and the one conscious hope which belongs to those who are called into this blessed place.<a name=333:12></a> That is the substance and reality of unity.<a name=333:13></a><a name=334>[Page 334]</a>

		The next enlarges in its sphere of application, but loses in its essential character -- one Lord, one faith, one baptism.<a name=334:1></a> This is profession upon earth, connected with the title of Christ to Lordship over them.<a name=334:2></a> He is Lord.<a name=334:3></a> It is not union with Him which is in heaven.<a name=334:4></a> The Holy Ghost unites us to the Head there; and we hope to enjoy fully what we enter into in spirit.<a name=334:5></a> Our calling is above.<a name=334:6></a> But faith here is the truth of the doctrine we profess.<a name=334:7></a> It is not even personal living faith here, for he could not then say one faith.<a name=334:8></a> One faith is the one thing believed, in the truth of which we own the Lord; and in baptism a person is publicly admitted into association with those owning the Lord and holding this faith, who form the house publicly upon earth.<a name=334:9></a> All this of course is on earth.<a name=334:10></a> There will be no faith in heaven.<a name=334:11></a> It is the unity of the owning of Christ's title.<a name=334:12></a> There is but one Lord, the holding the truth with which the announcement of Him is connected, and in the announcement of which that Lordship is maintained, and public outward association with the professors of it where that Lordship is owned.<a name=334:13></a> Simon Magus believed and was baptized; he was never of the body of Christ.<a name=334:14></a> It is a unity which regards professed Christianity on the earth.<a name=334:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next unity is one God and Father of all.<a name=334:16></a> That is, we have God, the Lord, and the Spirit, as in 1 Corinthians 12.<a name=334:17></a> This last is necessarily a larger unity still, based on a more widely claiming name, a name to which a wider sphere belongs.<a name=334:18></a> The Spirit is connected with the body, for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body.<a name=334:19></a> The Lord is owned by faith, and men are associated with the public profession of His name by baptism; but with the unity of God everything that is is connected, or there is something that exists independent of Him, and His unity is denied; or else creatures are not creatures but have independent existence of themselves.<a name=334:20></a> This to us now is simple; but when men owned "gods many and lords many," it was not so.<a name=334:21></a> To us there is but one God, the Father, and one Lord, Jesus Christ.<a name=334:22></a> Hence the Thessalonians are said to be in God the Father.<a name=334:23></a> This one God is above all, and through all.<a name=334:24></a> It is far from Pantheism: that a heathen could imagine.<a name=334:25></a> He is one God above all; yet He is present throughout -- He is through all.<a name=334:26></a> Whatever length and breadth and depth and height there may be, above all He is; and one God fills it all gloriously.<a name=334:27></a> But this is not all.<a name=334:28></a> He who fills all things dwells in the believer, He is "in you" or "us all" -- He brings us most blessedly into this immediate association with Himself.<a name=334:29></a>

		If Christ is Head over all things to the church, God, who is above all and through all, dwells in each individual who composes it, and brings him into the universe with personal divine blessing -- filled with Him who fills all.<a name=335:1></a> This brings us divinely back to realities, filling us with God Himself, in the widest though more outward and general sphere of His glory; yet even here we could not be separated from direct divine blessing.<a name=335:2></a> Lordship over might be over professed subjects; but God could not pervade all things without being in us in the proper way of divine blessing, because of our living relationship to Him -- wondrous grace and blessing!<a name=335:3></a> Through all things He is, but He who is so is in us.<a name=335:4></a> Here then we have three distinct unities, the first of which gives us the real unity of the body; the second, professed subjection, as the apostle speaks, to the gospel of Christ (how wide is this gone now!<a name=335:5></a> How dreadful the state of those who thus own His Lordship!<a name=335:6></a>); the third, that of all things and God.<a name=335:7></a>

		But the confusion which evil has brought into the church, and the enormous system of evil which bears its name, may create difficulties in many a sincere soul, when what bears the name of the church of God is the seat of the power of the enemy.<a name=336:24></a> To this the apostle turns.<a name=336:25></a> "But in a great house," continues he, after speaking of these mischievous teachers, and the general principles which secured and directed the heart of the faithful.<a name=336:26></a> "In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth, and some to honour and some to dishonour.<a name=336:27></a>" The professing church -- what bore the name of Christ in the world -- would become like a great house, where one finds vessels of every kind, and for all uses.<a name=336:28></a> What was to be done -- leave the Christian profession -- become unbaptized?<a name=336:29></a> That was impossible.<a name=336:30></a> There was no going out of the great house.<a name=336:31></a> Whatever state it was in, Christ was the Master of the house.<a name=336:32></a> We cannot be heathens, or Mahommedans, or strangers to Christian profession.<a name=336:33></a> What, I repeat, was to be done?<a name=336:34></a> Remain with those that dishonoured Christ because they also were in the great house?<a name=336:35></a> Not so.<a name=336:36></a> "If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.<a name=336:37></a>" What defiled the house was worse, as such, than heathenism or the darkest ignorance.<a name=336:38></a>

		I apprehend, in 1 Peter 4: 17, the professing house is referred to, alluding to Ezekiel; but in both these passages, and in all where ruin is not spoken of, the house, though viewed as outwardly subsisting in this world, is supposed to be a true one.<a name=339:2></a> Thus, when it is said to Timothy, "behave thyself in the house of God," it was his conduct in the professing church of God upon the earth, but assumed to be composed of disciples.<a name=339:3></a> That hypocrites, false brethren, might have got in, this altered nothing as to Timothy's conduct.<a name=339:4></a> He was to behave himself in it as the house of God, and maintain its order practically as such.<a name=339:5></a> What might come of the house through man's unfaithfulness is another and special question; what is seen in the passages I have just cited is the character, not the state, of the Christian body.<a name=339:6></a>

		THOUGHTS ON THE CHURCH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Acquaintance with the truth of the church is indispensable for the setting free of the soul.<a name=340:1></a> I call him set free who has done with all questions between himself, God, and Satan.<a name=340:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having entered into this understanding that we belong to the house of God, as if we had always been of it, the question arises, What has Satan to say to it?<a name=340:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Epistle to the Hebrews the point is that all is settled through Christ's blood, and I can draw near.<a name=340:4></a> For the church it is, I am of the family of God.<a name=340:5></a> My life is from Christ; it comes from above.<a name=340:6></a> I am with God.<a name=340:7></a> By the blood of Christ I draw near from without; as a child I am within whence I come.<a name=340:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is for me a difference between peace in the conscience and peace in the affections.<a name=340:9></a> As regards justification, the blood delivers me from a God of judgment, and the resurrection delivers me from the power of Satan, because the enemy cannot go farther than death.<a name=340:10></a> Then, in speaking of the church being risen with Christ, we are one body with Him in resurrection in a sphere where Satan has nothing.<a name=340:11></a> If I remain, as it were before the blood only, God always continues to be for me a judge; but, being risen with Christ, I am united to Him in heaven.<a name=340:12></a> And such is the church's place, for the church is composed of those who are one with Christ in heaven, and nothing else.<a name=340:13></a> We exist in virtue of the love of God, instead of having done anything to satisfy His righteousness.<a name=340:14></a> The lack of deliverance nowadays arises very much from the affections not being subdued.<a name=340:15></a> Therefore people really do not get out of this struggle till they have the consciousness of the love of God.<a name=340:16></a> One cannot enjoy the love of God without being in holiness.<a name=340:17></a> If the heart is full of love, God Himself is there; and this is holiness.<a name=340:18></a> Resurrection puts us there consciously; without resurrection and the power of the Spirit one is not of the church.<a name=340:19></a> On the earth I am not said to be dead; I have a right, it is true, to count myself dead; still, the flesh is in me; whilst in heaven my life is hid with Christ in God, and this by virtue of His resurrection and ascension.<a name=340:20></a> With the flesh I am not in heaven, for I am not united to Christ by virtue of the flesh.<a name=340:21></a> In resurrection the church is there, where is neither Jew nor Greek.<a name=340:22></a> Viewed in Christ, in its privileges, the church is in a condition which goes beyond the state where a conscience is needed; yet this is brought home to the conscience by the fact that the church is on the earth with a testimony.<a name=340:23></a>

		THE VAUDOIS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know not whether your readers are interested, as I have been, in the hunted remnant of the middle ages, both east and west, during the time that ecclesiastical corruption and wickedness were on the throne of their power.<a name=355:1></a> They laboured under a double disadvantage.<a name=355:2></a> They have no historians but their enemies, alike bitter and unprincipled, who would stop at no calumny to blacken them, their own stupendous wickedness making the accusation of it a natural weapon.<a name=355:3></a> This was one reason why we know so little truly of them, and that little to their disadvantage.<a name=355:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was a second disadvantage under which they laboured; they were thrown, by being separated from the public professing body, into the danger of following their own ideas instead of the abominable and senseless traditions in which they had been nurtured, and so much the more because they had (though the first that largely used them after darkness set in in the church), comparatively speaking, very little the opportunity of availing themselves of the word of God.<a name=355:5></a> And further they were in danger not only from the working of the human mind as we all are, but of coalescing with various heresies and works of Satan which moved about in the dark, but hated the ruling religious powers for the truth they preserved more than for the corruption they were guilty of You will always find Edomites that would raze Jerusalem, not because it is corrupt but because it has the standing of the city of the great king, as well as those who say "The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these," while they are only bringing ruin on it by corrupting it and dishonouring the Lord of the temple.<a name=355:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Waldenses have this advantage -- they are attacked by both.<a name=355:7></a> Roman Catholics and Ritualists attack them of course; and free-thinkers, who would have error free because it is free-thinking, will never bear subjection to the word of God, nor holding fast to the truth because it is the truth, for then man cannot be a free-thinker.<a name=355:8></a> Another very serious disadvantage under which the Vaudois have laboured is, that those in the seventeenth century who furnished their documents or copies of them to the Protestant world in England and France tampered with them -- that is, Leger and Perrin, or at least Perrin.<a name=355:9></a> Critics and Ritualists settled on this, as flies on a sore, and sought to cast on the Vaudois the sins of their historians and furnishers of documents.<a name=355:10></a> There was no serious effort to investigate the truth, but the greatest delight in detecting what was false and thereby discrediting the Vaudois or Waldenses.<a name=355:11></a> Even Moreland, who deposited the MSS.<a name=355:12></a> at Cambridge, did not escape; he, it was said, must have stolen them away after putting them there, that they might be in some safer Puritan's place and detection avoided.<a name=355:13></a> Quite a theory as to this was built up by Mr.<a name=355:14></a> Algernon Herbert in a very vulgar-minded detective-police article, quite worthy of that class of religionists, which is now proved to be all false.<a name=355:15></a> The MSS.<a name=355:16></a> are in Cambridge, and have always been there, overlooked though close by the rest.<a name=355:17></a>

		Nor was the spirit of Dr.<a name=356:1></a> Todd much better, who anxiously insinuates they held popish errors in the very pieces which relate their being tortured and delivered to the secular army by Romish prelates.<a name=356:2></a> Some of the MSS.<a name=356:3></a> are of a later date than the warm advocates of the Vaudois have supposed, and some falsely dated by the copyist for Perrin, or by Perrin himself -- very likely the latter.<a name=356:4></a> I know not why, but the French Synods were dissatisfied with his work, yet at last accepted it.<a name=356:5></a> The Nobla Leycon is a genuine and ancient document, but their manipulations had sought to give it an earlier date than was the real one; and we have a large body of documents genuine, though some have been meddled with, and some probably very ancient; and Gilly has pretty well proved the most ancient European translation of the New Testament found in any language is the Romaunt or Gallic.<a name=356:6></a> The copies we have are written with chapter and verse, but scripture is quoted in some treatises without either, proving the quoted passages to have been written early in the thirteenth century at latest.<a name=356:7></a> (Gilly's Introduction to the Romaunt version of John, 41.<a name=356:8></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears that the Nobla Leycon reads really 1400 years are fully accomplished, not 1100.<a name=356:9></a> This was Leger's doing, or some other, who furnished the MSS.<a name=356:10></a> But the poem is genuine; and long before the Reformation the early French translations were to supplant the Vaudois scripture.<a name=356:11></a> Such is the evidence of documents now afforded.<a name=356:12></a> We have the testimony of a letter of Pope Innocent III in 1199, of a Gallic translation circulated in the diocese of Metz in 1229.<a name=356:13></a> The Romaunt version was prohibited in the Council of Toulouse.<a name=356:14></a> Other acts of the inquisition and councils to prevent people reading this version it is unnecessary to speak of.<a name=356:15></a>

		As to the antiquity of the Vaudois themselves, some remarks may be useful.<a name=357:9></a> Waldo's history is well known.<a name=357:10></a> He appeared about 1170, was at first well received by the Pope, but forbidden to preach; he did however and was driven from Lyons.<a name=357:11></a> He had nearly all, if not all, the Bible translated, and was very active, having given away all his fortune.<a name=357:12></a> The upholders of popery have taken great pains to shew that the Vaudois were in many points conformed to the followers of the Pope.<a name=357:13></a> Now there were many points as to which they were in the dark.<a name=357:14></a> The infamy of the clergy, degraded by species of vice which none can call in question, had roused the conscience of many, and more as to practice and the acts by which they made money than as to dogma.<a name=357:15></a> But purgatory, consecration to the priesthood and indulgences, confession to priests, prayers for the dead, were all rejected.<a name=357:16></a> They are charged by ritualists with recognizing penances of prayers, fasting, alms.<a name=357:17></a> There is truth in this; but they appear to have been as opposed to indulgences which had obliterated all true discipline.<a name=357:18></a> They rejected oaths on confession extorted by torture.<a name=357:19></a> Andrinus Crespini, or Valoy, said there was no purgatory but in this world; he denied the spiritual power of the Pope, prelates and clergy, disapproved of the invocation of saints, kept no feasts or fasts of the church, gave no honour to images, had no faith in holy water.<a name=357:20></a> This was half a century before the Reformation.<a name=357:21></a> The superstition and vices of the clergy and church of Rome -- that they rejected; holding the common faith of the church at large, without any apparent protestant doctrine of justification by faith.<a name=357:22></a> This was the case also with the revival in Moravia and Bohemia of Hussitism before the Reformation, closely connected as it was with the scattered Waldenses, as their history plainly shews.<a name=357:23></a> They did not then like the doctrine of justification by faith when brought from Luther.<a name=357:24></a> Todd seeks to insinuate that they held the seven sacraments; but his own quotation proves that they did not hold extreme unction as really such, though he speaks of Perrin's only giving what refers to the abuses of the Roman Catholics.<a name=357:25></a> Nor, it is clear, did they hold priestly ordination at all.<a name=357:26></a><a href="#357:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		And now as regards the origin of Vaudois.<a name=358:1></a> Of Waldo I need say nothing.<a name=358:2></a> The facts as to him may be found in most church histories, and (with a trifling difference) the date of his coming forward as a herald of what truth he knew, and getting the scripture translated.<a name=358:3></a> He was forced to retire from Lyons, but it is admitted that the Vaudois sect was spread over all Western Europe.<a name=358:4></a> It is said Philip Augustus of France in the earlier part of the thirteenth century razed three hundred castles of Vaudois Seigneurs.<a name=358:5></a> This could hardly be from Waldo, who only began to preach at the end of the twelfth.<a name=358:6></a> But further Waldo first received serious impressions from a Troubadour, of whom many carried piety and anti-Roman doctrines around where they penetrated with their songs; and it is expressly said by Stephen of Borbonne that when driven out, Waldo went and joined other heretics of Provence and Lombardy.<a name=358:7></a> They were therefore already there.<a name=358:8></a> And this question then arises, Were these simply Albigenses or Manicheans as is alleged?<a name=358:9></a> That there were Manicheans spread from Bulgaria, originally from the east of Asia Minor, on into Spain itself, can hardly be questioned.<a name=358:10></a> But not even the Inquisition ever charged the Waldenses with this.<a name=358:11></a> The archives of the Inquisition of Toulouse published by Limborch demonstrate this; and the well-known testimony of Reinerius Saccho which declares that they live justly and believe all the articles of the creed; which makes them, he says, so dangerous.<a name=358:12></a> But, if we are to believe Mosheim, there were two parties even among these Bulgarian teachers who filled the whole south of Europe, and particularly Lombardy and the south of France, the latter being exterminated by the crusade of de Montfort, for which the Inquisition was invented.<a name=358:13></a> The one, or Albenanses, really held the doctrine of two principles, and thus were Manicheans; the other Baioli, of whom came the Albigenses, held nothing of the kind, but that there was one God the Creator, Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, but that Satan, after his fall, had ruined the earth, making the four elements.<a name=358:14></a> So they were divided into three parties as to the flesh of Christ, some holding He took flesh of the Virgin Mary, some not; others that He took it really and suffered in it, but did not take it to heaven on His ascension.<a name=358:15></a> The sacraments of the Roman body they wholly rejected.<a name=358:16></a> They had a certain but unsatisfactory faith in the Trinity.<a name=358:17></a><a href="#358:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> All this had nothing to do with the Vaudois.<a name=358:18></a>

		We have clearly then, I think, three parties: Waldo's followers, who amalgamated with the Vaudois, and the Cathari, of whom there were two parties, Manicheans, and non-Manicheans, though of unsatisfactory doctrine.<a name=359:1></a> We cannot be surprised, as all were opposed to Rome, at Rome's burning all together.<a name=359:2></a> She did not care for truth but for authority, and pulled up some tares contrary to Christ's direction and much wheat (as the blessed Lord foretold) with it.<a name=359:3></a> She will have to answer for the blood of all saints.<a name=359:4></a> But if we seek to trace out the history of the Vaudois proper, those of the valleys of Piedmont, it is not very difficult.<a name=359:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well known that Claude of Turin resisted what they resisted.<a name=359:6></a> He was archbishop of those very valleys.<a name=359:7></a> This was in the ninth century.<a name=359:8></a> But it is certain that before that the same opposition to superstition was found there.<a name=359:9></a> In Jerome's famous letter to Vigilantius, in which he rages with his accustomed abuse and violence against him for resisting superstitions then coming in, he refers to these very districts and states in the most insolent language (the custom of ritualists when opposed, however they fawn on superiors when it suits them), that the bishops there sustained Vigilantius in his opposition to the growing superstition.<a name=359:10></a> Thus from 406 and then in the middle of the ninth century the same opposition continues there; and then we find 300 years after the same opposition still, and them and their adversaries tracing it to some seventy years before we find it established there, as proved by Jerome's letter.<a name=359:11></a> It was a protest, not there only, but which survived there against the corruption of the professing church after Constantine, when it borrowed the rites and doctrines of Paganism and thus supplanted it.<a name=359:12></a> With the testimony we have from Reinerius Saccho and others, it is utterly impossible to think the Vaudois commenced with Waldo of Lyons, though it be very likely their tenets received a very great extension through his means.<a name=359:13></a> Reinerius Saccho's inquisitorial activity was sixty years after Waldo's activity began, and he states there were three reasons why the Waldenses or Vaudois whom he was sent to reduce to the obedience of the Roman Church.<a name=359:14></a> The first was they were a great deal older (diuturnior) than all other sects; adding, some say from the time of Pope Sylvester, others from the apostles.<a name=359:15></a> It has been attempted to say this is merely "some say," but it is Reinerius who says they were older than sects; and it is important to see that it was they themselves who thus held it to be from Sylvester at least, soon after whose time we find traces of it in these districts, the evil having really begun in his time by the christianizing of the emperor.<a name=359:16></a> Next, that they were more universally spread, there was scarce any land where it was not received.<a name=359:17></a> This could not have been in some fifty years.<a name=359:18></a> The third was that they lived justly, and held soundly all the articles of the creed.<a name=359:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Vaudois then were a people, a religious testimony with their Barbes (uncles) or pastors spread over Europe.<a name=360:1></a> Reinerius does not speak of Albigenses, who were treated as open heretics, but the Vaudois; and the history is well known, how they had been sought for their integrity by the feudal lords in Calabria, and, after being settled there some time and visited by their Barbes, were subsequently all utterly exterminated at the instigation and under the direction of the Roman Catholic clergy.<a name=360:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That the Vaudois had sunk very low at the time of the Reformation is quite true.<a name=360:3></a> They went to mass and were afraid of holding separate meetings.<a name=360:4></a> But we have even then the unexceptionable testimony that they had lived wholly apart from Rome.<a name=360:5></a> Seyssel, archbishop of Turin, declares in a book published in 1520, only three years after Luther's theses, that within memory of man no Romish prelates had been in the valleys.<a name=360:6></a> He declares that they pretend to date from Constantine but in an ignorant way calling themselves Leonists, from a Leo of Constantine's time who was disgusted with the largesses bestowed on the prelates by the emperor.<a name=360:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Reformation roused them up, and Oecolampadius blamed them much for thus yielding to popery and not having separate meetings.<a name=360:8></a> But at this epoch we have Seyssel's testimony that no prelate had dared to go there within the memory of man, and that by faith he ventured there.<a name=360:9></a> As we might suppose, oppression and persecutions came with the Roman clergy.<a name=360:10></a> Since the Reformation they sank down, with the rest of the reformed, into Socinianism; but with the rest God has graciously revealed the truth amongst them, though of course they have not got beyond the principles of the Reformation which they received from OEcolampadius and Bucer at the time by the intervention of Masson and Moul their Barbes.<a name=360:11></a>

		Recently Dr.<a name=361:1></a> Meila, a Roman Catholic clergyman, has sought to use the efforts of Todd and the recent discoveries (by Mr.<a name=361:2></a> Bradshaw) of the Cambridge MSS.<a name=361:3></a> to attack their antiquity.<a name=361:4></a> The body of the book is simply exposing what was already exposed, the unreliableness of the statements of Leger; and then seeks to prove that the Vaudois were persecuted for rebellion and not religion; but <i>qui s'excuse s'accuse</i>.<a name=361:5></a> The oppression is certain; and in another way the answer is no answer at all.<a name=361:6></a> There were Waldenses outside the valleys.<a name=361:7></a> They were all exterminated in Calabria and brought before the Inquisition everywhere.<a name=361:8></a> Rome is drunk with the blood of the saints.<a name=361:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dr.<a name=361:10></a> M.<a name=361:11></a> has brought forward only one document of any importance.<a name=361:12></a> In 1220 the corporation of Pinerol forbade any to open their houses to Waldenses.<a name=361:13></a> He adduced this as a proof that it was then new.<a name=361:14></a> This was some 30 years after Waldo's public activity.<a name=361:15></a> This may very likely have awakened the activities of the authorities against the Waldenses, but it is no proof one way or other of their existence or otherwise.<a name=361:16></a> Reinerius' testimony, which Dr.<a name=361:17></a> Meila entirely misrepresents and which was only 30 years after this decree of the local authorities, makes such an idea impossible.<a name=361:18></a> Nay the decree rather confirms the importance of the statement.<a name=361:19></a> Reinerius' own words are that it was of much older date than any sect.<a name=361:20></a> The particular alleged dates he quotes from others; but that it is "<i>diuturnior omnium</i>" is his own statement.<a name=361:21></a> He had been a Vaudois himself before the time of the decree and knew what they said, and turned Dominican and inquisitor.<a name=361:22></a> How was it possible, if it had only begun 30 years before in the neighbourhood?<a name=361:23></a> could he say that it had existed longer than any sect?<a name=361:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The decree of Pinerol is easily accounted for, the condemnation of Waldo and the Waldenses having just taken place at Rome.<a name=361:25></a> Not only so, but in the year 1127 there is a treatise of Peter of Clugny against the heretics of the diocese of Embrun, and in 1164 the mountains are said to be infected with heresy.<a name=361:26></a> At the very end of that century (1189) the Pope had embraced Waldo, only bid him not preach unless authorized by the priesthood.<a name=361:27></a> Subsequently not obeying this order he was driven from Lyons and went over to the Italian side of the mountains and sowed and drank in heresy, says Stephen de Borbonne.<a name=361:28></a> That then the decree of Pinerol should have been made, the Pope in council having now condemned them thus active in spite of popes, is perfectly natural, but proves nothing as to the date of Waldensian principles which the contemporary testimony of Stephen de Borbonne and Reinerius Saccho prove.<a name=361:29></a> One expressly he found already there; besides testimonies of an earlier date still, which say the heresy was there.<a name=361:30></a>

		My paper has greatly overpassed the limits I had thought of; but it may not (in the presence of these attempts to discredit an oppressed and persecuted people, without any honest search into the truth of the matter) be without interest to some of your readers.<a name=362:1></a> It is quite true that Leger and Perrin are not to be trusted, and the attempt to ascribe reformed doctrines to the ancient Waldenses has no foundation.<a name=362:2></a> But neither is Dr.<a name=362:3></a> Todd to be wholly trusted, and Mr.<a name=362:4></a> Herbert's ingenious and prejudiced theories were false.<a name=362:5></a> Dr.<a name=362:6></a> Todd is obliged to admit it was a monstrous charge, but neither has anything to do with the real history of the case.<a name=362:7></a>

		I may just add that the discussions as to the origin of the term Waldenses, Vallenses, etc.<a name=362:10></a>, have proved nothing.<a name=362:11></a> The Canton de Vaud is spelt with a 'd'; but east of Lausanne there is a commune in the height above the lake which is called Grandvaux with an 'x.<a name=362:12></a>' I doubt that Canton Waadh is the same as Wald.<a name=362:13></a>

		BRIEF REMARKS ON THE SPIRIT AND THE ASSEMBLY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Now concerning spiritual operations [or, manifestations]": this word is preferable to that of "gifts," because here it includes diabolical demonstrations, as well as operations of the Spirit; and we do not like to call that which is really the working of the devil a "gift.<a name=363:1></a>" Such is the meaning of desiring the "best gifts.<a name=363:2></a>" They might desire spiritual manifestations.<a name=363:3></a> Paul wished them to be able to discern, when any one had spoken with power among them, whether it was the devil or the Holy Ghost speaking by Him.<a name=363:4></a> No man can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the Holy Spirit; and no one calls Him "Anathema" if he speaks in the Spirit of God.<a name=363:5></a> It seems strange for us to think a person speaking with power should speak by the evil spirit; but it was a common thing with them.<a name=363:6></a> There were false prophets, we read.<a name=363:7></a> They took the form of teachers, instead of utterances.<a name=363:8></a> No doubt the devil has been thus working among Mormonites and Irvingites.<a name=363:9></a> "Every spirit that confesseth Jesus Christ come in the flesh is of God.<a name=363:10></a>" The great truth is Himself come in the flesh.<a name=363:11></a> The Gnostics said matter was a bad thing made by the devil.<a name=363:12></a> It is, in 2 John, Jesus Christ coming in the flesh, not speaking as to the time, but of the character, of His coming.<a name=363:13></a> Again, "This is he that came by water and blood.<a name=363:14></a>" There was moral power but atonement also.<a name=363:15></a> He was real man; and came for the shedding of blood as well as for purifying.<a name=363:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.<a name=363:17></a>" The great thing here insisted on is the unity of the Spirit, as opposed to many demons, creatures working by creatures.<a name=363:18></a> "He shall not speak of himself.<a name=363:19></a>" "Let the prophets speak two or three .<a name=363:20></a>.<a name=363:21></a>.<a name=363:22></a> if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace," 1 Corinthians 14: 29, 30.<a name=363:23></a> The power of the Holy Ghost acts morally on the individual.<a name=363:24></a> "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.<a name=363:25></a>" If we see a carriage movable by steam, the moment the steam is put on, there is the power; but it wants one to guide.<a name=363:26></a> If the one prophet went on speaking, it was not according to the order of the Spirit, though it was by the Spirit.<a name=363:27></a> The gift is committed to men who are responsible for the use of it.<a name=363:28></a> It is not impulse merely, though there be an impulse given; but then there must be the control over it.<a name=363:29></a> If two get up at the same moment to pray, both may have what is of the Spirit to utter, but one is not subject at the moment to the Lord's order.<a name=363:30></a>

		There are differences of ministries.<a name=364:1></a> The gifts are through the Holy Ghost, the service is to Christ the Head; but the Spirit is the power.<a name=364:2></a> In the exercise of the gift one is the servant of Christ the Lord, the Spirit is the energy by which one serves, but God is He that works all in all, doing everything.<a name=364:3></a> Though several should speak together, still it is all by one divine Spirit (not several spirits of demons).<a name=364:4></a> While I am Christ's servant and not man's, still I could not exercise my gift in spite of all my brethren (say against it) without despising Christ's authority in the body.<a name=364:5></a> "Be ye subject one to another.<a name=364:6></a>" It is God that is working; and therefore let all be silent before Him.<a name=364:7></a>

		The thought of the family, which sometimes prevails, is not sufficiently reverential to Christ as the Lord.<a name=364:8></a> Service to Christ as the Lord is something more than service in the family.<a name=364:9></a> For instance, I feel a difference in going to my Father, and going to God.<a name=364:10></a> Thus, if I go to my father in the house, I go up to him at once, and jump upon his knee; but if he is in court, sitting in public in his official capacity, I do not use such familiarity; I treat him with more respect than that.<a name=364:11></a> We are set as servants, and as members (lower down in the chapter) of one body, of which Christ is the Head.<a name=364:12></a> It makes an amazing difference in this way.<a name=364:13></a> If I have the thought of the Holy Ghost only present to my mind, self comes in, and I almost necessarily attach a certain importance to myself, because I am expecting to be used.<a name=364:14></a> I am to speak, or I am to pray.<a name=364:15></a> But when Christ is looked to and realized, it is entirely different.<a name=364:16></a> Self does not come in, because I am looking to another -- to Christ as personally present to faith; and thus the affections are drawn forth to a Person -- to Him who has died for me.<a name=364:17></a> The whole tone of a meeting will be affected by this.<a name=364:18></a>

		REMARKS ON 2 TIMOTHY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A few remarks on the Second Epistle to Timothy may, I think, not be without their use at the present moment.<a name=367:1></a> I will embrace in them, as throwing great light on the second, a short comparison with the first, as to its general character.<a name=367:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get in both epistles what is evidently of the deepest interest, the confidential communications of the apostle to one to whom, above all, he could open out all his heart, and express himself freely.<a name=367:3></a> But their characters are very different, and the rather as he could express all his personal feelings.<a name=367:4></a> Besides the interest of this, moreover, the general instruction of the Spirit in them is full of import.<a name=367:5></a> The first, as is soon perceived, bears in general the stamp of the quietness which characterizes a peaceful development of what was subsisting, in the main, as it had been first established.<a name=367:6></a> The second is thrown into individual duties and earnestness, because that which had been established had departed from all consistency with its original standing.<a name=367:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first epistle just guards the truth which was possessed, but is little occupied with it.<a name=367:8></a> Individuals were to be hindered teaching any other doctrine.<a name=367:9></a> Some few, hankering after the law, had already turned aside and gone into vain janglings.<a name=367:10></a> But in the main the apostle could speak of the church as being that which is always true to the responsibility of the position it is in, without its suggesting a painful sense of the discordance between fact and responsibility; namely, that it was the pillar and ground of the truth.<a name=367:11></a> Individuals had fallen into Gnostic Judaism.<a name=367:12></a> The assembly was still practically, as it always is in responsible position, the pillar and ground of the truth.<a name=367:13></a> It had not falsified its character.<a name=367:14></a> The church, and the church alone, until judicially rejected of God, sustains the truth before the world, though grace sustains the church.<a name=367:15></a> Men may minister the truth, but the church, by its profession, sustains it.<a name=367:16></a> This thought brings no present distress to the apostle's mind.<a name=367:17></a> It gives occasion to the prophetic declaration, that in the latter days some would depart from the faith.<a name=367:18></a> Timothy was to put the brethren in remembrance, so that they might be on their guard when that came; but the body of the epistle supposes the church, in the main, untroubled in this respect, though there were dangers seen in the horizon, as in Acts 20, and it is occupied, assuming the truth to be maintained, with the order and comeliness of the house of God -- how Timothy ought to behave himself in the church, which was the pillar and ground of the truth.<a name=367:19></a> It arranges the order of the house in the various practical details of its administration on earth, from the elders who should rule in it, to the care of widows and the church's duty in respect of them, keeping in view family ties and the obligations flowing from them.<a name=367:20></a> It is the whole order of the church upon earth, and the due administration of it.<a name=367:21></a> The church is looked at as in this world, not as the body of Christ.<a name=367:22></a> It is the house of the living God, and assembly here on the earth, the vessel and maintainer of the truth in it.<a name=367:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=368>[Page 368]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle looked to exercise still his administrative care himself, but instructed Timothy meanwhile how to behave himself, having his attention fixed on divine things, and exhorts him to fight the good fight of faith in view of the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=368:1></a> In a word, it is the due administration of the church upon earth, awaiting the Lord's appearing as the term of the responsibility.<a name=368:2></a> As a whole the church is seen as that to which the mystery of godliness was confided, and it was the maintainer of it on the earth.<a name=368:3></a> The danger of running into law and Gnostic asceticism is warned against; but as yet the church, as such, maintains the truth, and has only to be rightly administered.<a name=368:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be remembered that Timothy was left at Ephesus to guard against any preaching of any other doctrine (1 Timothy 1: 3), though instructed in the administrative order of the assembly; and this runs through the epistles, applying that truth withal to practical purposes, shewing it as the truth as it is in Jesus.<a name=368:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second epistle the assembly is still there; but it is viewed as a great house, in which vessels to dishonour are to be found.<a name=368:6></a> Here the truth, as with John, takes a prominent place, that is the maintenance of the truth, individual faithfulness to the truth, and individual piety.<a name=368:7></a> He looks for devotedness and courage in the individual, in the man of God.<a name=368:8></a> Church privileges are not before his mind.<a name=368:9></a> He can dwell on the Jewish faith (the truth in their day) of Timothy's mother and grandmother (and the mother had married a Greek), and that of Timothy, as all running in the same divine channel and flowing from the same divine source.<a name=368:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have two characters of the assembly.<a name=368:11></a> It is like a great house, it has vessels to dishonour as well as to honour, and it would have, in the perilous times, the form of piety but deny its force.<a name=368:12></a> As to the facts which gave occasion to this train of thought, they are evident.<a name=368:13></a> The apostle had been deserted by the saints, and was looking soon to leave the assembly, and he knew what would come in after his departure, and warns of it.<a name=368:14></a> "All in Asia had turned away" from him: he was glad to have one that cared for him in his prison!<a name=368:15></a> The Lord had indeed none.<a name=368:16></a> The brethren, some from worldly motives, some doubtless for service, but at any rate all but Luke, had left him.<a name=368:17></a> They had not in their hearts to stand by him in his witness.<a name=368:18></a> They had not left Christ as to the faith, but they could not hold fast in such an exposed place as Paul's.<a name=368:19></a> So at his first answer on his trial, "no man stood by him," "all men forsook him"; but he knows whom he has believed.<a name=368:20></a> It was to Christ he had committed his happiness, and He would keep it safe for him.<a name=368:21></a> A crown of righteousness was laid up for him.<a name=368:22></a> He had fought the good fight, he had kept the faith.<a name=368:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=369>[Page 369]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus strong individual personal faith, with the sense that the assembly had failed and not held on to the ground on which his soul walked, is that which gives the character and key-note to this epistle.<a name=369:1></a> Still unclouded personal courage is that which he looks for.<a name=369:2></a> But the state of the assembly on the earth may first occupy us, and then individual duty.<a name=369:3></a> It did not maintain church elevation in its position.<a name=369:4></a> Of this Paul was the representative.<a name=369:5></a> I doubt much if Timothy was at Ephesus at the time (Tychicus was sent there); but the epistle to the Ephesians gives, at any rate, what I mean by church elevation in its position.<a name=369:6></a> We know how Paul was converted by the revelation of a heavenly Christ, accompanied by the declaration that all saints were one with Himself.<a name=369:7></a> How the fact that men, Jew as well as Gentile (for he was a pattern of a Jew), were children of wrath, that man was alienated from God, dead in trespasses and sins, that it was a risen Christ he knew, and did not know Him after the flesh, and that all in Him was a new creation, a second Adam, characterized the teaching of the apostle.<a name=369:8></a> How the elevation of his doctrine, which judged all flesh and shewed what the church really was, awakened the opposition of fleshly religion and human pride.<a name=369:9></a> He had first been in bonds for this, he was now on the borders of death, but he had kept the faith -- had indeed "not counted his life dear unto him.<a name=369:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here the great body of the saints held back.<a name=369:11></a> It pressed them out too much against the world, and the world against them; and they shrank back; he was deserted as well as persecuted.<a name=369:12></a> It is this aspect of things which he had to contemplate.<a name=369:13></a> He was largely like the Lord in it; standing as it were between two worlds, his service finished in one, and yet not passed into the other.<a name=369:14></a> Timothy took, comparatively with Paul, John's place with the blessed Lord on the cross.<a name=369:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the service of ministry there was a power which raised not only above sin (Christ, of course, was absolutely free from it) but above nature, when it was not sin, but where admission of it would have been a hindrance and so a failure, and incompatible with the undivided service to the Lord.<a name=370:1></a> "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=370:2></a>" So, when one would bid adieu at home, the Lord says: "he that hath put his hand to the plough and looketh back, is not fit for the kingdom of God": a man must hate his father and mother.<a name=370:3></a> So Paul: "henceforth know we no man after the flesh.<a name=370:4></a>" He took no counsel with flesh and blood.<a name=370:5></a> But when the Lord had closed His service, He said, "Woman, behold thy son; son, behold thy mother.<a name=370:6></a>" So the apostle here returns to the thoughts and feelings of nature (I do not mean as evil, but human) kindly associations.<a name=370:7></a> He opens his heart to Timothy, is mindful of his tears, desiring to see him that he might be filled with joy.<a name=370:8></a> He had served God from his forefathers, thinks of the piety and faith of Timothy's mother and grandmother, feels too his isolation, can speak of his cloak and books and parchments.<a name=370:9></a> He is, in spirit, passing out of his ministry, in which he was sustained above all nature, into gracious and tender feelings (but not apart from nature), and solemnly commending the charge which Timothy was to take up to his care and responsibilities.<a name=370:10></a> He who had represented the church in its higher character, and sustained it in his spiritual energy, was now in prison.<a name=370:11></a> This, for any but especially for such a servant of God, is full of touching interest.<a name=370:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the church had lost withal that character in which the divinely given elevation of his spirit could have found its sphere.<a name=370:13></a> He had his own place from God.<a name=370:14></a> He was a masterbuilder; and, however he could prophetically point out what was coming on, and give just warning as to it, one may justly ask oneself, how he could, such as he was, as given of God, have wrought in the declining state of things -- the rapidly corrupted church, which did not keep, we may say, a day after his death, the consciousness of the elevation of its position, or the clear doctrine of justification as risen with Christ It sank down to its conventional place in this world.<a name=370:15></a> No doubt the knowledge of Christ in that place made it incomparably superior to the world, to say nothing of individual salvation.<a name=370:16></a> But how could Paul have descended there?<a name=370:17></a> He would have been more than useless.<a name=370:18></a> He would have been in conflict with the whole church, when it was falling -- not reviving -- or have sanctioned, helplessly, the state he disapproved of No; God orders all things rightly.<a name=370:19></a> When the church is just turning into a great house, all having abandoned the apostle, the apostle, called up of God, abandons the no longer applicable service, having fought the good fight and finished his course; and leaves to John, in his singularly blessed Ephesus, to record the abandonment of their first love, and to secure individual faithfulness and walk where corporate consistency had failed.<a name=370:20></a> Meanwhile, what is ever our duty in our place, he urges on Timothy devoted and courageous faithfulness whatever the state of the assembly may be, and shews the saints' united path in it.<a name=370:21></a> This state of the assembly on earth in its elements, its form, and our path of duty in it, I have now to inquire into.<a name=370:22></a>

		Life and incorruptibility according to grace (given us in Christ Jesus before the world was) are now before his spirit, death being abolished in its power.<a name=371:1></a> The Fulfiller of the promise to the seed of David was raised from the dead.<a name=371:2></a> We have to suffer -- endure hardness -- not to be ashamed of the testimony, nor of its being in prison: a day is coming which will set all clear; at His appearing, and His kingdom, He would judge.<a name=371:3></a> There is here, note, no thought of rapture, or church privilege.<a name=371:4></a> I will touch on this farther on.<a name=371:5></a>

		That it marred the character of the assembly on earth as the recognized gathering together in one of the children of God who had been scattered, the manifestation of God's elect ("knowing, dearly beloved, your election of God"), (a decay already hinted at, 1 Corinthians 10), and the body of Christ, is evident from what the seal of the sure foundation of God was: "the <i>Lord</i> knoweth them that are his.<a name=372:1></a>" They were not publicly and distinctively manifested.<a name=372:2></a> It was no longer "the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved," nor the "perfecting of the saints, the edifying of the body of Christ, till <i>we all</i> come," etc.<a name=372:3></a> This form of truth is gone: the Lord Himself knows, and only He, who His chosen ones are.<a name=372:4></a> And the same thought is stamped on the reverse of the seal, man's responsibility to act up to his profession so that it might be evidently real: if a man named the name of Christ (plenty might be doing it), he was to depart from iniquity.<a name=372:5></a>

		Let us now see the spirit in which the saint, taught of God and watchful, has to walk, what our divine directions are.<a name=373:1></a> The first and most marked characteristic is the way the apostle looks for spiritual courage.<a name=373:2></a> God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.<a name=373:3></a> He was to be partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.<a name=373:4></a> No shame as to the testimony; no shame as to the shame it brought on those who were faithful.<a name=373:5></a> He was to be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=373:6></a> Personal faith was to grow in the measure in which evil grew, and the saints declined.<a name=373:7></a> He was to endure hardness, not to entangle himself with affairs of this life.<a name=373:8></a> He must fight according to rule.<a name=373:9></a> There was a power above all the power of evil.<a name=373:10></a> If Paul was bound, the word of God was not.<a name=373:11></a> God carries on, in spite of all, His own work.<a name=373:12></a> He is above all the circumstances which affect us.<a name=373:13></a> We do not sufficiently believe that the works that are done upon the earth, He doeth them Himself.<a name=373:14></a> Our part is to trust Him.<a name=373:15></a> So Paul had walked in enduring energy of love.<a name=373:16></a>

		Another important principle laid down, when the form of piety reigned denying the power, is faith based on the authority of the teachers then sent of God and the holy scriptures.<a name=374:1></a> These suffice to make the man of God perfect.<a name=374:2></a> The acknowledgment of the authority of the apostolic writers, and of the inspiration and sufficiency of the scriptures to make wise unto salvation, "perfect, throughly furnished," is another mark of the sound Christian in the perilous times of the last days.<a name=374:3></a> Connected with this is the place <i>the truth</i> takes.<a name=374:4></a> There is such a thing as the truth.<a name=374:5></a> This has to be held at all cost.<a name=374:6></a> The Lord tells us, "the truth shall make you free," "sanctify them through thy truth": "thy word is truth.<a name=374:7></a>" So here silly women cannot come to the knowledge of the truth, the deceivers resist the truth.<a name=374:8></a> These would soon turn their ears from the truth.<a name=374:9></a> Timothy was to teach meekly, in hope that God might give repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth.<a name=374:10></a> Thus, known <i>direct</i> apostolic authority (which no tradition can give, for I cannot say from whom I learned it so that it should have the apostle's authority), truth in the form of words given by the apostle, the scriptures, known truth, and the holding these fast, characterize the approved disciple, when decline and unfaithfulness had come in.<a name=374:11></a>

		Again, enduring, faithfulness, persecution, as contrasted with ease and profession, practically mark the divine path.<a name=374:12></a> Not uncertainty as to salvation, and a laborious procuring of it: we are saved, and called with a holy calling, according to God's purpose, before the world began.<a name=374:13></a> Death is abolished, so that we are not under its fear.<a name=374:14></a> Life and incorruptibility are brought to light.<a name=374:15></a> We are in the bright and blessed liberty of saved ones, for whom the whole power of death is destroyed.<a name=374:16></a> This was to be fully maintained.<a name=374:17></a> On the other hand the gospel brought afflictions: Timothy was to be partaker of them according to the power of God; Paul was suffering for it; Timothy was to endure hardness as a good soldier, be disentangled from the world; so Paul was enduring all things for the elect's sakes.<a name=374:18></a>

		But it was not merely those ministerially active who would suffer.<a name=375:1></a> There was another source of persecution, not Christianity now in itself, but seeking to live godly in Christ Jesus.<a name=375:2></a> The form of piety with abounding evil would prevail; but piety, the seeking to live godly, not to join the current of worldly profession, would be persecuted.<a name=375:3></a> The professing church being in this state, the assembly in general would be a great house, and vessels to dishonour allowed in it.<a name=375:4></a> This leads to ecclesiastical direction, so to speak.<a name=375:5></a> Carelessness as to doctrine, departure from the truth, and a worldly carnal state of the professing church prevailing (in which the sense that, risen already in Christ, we were looking for a resurrection to take us out of this whole state, was lost), and what called itself Christian settled into a recognition of man <i>this side death</i>.<a name=375:6></a> What was the Christian to do?<a name=375:7></a> Purge himself from these, so as to be a vessel meet for the Master's use.<a name=375:8></a> He could not leave the profession of Christianity, corrupted as it had become, that is clear; nor was he to sanction the corruption, nor could he correct it as regards the public profession.<a name=375:9></a> Nay -- evil remained -- seducers would wax worse and worse.<a name=375:10></a> He was <i>to purge himself</i> from them.<a name=375:11></a>

		But his practice was to be equally exact.<a name=375:12></a> Avoiding lusts, he was to follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace.<a name=375:13></a> Was he then to isolate himself in his walk because of the evil, in thus pursuing godliness and grace?<a name=375:14></a> He was not.<a name=375:15></a> He was to recognize and distinguish those who called on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=375:16></a> If it be asked, how can he do this?<a name=375:17></a> My answer is, the apostle tells us to do it; he does not suppose we cannot.<a name=375:18></a> It was to be done.<a name=375:19></a> I may not be able to distinguish a person to be such.<a name=375:20></a> That is possible.<a name=375:21></a> I am not his judge; but he is not one of those who are pointed out as those with whom I should walk.<a name=375:22></a> The direction is very simple.<a name=375:23></a> The professing church is characterized as a great house containing vessels to dishonour.<a name=375:24></a> In that state of things, I am not to rest satisfied with the dishonour; not to think of mending the house nor of leaving it, but of purging myself from those who are so, and recognizing those who call on the name of the Lord (own, and worship Him) out of a pure heart -- to walk with them.<a name=375:25></a>

		Some details remain, which we may notice, but now specially connected with ministry.<a name=375:26></a> I start from the holding fast the form of sound words and avoid jangling on profitless questions raised, holding to the truth itself; avoiding strife even in contending for the truth; shunning profane vain babblings -- they increase to more ungodliness.<a name=375:27></a> This was not the jangling on questions to no profit but error, as we see from the case given.<a name=375:28></a> They were to be shunned; nor are we to strive about words to no profit.<a name=375:29></a> All these shunnings and avoidings referred to keeping in the simplicity of the truth.<a name=375:30></a> From the corrupt profession, forms of piety, and ungodliness, we are to turn wholly away.<a name=375:31></a> The former were to be avoided, shunned (it was individual); the latter, left or turned away from.<a name=375:32></a>

		On the other hand, he was to be watchful and diligent to shew himself a workman approved unto God; a workman not needing to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth: it was to be rightly set out, dissected, and applied, as well as expounded according to the mind of God.<a name=376:1></a> Then he was to commit what he heard from Paul to faithful men -- not put men in office but commit truth to men, faithful men.<a name=376:2></a> Truth all through, and truth connected with unaffected and true godliness, is the leading thought of the apostle, and a suffering place in the world because of it, in contrast with an easy-going church.<a name=376:3></a> But all his directions are individual, not to fancy he could correct the body; he was to shun, avoid, turn away, etc.<a name=376:4></a>, and pursue godliness with them that really sought the Lord (not mere profession) out of a pure heart.<a name=376:5></a> The testimony and truth were to be held fast at all cost.<a name=376:6></a> We see how soon departure from the truth was the enemy's way of bringing in ungodliness and worldliness.<a name=376:7></a> Even when the form of godliness is spoken of, it is propagated amongst silly women never coming to the knowledge of the truth.<a name=376:8></a> This laid them open.<a name=376:9></a> Finally the Lord would be faithful -- could not deny Himself.<a name=376:10></a>

		I have another remark to make here.<a name=376:11></a> The promise of life in Christ Jesus is the very starting-point of the epistle -- what is livingly personal, not ecclesiastical.<a name=376:12></a> So the fulness of grace, as we have noticed (chapter 1: 9); but, all through, personal responsibility is dwelt on; and, hence, we are placed, not in presence of privileged hopes but of judgment, I mean even as Christians.<a name=376:13></a> For Onesiphorus mercy is desired in that day.<a name=376:14></a> Timothy is charged before God and the Lord Jesus, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom.<a name=376:15></a> So the crown is a crown of righteousness; men must strive lawfully, and, labouring first, partake of the fruits.<a name=376:16></a> The Lord, the righteous Judge, gives him the crown of righteousness; so, as to all others, it is laid up for those who love His appearing.<a name=376:17></a> But he had just spoken of His appearing as the time of judging.<a name=376:18></a> And so it is, first the quick, and afterwards the dead.<a name=376:19></a> How love it?<a name=376:20></a> Now this supposes, first, the most complete association with Him and acceptance, judgment being set aside for us.<a name=376:21></a>

		But more, loving His appearing supposes that its present realization awakens no feeling of anything which would have to be judged, which would hinder our loving that which will set aside evil.<a name=377:1></a> It is the time of glory for us.<a name=377:2></a> When He shall appear, then shall we appear with Him in glory.<a name=377:3></a> But then it is the setting aside evil; so that, if anything is allowed in us, anything not suited to His appearing, if we are not wholehearted in the setting up of His glory, we cannot practically love His appearing.<a name=377:4></a> This gives, in the midst of general decline, a solemn but a very blessed character to the instruction of the epistle; indeed it all supposes great personal nearness proportioned to the general decline.<a name=377:5></a>
