		FAMILIAR CONVERSATIONS ON ROMANISM -- EIGHTH CONVERSATION -- TRANSUBSTANTIATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:1></a> Good-evening all.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>

		<i>James</i>.<a name=1:3></a> Pray sit down, gentlemen.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:5></a> Well, we are here again to pursue our inquiry into the subject we had arrived at, and examine whether the doctrine of the Romish creed can be held to be the truth.<a name=1:6></a> I suppose we may at once enter on the point which it was understood we should speak of -- transubstantiation.<a name=1:7></a> Perhaps the best way, if our friends agree to it, would be to state from unquestionable Roman Catholic authorities, what the doctrine maintained by them is.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Mr.<a name=1:9></a> R</i>.<a name=1:10></a> We could not pursue a better method.<a name=1:11></a> We can then follow out the proofs and testimony on which it is based, though the plain words of Scripture are the strongest, and it seems to me, conclusive.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:13></a> Well, we cannot take better authority than the Council of Trent to begin with.<a name=1:14></a> "But since Christ our Redeemer said that that which He offered under the form of bread, was truly His body, it has therefore been ever the persuasion of the church, and this holy Synod now anew declares, that, by the consecration of [the] bread and wine, conversion of the whole substance into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord takes place, and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of His blood.<a name=1:15></a> Which conversion is conveniently and properly called, by the holy Catholic church, transubstantiation.<a name=1:16></a>" (Sess.<a name=1:17></a> 12, c.<a name=1:18></a> 4.<a name=1:19></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		That we may complete this account I may add the Canons 1 and 2 of the same Session 12.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CANON 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If any one shall have denied that in the sacrament of the most holy Eucharist are contained truly, really, and substantially, the body and blood together with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and consequently, a whole Christ; but shall have said that they only are in it as in a sign, or figure, or virtue, let him be anathema.<a name=1:21></a>"

		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CANON 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If any shall have said that in the very sacred sacrament of the Eucharist, the substance of the bread and wine remains together with the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and shall have denied that wonderful and singular conversion of the whole substance of bread into the body, and of the whole substance of wine into blood, the forms of bread and wine only remaining; which conversion indeed the Catholic church most aptly calls transubstantiation, let him be anathema.<a name=2:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CANON 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If any shall have denied that in the venerable sacrament of the Eucharist under each form, and under every part of each form, when separation is made, a whole Christ is contained, let him be anathema.<a name=2:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Canon 6 declares it is to be adored with divine worship.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Catechism of the Council of Trent, which explains and enlarges on it, is even more precise.<a name=2:4></a> (Part 2, c.<a name=2:5></a> 4, Sec.<a name=2:6></a> 33.<a name=2:7></a>) Not only the true body of Christ, and whatever belongs to the true body, as bones and nerves, but also a whole Christ is contained in the sacrament.<a name=2:8></a> It is then added, that, by the words of consecration, the bread becomes the body, and the wine the blood; but that, by concomitance the blood, soul and divinity will be with the body in the bread and so conversely of the wine (see 34).<a name=2:9></a> What I have now cited gives the doctrines to us on the highest authority, clearly enough.<a name=2:10></a> Any reasons of Bellarmine or others we can take up when needed.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=2:12></a> This is quite sufficient for us as a statement of it.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:14></a> Well, I affirm all this to be a delusion and a fallacy.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=2:16></a> That is strong language, Mr.<a name=2:17></a> N.<a name=2:18></a>; when so many Fathers and holy men have received and taught it, and when it is the common faith of the church in all ages.<a name=2:19></a> What you have to meet is the plain statement of Scripture, "This is my body" -- words so definite that your own Luther could not get over them.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:21></a> We will take the statements of Scripture up first then.<a name=2:22></a> That it was always the persuasion of the church I wholly deny.<a name=2:23></a> That superstition and very high-flown statements are found in the Fathers as to what we receive, I freely admit.<a name=2:24></a> But not only was it not the uniform persuasion of the church, but the best known and most esteemed Fathers taught expressly the contrary, and it was not authoritatively established as a dogma in the West, for centuries; and, though gradually dropped into as a general persuasion after John Damascene, never in the Greek church as a body.<a name=2:25></a> This we will examine; but before we turn to the Fathers, we will turn to the Scriptures themselves, "This is my body," and chapter 6 of John's Gospel.<a name=2:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me however to say that every Christian acknowledges the great and blessed privilege granted to us in the institution of the Lord's supper -- that feeding on Him, though not there only, is the very way of life to the soul.<a name=3:1></a> Nor is there anything more touching, than that He, the blessed Saviour, should care that we should remember Him, and should even desire with desire to eat the last Paschal supper with His disciples before He suffered.<a name=3:2></a> This is not the question; but whether the bread and wine are physically changed into the body and blood of Christ, so that there is no bread and wine there at all; but that Christ, a whole Christ, and that expressed in a profane way, His bones and nerves, alone is there.<a name=3:3></a> They admit that it is called bread after consecration, and seek to account for it, saying it is so called, because it has the appearance of it; as when Abraham saw the three men who really were angels.<a name=3:4></a> And that it still retains the quality natural to bread, that of supporting and nourishing the body.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=3:6></a> But where do you find that admitted?<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:8></a> In Part 2, Section 40 of the catechism of the Council of Trent.<a name=3:9></a> The difficulty really is of answering what has no solid ground at all.<a name=3:10></a> They admit that "the exposition of this mystery is most difficult.<a name=3:11></a>" At any rate, it is such that "the whole substance of the bread is changed by the power of God into the whole substance of the body of Christ, and the whole substance of the wine into the whole substance of the blood of Christ, without any change in our Lord" (41).<a name=3:12></a> Before we examine the positive statement of Scripture, which really presents no difficulty whatever, there are some difficulties on the Roman Catholic view of it, I should like to present to you.<a name=3:13></a> The pouring out the wine into the cup, is, you say, a kind of figure of Christ's shedding His blood.<a name=3:14></a> In Sec.<a name=3:15></a> 76 on the Eucharist too, the catechism of the Council of Trent declares that it is the same sacrifice with that of the cross.<a name=3:16></a> At any rate the essence of the doctrine we are treating is that the blood of Christ is really there, the wine being changed into it in the cup, and by concomitance the body, which is under the form of bread, also.<a name=3:17></a> First, it is inconsistent (and grossly so) to say it is in His body, and shed out of His body too; I have already remarked that if it is in the body, not shed, there is no redemption.<a name=3:18></a> Satan has mocked you with a sacrifice of non-redemption.<a name=3:19></a> But I go further: Did not Christ shed his blood on the cross for us?<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=4:1></a> Surely, it was a bloody sacrifice.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:3></a> And now He is entered into glory, though, thank God, and wondrous truth it is, still a man, and there according to the efficacy and power of His precious blood.<a name=4:4></a> But He is not there in His body and unshed blood in the state in which He lived on earth.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=4:6></a> No; He has a spiritual and glorious body and dieth no more.<a name=4:7></a> His blood has been shed, and if we speak of His entering in, not without blood, it is as shed upon the cross.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:9></a> But then, how can we have the body, blood, soul and divinity all in one true present person?<a name=4:10></a> By the cup it celebrates His blood being shed.<a name=4:11></a> It is the very basis of our hopes.<a name=4:12></a> There is then no such whole living Christ, as the One into whom you profess to change the bread, and indeed the wine by concomitance too.<a name=4:13></a> As to the cup, it is a contradiction, for it is there professedly as shed, to shew it is, and yet it is in the body all the time.<a name=4:14></a> But there is no such Christ now, as a Christ living in flesh and unshed blood: He is glorified in heaven.<a name=4:15></a> The Eucharist or Mass is the same sacrifice as that of the cross: that of course (sacramentally if you please) includes shedding of blood of a Christ who.<a name=4:16></a> first offers Himself alive to God down here: and such you make the bread by consecration.<a name=4:17></a> But there is no such Christ; I do not mean merely that you do not put Christ to death now, but there is no Christ now who is such as could die, and shed His blood.<a name=4:18></a> He is actually, livingly, in a state in which He cannot be offered in sacrifice.<a name=4:19></a> The Christ which is now, though the same blessed Person, as to His state cannot be a Christ on the cross, nor the same sacrifice offered, nor a Christ living in flesh and blood on the earth, capable of being sacramentally or otherwise, so offered.<a name=4:20></a> A glorified Christ cannot be a Christ living on earth capable of dying, nor a Christ offered as a victim of propitiation by bloodshedding.<a name=4:21></a> You cannot in truth, life, or reality bring <i>Him</i> back into this condition in any sense.<a name=4:22></a> He is not now a Christ who can be sacrificed.<a name=4:23></a> If you transubstantiate the bread into the Christ that is now, He cannot be a sacrifice, nor one shedding blood, nor flesh and blood as He was: hence not the same sacrifice.<a name=4:24></a> You cannot either make Him again what He was on the cross.<a name=4:25></a> No such Christ can or ever will, exist.<a name=4:26></a>

		Is He in the Mass an existing Christ, glorified?<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=5:2></a> No; we hold it is sacramentally His body broken, and blood shed, the sacrifice of the Mass.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=5:4></a> Then it is no true Christ.<a name=5:5></a> There is none such now.<a name=5:6></a> Can He be now truly, really, and substantially the dying Christ on the cross?<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=5:8></a> Well, Christ is now in glory, He cannot die, or be as He was on the cross.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=5:10></a> Then you have no Christ in the Eucharist; not a glorified one, for it is His death and blood-shedding which is there set before us, as we all know.<a name=5:11></a> Not a dying one on the cross, or the blood yet unshed in the body, for there is no such Christ now.<a name=5:12></a> Transubstantiation is a wicked fable, as Mr.<a name=5:13></a> D.<a name=5:14></a> once owned it.<a name=5:15></a> It is neither a glorified, nor a dying Christ, truly really and substantially.<a name=5:16></a> It is no Christ at all.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=5:18></a> Well, Mr.<a name=5:19></a> R.<a name=5:20></a>, which do you think it is?<a name=5:21></a> for I do not think it can be Christ as He is now in glory, if we think of the cross, because He is not there now; nor such as He was then, and surely it is not a Christ glorified that we have set before us in the Mass, but the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=5:22></a> But that cannot be now.<a name=5:23></a> I do understand doing it in remembrance, but I cannot see how it can be a glorified Christ, if it be a sacrifice, nor how a Christ as He was on the cross can be really and truly there, for there is none such now.<a name=5:24></a> I begin to see into it more clearly than I did.<a name=5:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=5:26></a> You have lost a glorified Christ, for He cannot be in any sense a sacrifice again, and a crucified one you cannot have, for there is none such now; and in fact you have lost both.<a name=5:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>D</i>.<a name=5:28></a> But what then is taught and given to us there?<a name=5:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=5:30></a> I have all Christ's institution, and a most blessed one too.<a name=5:31></a> That which we do, as He told us to do in remembrance of Him, and find grace and refreshment, comfort and sanctifying power from Himself in doing it, to say nothing of the deep thanksgiving and deeper affections it awakens in us.<a name=5:32></a> I hold it to be as to institutions, the highest privilege.<a name=5:33></a> That is not the question, but this conversion of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, His soul and divinity being there, and as I quoted, and the catechism of the Council of Trent says, His bones and nerves.<a name=5:34></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>D</i>.<a name=6:1></a> But all the holy Fathers teach it.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=6:3></a> I am not concerned in what they teach, but they do nothing of the kind.<a name=6:4></a> I do not justify what they say, for the grossest superstition and immorality and heresy is found in them, but they do not teach that.<a name=6:5></a> The very doctrine of substance and accidents is scholastic Aristotelism.<a name=6:6></a> The system of seven sacraments is from Lombard.<a name=6:7></a> In the tenth century it was largely discussed, the greatest doctors denying it, and was never settled as a church dogma till 1215, by the same Pope and council that established the Inquisition, at the time the papacy was in its highest pitch of power, in fact governed the world, and all was in a state of infamous corruption, as we have seen.<a name=6:8></a> There is another thing which curiously points out how, when the Canon of the Mass was framed, I suppose substantially in the seventh century, there was no such thought.<a name=6:9></a> In consecrating the cup, following, I apprehend, the Vulgate, it reads in reciting Christ's words at the institution, "which <i>shall be</i> poured out.<a name=6:10></a>" That is, it makes Christ not institute a sacrifice or offer Himself at the institution of the Eucharist, but declare that He was going to be sacrificed and His blood shed on the cross.<a name=6:11></a> Strange to say, the Canon of the Mass is a positive denial of the pretended sacrifice in the Eucharist.<a name=6:12></a> Christ speaks of it as a thing to take place afterwards, not as anything then accomplished in any sense.<a name=6:13></a> It is 'effundetur,' not 'effunditur.<a name=6:14></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>D</i>.<a name=6:15></a> But in the Greek it is not so, it is to <i>ekchunomenon</i>.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=6:17></a> That merely gives it its character, for it certainly in fact was not poured out yet, and confirms really the general idea.<a name=6:18></a> It is the poured out blood which is represented there, and as we have said no such Christ (that is Christ in such state as dead upon the cross, his blood poured out), exists now, while the true spiritual commemoration of it is most precious.<a name=6:19></a> But it is not the question, what is in the Greek.<a name=6:20></a> First, the Vulgate is the authentic Bible of the Roman Catholics, not the Greek; and secondly, I am not yet inquiring what the truth of the institution is in itself, but shewing that the very Canon of the Mass treats it as no actual offering, but representing what was yet to be accomplished, saying not, "my blood poured out"; but "my blood which shall be poured out.<a name=6:21></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=7:1></a> It is curious it should be so put, and the fact is unquestionable.<a name=7:2></a> The fact too that the living glorified Christ cannot be sacrificed, and that if it be now a real living true Christ, it must be a glorified One, perplexes me, but I fear reasoning about it.<a name=7:3></a> The blessings and benefits of it are more pressed upon us than its nature.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=7:5></a> I understand that.<a name=7:6></a> The pastor is directed in the catechism of the Council of Trent so to do, except with more mature members of his church.<a name=7:7></a> Nor would I deny that in receiving, however false the whole thing is, pious souls may think for themselves of the true sacrifice of Christ upon the cross, though not with intelligence.<a name=7:8></a> But if the service itself is false, it is a very serious thing.<a name=7:9></a> Your worship is all false, though it may be ignorantly so.<a name=7:10></a> If you have a true Christ, body, soul, and divinity there, the only true One is in glory, and cannot be a sacrifice at all: He cannot now in thought or sacramentally be a sacrifice.<a name=7:11></a> If it is what was on the cross, there is no such Christ in existence.<a name=7:12></a> And remember I am not now reasoning against the sacrifice of the Mass of which we have spoken; but you cannot convert the bread and wine into a true, real living Christ as now in this world and crucified when none such exists, nor into a dead one, for there is none such now.<a name=7:13></a> If into a glorious One, He is not in a condition to be a sacrifice.<a name=7:14></a> A commemoration of it, done in remembrance of Him, shewing forth His death till He come, that we can all understand, and wonderful grace too, that the Lord can care for such poor creatures remembering Him.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=7:16></a> It is so indeed, wonderful grace.<a name=7:17></a> It seems all plain to me.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=7:19></a> I see it cannot be a real living Christ there, and it is hard to think that the priest should make Christ out of a piece of bread; but the passage, "This is my body," what do you make, sir, of that?<a name=7:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>D</i>.<a name=7:21></a> I was just going to ask the same question, and there are other passages as "the communion of the body of Christ," and John 6; the unworthy eaters being guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<a name=7:22></a> And why should we cast a doubt on the omnipotency of God?<a name=7:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=7:24></a> It is not a question of God's omnipotency, which, in the true sense of it, no Christian denies.<a name=7:25></a> But God has revealed His ways of dealing and acts in grace and truth according to those ways.<a name=7:26></a> Thus, working by the Lord Himself or by His followers to confirm the blessed word of His grace, He gave miracles, sensible signs, works of power which all men could see and multitudes did see, so as to accredit those who announced the truth.<a name=7:27></a> The miracle was a plain proof of the senses to confirm the testimony.<a name=7:28></a> But here the alleged miracle, which is not the revelation of any new truth, is the thing we are called upon to believe; not only with no testimony to it, but with the fullest testimony against it in every possible way, to sight, taste, touch and smell, and even, as is admitted, nourishing powers, it is and remains bread and wine, can be eaten by an animal, decay, become corrupt, nay, we learn from Corinthians could make people drunk, in a word in every way contradicts the alleged miracle, the very idea of which is founded on a heathen philosophical system of substance and accidents adopted by the schoolmen in the middle ages, never dreamt of in the early church, and a chimera without any real foundation, a mere philosophical thing without proof.<a name=7:29></a> Some hidden essence clothed in various appearances, which essence was the substance of bread, while all we can see, taste, or feel, are accidents; the substance becomes, they say, Christ, and these accidents remain.<a name=7:30></a> Nor is Christ brought down from above, for then, they say, there would be a change of place<a href="#7:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> (Cat.<a name=7:31></a> Council of Trent, Euch.<a name=7:32></a> Part 2, 37 and 44), and space would be in question which, though they speak of a true body, bones and nerves, is not they admit, tenable.<a name=7:33></a> It is a creation of Christ<a href="#7:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> there taking the place of what was bread in this philosophical idea of abstract substance.<a name=7:34></a> And if Christ does not change His place and come there it must be a creation of His soul too or changing, if they prefer it, the bread into His soul.<a name=7:35></a> And is it then the same soul?<a name=7:36></a> If it be His soul as in glory, He does not change His place; if not, is it another?<a name=7:37></a> Is it His soul, if He has not changed His place?<a name=7:38></a> I am called upon, not to believe a divine truth helped by the confirmation of visible works of power addressed to my senses, but a contradiction and a philosophical fancy in admitted contradiction to the evidence of my senses.<a name=7:39></a> This is not what Scripture calls a miracle.<a name=7:40></a> What is the truth I learn there?<a name=7:41></a> Christ's sacrifice is a truth already revealed, only with a declaration that it cannot be repeated.<a name=7:42></a> There is no revelation of any truth in transubstantiation, and no proof of it; but every proof which God does use in miracles contradicting it.<a name=7:43></a> And the thing itself, a repetition of Christ's sacrifice forbidden to the believer by the word of God.<a name=7:44></a> It is the contrary to a miracle, and a mere fable.<a name=7:45></a> Your appeal to the omnipotence of God, which no one denies -- though what is contrary to truth, to what He has revealed, to Himself, He cannot do -- is only throwing dust in peoples' eyes, the wiles of the enemy.<a name=7:46></a> The question is what has He done, not what He can do, of which indeed we are no judges, morally speaking.<a name=7:47></a> For I repeat He can do nothing inconsistent with Himself or His wisdom.<a name=7:48></a> God, it is said, who cannot lie: and of His wisdom we are no competent judges, knowing it only as it is revealed in Christ.<a name=7:49></a> Further we know divine truth only as it is revealed.<a name=7:50></a> The question is: Has He revealed that in the Lord's supper He has, and that the priests can turn bread into the body, blood, and soul, and divinity of Christ, as our poor Irish friends say, "make God"?<a name=7:51></a> It is really a monstrous supposition, without any truth revealed in it, or any testimony to it.<a name=7:52></a> But we will examine what Scripture says.<a name=7:53></a> All the direct testimony for it is: "This is my body," and "This is my blood" of the New Testament, "which is," or as you say "which shall be shed for you and for many.<a name=7:54></a>" Now in ordinary language, nobody would dream of such a use of the words as would make it a change of the bread into the body.<a name=7:55></a> Supposing there were two pictures, and I were to say, "That is my mother, and that her sister," who would dream that the pictures were transubstantiated into my mother and aunt?<a name=7:56></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=30:7></a> The apostle Paul has at any rate settled it.<a name=30:8></a> In speaking of the communion of the body of Christ (that is, as the passage makes evident, our spiritual identification with Christ as the Gentiles were identified with their idols in partaking of the idol sacrifices, and the Jewish priests with the altar of Jehovah by eating of the sacrifices offered there), he declares what we break to be bread.<a name=30:9></a> Where this communion, that is, takes place, it is still bread.<a name=30:10></a> And so little does he attach the thought of any substantial change to it, that he is content to say, "The cup which we drink.<a name=30:11></a>" He saw the broad plain fact which all saw and acted in before him.<a name=30:12></a> It was bread He broke, and a cup they drank of.<a name=30:13></a> The spiritual sense was communion with the body and blood of Christ, association with it, and if so they could not be associated with demons too.<a name=30:14></a> But remark further, it is "Christ crucified" which is in question.<a name=30:15></a> He is viewed in the Eucharist not as sitting, true as that may be, thank God at the right hand of God; but as often as we eat that bread and drink that cup, we shew forth the Lord's death till He come.<a name=30:16></a> What we eat is bread, and what we drink is the cup, the plain, sensible, evident fact; but what we set forth and declare in it, is Christ's death -- His body given for us, His blood shed for us; we do it <i>in remembrance</i> of Him.<a name=30:17></a> There is no such Christ to be changed into.<a name=30:18></a> There is now no dead Christ, no shed blood substantially to be found.<a name=30:19></a> And this is no mere playing with words, it is the essence of the rite, what we shew forth.<a name=30:20></a> It is His blood as shed that is set forth, and His death.<a name=30:21></a> It is Christ's dying that is the meaning of the rite, and that must be remembrance.<a name=30:22></a> He cannot die now.<a name=30:23></a> Hence, as so presented in John 6, it comes after His coming down from heaven, and before His ascending up where He was before, as of course His death necessarily did.<a name=30:24></a> For in John His death itself, not the memorial of it, is spoken of.<a name=30:25></a> But it cannot be in remembrance of a present living Christ in heaven.<a name=30:26></a> It is in remembrance of Him once humbled and dying, a state passed and gone for ever.<a name=30:27></a> Further He could give no such Christ at the last supper: His blood was not then poured out.<a name=30:28></a> The state spoken of, He was not in.<a name=30:29></a> He could not say, "This is my blood of the new covenant which is shed for many," as a present substantial real thing; there was none such.<a name=30:30></a> Giving it to be observed as a memorial of its shedding on the cross, that we can all understand; but He could not hold His own shed blood in His hand, for it was yet in His body.<a name=30:31></a> A figure of what would be is plain enough Hence, as we have seen, your Vulgate says, "which shall be poured out," acknowledging it was not so then.<a name=30:32></a> The truth is the word <i>(ekchunomenon)</i> does not say "had been" or "would be," but gives it that character; it was shed blood which was of any avail; that must be drunk, or there was no life, without that shedding there was no remission.<a name=30:33></a> When the Lord said, "Take eat," He had not yet consecrated it by the words said to do so by the Roman Catholic doctrine.<a name=30:34></a> As has long ago been urged, when He took and brake it, and said this, it was the bread He had taken in His hand.<a name=30:35></a> It was the bread which He took and brake they were to eat as such, as His body, but not a word of being changed into it, and do it in remembrance of Him who was gone, and to eat it in remembrance of that which, though the one foundation of every blessing, was a passing thing in His history; His death and blood-shedding could not be an abiding present thing.<a name=30:36></a> And this embarrasses their doctors.<a name=30:37></a> They say (Bellarm.<a name=30:38></a> 4, 22, 17) that the priest's drinking of the cup<a href="#30:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is more for the sacrifice than the sacrament (a distinction unknown of old to Christendom), as the people get the blood in the body all the same, but that the shedding of blood is thus set forth.<a name=30:39></a> But then the priest takes it as shed, the people as in the body.<a name=30:40></a> And if the priest in eating the bread have taken it as in the body, it is before the shedding of the blood, and there is no sacrifice, no redemption, no remission: and according to Bellarmine, it is the priest's eating it which is his putting Him to death, a sad office to perform, so that he has taken Him to feed on Him before there was any sacrifice, and yet the consecration had taken place which turned it into His body.<a name=30:41></a> But such irreverent confusion is the necessary consequence where so holy and blessed a memorial of Christ's death is turned into a profane materialism; and yet after all, taken in sufficient quantity, it nourishes the body, yet there is no substance of bread at all: the accidents do it.<a name=30:42></a>

		The note of the Rhemish translation of Matthew 26 also distinguishes the sacrifice and the sacrament, that the sacrament by concomitancy is the whole body, blood, soul, and divinity of the Lord, but that for the sacrifice it is the bread changed specifically into the body, and the wine into the blood -- that being the condition of Christ in making the sacrifice,, so that His body is apart for the sacrifice and His blood apart, but all together in the sacrament.<a name=31:1></a> But Paul knows no such difference: the bread which we break is the communion of His body, and the cup which we bless, the communion of His blood, so that the distinction made in the alleged sacrificial part is yet by Paul declared to be the communion, and on the other hand, as often as we eat that bread and drink that cup, which is the alleged sacramental part, he says, we do shew forth the Lord's death till He come; but in His death it is admitted that the blood was separated from the body, shed for us, so that the attempt to make this difference to meet the evident testimony to death and the shedding of Christ's blood in the sacrament -- for it was shed blood they were to drink -- only brings in increased confusion.<a name=31:2></a> The use of "is" for "represents" is too common to dwell upon.<a name=31:3></a> That rock "was" Christ.<a name=31:4></a> The seven kine "are" seven years, the seven ears of corn "are" seven years.<a name=31:5></a> So we do constantly; I shew a picture and say, "That is my mother," and so on.<a name=31:6></a>

		Cyril of Jerusalem uses language as strong in appearance as may be, but not that the substance is changed, but that faith sees the body there, and he really uses language which shews he never thought of such a change.<a name=43:1></a> Thus in the very place where he uses the strongest language, he says (Cat.<a name=43:2></a> 22, Myst.<a name=43:3></a> 4), "Do not regard <i>(proseche)</i> the bread and the wine as merely such <i>(psilois)</i>, for they are the body and blood of Christ according to the Lord's declaration.<a name=43:4></a>" They were still bread and wine, but to be received as the body and blood of Christ by faith, and citing Psalm 23 (22), interpreting it as a mystical table, apprehended by the understanding <i>(noeten).<a name=43:5></a> I</i> quote this the rather because it shews how the passages which speak of Christ's flesh and blood do not contemplate any change of the substance; faith receives it; it is <i>noeta</i>, received by the mind.<a name=43:6></a> As bread suits the body, so the word the soul.<a name=43:7></a> So in 3, "For in the figure (tupo) of bread, His body is given to you, and in the figure of wine, His blood.<a name=43:8></a>" They are the <i>tupoi</i>, figures, of the body and blood.<a name=43:9></a> So Gregory Nyssen: (oratio octava) in his praise of Gorgon calls them the antitypes <i>(antitupa)</i> of the precious body and blood.<a name=43:10></a> There is one passage of Gregory Nazianzen which I must read before I turn to the Latins, shewing how Christendom had sunk into Judaism, but shewing most clearly the vagueness of their thoughts.<a name=43:11></a> I am almost ashamed to go through the quantity of passages I collected on the subject, but I do not myself attach the smallest authority to the uncertain and superstitious thoughts of the Fathers; but for you, or at least to clear your mind from the notion that it was a settled doctrine of faith, corrupt and superstitious as Christendom had become, I go through them.<a name=43:12></a>

and further that when they spoke of what appeared, they had no idea of a form and a totally distinct substance behind.<a name=44:23></a> There was nothing changed in body or in form.<a name=44:24></a> Chrysostom, if we are allowed to count his letter to Caesarius as genuine, is quite clear on the point.<a name=44:25></a> He says, reasoning against Apollinarius, "For as before the bread is sanctified we call it bread, but divine grace sanctifying it by means of the priest, it is freed from the appellation of bread, but it is held to be worthy of the appellation of the Lord's body, although the nature of bread remains in it, and we announce it not as two bodies, but as one.<a name=44:26></a>" Now if this be not Chrysostom's it is quoted as such by John Damascene, Anastasius and the Fathers; it is an early writing of nearly the same age (the Jesuit Hardouin holds it is Chrysostom's), and plainly shews that the positive doctrine of the bread's remaining bread caused no scandal then.<a name=44:27></a> But Chrysostom himself at any rate, (and where pressing, as he is famous for doing, the importance of this ordinance) speaks of it as distinct from other <i>food</i>.<a name=44:28></a> "Do not look at it as bread, nor think of it as wine, for it does not as other food go into the draught.<a name=44:29></a> But as wax put to the fire does not lose any part nor leave anything superfluous, so also here reckon the mysteries to be consumed by the substance of the body" (De Poen.<a name=44:30></a> Hom 9, 2, 350).<a name=44:31></a> This is transubstantiating into us.<a name=44:32></a> How little his mind is occupied with literal transubstantiation is evident from the way he repeats word for word in the second discourse on the betrayal by Judas what he says in the first, save the last words.<a name=44:33></a> In the first (2, 3 and 4), after saying the words "This is my body" made it the body of Christ, etc.<a name=44:34></a>, he compares it to "Be fruitful and multiply," which was efficient through succeeding generations; so these.<a name=44:35></a> And in the first discourse, he concludes by "Make it a perfect sacrifice"; in the second, "will ever increase with grace those worthily partaking of it.<a name=44:36></a>" The wicked who partake increase their condemnation.<a name=44:37></a> But there is no thought of its being Christ Himself at any rate.<a name=44:38></a> The Homily on "Nolo vos ignorare" implies equally that it is spiritually Christ's blood, not literally.<a name=44:39></a> Now in Chrysostom we have the Eucharist spoken of rhetorically beyond all the Fathers, and receiving Christ's body and blood; but I find no trace of his not considering it as in fact bread and wine.<a name=44:40></a> "We are not to consider it such: they who receive worthily receive Christ.<a name=44:41></a>" On its being His body, he is plain enough, and saints receiving it; but he does not seem to have thought of transubstantiation in the modern sense.<a name=44:42></a> He speaks of the bread and the cup, and indeed when coming to the table to be looking up like an eagle to the sun, to Christ, and there applying "where the carcase is the eagles will be"; but all is such rhetoric that as doctrine it proves little.<a name=44:43></a> This is Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians.<a name=44:44></a> Were we to take the imperfect work on Matthew as Chrysostom's, the denial of transubstantiation would be as clear and strong as possible.<a name=44:45></a> "In these sanctified vessels, in which the true body of Christ is not contained but the mystery of his body" (Chrys.<a name=44:46></a> Opera, ed.<a name=44:47></a> B.<a name=44:48></a>, 6, 63, Appendix).<a name=44:49></a><a href="#44:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

		But we may now turn to plainer statements than the rhetoric of the golden-mouthed, Theodoret in his Dialogues, Dialogue 1 (vol.<a name=47:1></a> 4, Paris, 1642).<a name=47:2></a> He had been saying that the Saviour changes the names (giving the name of the thing to the symbol, and of the symbol to the thing, calling Himself a vine), and attributes the name of blood to the symbol.<a name=47:3></a> Eranistes asks why?<a name=47:4></a> He answers: "The purport is obvious to those who are initiated into the divine mysteries.<a name=47:5></a> He desired that those who participate in the divine mysteries should give heed to the nature of those things which are seen; but, by the change of names, have faith in the change which is made by grace.<a name=47:6></a> For He who called His body natural wheat and bread, and again called Himself a vine, honoured the visible symbols with the appellation of body and blood, not changing the nature, but adding grace to nature.<a name=47:7></a>" So what follows: "Of what thinkest thou that all-holy food to be the symbol and figure?<a name=47:8></a> The divinity of Christ the Lord, or of His body and blood?<a name=47:9></a>" This leaves no obscurity as to his thoughts; and "symbol" is the word we have seen Chrysostom use, who with Theodore of Mopsuestia were his theological masters.<a name=47:10></a>

		The truth is, one reading the Fathers cannot but see that, however rhetorical they may be about it, the thought of transubstantiation could not have been in their minds.<a name=48:1></a> I do not refer now to positive statements already quoted, but to collateral statements.<a name=48:2></a> Thus Cyprian writing against those who would have only water, says, If wine were not there, there was no figure of the blood; that the wine was the figure of the blood and the water of the Christian people.<a name=48:3></a> Who would think of transubstantiation here?<a name=48:4></a> So Augustine, It is said the rock was Christ; and insists that it is not said the rock signified Christ, but was Christ (Contra Adamantium 12, 5, and in sec.<a name=48:5></a> 3).<a name=48:6></a> So the Lord did not hesitate to say, in giving the sign of His body to His disciples, This is my body.<a name=48:7></a> And again (Er.<a name=48:8></a> in Psalm 3: 1), when the great and admirable patience of our Lord received [Judas] to the feast in which He commended and delivered to His disciples the figure of His body and blood.<a name=48:9></a> But were I to cite all Augustine says on the subject I should not soon close.<a name=48:10></a> It is a point he insists on continually, so that Cardinal Du Perron had to write a book (Refutatio, etc.<a name=48:11></a>, Paris, 1624) to explain away what he says.<a name=48:12></a> On Conc.<a name=48:13></a> Ad.<a name=48:14></a> 12, 3 he says, you must introduce "according to you," that is, the Manicheans, which is really only a confession of the force of the passage.<a name=48:15></a> Tertullian, Cyril, Gaudentius, and others constantly declare a figure is not the truth, but the imitation of the truth.<a name=48:16></a>

		I go on to Eusebius in his Demonstratio Evangelica from whom Procopius draws it (lib.<a name=52:14></a> 1, 10, Paris, 1628, page 37).<a name=52:15></a> After speaking of Christ's sacrifice supplanting all the Jewish figures of it, he says: "We who believe in him are free from the curse of Moses and justly since they daily celebrate the remembrance <i>lupomnesin]</i> of his body, and of his blood"; and (38) "Christ having offered for us all an offering <i>[thuma]</i> and sacrifice as slain <i>[sphagion]</i> and given to us a memorial, for (or instead of) a sacrifice <i>[anti thusias]</i> to offer continually to God.<a name=52:16></a>" The <i>sphagion</i>, the actual sacrifice, Christ had offered to His Father <i>(anenegke</i>, a sacrificial term for offering up on the altar); but He delivered there to us also a memorial to be continually presented to God <i>(prospherein</i> the bringing up as such), in place of, to serve instead of, a sacrifice.<a name=52:17></a> And again (page 39), saying how according to Psalm 45 Christ had offered Himself a sacrifice to God in place of the old Jewish sacrifices: "As therefore we have received to celebrate the memorial of this sacrifice on a table by symbols both of His body and His blood, according to the rites of the new covenant,"and then he goes on to cite Psalm 23, as a table spread in the presence of their enemies, etc.<a name=52:18></a> Now he speaks of unbloody and intelligent offerings, but they are for men only symbols and memorials.<a name=52:19></a> So in book 8 at the very end of the very first part <i>(apo tes geneseos)</i> after the preface (page 380) he says, commenting partly on the blessing of Judah, which the Fathers are very fond of, and partly on the prophecy of Zechariah: "For by the wine which is the symbol of His blood, those who are baptised to His death and believe in His blood, are purged from their old evils.<a name=52:20></a>" And after speaking of it as mystic food, and quoting the Lord's words, he adds: "for again He delivered to His own disciples the symbols of the divine dispensation to make it the image of His own body <i>[ten eikona tou idiou somatos]</i>.<a name=52:21></a>" They were no longer to use bloody sacrifices, nor slain offerings <i>[sphagia]</i> of divers animals as under Moses; but He "taught them to use bread [as] a symbol of His own body" (Eusebius, Dem.<a name=52:22></a> Ev.<a name=52:23></a>).<a name=52:24></a> I have gone a little backwards in date, for Eusebius was in Constantine's time, early in the fourth century; but this does not weaken his testimony, which is plain enough.<a name=52:25></a>

		Now Cyril teaches it is a propitiatory sacrifice, and good for souls dead in their sins or without any, and refers to intercession of saints, but I do not think that he had the thought that there was no bread and wine there.<a name=59:3></a> He uses the word <i>tupos</i> (Cat.<a name=59:4></a> 13, 19, as do the other Fathers constantly, for the figure, as did the Latins typus.<a name=59:5></a> This is used by Theodoret as equivalent to symbol, and <i>antitupos</i>, the word used in the Hebrews for the tabernacle compared with heaven.<a name=59:6></a> Procopius uses it as identical with image or effigy, on Genesis 49: 12.<a name=59:7></a> So that far as Cyril went in the system of superstition, it is (I think) plain he did not believe in any real change of substance.<a name=59:8></a> The strongest term he uses is <i>metabebletai</i>, cap.<a name=59:9></a> 23, Myst.<a name=59:10></a> 5, 7; the Holy Spirit sanctifies and changes all it touches, but it is clear that this cannot be said of everything.<a name=59:11></a> W as Christ changed, transubstantiated, when the Holy Ghost came upon Him?<a name=59:12></a> or the hundred and twenty on the day of Pentecost?<a name=59:13></a> A change took place, but there was no transubstantiation, and this is so clearly the case that he uses the same language in Cat.<a name=59:14></a> 21, Myst.<a name=59:15></a> 3, as to the anointing: it is not mere <i>(psilon)</i> oil, but efficient for communicating the Spirit, comparing it in terms with the Eucharist.<a name=59:16></a> "For as the bread of the Eucharist after the invocation of the Holy Ghost is not mere bread, but the body of Christ, so this holy ointment is no longer mere [ointment] but the charisma of Christ made effectual by the presence of His divinity, and is symbolically applied to thy forehead and other senses.<a name=59:17></a> And while the body is anointed with visible ointment, the soul is sanctified with the holy and vivifying Spirit.<a name=59:18></a>" (Compare 23, 7, and the language of 22, Myst.<a name=59:19></a> 4, 6.<a name=59:20></a>) He calls it <i>tupon</i> of bread (Cat.<a name=59:21></a> 13).<a name=59:22></a> If you desire to see the uncertainty and absurdity of the Father's interpretation, read this Cat.<a name=59:23></a> 13, 21.<a name=59:24></a> The idea of transubstantiation was foreign to Cyril; but what his language shews is that, with these Fathers, those who use the strongest do not mean transubstantiation thereby as now held at Rome.<a name=59:25></a>

		In his sermon on the supper of the Lord which is much more one on indwelling sin, he says, however, "A sacrament is called a sacred sign or sacred secret.<a name=62:1></a> Many things indeed are for themselves alone, others to designate other things, and they are called signs.<a name=62:2></a> That we may take an example from common things, a ring is given, absolutely a ring, and has no signification; it is given as the investiture of some inheritance and it is a sign so that he who receives it can say, The ring is nothing worth, but the inheritance which I seek.<a name=62:3></a> In this manner therefore, the Lord, drawing near His passion, took care in His grace to give investiture to His own, that invisible grace might be afforded [praestaretur] by a certain visible sign.<a name=62:4></a> To this purpose all the sacraments were instituted.<a name=62:5></a>" Then he goes through these; the partaking of the Eucharist, washing the feet, and baptism.<a name=62:6></a> He had said these would be enough for them.<a name=62:7></a> He was the last of the Fathers so-called, and was after Berengarius as to whom the question had been very rudely agitated.<a name=62:8></a> Aucalaurius, deacon of Metz, in the ninth century, says (De Euch.<a name=62:9></a> Off.<a name=62:10></a> 1, 29), "For sacraments are somewhat to resemble these things whereof they are sacraments .<a name=62:11></a>.<a name=62:12></a>.<a name=62:13></a> the sacrament of the body of Christ is in some manner the body of Christ.<a name=62:14></a> For sacraments should not be sacraments if in some things they had not the likeness of that whereof they are sacraments.<a name=62:15></a> Now by reason of this mutual likeness they oftentimes are called by what they represent," 3, 24.<a name=62:16></a> Yet he also uses language which is tantamount to transubstantiation, so uncertain were these men.<a name=62:17></a>

If we acknowledge therein ghostlye might, then understand we that life is therein, and that it giveth immortalitie to them that eate it with faith.

Much is between the body Christ suffered in, and the body that is hallowed to housell. The body that he suffered in was borne of the flesh of Mary with blood and with bone, with skinne and with synowes in human limmes, with a reasonable soul living. And his ghoslye body which we call the housell is gathered of many cornes, without bloude and bone, without lymme, without soule and there fore nothing is to be understood therein bodily, but all is ghostlye to be understood." I might add much more: one sentence may suffice. "Thys mysterye is a pledge and a figure, Christ's bodye is truth itself ... . And He (the Saviour) bad them not eate that bodye which He was going about with, nor that blood to drink which He shed for us, but He meant with those words that holy housell which ghostly is His body and Hys bloude."

		The progress of superstition is seen indeed in John Damascene, he refers, as we have often seen in the Fathers, to the oil of the chrism and the water in baptism,<a href="#70:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> to which divine grace was added by means of the invocation of the Holy Ghost, which was, and in the Greek church is still, what consecrates the elements.<a name=70:1></a> These are only set apart by the words, This is my body, as a preparatory service in what is called the prothesis, and then carried in procession to be consecrated on the altar.<a name=70:2></a> But the language of John Damascene does shew the progress of superstition, for the strongest part of his statement is, as the editor annotator of his works, Lequien, a Roman Catholic of the order of preachers (Paris, 1712) remarks, and as is easily seen, is taken from the letter to Caesarius attributed to Chrysostom, and of that epoch, though not probably his.<a name=70:3></a> Now this says, "Divine grace sanctifying it [the bread] by means of the priest, it is indeed freed from the appellation of bread, but is esteemed worthy of the appellation of the Lord's body even though the nature of bread has remained in it, and it is called not two bodies, but one body of the Son," whereas in Damascene we have, "By the invocation and coming of the Holy Spirit they are supernaturally transformed <i>(uperphos metapeiountai)</i> into the body of Christ and the blood, and they are not two, but one and the same thing.<a name=70:4></a>" This, "although the nature of bread remains in it" has passed away, but so had some 400 years time.<a name=70:5></a> A century later Paschasius Radbert first publicly introduced it in the West as we have seen.<a name=70:6></a> But Damascene's views were not then publicly adopted.<a name=70:7></a> Some six years before his death, the Council of Constantinople (754) called as general, but not received in the West, nor in the East beyond the Emperor's rule, declared the elements in the Lord's supper to be the only image of Christ.<a name=70:8></a><a href="#70:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> Still; though never dogmatically established, the superstitious feeling grew.<a name=70:9></a> I may add that in the Russian part of the Greek church, it is since Peter the Great's time in a certain sense established by law.<a name=70:10></a> It seems that through the efforts of Rome and the propaganda, persons from Eastern countries who had received their education there had widely propagated the views with which they had been imbued at Rome.<a name=70:11></a> Peter the Great brought many clergy in from the Ukraine, where Romish influence was considerable, and only then 1725) imposed on everyone consecrated bishop, an oath "that he believes and understands that the transubstantiation of the body and blood of Christ in the holy supper as taught by the Eastern and ancient Russian doctors is effected by the influence and operation of the Holy Ghost when the bishop or priest invokes God the Father in these words, 'and make this bread the precious body of Christ.<a name=70:12></a>'" Thus since Peter the Great's reign there has, at least by the prelates, been a positive profession of transubstantiation in Russia; but by invocation of the Holy Ghost and not as at Rome, but this is only since the beginning of the eighteenth century; that was rather late in the day.<a name=70:13></a> The way it came about was this: It seems Rome had been very active in seeking to win and influence the Greek church, which though itself corrupt enough, was a standing witness against her pretended catholicity, and against some of her doctrines.<a name=70:14></a> It had had to do with the struggles in the case of Cyril Lucaris, who had embraced evangelical doctrine and was strangled by the Porte, as was the Cyril of Berrhoea who supplanted him.<a name=70:15></a> By like intrigues the Ukraine or Little Russia, and the provinces at the mouth of the Danube and neighbourhood in what had once been Polish, had been very much Romanized, at the same time the clergy had at least received some education at Rome.<a name=70:16></a> Peter the Great, who was the ecclesiastical reformer of Russia and remodelled the whole church and monastic system, brought in thence (the Russian clergy being utterly brutish), at least educated men, and then (1725) introduced the oath as to transubstantiation.<a name=70:17></a> Mogilas, Metropolitan of the Ukraine, had made a catechism, confirmed in 1643 by the patriarchs, and in vogue till the Synod's Catechism by the Archbishop of Novgorod in 1766 supplanted it.<a name=70:18></a> I do not question that the superstition insisted on by John Damascene had borne its fruits.<a name=70:19></a> At the time of the Reformation, the Wurtemberg divines wrote to the patriarch Jeremias, sending the confession of Augsburg, and in his answer he quotes the words of John Damascene; he says it is the body of Christ, not a type, he calls it bread when consecrated; nor is there a hint of substance and accidents.<a name=70:20></a> The best account perhaps of transmutation in the Greek church will be found in Covel (page 122, C.<a name=70:21></a>5, Camb.<a name=70:22></a>, 1782).<a name=70:23></a> But as is evidently quite modern.<a name=70:24></a> I thought I might notice the Greek church to complete our review.<a name=70:25></a>

		This much I think we have seen: first in searching Scripture, it cannot be said that Christ, in giving the bread and the wine, was present a glorified Christ as actually existing, for then there can be no shed blood, as is evident, and He was not yet so glorified: nor would it be what He was then, for His blood was not shed.<a name=72:1></a> Its being done after He was gone and glorified, in <i>remembrance</i> of Him and His sacrifice, is as simple as it is blessed.<a name=72:2></a> Next, in the Fathers, we have found that many of them, though speaking in the highest terms of the Eucharist, insist earnestly on the exact contrary of transubstantiation.<a name=72:3></a> And this is true of the very early ones reasoning against the Doceta; and then, somewhat later, others in writing against the Eutychians, say things which modern Roman Catholics hold to be 'prave dicta,' and others excuse, saying, when the dogma was not settled they spoke in a way liable to be abused, 'in malam partem trahi.<a name=72:4></a>' We have seen that in the West, Paschasius Radbert was the first who positively and clearly expounded the doctrine, that is, in the ninth century, and that it was never formally decided to be the doctrine of the church till 1215.<a name=72:5></a> There was a great deal of intriguing of the Western powers at Constantinople on this subject to augment their influence, but into this I need not enter.<a name=72:6></a> I may note, however, that in Peter the Great's bishops' oath (and which is indeed its object), and all the Eastern documents I have come across, the change, as in ancient liturgies, is invariably attributed to the invocation of the Holy Ghost, and distinctively to that, the <i>epiklesis</i> of the early Fathers.<a name=72:7></a> This is wanting wholly in the Roman missal, so that an orthodox Greek does not hold the elements to be consecrated at Rome at all.<a name=72:8></a> In the Romanized liturgies of other bodies, as Armenians and Ethiopians united to Rome, in the former we find in the invocation bread changed into consecrated bread.<a name=72:9></a> The Ethiopic goes further, and says, "This bread, that is, the body of Christ.<a name=72:10></a>" They have not taken away the invocation, but changed it so as to make it an already consecrated bread.<a name=72:11></a> In the ancient liturgies, the oblation was before the consecration, from the very ancient habit of bringing the fruits of the earth in kind before the celebration of the Lord's supper.<a name=72:12></a> In all, we find the virgin Mary prayed <i>for</i>, not doing which Epiphanius notices as the distinction of a divine Person, as Christ, and many other traces, not of what was primitive then came in.<a name=72:13></a> In Justin Martyr's time, the president prayed and thanked as best he could, but at any rate of early times.<a name=72:14></a> The change in praying <i>to</i> instead of <i>for</i> saints is noticed in a question in the Corpus Jur.<a name=72:15></a> Can.<a name=72:16></a>, and puzzled the Pope who could not account for it; only saints, could not, he said, be prayed for.<a name=72:17></a> But of this we have spoken.<a name=72:18></a> But as Scripture really cannot honestly be tortured to mean it, so that the Fathers shew that transubstantiation was not the doctrine of the early church, no honest man who has read them can deny, rapidly as superstition and immorality grew, and dark and ignorant as the so-called Fathers were.<a name=72:19></a>

Isaiah 26: 4 has nothing to do with the matter. He is the Rock of Ages -- abiding ground of confidence. Nor, indeed, has Isaiah 40: 23. "In Exodus 2: 15 we read of God's *onoma aionon*, that is, His name as connected with deliverance." It is nothing of the kind; it is His constant name with Israel. His comment on 2 (or chapter 4: 17, page 67) is puerilely false. The connection of the word *baros* with *aionon* shews it plainly. Again, the use of *akatalutos* with punishment would have no sense, if I should say indestructible judgment or punishment.

		I have thought that, as one of the forms in which infidelity circulates at present is Universalism, or the Restitution of all things, it might be well to put out clearly and simply some facts (for that is what they are), which may deprive its advocates of one main ground of their reasonings, and that without any reasoning on the general subject of a doctrine, which, when examined, sets aside the truth of Christianity.<a name=124:1></a> I refer to the meaning of <i>aion</i>, and also of <i>aionios</i>.<a name=124:2></a> We are told by Dr.<a name=124:3></a> Farrar, with much pretension to competency in affirming it, that "everlasting" or "eternal" ought not to be found in the Bible; by Mr.<a name=124:4></a> Cox, that it means properly an "age" and "age-long," and that it cannot be right to translate them eternal or everlasting.<a name=124:5></a> Mr.<a name=124:6></a> Jukes, with a wild imagination, takes the same ground.<a name=124:7></a> They simply echo one another.<a name=124:8></a> Now all I purpose to do here is to state some passages from other authors, which prove that (while used in other senses, some of which are not found at all in Scripture), it does mean "eternity" and "eternal.<a name=124:9></a>" I will afterwards examine some of the passages in Scripture in which it is found.<a name=124:10></a>

		<i>Aion</i> in Greek properly means "eternity.<a name=124:11></a>" I do not dispute here, whether we are to believe with Aristotle, that it is derived from <i>aei einai</i>; or with other modern writers from <i>aio</i>, I breathe, whence it had the meaning in Homer, Euripides, and other authors, of life and breath; or possibly these may be two different words, one from <i>aei on</i>, the other from <i>ao spiro</i>, whence the two very different meanings.<a name=124:12></a> This is certain, that the word is distinctly used by Plato, Aristotle, and Philo (and, according to the dictionaries, by Lycurgus, whom I have not the means of consulting) as "eternal," in contrast with what is of time having beginning or ending, as its definite and proper meaning.<a name=124:13></a>

		Plato (<i>Timoeus</i>, ed.<a name=124:14></a> Steph.<a name=124:15></a> 3, 37, or ed.<a name=124:16></a> Baiter, Orell.<a name=124:17></a> et Winck.<a name=124:18></a> 712) says, speaking of the universe: "When the father who begot it<a href="#124:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> perceived that the image made by him of the eternal <i>(aidion)</i> gods moved and lived, he was delighted with his work; and, led by this delight, thought to make his work much more like that first exemplar.<a name=124:19></a>" Inasmuch therefore as it (the intelligible universe) is an eternal <i>(aidion)</i> animal (living being), so he set about to make this (the sensible) universe such with all his power.<a name=124:20></a> The nature therefore of the animal (living being) was eternal <i>(aionios</i>, before <i>aidios)</i>, and this indeed it was impossible to adapt to what was produced <i>(to genneto</i>, to what had a beginning); he thinks to make a moveable image of eternity <i>(aionos)</i>, and in adoring the heavens he makes of the eternity permanent in unity a certain eternal image moving in number, that which in fact we call time; that is, days and nights, and months and years, which did not subsist before the heaven began to be, then with its being established he operates their birth" (beginning to be, <i>genesin auton)</i>.<a name=124:21></a> And after unfolding this, he says (page 38): "But these forms of time imitating eternity <i>(aiona)</i>, and rolling round according to number, have had a beginning <i>(gegonen)</i> .<a name=124:22></a><i>.<a name=124:23></a>.<a name=124:24></a> </i>.<a name=124:25></a> Time therefore began with heaven.<a name=124:26></a> that they having begun with it may be dissolved with it, if there be indeed any dissolution of them, and according to the pattern of eternal <i>(diaionias</i>, in some MSS.<a name=124:27></a> <i>aionion</i> or -<i>as)</i> nature that it might be as like as possible to it.<a name=124:28></a> For that pattern exists for all eternity <i>(panta aiona estin on)</i>, but on the other hand, that which is perpetual <i>(dia telous)</i> throughout all time has had a beginning, and is, and will be.<a name=124:29></a>" And then he goes on to speak of stars and planets, etc.<a name=124:30></a>, as connected with what was created in time.<a name=124:31></a> It is impossible to conceive any more positive statement that <i>aion is</i> distinct, and to be contrasted with what has a beginning and belongs to the flux of time.<a name=124:32></a> <i>Aion is</i> what is properly eternal, in contrast with a divine imitation of it in ages of time, the result of the creative action of God which imitated the uncreate as nearly as He could in created ages.<a name=124:33></a> It is a careful opposition between eternity and ages; and <i>aion</i> and also <i>aionios</i> mean the former in contrast with ages.<a name=124:34></a>

		I now give Aristotle <i>peri ouranou</i>, 1, 9 (ed.<a name=125:1></a> Bekker, 1, 279): "Time," he says, "is the number of movement, but there is no movement without a physical body.<a name=125:2></a> But outside heaven it has been shewn that there is not, nor possibly can come into existence, any body.<a name=125:3></a> It is evident then that there is neither place, nor void, nor time outside.<a name=125:4></a> Wherefore neither in place are things there formed by nature; nor does time cause them to grow old: neither is there any change of anything of those things which are arranged beyond the outermost orbit; but unchangeable, and subject to no influence, having the best and most independent life, they continue for all eternity <i>(aiona)</i>.<a name=125:5></a> For this expression (name) has been divinely uttered by the ancients; for the completeness which embraces the time of the life of each, outside which there is nothing, according to nature, is called the <i>aion</i> of each.<a name=125:6></a> According to the same word <i>(logon)</i> the completeness of the whole heaven, and the completeness which embraces all time and infinitude is <i>aion</i>, having received this name from existing for ever <i>(apo tou aei einai)</i>, immortal <i>(athanatos</i>, undying), and divine.<a name=125:7></a>" In 10 he goes on to shew that that beginning to be <i>(genesthai)</i> involves the not existing always, which I refer to as shewing what he means by <i>aion</i>.<a name=125:8></a> He is proving the unchangeable eternity of the visible universe.<a name=125:9></a> That is no business of mine; but it shews what he means by eternity <i>(aion)</i>.<a name=125:10></a> It cannot be <i>aidion</i> and <i>genesthai</i> at the same time, when, as in Plato, <i>aidios is</i> used as equivalent to <i>aionios</i>.<a name=125:11></a> Aristotle has not the abstract thoughts of Plato as to ideas, and the <i>paradeigma</i> of what is visible, the latter being a produced image of the eternal <i>paradeigma</i>.<a name=125:12></a> He rests more in what is known by the senses; and makes this the eternal thing in itself.<a name=125:13></a> But the force of <i>aion</i> for both is a settled point; and Aristotle's explanation of <i>aion</i> as used for finite things, I have long held to be the true one; that is, the completeness of a thing's existence, so that according to its natural existence there is nothing outside or beyond it.<a name=125:14></a> It <i>periechei</i> the whole being of the thing.<a name=125:15></a>

		As to Philo, the sentence is in De Mundo, 7, <i>en aioni de oute pareleluthen ouden, oute mellei, alla monon iphesteken</i>.<a name=126:1></a> Such a definition needs no explanation: in eternity nothing is passed, nothing is about to be, but only subsists.<a name=126:2></a> This has the importance of being of the date and Hellenistic Greek of the New Testament, as the others give the regular, and at the same time philosophical force of the word, <i>aion, aionios</i>.<a name=126:3></a> Eternity, unchangeable, with no 'was' nor 'will be,' is its proper force, that it can be applied to the whole existence of a thing, so that nothing of its nature was before true or after is true, <i>to telos to periechon</i>.<a name=126:4></a> But its meaning is eternity, and eternal.<a name=126:5></a> To say that they do not mean it in Greek, as Jukes and Farrar and S.<a name=126:6></a> Cox, and those they quote, is a denial of the statements of the very best authorities we can have on the subject.<a name=126:7></a> If Plato and Aristotle and Philo knew Greek, what these others say is false.<a name=126:8></a> That this is the proper sense of <i>aionios</i> in Scripture, is as certain as it is evident.<a name=126:9></a> In 2 Corinthians 4: 18, we have <i>ta gar blepomena proskaira, ta de me blepomena aionia</i>.<a name=126:10></a> That is, things that are for a time are put in express contrast with <i>aionia</i>, which are not for a time, be it age or ages, but eternal.<a name=126:11></a> Nothing can be more decisive of its positive and specific meaning.<a name=126:12></a>

		I will now quote various passages of Scripture to shew <i>aion</i> or <i>aionios</i> has the definite meaning of "for ever," or "eternal," in English.<a name=127:1></a> No one who has examined its use in Greek questions that it is used for life, or the whole period of a man's existence till he breathes his last; nor that it may be used for ages or periods, looked at as a whole.<a name=127:2></a> The question is, Does it not properly mean eternal or for ever, and that where age and age-long would have no sense?<a name=127:3></a> Thus Matthew 21: 19, of the fig-tree: Let no fruit grow on thee <i>eis ton aiona.<a name=127:4></a> "For</i> the age" has no sense.<a name=127:5></a> It never was to grow.<a name=127:6></a> So Mark 11: 14.<a name=127:7></a> That eternity is not grasped by man as a definite idea is true, because definite is finite, and man, being finite, cannot grasp what is in-finite.<a name=127:8></a> It is known only as that which is absolutely; or negatively as that to which end is denied.<a name=127:9></a>

		Again, Mark 3: 29, <i>oik echei aphesin eis ton aiona</i>.<a name=127:10></a> What age?<a name=127:11></a> It is not <i>in</i> the age, as some have fraudulently translated it, but "has not ever forgiveness.<a name=127:12></a>" It is not any particular age; the <i>eis</i> allows no such sense, and the <i>ton</i> would require some particular age, which even so would leave no sense to <i>eis</i>.<a name=127:13></a> It can only mean here "for ever.<a name=127:14></a>" There was a present age and age to come, <i>o aion outos</i>, and <i>o aion o mellon</i>, and well known to the Jews, the <i>olem hazeh</i>, and the <i>olem havo</i>; and an increased measure of forgiveness was looked for in Messiah's age.<a name=127:15></a> This sin could be forgiven in neither; no additional increase of forgiveness was looked for beyond Messiah; and each measure belonged to its own age; it was not a prolonged process, but what occurred in each as proper to it.<a name=127:16></a> But <i>eis ton aiona</i>, can only mean "for ever," though "for ever" may be used metaphorically when there is no withdrawal of the gift or promise, and the effect cannot last longer than that to which it applies.<a name=127:17></a> The gift has no limit (it is, as Aristotle says, <i>apeiria)</i>, the existence of that to which it applies may.<a name=127:18></a> I do not lend it, I give it for ever; yet what I give, or the person to whom it is given, may cease to exist; but the gift is for ever, without repentance, out and out.<a name=127:19></a>

		So John 4: 14, shall not thirst "for the age": is that the meaning?<a name=128:1></a> or never?<a name=128:2></a> John 6: 51, 58, "live for ever"; John 10: 28, not perish "to the age": is that the sense?<a name=128:3></a> John 13: 8, thou shalt not wash my feet "to the age!<a name=128:4></a>" A multitude more may be quoted to the same effect; some with the modified sense I have spoken of above of absolute gift and calling never to be retracted.<a name=128:5></a> But <i>eis ton aiona</i> never means "to the age" in any case.<a name=128:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take 1 Peter 1: 23, 25, <i>logou zontos theou kai menontos eis ton aiona</i>.<a name=128:7></a> Does it last only "to the age" (applying it to the <i>logon</i>, not to <i>theou</i> as some do)?<a name=128:8></a> So verse 25, <i>rema menei eis ton aiona</i>.<a name=128:9></a> So 2 John 2, the truth shall be with us "to the age!<a name=128:10></a>" So Jude 13, wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness <i>eis ton aiona</i>.<a name=128:11></a> Here again "to the age" has no sense.<a name=128:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The case of <i>aionios is</i> just as strong.<a name=128:13></a> It is used seventy-one times in the New Testament.<a name=128:14></a> Of these it is connected forty-four times with life, where "for an age" or "age-long" is just nonsense, as believers to have age-long life and shall not perish.<a name=128:15></a> It is in contrast with ever perishing.<a name=128:16></a> The knowledge of the Father, and of Jesus Christ, whom He has sent, is life for the age.<a name=128:17></a> Is that all?<a name=128:18></a> The words of Jesus were <i>remata zoes aioniou</i> not <i>tes zoes</i>.<a name=128:19></a> It was that in its nature, not a specific period: indeed believers have it now.<a name=128:20></a> In Romans 6: 22 the end is everlasting life.<a name=128:21></a> So that the life of that age, though no particular one is ever spoken of, is the end of the matter.<a name=128:22></a> It is not merely dark beyond as to a Jew, but there is no object beyond.<a name=128:23></a> My object is not to argue the point, but to consider the words here; but I must say that, if anything could lower and degrade the hope and present joy of the Christian, it is this miserable notion that "eternal" does not mean eternal.<a name=128:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, farther, Christ was that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us; 1 John 1: 2.<a name=128:25></a> He is our life; he that hath the Son hath life.<a name=128:26></a> He is the true God and eternal life.<a name=128:27></a> Five, I may say six, times it is used of "eternal fire," or "punishment.<a name=128:28></a>" The rest are various, glory, salvation, redemption, inheritance, Spirit, God Himself.<a name=128:29></a> But none of them is eternal!<a name=128:30></a> all belong to this wonderful unknown age, and no more.<a name=128:31></a> But the eternal weight of glory is that of which the apostle speaks, when he says that the things are not for a time, <i>proskaira</i>, but eternal, <i>aionia</i>, chapter 5: I going on to say that he was looking for a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<a name=128:32></a> We have the word used with <i>chronon</i> (times) in plural for the times of God's active dispensations.<a name=128:33></a> Before anything was created, this life was given us in Christ; putting it in its nature out of time.<a name=128:34></a>

		Read these passages, and say if (while no one denies that there are ages and dispensations in which God has wrought and works), it be so that eternity is excluded from the revelation given to the Christian, and from the rest of God (for the promise is left us of entering into <i>His</i> rest), and that eternal glory, the eternal God, only means a God that has to say to that age.<a name=129:1></a> That God having called us to His own kingdom and glory, specifically that as our calling, this means a temporary period, an age which characterises Him, so that the eternal God is only the age-long God.<a name=129:2></a> That this life promised before the ages <i>(chronon aionion)</i>, and which Christ is in His Person as with the Father, is only a life in one of these ages; and that when I read that the God of all grace has called us to His eternal glory by Jesus Christ, for which we may suffer a while, it is only a temporary glory of His for some special age; 1 Peter 5: 10.<a name=129:3></a> That the glory of God, for which we hope in contradistinction to the peace and favour we possess, is only a temporary thing, for I suppose His own glory is the glory we boast in Romans 5.<a name=129:4></a> That language of exuberant apprehension is used, such as "ages of ages," and all the "generations of the age," or "eternity of ages," we know.<a name=129:5></a> But this does not alter the meaning of the word: <i>aionios</i> is properly the opposite to <i>proskairos</i>.<a name=129:6></a>

		As to "damnation," the English word was used more loosely when the Bible was translated than it is now.<a name=131:1></a> In 1 Corinthians 11: 29, it is used in contrast with final condemnation.<a name=131:2></a> The translators, where one word was used in Greek, took pains to use several in English, and thereby disfigured the sense of many passages, or at least obscured the connection.<a name=131:3></a> Thus in John 5 we have "judgment," "condemnation," "damnation," all used for <i>krisis</i>, where "judgment" is the only true translation; but this does not affect the substance of Canon Farrar's assertion.<a name=131:4></a> He speaks of the word in its ordinary modern acceptation.<a name=131:5></a> "Damnation" is used frequently in the English New Testament for judgment, as in Matthew 23: 14; Mark 12: 40; Luke 20: 47; Romans 3: 8; chapter 13: 2; 1 Timothy 5: 12; and this is the sense of 1 Corinthians 11: 29, in contrast with condemnation with the world.<a name=131:6></a> Now, even if this "judgment" be everlasting condemnation, still the word means judgment.<a name=131:7></a>

		But there is another and a stronger word than <i>krima</i> used, even in express contrast with it, so as to plainly mean final, absolute, condemnation.<a name=131:8></a> The word is <i>katakrima</i>.<a name=131:9></a> What a man is condemned to must be known by the sentence.<a name=131:10></a> We have both words in Romans 5: 16, "For the judgment <i>(krima)</i> was by one to <i>(katakrima)</i> condemnation," and in verse 18.<a name=131:11></a> So, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus," Romans 8: 1.<a name=131:12></a> "God justifieth.<a name=131:13></a> Who is he that condemneth?<a name=131:14></a>" (verses 33, 34).<a name=131:15></a> "When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world" (1 Corinthians 11: 32), where partial earthly judgments are contrasted with a final absolute condemnation.<a name=131:16></a> It is not therefore the mere word "damnation" for which I contend, nor to which Dr.<a name=131:17></a> Farrar objects, as all his sermon proves; for it is used in the English version many times, not in the sense of eternal condemnation; but that eternal condemnation meant by the word in modern times is spoken of in contrast with judgment, and as a distinct thing.<a name=131:18></a> Hence the apostle speaks of "eternal judgment" (Hebrews 6); "eternal punishment" (Matthew 25); "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord"; and (Mark 3: 29), "hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of <i>(enochos</i>, subject to) eternal damnation.<a name=131:19></a>" And where the wicked have their part in the lake of fire it is said, <i>gegone</i>, It is done, when <i>Omega is</i> written on all things.<a name=131:20></a>

		The other word is "hell.<a name=132:4></a>" Now, unfortunately, two words are translated "hell" in the English Bible -- Hades and Gehenna: one meaning the temporary state of departed spirits, the unseen world without saying more; the other used for the fire that never shall be quenched.<a name=132:5></a> Its meaning is, etymologically, the valley of Hinnom, where people offered their children to Moloch, and which was defiled by Josiah; and, it seems, a fire kept up to consume what was filthy and unclean out of Jerusalem and called Tophet.<a name=132:6></a> Hence we have in Isaiah, "For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large; and the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it," Isaiah 30: 33.<a name=132:7></a> "And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh," Isaiah 66: 24.<a name=132:8></a> This is, on the face of it, a material fact; there was a constant fire enduring continually, to which those bodies were enduringly subjected.<a name=132:9></a> Now Sheol, or Hades, is never confounded with this.<a name=132:10></a> It was an actual valley between Zion and what is called the Hill of Evil Counsel, south of Jerusalem, where tradition places the house of Caiaphas, if my memory serve me.<a name=132:11></a> This valley, where the unquenched fire consumed what was unclean, which yet, according to Isaiah 66, should remain in the consuming fire unconsumed, an abhorring unto all flesh, was used for an image of a sorer punishment, and was called Gehenna (Anglice, "hell"); that is, literally, the valley of Hinnom.<a name=132:12></a> Now this word is found in Matthew 5: 22, 29, 30; chapter 10: 28; chapter 18: 9; chapter 23: 15, 33; Mark 9: 43, 45, 47; Luke 12: 5; James 3: 6.<a name=132:13></a>

		But then, as to miracles, and the idea of making them the result of natural causes, in a sphere of which much is yet unknown to us, Christianity rests on the truth of resurrection, which is certainly not according to the course of nature.<a name=135:9></a> And of this the Duke of Argyll can only say, Why should it seem incredible to you that God can raise the dead?<a name=135:10></a> No doubt God can, and He has raised Christ Himself.<a name=135:11></a> But that is shirking the question.<a name=135:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Science is occupied in phenomena, what the perceptive mind of man can take cognisance of.<a name=138:8></a> It may search into these with the utmost minuteness; it may see that these are regularly governed by general laws, and from the universality of phenomena discover a general principle which acts in all of them.<a name=138:9></a> It sees too that certain phenomena are constantly consequences of other phenomena, so far as that, when certain phenomena occur, they are, if not hindered by some external power, followed by other phenomena which are their consequences.<a name=138:10></a> There are certain constant facts, and facts which flow from other facts, with (as a general rule) a regularity which constitutes a law of nature.<a name=138:11></a> All this science can investigate.<a name=138:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Doubtless there is a vast number of such facts and connections not yet discovered, and I know of no limit in principle to any discovery of the order of nature.<a name=138:13></a> But science can go no farther; it deals with phenomena (that is, the perceived course of nature), and cannot go beyond them.<a name=138:14></a> These, as ordinary and universal phenomena, can be (if science has gone so far) traced to causes which have produced them, and regularly produce them, or to some general uniform principle, such as what is called gravity; so that there are, as to the course of nature, general laws and productive causes.<a name=138:15></a> Still the way this is spoken of is very commonly incorrect; as if there were a succession of events.<a name=138:16></a> Now this is not the case in much referred to.<a name=138:17></a>

		A general principle is discovered, as gravity, or the action of acids on certain other substances, or the laws of electricity.<a name=139:1></a> In these cases there is no succession or series of events, but either constancy in fact, as in the movements of the heavenly bodies, or, if certain substances are applied to others, uniform effects produced, and new combinations formed, and the like.<a name=139:2></a> This has nothing to do with a succession of productions.<a name=139:3></a> I do not say everything produced has proceeded from an antecedent, and this from another.<a name=139:4></a> It only proves that there are certain general laws which govern what exists, so that they as a rule act uniformly, or perhaps constantly.<a name=139:5></a> Adams or Leverrier could discover that there must be a planet in a certain place because of certain disturbances in the movements of Neptune, and there it was found.<a name=139:6></a><a href="#139:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> So Kepler discovered elliptic orbits, and equal spaces in equal times, and the like: and chemistry ascertained the combination of elements in regular proportion.<a name=139:7></a> That is, regular and orderly (or, as they are called, general) laws of the operations of forces in what exists in the visible universe have been discovered constant in their nature.<a name=139:8></a> What exists moves in a regular way, or, when the occasion is there the same thing produces the same effects; not a succession of productive causes, but uniformity in the actions of each, so that we can calculate on effects if nothing hinders.<a name=139:9></a> But that is all.<a name=139:10></a> Science informs me of these general laws which govern what exists; but the things must already exist so to act.<a name=139:11></a>

		It is sweet to see how the apostle, in Romans 8, applies this love of God to everything.<a name=152:20></a> He who has given His own Son, how shall He not with Him freely give us all things?<a name=152:21></a> He is for us in giving all things.<a name=152:22></a> Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?<a name=152:23></a> He is for us in justifying us.<a name=152:24></a> He is for us, whether it be the giving on His side, or the guilt on ours.<a name=152:25></a> He is for us as to the trials, or the difficulties.<a name=152:26></a> No matter what, if God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=152:27></a> When trial comes, we remember that there is a rest.<a name=152:28></a> And, if there be a rest, it is for God's people; and, if it be for God's people, it is God's rest, and He will come and take us to it.<a name=152:29></a> I may send and fetch a person to me, if I do not care particularly for him; but if I think much about him, I shall go and meet him myself.<a name=152:30></a> So He says, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself.<a name=152:31></a>"

		DELIVERANCE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Romans, beloved friends, takes up the Christian, if we compare one aspect of his condition with another, on the lowest ground.<a name=153:1></a> If for instance we take the Ephesians, there we find the Christian spoken of as "raised up together, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"; but you never get him there in the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=153:2></a> Though in the end of chapter 8 it is stated that he is predestinated in God's original purpose for the glory, yet we never get him as risen and in the heavenly places, but looked at as on this earth, and of course he is.<a name=153:3></a> We will see now a little, with the Lord's help, how He does look at a Christian on this earth.<a name=153:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now thus looked at, though not sitting with Christ, yet Christ is his life.<a name=153:5></a> Here am I a sinner in myself, and my flesh has got no good in it.<a name=153:6></a> The whole Epistle develops very fully what the Christian is, looked at in this world, and the chapter I have read treats one special part of it, and that is his positive state and standing, not his guilt; as to his guilt, it has been treated very fully up to the middle of the previous chapter.<a name=153:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To begin with, the apostle says he is "not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<a name=153:8></a> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed.<a name=153:9></a>" And then he goes on to shew why it must be God's righteousness that is revealed -- simply because man has none.<a name=153:10></a> God's law had come and required righteousness in man, which it could not find; but the gospel comes and reveals God's righteousness, and he is not ashamed of it because it is revealed in it.<a name=153:11></a> He shews us the Jews under law and the Gentiles without law, and proves "every mouth stopped, and all the world guilty before God.<a name=153:12></a>" Instead of the law making it any better for the Jews, it only proved their guilt; and as to the Gentiles, that which might have been known of God in creation left them without excuse when they went to idolatry.<a name=153:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He next shews us how "God hath set forth Christ to be a propitiation through faith in his blood," and applies that death to the past and the present, saying that it declared "God's righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God.<a name=153:14></a>" God had been forbearing with them, but there had been no proof of righteousness in His forgiving them one more than another; but now on the cross it is explained.<a name=153:15></a> And not only this, but He is "just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<a name=153:16></a>" There it is the present time, His righteousness is now revealed, and we stand upon the ground of this righteousness that has been revealed.<a name=153:17></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=154>[Page 154]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The place where it has been shewn and manifested is in setting Christ at God's right hand.<a name=154:1></a> This is a demonstration of the sin of the whole world, because it did not believe in Christ; also a demonstration of righteousness, "because I go to My Father, and ye see Me no more": the Saviour they had rejected they would see no more till He came again as Judge.<a name=154:2></a> Thus the gospel comes and shews us that He is seated there (besides being the Son of God) in virtue of the work of the cross.<a name=154:3></a> There is where God's righteousness is displayed for faith to look at.<a name=154:4></a> I see thus the perfect love of God which sought us in this way.<a name=154:5></a> I had sins, but no righteousness; I have nothing but Christ to look to, and my eye rests through faith where God's eye rests; God is satisfied, and so am I through grace.<a name=154:6></a> I see the sins put away through the work of the Lord Jesus Christ, so that there is no more question of sin, because my righteousness is Christ; He is "made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.<a name=154:7></a>" All is perfectly settled once and for all, and I am made the righteousness of God through Christ -- God's righteousness.<a name=154:8></a> What we rejected God accepted, and proved His righteousness thereby.<a name=154:9></a> All the fruit of the old man is done away, and we are in Christ accepted.<a name=154:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now comes another question; not that of our sins being put away, but of our deliverance from the principle of sin.<a name=154:11></a> As we read, "As he is, so are we in this world.<a name=154:12></a>" On the ground of what we are by faith all our sins are put away; but then comes the power of sin -- this evil nature -- what is in me, not what I have done.<a name=154:13></a> But can I in this world say that I am delivered from sin?<a name=154:14></a> that I am made free from sin?<a name=154:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this word "free" is often abused in English; it has two meanings.<a name=154:16></a> It is not here used in the sense that there is none in us, as I would say, "That horse is 'free' from vice"; but it is in contrast to the word "captive.<a name=154:17></a>" It means we are not captive to sin.<a name=154:18></a> He takes up the question of law as he took up the question of righteousness.<a name=154:19></a> Man had not made out righteousness either with law or without it; then God gave him Christ to be his righteousness.<a name=154:20></a> Now the question is whether, we having thus got righteousness, the law can deliver us.<a name=154:21></a>

		Well, in chapter 8 it says, "What the law could not do.<a name=155:1></a>" It is not guilt now, but the flesh is not subject, neither can be.<a name=155:2></a> He means it has a will of its own.<a name=155:3></a> We know we have a will of our own.<a name=155:4></a> Now a will of our own is the principle of sin: whenever I have got a will of my own, there is sin -- self-will, just the same as Eve when she would go and eat the fruit.<a name=155:5></a> The law thwarted the acting of will, of course; it was "holy, and just, and good," so it must; but it did not take away, nor did it alter sin; but "what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh": the law of course had nothing to do with that.<a name=155:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things the law could not do: it could not give life, and, even supposing we got life, it does not give strength; and, another thing of the deepest moment for our souls, it does not give an object.<a name=155:7></a> But in Christ I find my life, my strength, and my object.<a name=155:8></a> "They that are after the Spirit do mind the things of the Spirit"; they have the true object.<a name=155:9></a> I get in Christ an object that is sufficient to delight God Himself.<a name=155:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the fact of life will not do; we must have it, of course, but that is not sufficient.<a name=155:11></a> The old man is here yet: there are lusts.<a name=155:12></a> The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and "it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be"; therefore the law instead of delivering me brings me into captivity.<a name=155:13></a> It is just what we get in Romans 7.<a name=155:14></a> Suppose a man quickened in this world, what will be the effect of the law upon him?<a name=155:15></a> It will give him the knowledge of sin; "I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.<a name=155:16></a> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.<a name=155:17></a> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.<a name=155:18></a>" Yet "the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good"; but it did not give anything of what we want; it was only the rule outside it, and gave us nothing to enable us to walk up to it.<a name=155:19></a> Here was a man in a kind of sleepy indefinite way going on quite comfortably, a man with a good conscience; "I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=155:20></a>" When the law came, it said, "Thou shalt not covet"; but it did not take away the lust; and he found at once another law warring against the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin.<a name=155:21></a> There was no deliverance.<a name=155:22></a> God allowed him to use every kind of effort to get the victory; but it all only went to prove not simply that he was guilty, and that he had an evil nature, but that besides this he had no strength; and that is an exceedingly miserable condition.<a name=155:23></a>

		As I have been saying, the apostle shews us, besides the question of guilt, the question of state.<a name=156:10></a> I have been seeing what the state of bondage is of a renewed man under law, in contrast to the state of a renewed man knowing what it is to be risen with Christ.<a name=156:11></a> We are united to Christ risen, and, being thus, He brings in, not the death of the law, but our death.<a name=156:12></a> So that I have not got to hunt up things in my heart to see whether evil is present with me; this would be law, and the law cannot help me at all; but I have got Christ as my life, Christ risen and glorified too; and I am past death and raised up, though I do not go on to glory here, because it is a man here walking on the earth.<a name=156:13></a> I have got Christ to be my life, not Adam; I am not alive to God at all as born of Adam; we are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in us.<a name=156:14></a>" When I stood as a child of Adam before God, the law i!<a name=156:15></a> was applied to me on that footing.<a name=156:16></a> I have not got what meets it.<a name=156:17></a> As long therefore as I am in the flesh, I cannot meet God or please God, and I never can get free or happy with God.<a name=156:18></a> So much the better, that I may find it out.<a name=156:19></a>

		Now the flesh never changes; "it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=157:1></a>" When man fell, the world got so awfully bad that God had to destroy it; when God's Son came into the world, they crucified Him; when the Spirit came, the flesh lusted against it; and when it has gone into the third heavens, it puffs a man up -- if there were a fourth heaven, it would only puff him up more: that is the end of it!<a name=157:2></a>

		The Christian, having thus the redemption of his sins, and the earnest and comfort of the Spirit, goes on to learn that God is for him.<a name=161:10></a> We do not know what to pray for as we ought.<a name=161:11></a> We have spiritual desires of good, and the sense of evil around us, though our intelligence is not clear enough; but He makes intercession in us according to God.<a name=161:12></a> We do not know what is the best thing to ask for: some things cannot be remedied till the Lord come; but, whilst we do not know what to ask for, we do know that "all things work together for good to them that love God.<a name=161:13></a>" On this we can reckon with unfailing assurance.<a name=161:14></a>

		It began, note, with God.<a name=162:1></a> He says to Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in all the earth, a perfect and an upright man?<a name=162:2></a>" God <i>had</i> considered him.<a name=162:3></a> Satan says, Well, You have made a hedge about him, so why should he- not fear You?<a name=162:4></a> Then God lets Satan loose at him.<a name=162:5></a> He lets him take all that he has, his servants are killed, his children too afterwards, his fortune gone; and Job says, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.<a name=162:6></a>" Then Satan says, Skin for skin, a man will give anything he has for his life!<a name=162:7></a> Then God says, You can have his body, but not his life.<a name=162:8></a> So Satan smites him with sore boils, so that he becomes both wretched, and the derision of his neighbours.<a name=162:9></a> His wife wants him to curse God and die, but in all this Job sins not; he has "received good at the hands of the Lord and shall not he receive evil?<a name=162:10></a>" So that I get this fact: all that Satan did against Job entirely failed, save that it entirely cleared him from Satan's accusation and the charge of hypocrisy.<a name=162:11></a> All that Satan could do he did, but could do no more than he was allowed to do.<a name=162:12></a>

		But now we see how God was watching over Job.<a name=162:13></a> Job was full of himself.<a name=162:14></a> He was doing blessedly, but he was thinking of it too.<a name=162:15></a> Supposing God had stopped short here, what would have been the effect of it?<a name=162:16></a> Why Job would have said: Well, I was gracious in prosperity, and now I have been patient in adversity; and he would have been worse than ever.<a name=162:17></a> God had justified him from Satan's accusations, and his suffering had only prepared the way for closer dealings of God.<a name=162:18></a>

		Job's friends come and tell him that he must be a wicked man, or such things would not have befallen him; that this world was an adequate witness of the government of God.<a name=162:19></a> Whether his pride was hurt by his friends, or whether it was their sympathy broke down his spirit, as sympathy often does, I cannot say; but now Job broke down utterly, and cursed the day when he was born.<a name=162:20></a> It brought the flesh out.<a name=162:21></a> The loss of the cattle and all that, had been nothing, but now the latent evil is laid bare.<a name=162:22></a> Still his faith recognises the good in God, though his flesh breaks sadly out.<a name=162:23></a> "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.<a name=162:24></a>" So he says, If I could find God, He would not be like you.<a name=162:25></a> But his friends' work was done now.<a name=162:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle looks beyond all this discipline -- beyond the ways of God on the road, which are only the instruments to work out His purpose.<a name=163:14></a> It is Satan's world in a certain sense, though he cannot take things out of God's hand.<a name=163:15></a> He could go to the Chaldeans and say, Take the cattle; and how little they knew they were doing God's will all the time, and that the hand of God was in it!<a name=163:16></a> They are all the ways of God with a view to His purpose, making everything work together for good, "for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=163:17></a>" That is His purpose, and we are even now nigh enough to see and trace His hand -- anyhow we shall see it soon, if we do not now.<a name=163:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He goes through the whole course of God's sovereign purpose till it lands us in the glory.<a name=163:19></a> It is well to notice that predestination is always to something; it is not the persons merely, but He has predestinated them to something.<a name=163:20></a> Then He closes it all in with, "What shall we say to these things?<a name=163:21></a> If God be for us who can be against us?<a name=163:22></a>" Not only am I cleansed so that I can stand before God, but I get this immense truth -- <i>God is for me.<a name=163:23></a> As</i>, by Christ, I believe in God, my heart knows that God is for me in everything; "He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous.<a name=163:24></a>" The heart, in looking at God, can say as to every circumstance of the way, "God is for me.<a name=163:25></a>" I may not always like what He does, but He is always for me.<a name=163:26></a> "Not a sparrow falleth to the ground," not without <i>God</i> merely, but "without your <i>Father</i>.<a name=163:27></a>"

		Job says, "Blessed be the name of the Lord," and it is lovely to see his patience and submission.<a name=164:1></a> But the apostle goes farther.<a name=164:2></a> It is another thing to "glory in tribulation.<a name=164:3></a>" It is one thing to say, He is wise and good, and another to say, He is for me.<a name=164:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point, too, I would notice.<a name=164:5></a> When the Holy Ghost reasons with man, He does not reason from what man is for God, but from what God is to man.<a name=164:6></a> Souls reason from what they are in themselves as to whether God can accept them.<a name=164:7></a> No, I say, He cannot accept you thus; you are looking for righteousness in yourself as a ground of acceptance with Him.<a name=164:8></a> You cannot get peace whilst reasoning in that way, and I should be very sorry if you could.<a name=164:9></a> But "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<a name=164:10></a>" He loved us from no motive at all but what was found in His own grace.<a name=164:11></a> We do not know Him.<a name=164:12></a> The prodigal did not know his father till his father was on his neck kissing him.<a name=164:13></a> He was reasoning from what he was, and not from what his father was, as to how he would receive him.<a name=164:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Ghost always reasons down from what God is, and this produces a total change in my soul.<a name=164:15></a> It is not that I abhor my sins; indeed I may have been walking very well; but it is "I abhor myself.<a name=164:16></a>" This is how the Holy Ghost reasons; He shews us what we are, and that is one reason why He often seems to be very hard and does not give peace to the soul, as we are not relieved till we experimentally, from our hearts, acknowledge what we are.<a name=164:17></a> As in the case of the SyroPhenician woman, the Lord does not seem to listen, and so He goes on until she owns that she has no title to anything, that she has no more claim through promise than through righteousness, till she only pleads that there is enough goodness in God to give her what she has no right to; and Christ cannot say that there is not.<a name=164:18></a>

		Until the soul comes to that point He does not give it peace -- He could not; it would be but healing the wound slightly; The soul has to go on until it finds there is nothing to rest on but the abstract goodness of God; and then "If God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=165:1></a>" There are three things here in which He is for us: God is for us in giving; He has given the very best thing, Him who is one with Himself, His Son.<a name=165:2></a> If God has given His Son, surely He will give everything else.<a name=165:3></a> Of course He will!<a name=165:4></a> It is reasoning down from what God is and what God has done.<a name=165:5></a> I ask, Will He give me all I want?<a name=165:6></a> Yes, indeed; and not only all I want, but He will set me in the glory, and I certainly shall not want anything there.<a name=165:7></a> This is the giving part.<a name=165:8></a> If He have given His Son, He will certainly give less things.<a name=165:9></a>

		Well, but what about my sins?<a name=165:10></a> This is the very place I learn how great the love is; where I get the answer, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?<a name=165:11></a> It is God that justifieth.<a name=165:12></a>" Why, it goes up to God in justifying.<a name=165:13></a> It is not we are justified in His sight, but He justifies.<a name=165:14></a> Little matter who condemns if God justify.<a name=165:15></a> If I look at my sins I get this great truth, that "God is for me.<a name=165:16></a>" It is through the work of Christ I am justified, but here God is looked at as the source of it all.<a name=165:17></a>

		I have it on my heart to say a few words on this chapter in reference specially to the character of sanctification.<a name=168:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At this moment, as we all know, the Lord was rejected.<a name=168:2></a> From chapter 13 we get Him speaking on this ground: "Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father.<a name=168:3></a>" All through the Gospel, from chapter I, He is unknown to the world, and rejected by the Jews.<a name=168:4></a> "He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<a name=168:5></a>" But from chapter 13 He speaks as going out of the world and ascending on high.<a name=168:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter, however, what is brought out is, that He came forth from the Father, not from God only; and this involves "eternal life": "To know thee [the Father] the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.<a name=168:7></a>" That is where eternal life comes in.<a name=168:8></a> Its character is that it is the knowledge of the Father; for the Father sent His onlybegotten Son, that we might live through Him.<a name=168:9></a> Of course, therein we know God also, "who by him do believe in God"; but it is in the knowledge of the Father, and Jesus sent by Him, that there is eternal life.<a name=168:10></a> And then the character in which we know Him is that of "holy Father"; and this is sanctification.<a name=168:11></a> When it is a question of the world, it is "righteous Father.<a name=168:12></a>" It is not that grace does not go out to poor sinners in the world to deliver them out of it, but that saints are not of it and have done with it.<a name=168:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In some places it is a current thought that Christ came into the world to connect Himself with humanity -- that He united Himself to man in the incarnation -- which is utter falsehood.<a name=168:14></a> He was a true man -- in one sense more man than we are, for a perfect thing is more than a corrupt thing.<a name=168:15></a> The union of God with man -- with humanity as it was -- is wholly unscriptural; there is none before redemption.<a name=168:16></a> Nor is it ever said that God, or a divine Person, united Himself to us.<a name=168:17></a> The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, true man in the flesh, but no union with us; and to maintain that there is is totally false.<a name=168:18></a> I refer to it, because it is very current among Christians of all shades and forms.<a name=168:19></a> The doctrine of Scripture is that we are united to Christ after redemption is accomplished -- to a glorified Christ.<a name=168:20></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone" -- entirely and totally alone.<a name=168:21></a>

		The state of the soul after death is a subject which deeply interests us all.<a name=178:1></a> The rejection of the coming again of Christ to receive the saints, and to judge the earth, before the end of the world, and the losing sight of the distinctive importance given to the resurrection in the New Testament, has given in the common evangelical faith, and that where sound in the main, an absolute character to the vague idea of going to heaven, exclusive of all other conception of happiness and glory.<a name=178:2></a> But Scripture spoke too plainly of the Lord's coming and the resurrection of the saints, to allow the thought of going to heaven when we die to maintain the absorbing place it held in the minds of the pious.<a name=178:3></a> Strange to say, going to heaven is not spoken of in Scripture, unless in the one case of the thief upon the cross going to be with Christ in paradise.<a name=178:4></a> Not that we do not go there; but the scriptural thought is always going to Christ.<a name=178:5></a> Since He is in heaven, of course we go there; but being with Christ, not being in heaven, is what Scripture puts forward, and this is important as to the state of the spiritual affections.<a name=178:6></a> Christ is the object before the soul, according to the word, not simply being happy in heaven, though we shall be happy and in heaven.<a name=178:7></a> I speak of it only as characterising our habits of thought.<a name=178:8></a> Poor human nature is apt to fall into Scylla to avoid Charybdis.<a name=178:9></a> It is apt, too, to follow its own thoughts, not simply to receive the word of God.<a name=178:10></a> There was a reaction, and the recovered truth of the Lord's coming and the first resurrection obtained an importance in some minds, which eclipsed the going to heaven when we die, too vague, and too little formally scriptural, to satisfy those awakened to search the word.<a name=178:11></a> It was stated that the soul sleeps, is unconscious, till the resurrection, even by some who, in the main, were sound in the faith; while with others this notion carried them on to deny not only the immediate bliss of the departed, with Christ, but that we <i>ever</i> went to heaven, and what constitutes distinctive Christian hope.<a name=178:12></a> Alas!<a name=178:13></a> soon very many were led to deny the fundamental doctrines of the gospel.<a name=178:14></a>

		My object now is not to enter into controversy with these last, who deny the immortality of the soul; it has been done, and done very effectually, by more than one; my object is to give a plain scriptural statement and proof from Scripture, that there is immediate happiness with Christ for the departed Christian.<a name=178:15></a> It is an intermediate state, and so, as to His position as a man, is Christ's though He be in glory.<a name=178:16></a> The departing Christian waits for the resurrection of the body -- and then only will he be in his final state in glory.<a name=178:17></a> Men speak of glorified spirits, Scripture never.<a name=178:18></a> The purpose of God as to us is, that we should be conformed to the image of His Son, that He may be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=178:19></a> "It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<a name=178:20></a>" "As we have borne the image of the earthy, so also we shall bear the image of the heavenly.<a name=178:21></a>" This was exhibited for a moment when Moses and Elias appeared in glory with Christ at the transfiguration.<a name=178:22></a> (See Romans 8: 29; 1 John 3: 2; 1 Corinthians 15: 49; Luke 9: 28-36.<a name=178:23></a>) This, and to be for ever with the Lord, received to Himself in the Father's house, is our eternal state of joy and glory.<a name=178:24></a> This latter part is seen also in the account of the transfiguration, in Luke, where they enter (Moses and Elias) into the cloud whence the Father's voice proceeded.<a name=178:25></a> (See also 1 Thessalonians 4: 17.<a name=178:26></a>) But this is our eternal state, when Christ shall have come and received us to Himself raised, or changed into His likeness, when our poor earthly body shall have been fashioned like His glorious body; Philippians 3: 21.<a name=178:27></a> God hath wrought us now already for this selfsame thing, and given to us the earnest of the Spirit; 2 Corinthians 5: 5.<a name=178:28></a> To be with the Lord and like the Lord for ever is our everlasting joy, and that the fruit of God's love, who has made us His children, and will bring us into the mansions prepared in our Father's house.<a name=178:29></a> Two things belong to us: first, to be like and with Christ Himself; and, secondly, to be blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Him.<a name=178:30></a> Redemption has made this ours; but we are not in possession.<a name=178:31></a> We have only the earnest of the Spirit, though God has wrought us for that selfsame thing.<a name=178:32></a>

		The first point, being like Christ, we have already spoken of, though what has been cited there introduces us with scriptural authority, to the second -- so shall we ever be with the Lord.<a name=179:1></a> But I add here other proofs of the second point, namely, that our portion is in heavenly places.<a name=179:2></a> It is distinctive of believers who have believed and suffered with Him.<a name=179:3></a> God, we are told, will gather together in one, under Christ, all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; Ephesians 1: 10.<a name=179:4></a> So we read all things were created by Christ and for Christ (Colossians 1: 16, 20); all things will be put under His feet as man; Hebrews 2; 1 Corinthians 1<i>5:</i> 27, 28; Ephesians 1: 22.<a name=179:5></a> But we read in Hebrews 2 that all things are not yet put under Him.<a name=179:6></a> He sits now on the Father's throne, not on His own; Revelation 3 .<a name=179:7></a> 21.<a name=179:8></a> God has said, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.<a name=179:9></a> He is (Hebrews 10) expecting till His enemies be made His footstool.<a name=179:10></a> The time will come when not only all things in heaven and earth will be reconciled (Colossians 1: 20), but even things under the earth, infernal things, will be forced to recognise His power and authority.<a name=179:11></a> Every knee shall bow to Him, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ, the despised and rejected of men, is Lord, to the glory of God the Father; Philippians 2: 10, 11.<a name=179:12></a> For this we must wait.<a name=179:13></a> But in this gathering of all things in heaven and earth under one head, Christ, <i>our</i> part is in heavenly places, and as it is our portion now in spirit, so it will be our part in glory.<a name=179:14></a> Nor is there any real separation between these two.<a name=179:15></a> Of course we are not in glory now, there is no need to insist on that, but that is our calling now, that which we are redeemed to, and wrought for, and wait for.<a name=179:16></a> <i>Now</i> we have the treasure in earthly vessels, and groan, being burdened.<a name=179:17></a> When we are out of the body groaning is over, and we are with Christ in joy; when He comes we shall have a body suited to that heavenly place, we shall be in glory.<a name=179:18></a> Thus (Ephesians 1: 3), "He hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ" (2 Corinthians 5: 1), "<i>We</i> know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens"; Philippians 3: 20, "Our conversation [citizenship, our relationship in life as Christians] is in heaven"; and in the same chapter, verse 14, where you have 'high calling,' the true force of the word is calling above, as may be seen in a Bible with a margin.<a name=179:19></a> We are called to be up above there.<a name=179:20></a> So, in Hebrews 6: 19, 20, we read that Christ is entered within the veil, that is, heaven itself; chapter 9: 24, and as our forerunner.<a name=179:21></a> So, Hebrews 3, we are partakers of the heavenly calling.<a name=179:22></a> As united to Christ by the Holy Ghost, we are sitting in heavenly places in Christ -- not <i>with</i> Him yet, but <i>in</i> Him, that is our place.<a name=179:23></a> So, when the Lord comes, He gathers, indeed, as Son of man, out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity.<a name=179:24></a> But the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=179:25></a> Hence, Moses and Elias not only are manifested in glory on earth, to shew the state of the saints in the kingdom, but they enter into the cloud, God's dwelling-place, whence the Father's voice came.<a name=179:26></a>

		It is thus clear that as God will gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven and on the earth, our part is to be like Christ in glory, and with Him for ever, and that in heaven itself, blessed with all spiritual blessings (as Israel with temporal ones) and in heavenly places (as they in earthly).<a name=181:1></a> If we are joint-heirs with Him (Romans 8: 17), we have what is yet better, to dwell in the Father's house where He is gone.<a name=181:2></a> Hence it is clearly and distinctly expressed (Colossians 1: 5), that our hope is laid up for us in heaven, and Peter tells us (1 Peter 1: 4) that an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, is reserved in heaven for us.<a name=181:3></a> All this clearly shews our blessings are where our hope enters, where our forerunner is gone; what our glory is, celestial, not terrestrial.<a name=181:4></a> We shall bear the image of the heavenly, and shall be for ever with the Lord.<a name=181:5></a> He has gone to prepare a place for us in the Father's house, and will come again to receive us there to Himself.<a name=181:6></a> He has declared, "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me be with me where I am.<a name=181:7></a>" One might expatiate on the blessedness of this, the wondrous place given to us, that in the ages to come He might shew the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus!<a name=181:8></a> but my object now is to give the scripture statement of our blessedness, and the proofs of it.<a name=181:9></a> What I have said gives our calling the same throughout, from the moment we are called, to the glory of eternity.<a name=181:10></a> There is no other, there is "one hope of our calling.<a name=181:11></a>" God has called us to His own kingdom and glory; we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<a name=181:12></a> Their Father's house is the home of His children.<a name=181:13></a> But this has not told us, in distinct statements, what the intermediate state is, though it has shewn us, as a general principle, where all our blessing is, what redemption has obtained for us.<a name=181:14></a> The God of all grace has called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus; wondrous love!<a name=181:15></a> but an integral part of Christ's own glory, for what is a Redeemer without His redeemed?<a name=181:16></a> And once I believe that the blessed Son of God has died for me as man on the cross, nothing that a creature whose life He has become, can have is too great, as the effect of it.<a name=181:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Revelation 1: 4-7; 22: 16-21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have taken these two passages which precede and come after all the prophetic part of the book, as giving us the relationships in which the saints stand to Christ, to whom the book is confided.<a name=190:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these opening verses we get an address, and the answer of heart in the saints to that address; and then, when the book closes, the address of the Lord to His people as the bride, and the answer.<a name=190:2></a> I desire to shew the place in which the Spirit of God sets the saints, and the connection of it with their character, affections, and duties.<a name=190:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One abstract remark may be made.<a name=190:4></a> Our affections and our duties flow from the relationship in which we are set.<a name=190:5></a> It is clear that if we are creatures of God, our duties as such flow from our knowledge of that.<a name=190:6></a> So with our earthly duties and affections -- they flow from our relationship one with another, whether as husband and wife, or father and child.<a name=190:7></a> It is a very simple remark, but of all importance, with regard to the saints' position.<a name=190:8></a> But then I must be in this relationship to have these affections, and I must know what the relationship is to which those duties belong.<a name=190:9></a> If I had no consciousness of being a child, and happened to meet my father, I should have no sense of the duties and affections belonging to me as a child.<a name=190:10></a> In order to have right affections, I must be <i>in</i> the relationship to which the affections belong, and I must <i>know</i> that I am in it too.<a name=190:11></a> The relationship must be known as mine, in order to possess the affections belonging to it.<a name=190:12></a> I cannot love Christ as a Saviour, if I do not know whether He is a Saviour or not to me; I cannot love God as a Father, if I am not sure whether or not I am a child.<a name=190:13></a> Now the importance of this is, that a full settled knowledge of salvation is the spring and foundation of our duties to God -- not only the knowledge of the fact of salvation, but of what that salvation has brought me into.<a name=190:14></a> It has made me a child, and I am bound to walk and feel as a child.<a name=190:15></a> It is so if I take Christ as He presents Himself at the end of this book: immediately the Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=190:16></a> If I do not know that I belong to the bride of Christ, how can I, when He thus presents Himself to me, say to Him, Come?<a name=190:17></a> It is the relationship in which I am from which all must flow, and no duties and affections are rightly founded until we know ourselves to be in this relationship to God.<a name=190:18></a> There may be a craving after the thing, and there will be.<a name=190:19></a> If I am an orphan, I would give anything to have a father; but I cannot have the affections of a child, because I have not got a father to love me.<a name=190:20></a> Wherever the divine nature is, there is the spring of these thoughts and feelings of love to God, and of holiness; but I cannot have them in perfection for my soul, because I have not the constant enjoyment of my relationship.<a name=190:21></a> A law may be imposed upon a person, but it never produces any affection.<a name=190:22></a> There may be a law which claims certain feelings and affections from me, but that gives no consciousness of the relationship by which these affections are produced: consequently it gives me no power.<a name=190:23></a> This is the real character of the law.<a name=190:24></a> Instead of being founded on a relationship that is existing, it promises that by keeping it I shall get life.<a name=190:25></a> If I keep the law without having real life, I am to get life by keeping it.<a name=190:26></a>

		I find that principle laid down in Scripture -- duty called for in order to the obtaining of life; but never does it produce the thing.<a name=191:1></a> Law claims from man what he ought to be, but it does not and cannot place man in any relationship with God, in which he may enjoy the blessing that belongs to God.<a name=191:2></a> Now it is not so with Christ.<a name=191:3></a> He <i>does</i> bring us, by the salvation which He has wrought, into relationship with God; He gives us a known settled place before God; and then our affections and duties flow from the place we are in.<a name=191:4></a> They are not the means of obtaining the place, but that which belongs to the place we are in.<a name=191:5></a> If we are the bride of Christ, we ought to have the feelings and wishes of one that is so.<a name=191:6></a> Throughout, when you enter into these verses, that suggests itself to the heart.<a name=191:7></a> In whatever way Christ is spoken of, there is at once what calls forth a response from the hearts of the saints.<a name=191:8></a> Whatever may be said as to His titles or offices, or what He is, the effect of speaking of Him with whom we are in relationship, is to awaken feelings in our own hearts of what He is to us.<a name=191:9></a> For instance, if I were to speak to a child of its father, as one who had eminently distinguished himself as a hero, or a statesman, the child's feeling at once would be, That is my father.<a name=191:10></a> He would not say, That is a great conqueror.<a name=191:11></a> The child's feeling would be, That great man is my father.<a name=191:12></a> So it would be with a wife.<a name=191:13></a> If she were told that such a person had greatly distinguished himself in any place, and she knew it was her husband, she would say, That is my husband; because all this glory awoke, in the mind of the child or the wife, the consciousness of the relationship in which they stood to the one to whom they belonged.<a name=191:14></a> Now that is the case with the church of God.<a name=191:15></a> You cannot speak of any glory of Christ or of God, that does not awaken in the heart of the saint the consciousness of what God and Christ are to itself.<a name=191:16></a> This is characteristic of the existence of such a relationship, and the affections that belong to it.<a name=191:17></a> You cannot speak of the person with whom others are in relationship, without awakening in their hearts the sense of what the person is to them.<a name=191:18></a>

		The whole character of this book is one of judgment.<a name=192:1></a> It is not the Father communicating with the church by means of the Holy Ghost which dwells in it.<a name=192:2></a> And when Christ is described, it is as One whose eyes are like a flame of fire, judging in the midst of the churches, or as One coming out of heaven on a white horse, a sharp sword going out of His mouth, that with it He should smite the nations.<a name=192:3></a> When it is God, He is sitting on a throne from whence lightnings and thunderings proceed, and sending out preliminary or final judgments on the earth.<a name=192:4></a>

		Now we shall find here, by the feelings that are expressed, the way in which the saint, the child of God, feels when Christ is brought forward.<a name=192:5></a> We shall find that, even when He is presented in judgment -- that is, in an earthly character -- the church has immediately awakened in her heart the place and relationship in which she stands to the one thus presented.<a name=192:6></a> Jesus, the Prince of the kings of the earth, is alluded to: at once the answer is, "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.<a name=192:7></a>" If the "Root and offspring of David" is named, the Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=192:8></a> It is the characteristic of the soul that lives in the conscious blessedness and enjoyment of an existing relationship with God.<a name=192:9></a> However Christ is presented, it is her own relationship with Him that is at once awakened in the bride.<a name=192:10></a> What I see in the word is not merely God visiting us as sinners, as He has done, but that when He has visited us, He has brought us into blessed connection with Himself, and having brought us there, He calls us, as in that connection, to live in the delight and in the duties that belong to it.<a name=192:11></a>

		We do not thoroughly understand how lost we are in our natural state, because we do not look simply to our place in Christ.<a name=192:12></a> It is in the measure that we understand that they who are in the flesh cannot please God, and that the flesh is not subject to God and cannot be remedied, that we are cast over by faith into our place in Christ.<a name=192:13></a> The moment I come to know that my relationship with God depends upon what He is for me, and what He has made me by grace in Himself, and not upon what I am to Him, it is all simple.<a name=192:14></a> It may astonish many to see that it does not depend upon what they are to Him.<a name=192:15></a> They will say, Are not men judged according to their works?<a name=192:16></a> To be sure they are.<a name=192:17></a> But who among you will stand this judgment?<a name=192:18></a> It is not merely a truth: but what is your condition if it is a truth?<a name=192:19></a> We are lost.<a name=192:20></a> We can only say, "Enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.<a name=192:21></a>" There is an end of all flesh as such.<a name=192:22></a> If Christ came, He came to call sinners -- to seek and save that which was lost.<a name=192:23></a> It was all a settled thing as to man in the flesh.<a name=192:24></a> You and I, looked at as moral responsible beings before God, have walked in such sort, that we could not stand in the judgment -- no one, not even a Christian, could.<a name=192:25></a> I am not talking of grace saving; but of man judged as a responsible being to God.<a name=192:26></a> If God deals with us on this ground, we could not, as Job says, answer Him one in a thousand.<a name=192:27></a> That we know to be true.<a name=192:28></a> There is not a single person, if it were a question of the most careless person in the world, who does not know that he cannot stand in the judgment.<a name=192:29></a> If he were brought today into the presence of God, he would do what Adam did -- go and hide himself if he could; he would not dare to stand and be judged of God.<a name=192:30></a> The saint knows it, but the sinner knows it too.<a name=192:31></a> As a present thing, he has no desire to be with God.<a name=192:32></a> If it was offered to ever such a decent man of the world to go to heaven today, he would not -- nor to-morrow either.<a name=192:33></a> When then is he to go?<a name=192:34></a> When he cannot help it.<a name=192:35></a> If he <i>must</i> die, he would rather go to heaven, but there is not a man of the world but would stay out of heaven as long as possible.<a name=192:36></a> If God reveals Himself in judgment, man will fly from Him; and when He revealed Himself in grace, what did man do?<a name=192:37></a> Spat upon Him, crucified Him.<a name=192:38></a> The story is told.<a name=192:39></a> Conscience tells us the one thing, and the facts of Christianity tell us the other: man would not have God.<a name=192:40></a> That is what we all are, and without any difference.<a name=192:41></a> Some may have produced more bad fruit than others, but we are all alike lost; and therefore God deals with us, consequent upon the death of Christ, on the ground that we are lost.<a name=192:42></a> It is of immense importance to see this fully, in order that we may fully enjoy God's love.<a name=192:43></a> "For a good man some would even dare to die.<a name=192:44></a>" "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<a name=192:45></a>" That is, I learn this -- that if I am bad, dreading judgment, and having no affections towards God, if God has loved me, it is according to the perfectness of His own nature.<a name=192:46></a> This is how grace meets a man's case.<a name=192:47></a> He is brought to this conviction, that he is a poor lost sinner with no desire after God -- a lost sinner after having been tried in every possible way -- tried without law, tried under law, and then tried by Christ, coming in grace to meet them in all their need.<a name=192:48></a> And what was the result?<a name=192:49></a> Man was lost, hopelessly lost.<a name=192:50></a> "We will not have this man to reign over us.<a name=192:51></a>" We will have the world without being troubled with God.<a name=192:52></a>

		Colossians 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of Colossians is that the saint is looked at as risen: we hear nothing of the Holy Ghost except the expression, "your love in the Spirit.<a name=210:1></a>" But it brings out the other side, Christ as life in us, more fully here than anywhere.<a name=210:2></a> Christ is in us, "Christ in you, the hope of glory.<a name=210:3></a>" The way the saint is looked at is as risen; the consequence is that he is not, as in Ephesians, in heavenly places.<a name=210:4></a> In Ephesians you have the work of the Spirit of God, and the presence of the Spirit revealing things above, and associating us with them: here in Colossians the saint is dead and risen with Christ, a risen man walking through the midst of this world.<a name=210:5></a> In Romans you see a living man actually in this world, as we all are, Christ being his life, and rejoicing in the hope of the glory of God.<a name=210:6></a> We find, therefore, in Romans that a man is to yield himself to God; whereas in Ephesians we are looked at as coming from God to shew God's character in this world.<a name=210:7></a> If you are able to do what is in Ephesians, you will be able to do what is in Romans.<a name=210:8></a> Christ had given Himself a dying sacrifice; you are to give yourself a living one.<a name=210:9></a> In Ephesians we have, "Be ye therefore imitators of God as dear children" (Ephesians 5: 1); this goes farther.<a name=210:10></a> What Colossians gives us is, not heavenly places, but that we are dead with Christ, and risen with Him, and this life is fully developed here.<a name=210:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see the way the Christian is to live, and this founded on the place in which he has been put by grace.<a name=210:12></a> After that he speaks of all things as to be reconciled to God, while the church He has reconciled.<a name=210:13></a> First he takes the great truth of what our life is and our walk, and what it is founded on.<a name=210:14></a> There is a path in this world, the spring and character of which is that God's will is in it, a path the vulture's eye has not seen, which was perfectly fulfilled in Christ.<a name=210:15></a> "He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked," 1 John 2: 6.<a name=210:16></a> The saint is given a path through this world which has nothing to do with the world, but which displays the character of Christ in it.<a name=210:17></a> "But I say unto you that ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also," Matthew 5: 39.<a name=210:18></a> This would not be righteousness, but Christ displayed.<a name=210:19></a> You will see this immense privilege of walking down here like Christ, who could speak of Himself as "the Son of man who is in heaven," who lived a heavenly -- more than this, a divine -- life down here.<a name=210:20></a> There was not a single motive in Christ which governed the world, or a single motive in the world which governed Christ.<a name=210:21></a> "I will even make a way in the wilderness" (Isaiah 43: 19), that is the Christian's path.<a name=210:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a path which the saint has to tread through this world, which is God's path for him in it.<a name=211:19></a> God puts him to walk there to test the state of his soul, whether he has wisdom and spiritual understanding.<a name=211:20></a> "If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light," Luke 11: 36.<a name=211:21></a> A candle not only is light itself, but it gives light to all around.<a name=211:22></a> "In thy light we shall see light.<a name=211:23></a>" "The spiritual man discerneth all things," there is progress in this surely; the measure of it we get in the next verse, "That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.<a name=211:24></a>" Suppose I did not know my Father, I should not know how to walk worthy of Him.<a name=211:25></a> But the babes do know Him.<a name=211:26></a>

		The apostle was anxious about them, because they were constantly mixed up with these things -- living in the midst of these Greek philosophers.<a name=222:1></a> Although he had never been there, yet his heart knew experimentally by the power of the Holy Ghost what the snares were, and he says, "I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you.<a name=222:2></a>" He felt the dangers that were there, and he looked on these saints as belonging to Christ, whom he so loved and laboured for, and he shewed interest in them.<a name=222:3></a>

		Verse 2.<a name=222:4></a> Here I get the understanding of the mystery of God, and that is another thing altogether.<a name=222:5></a> It is not the way we are accustomed to understand the word "mystery," as a thing not to be found out; but it is a thing only known by revelation -- it is not known save to the initiated.<a name=222:6></a> It is that which by divine revelation and teaching we know, and it brings us into a totally new world.<a name=222:7></a>

		You get, then, another important thing needed.<a name=222:8></a> Supposing I was the greatest scientist in the world, there is not a bit of love about it: it is connected with nobody, and there is not an atom of soul-work in it.<a name=222:9></a> Therefore God cannot be known, for God is love.<a name=222:10></a> Faith gives us an inlet into all the things that love has done.<a name=222:11></a> Science is as cold as ice -- dead cold: you cannot let a bit of feeling in.<a name=222:12></a> There is no relationship with anything in the world or any One above it (verse 2).<a name=222:13></a> But revelation lets in "To the acknowledgment of the mystery of God" -- God the source of their life, God the One who dwells there by the Holy Ghost among them, and gives the feeling that flows from the relationship into which they are brought.<a name=222:14></a> The mind may get developed, but there is no moral [motive?<a name=222:15></a>] in it -- it is not in its nature.<a name=222:16></a> The Christian acts by a motive.<a name=222:17></a> Science does not touch the ground that the soul is on.<a name=222:18></a> What has feeling to do with the discovery of how the physical nature works?<a name=222:19></a> In Christ I learn the blessed truth, that God dwells in me by the power of the Spirit in the divine nature, and I have communion with the Father and the Son.<a name=222:20></a> I get into a new world altogether.<a name=222:21></a>

		The third thing goes much higher -- "Full assurance of understanding" -- for it is part of God's plan and counsel in Christ; and if we are not there, Christ's glory is not complete, and it cannot be otherwise.<a name=223:17></a> "We have the mind of Christ.<a name=223:18></a>" If I have the full assurance of hope, then I see these things as a part of God's plan and Christ's glory, and that is the full assurance of understanding.<a name=223:19></a>

		Now the apostle turns to a special thing which was their difficulty then, that, while he gives the whole scope of God's mind in the mystery, he goes down and deals with this fleshly religion.<a name=226:1></a> The Colossians were accustomed to be in the midst of these things.<a name=226:2></a> The Jewish system was bringing out for us whether man in the flesh could have to do with God.<a name=226:3></a> How many souls there are now under the law in their hearts (they are lawless if they are not)!<a name=226:4></a> You must get the knowledge of sin by the law, if rightly applied.<a name=226:5></a> It is man, as responsible man, getting a perfect rule of what he ought to be, and circumcision is merely the expression of that -- death of the flesh.<a name=226:6></a> All that was shadowed forth in those things you have in Christ.<a name=226:7></a>

		The apostle turns more to details to shew where we are as Christians (verse 11).<a name=226:8></a> A totally new thing it is -- the putting off the body of the flesh.<a name=226:9></a> They never had circumcision in the wilderness, not till they crossed the Jordan -- a figure of our dying with Christ.<a name=226:10></a> Gilgal was the place where they rolled away the reproach of the world.<a name=226:11></a> I get the same here.<a name=226:12></a> Before it was a circumcision made with hands; now it is without: I have the true circumcision.<a name=226:13></a> Instead of the mere outward ritual of the thing, I have the thing itself; I am complete in Christ.<a name=226:14></a> How so?<a name=226:15></a> Why I am dead and gone!<a name=226:16></a> I have put off the old man altogether; I am not speaking of carrying it out: this you get in 2 Corinthians 4: 10.<a name=226:17></a> A risen Christ is my life, all connection with this world is gone.<a name=226:18></a> I am dead to sin, and alive to God.<a name=226:19></a> I have put off the body of the flesh, I have died with Christ.<a name=226:20></a> I reckon myself dead; I have got a risen Christ as my life; to faith then I have done with this flesh -- done with it altogether.<a name=226:21></a> I have got this new thing; I am in it (of course I am in this poor earthly tabernacle still, but) I do not belong to this world; I have died through the death of Christ.<a name=226:22></a> It is not merely saying you must die -- saying "you must" does not give a thing.<a name=226:23></a> If you have died with Christ, you are risen with Him -- you have left it all behind.<a name=226:24></a> It is the very character and meaning of baptism.<a name=226:25></a> With Christ I died, I am baptised to Christ's death.<a name=226:26></a> Here am I, a living man, and I go through death with Christ (an outward sign, of course) -- a person who has gone with Christ into His grave, and come up out of it again.<a name=226:27></a> He passed out of the condition He was in here as a man on the earth into a totally new place -- God raised Him from the dead.<a name=226:28></a> You then get, "Wherein also ye are risen with him," etc.<a name=226:29></a> As a Christian you are risen.<a name=226:30></a> I have got into this new state; I say, That is myself, for I am a Christian.<a name=226:31></a>

		And now we get much further light on our condition.<a name=227:1></a> "And you being dead in your sins" (verse 13).<a name=227:2></a> I was living in sins in the other, but the truth of "dead in sins" goes a good deal farther: alive as regards my sins, but dead as regards God.<a name=227:3></a> This goes farther, and takes up the nature that likes doing them.<a name=227:4></a> There is not one single thing in your heart with which God could link Himself.<a name=227:5></a> "They that are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=227:6></a>" There is nothing in heaven your nature would like.<a name=227:7></a>

		I get now, not merely "quickened," but "quickened together with him" (verse 13); because, supposing I am alive, I may be spiritually alive, or I may be in Romans 7.<a name=227:8></a> Any one there says, "I think Christ is precious to me, and I love His word and His people," but he is examining himself to find out if he is in the new creation.<a name=227:9></a> Like the prodigal, he has not met the father; but this is not quickened together with Christ -- quickened, no doubt, and when I speak of being quickened in that way, it is the divine operation of a new life in my soul.<a name=227:10></a> But quickened together with Christ is different.<a name=227:11></a> Where do I see Christ Himself?<a name=227:12></a> Not as quickener, but as quickened.<a name=227:13></a> Christ as man has been raised from the dead.<a name=227:14></a> He died under our sins -- for them; He went on unto death for us, and God has raised Him up, and, supposing I am a believer, I am raised up with Him.<a name=227:15></a> If I look at myself, it is as raised with Christ, as it says here, "Quickened together with him.<a name=227:16></a>" It looks at Christ as a dead man, but that in coming down to death He put away my sins, and therefore I am raised with Him.<a name=227:17></a> It is not merely the fact that I have life; I have life in a new condition where Christ is.<a name=227:18></a> I have got into a new place before God -- Christ's place -- and all my sins are left on the other side of Christ's grave.<a name=227:19></a> I do not own the old man, it is the horrid thing that has been deceiving me.<a name=227:20></a>

		There are two more things I would just mention.<a name=227:21></a> There are these ordinances -- all "blotted out.<a name=227:22></a>" All the things the flesh can do in order to gain acceptance are dead in the flesh that did them.<a name=227:23></a> Where do I find Christ now that we are risen?<a name=227:24></a> Where do I find Christ in the Lord's supper?<a name=227:25></a> It is His death.<a name=227:26></a> "Bringing Christ into the elements," as people say; there is no such thing, for it is a dead Christ.<a name=227:27></a> The shed blood shews forth His death, and there is no such Christ now.<a name=227:28></a> After His resurrection He is alive, death can have no more dominion over Him.<a name=227:29></a> And so baptism, as to its signification; it is unto His death: I have gone down with Christ to death, and I am risen with Him.<a name=227:30></a>

		Only one thing more.<a name=228:1></a> In order to bring us thus complete in Him, there were other things against us -- these "principalities and powers" (verse 15).<a name=228:2></a> Christ has destroyed Satan's power in the cross; I was a living man in sin -- that is gone.<a name=228:3></a> Then all those ordinances I was bound to -- they are gone.<a name=228:4></a> Well, then, Satan's power (not that he has not power) -- Christ has triumphed over him, "Through death destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil"; so death has lost its power too.<a name=228:5></a> The cross of Christ has closed the history of the old man, and of all its associations.<a name=228:6></a> I was a slave of sin, "I am quickened together with him" -- a slave to ordinances, they are "nailed to his cross" -- a slave to Satan, his power is destroyed.<a name=228:7></a> I am risen with Christ beyond these things, and that is where the Christian is.<a name=228:8></a> I am going to have an everlasting holiday; I have it even now in spirit.<a name=228:9></a> I am going to God's rest in heaven.<a name=228:10></a> I do not keep days, for this is going back to heathenism.<a name=228:11></a> Do you think the sun going round will make them keep days in heaven?<a name=228:12></a> It is an everlasting holiday; it is only in our hearts now, for if we follow Christ, we learn its sorrows and griefs too, for He was "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.<a name=228:13></a>" We are taken out of all the speculation of philosophy, for we are in a world into which it cannot get.<a name=228:14></a>

		Our being sealed with the Spirit is too important a 'point to allow it to settle down into the ambiguity and mist into which it is fallen in many souls.<a name=254:1></a> The Scripture is plain and positive on the subject, and it constitutes, not the foundation, but what is specifically characteristic, of the Christian state.<a name=254:2></a> Details and experiences as to it may require detailed inquiry, and sound and enlarged spiritual experience.<a name=254:3></a> But the presence, and as to the individual the indwelling, of the Holy Ghost, constitute Christianity, and the Christian state of the individual.<a name=254:4></a>

		When John the Baptist proclaimed Christ to his disciples, he announced Him under two characters: "The Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world," and "He it is that baptiseth with the Holy Ghost," the last being evidenced by the Holy Ghost descending and abiding upon Christ Himself.<a name=254:5></a> All the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Him bodily, but He as man, and He alone until redemption was accomplished, was sealed and anointed with the Holy Ghost -- in His case a testimony to His own perfectness; "and John saw and bare record that he was the Son of God," John 1: 29-34; Acts 10: 19; John 6: 27.<a name=254:6></a> So He was led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<a name=254:7></a> By the Spirit of God He cast out demons.<a name=254:8></a> By the eternal Spirit He offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=254:9></a> He spoke the words of God, for the Spirit was not given to Him by measure.<a name=254:10></a> If it was by resurrection He was declared Son of God with power, it was according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=254:11></a>

		I refer to these passages, and many more connected with the point might be quoted, to shew the immense importance of this fact.<a name=254:12></a> His being sealed was the testimony to His own perfectness; in us it is the fruit and seal of redemption.<a name=254:13></a> But if it sealed the Person and character of Christ, and that it was by this power He wrought as man, and we are made partakers of it consequent on redemption, its importance, though not the foundation, can hardly be overrated, and the connection of our position with Him is brought into a wonderful light: he alone possessing it while He was alive here below, but competent to confer it on us when gone on high, and redemption had qualified us for receiving it.<a name=254:14></a> The coming or baptism of the Holy Ghost was consequent on the exaltation of Christ.<a name=254:15></a> Christianity, which as I have said is characterised by His presence, could not exist until Christ was glorified (John 7: 39); and Christ when exalted received the Holy Ghost as to the exalted man anew in order to its being sent down; Acts 2: 33.<a name=254:16></a> This is confirmed as to its being sent by the words of the Lord Himself.<a name=254:17></a> "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go away, I will send him unto you," John 16: 7.<a name=254:18></a>

		The presence of the Holy Ghost was specifically and distinctively the consequence of the glorifying of Jesus, who had accomplished the work that saves us, in dying, shedding His blood for us as man, and rising again.<a name=262:1></a> Thus there is evidently a double part as to Christ Himself, His suffering in obedience unto death, drinking for us that dreadful cup, the thought of which made Him shed, as it were, great drops of blood, and, as a consequence of that, His being glorified.<a name=262:2></a> The former was the accomplishment of redemption demonstrated by His resurrection, or our faith would be vain; if He were not risen, we should be yet in our sins.<a name=262:3></a> He would be lying in death as another.<a name=262:4></a> Subjectively, man was in his new state in Christ risen.<a name=262:5></a> Hence we read, "He was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.<a name=262:6></a>" He has loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood.<a name=262:7></a> The latter, His being glorified, is what He is entered into and has obtained for us, but which, though happy meanwhile if we depart, we shall not possess till He comes again to receive us to Himself.<a name=262:8></a> It is evident from Scripture that the Holy Ghost came down when Jesus was glorified, His work being accomplished; but when we by faith have part in the accomplished salvation, but have not yet attained the glory, He is the seal of faith in the one, and the earnest of the other.<a name=262:9></a> For in Christ all is accomplished, and He is entered as our Forerunner; and the Holy Ghost sent down and dwelling and ministering in us gives the full consciousness of the fruit of the one in forgiveness, and of our place in Christ.<a name=262:10></a> He gives withal the consciousness of being sons, and if sons, then heirs.<a name=262:11></a> Born again we must be to have the smallest part in these things, but it is faith in Christ's work which is sealed by the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=262:12></a>

		I have said that chapter 6 gives us the basis of this in doctrine.<a name=266:1></a> We are baptised, our profession of Christianity is to Christ's death, our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin, as a whole in its concrete form, might be destroyed.<a name=266:2></a> There is an end of our old Adam state by the cross.<a name=266:3></a> Christ died (not here for our sins, but) to sin, and we are baptized to His death, are to reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God, not in Adam, but in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=266:4></a> All that is in the Father's glory, what He is as displayed and surrounds Himself with according to what He is, was engaged in the resurrection of Christ; holiness, righteousness, majesty, love to the Son, recognition of what He had done, supremacy above all evil in light and love, and Christ as man rises by and into it, and that as having perfectly glorified God, where all was exactly contrary to it.<a name=266:5></a> And we are alive in Him, have Him risen as the life suited to it.<a name=266:6></a> We may have it in an earthen vessel, but it is our place with God.<a name=266:7></a> In this the flesh has no possible part.<a name=266:8></a> As man, Christ entered into it through death, closing (Himself ever sinless and apart) all connection with man as born of Adam; a true real man and Son of man, but Head, as risen of a new race and state.<a name=266:9></a> It is right to remark that He never united Himself to men -- a common and ruinous doctrine.<a name=266:10></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.<a name=266:11></a>" He alone, as we have seen, was anointed of the Holy Ghost, and sealed of God the Father, still a true man come of a woman, come under law, and in the likeness of sinful flesh, and going with the godly remnant as associating Himself with them.<a name=266:12></a> He was there a man amongst men, but that association was closed by death, save as Lord over them.<a name=266:13></a> We are united to Him in His new and glorious state as Head; Ephesians 1, 2.<a name=266:14></a> But this is <i>kaine ktisis</i>, a new creation.<a name=266:15></a> But to return to our direct subject.<a name=266:16></a>

		"We are crucified with him.<a name=267:1></a>" Here it is our "old man.<a name=267:2></a>" We are still in the body, but we are not on the old standing-ground with God, we have died out of it in Christ, we are crucified with Him, we reckon ourselves as dead to sin here (to the world in Colossians), and alive in Him to God; our old Adam standing before God is gone by death, and we are in Christ, alive to God in Him, to give ourselves up to God as those that are in Him alive from the dead, and free to do so in this new life.<a name=267:3></a> We are not looked at as risen with Christ in Romans, but justified, and Christ our life, as men living in natural life down here, only Christ our life in it, in Him before God, not in the flesh.<a name=267:4></a>

		Now the first part of the epistle brings us from conscious guilt into divine favour and knowledge of divine love, as justified by Christ's work; the second, into the knowledge of ourselves as having died with Christ to our old state, and being in Him before God.<a name=267:5></a> Our profession is not merely believing in Christ, but being brought into His death, baptised to it as our portion.<a name=267:6></a> But the first is complete and absolute.<a name=267:7></a> The <i>doctrine</i> of sealing is not found here; but the person is sealed, a guilty person restored to God's favour, and enjoying His love, reconciled to Him, and delighting in Him.<a name=267:8></a> I repeat, the first part is complete in itself; the man is a pardoned, justified man, enjoying God's favour, His love in his heart by the Holy Ghost given to him, and rejoicing in the hope of glory.<a name=267:9></a> It is judicial.<a name=267:10></a> Eternal life is not a present existence, but given to those who continue patiently in well-doing (indeed it is always a future thing in Romans, where not merely a general fact of grace); only God commends His love toward us.<a name=267:11></a>

		Our state and standing out of Christ and in Christ is another and distinct point, but when in Christ the sealing of the Holy Ghost is here also assumed and developed.<a name=267:12></a> It is specifically taught in Ephesians and 2 Corinthians, but always as that of believers, that is, of those who have life already, and are washed in the blood of the Lamb.<a name=267:13></a> <i>Christianity is not known in its real character where this is not</i>.<a name=267:14></a> The starting-point of this, as to our standing, is -- we have been baptised to Christ's death, our old man is crucified with Christ, so that we should not serve sin.<a name=267:15></a> It is done with for faith, we are set free.<a name=267:16></a> But is there no remedy, no ameliorating the old man, no power in the new to walk out of and independent of it?<a name=267:17></a> There is no amelioration nor power in the new to go right by itself, even when one wills it.<a name=267:18></a> If righteousness is to be had in our fallen Adam state (in the flesh), then the law is the measure.<a name=267:19></a> But the flesh is not subject to the law of God, nor can be -- law, no doubt, in its spiritual character, for law forbids lust, and the flesh lusts.<a name=267:20></a> To stand before God on this ground is therefore a hopeless matter, but the question is, in this part of Romans, our standing before Him.<a name=267:21></a>

		And now mark that in the parenthetical chapter 7, which treats of the bearing of law on the question, we have two states of the soul, both when quickened, not of progress or degree, but absolutely incompatible -- so incompatible, that one cannot exist if the other does, a relative position in one of which the soul is connected with law as with a husband, in the other with Christ risen from the dead.<a name=269:1></a> The soul has died in the first, so as to have done with it, died away out of it, only as crucified with Christ, or it would have been condemnation as well as death; 2 Corinthians 3; Galatians 4.<a name=269:2></a> We are dead to the law by the body of Christ, that we might be married to another; we could not have two husbands at once.<a name=269:3></a> Then we get the experimental effect of the law, as seen and estimated by the light of Christianity.<a name=269:4></a> It awoke, and as an occasion provoked sin.<a name=269:5></a>

		The experience of chapter 7 is not the cry of a man in it not knowing what it is, but the estimate of it by one who can judge of it with spiritual knowledge.<a name=269:6></a> We, we Christians as such, so the expression is ever used, we know that the law is spiritual.<a name=269:7></a> As to the fact, no one was ever in such a state, the will always perfectly right, and the doing always wrong.<a name=269:8></a> It is the working of the law when the will is renewed, but the man is under law, and as to the thoughts of his relationship with God he is in the flesh, loving obedience and God's law, but judging of God's thoughts of him from what he is himself, which is the opposite of grace.<a name=269:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The law is seen to be spiritual in its requirements, his conscience consents to it as good, his heart delights in it after the inner man, but he does not succeed in keeping it.<a name=269:10></a> He is <i>captive</i> to the law of sin which is in his members.<a name=269:11></a> To will is present with him, but how to perform the good he finds not.<a name=269:12></a> Now this is experience looked at by a delivered person, but of a person clearly undelivered, a person under law, a man when he was in the flesh.<a name=269:13></a> He learns, thus looking at it, not guilt, but that there is no good <i>in</i> him, that is, in his flesh; next, that it is not himself, since he hates it; thirdly, that it is too strong for him -- he cannot succeed in his will to do right.<a name=269:14></a> It is a lesson of two things -- that there is no good in the flesh when estimated spiritually, and next, that we have no power.<a name=269:15></a> To distinguish the sin from oneself is often a relief, but not deliverance.<a name=269:16></a> Now it is of all importance that he should know, and experimentally know, what flesh is, and so what it is to be under law; but God has no pleasure in keeping him there when he has learned it.<a name=269:17></a> But it is not the Christian state.<a name=269:18></a> There is conflict to the end when we are delivered, but then that is in the Christian: the flesh lusts against the Spirit.<a name=269:19></a> Here there is no question of the Spirit, nor of Christ, save in contrast, another husband, which you cannot have at the same time.<a name=269:20></a> As to this the chapter is positive.<a name=269:21></a> We cannot have two husbands at the same time.<a name=269:22></a> If I have learned the love of God in the gift of His Son, and my standing is there, divine acceptance does not rest on what I am for God -- under law it does.<a name=269:23></a>

		Ask them what it means, when it says that by one offering He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified; they cannot tell you: each sin, after its commission, has to find its forgiveness as and when it may; and people are taught that it is a very dangerous doctrine to think otherwise.<a name=275:1></a> Now there is an interruption of communion; there is a gracious washing of the feet with water; but when I have believed in Christ's work there is no more imputation of sin, I am perfected as to conscience.<a name=275:2></a> We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.<a name=275:3></a> He who bore our sins, and put them away long ago, is there.<a name=275:4></a> We must not confound the work of the Spirit, which makes me own my faults, and the work of Christ, finished and effectual once and for ever.<a name=275:5></a> He bore my sins when I had not committed one of them, and if forgiveness, in the sense of non-imputation, has to be gained now, it would be impossible; for Christ would have to suffer for them as the apostle says, "For then he must often have suffered from the foundation of the world.<a name=275:6></a>" Hence he who has not the sense of redemption in his soul by faith, and he who really has, are by current teaching put on the same footing, though one has the Spirit of adoption, and the other has not -- one looks for mercy, not yet obtained by faith, and the other, with God, cries Abba, Father; but both are taught to suppose sin imputable alike, and to search if they are children, and the delivered man is thrown back by false teaching under law in Romans 7.<a name=275:7></a> If you can really cry, Abba, Father, you are surely sealed; but then no sin can be imputed to you, or Christ is dead in vain.<a name=275:8></a> Judaism was, as to that, better than this half Christianity.<a name=275:9></a> There, if a man sinned, was a sacrifice, and his sin was forgiven.<a name=275:10></a> Here, once, perhaps, pardoned for what was gone before, he has nothing but uncertainty for all that follows.<a name=275:11></a> But Christ has obtained eternal redemption, and blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes no sin.<a name=275:12></a> And the work being complete, and he who is sanctified perfected for ever, the worshipper <i>once purged</i> has no more conscience of sins, and Christ is <i>sitting down</i> on the Father's throne because all is finished.<a name=275:13></a> Of this the Holy Ghost is the witness; being born of God is not.<a name=275:14></a>

		Take what is said by the Lord; and this will lead us to the question of the Holy Ghost.<a name=285:1></a> Than John Baptist no greater prophet had ever arisen, and of those born of woman none greater; but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.<a name=285:2></a> Many kings, prophets, righteous men, had desired to see the things which the disciples saw, and had not seen them; but "blessed," says the Lord, "are your eyes, for they see.<a name=285:3></a>" They were more blessed than their kings and prophets -- they had Messiah with them.<a name=285:4></a> But so great was the privilege and advantage of having the Holy Ghost, that it was expedient that Christ should leave them; for if He did not, the Comforter would not come; but if He went away, He would send Him.<a name=285:5></a> What a thing to lose, Christ's personal presence in grace!<a name=285:6></a> Yet so great was to be the effect of the coming of the Holy Spirit, that it was better He should go.<a name=285:7></a> But they would persuade us that He had been there all the time of the Old Testament!<a name=285:8></a> (See 1 Peter 1.<a name=285:9></a>) They searched their own prophecies, and found they did not minister to themselves, but to us, the things now reported by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=285:10></a> Was the promise to pour out the Spirit "nothing"?<a name=285:11></a> Clearly it was not anything if He was there all the time as when poured out.<a name=285:12></a>

		And now mark the foundation of this immense truth.<a name=285:13></a> God never dwelt with Adam innocent, nor with Abraham or others; but as soon as a redemption, external even, was accomplished, we read, "They shall know (Exodus 29) that I, Jehovah their God, have brought them up out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them"; and the Shechinah of glory came down and sat between the cherubim, and led them in the wilderness.<a name=285:14></a> So it was, when an eternal and full redemption had been accomplished, and man (though much more than a man) sat down in virtue of it at the right hand of God, that the Holy Ghost came down to dwell in God's people individually and collectively.<a name=285:15></a>

		We must not confound between the divine action of the Holy Ghost and His coming.<a name=285:16></a> I think it will be found in Scripture that all direct action of God from creation is by the Holy Ghost.<a name=285:17></a> Even Christ could say, "If I by the Holy Ghost cast out demons.<a name=285:18></a>" At any rate He moved on the face of the waters; by His Spirit God garnished the heavens; He inspired the prophets, and wrought all through the divine history; but this was not His personal coming.<a name=285:19></a> So the Son created all things, but He did not come until the incarnation.<a name=285:20></a> "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father," John 16: 28.<a name=285:21></a> So speaks Christ of the Holy Ghost: "If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go away, I will send him unto you, and when he is come," etc.<a name=285:22></a> (John 16: 7, 8.<a name=285:23></a>) And this was so distinct a thing, that it is called "The Holy Ghost" without saying came, or given, or anything else.<a name=285:24></a> Thus John 7: 39, "For the Holy Ghost was not yet" -- <i>given</i> is added -- "for Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=285:25></a>" So the disciples, baptised by John in Acts 19: 2, said, "We have not so much as heard whether the Holy Ghost is.<a name=285:26></a>"

		All Jews knew the being of the Holy Ghost; but this was His promised presence, and this is easily understood as to John's disciples, because he had spoken of Christ's work as twofold: -- He was "the Lamb of God," and "he it is that baptiseth with the Holy Ghost"; which was the second great part of His work -- baptising with the Holy Ghost -- and could not be done till He was glorified.<a name=286:1></a> So He tells His disciples after His resurrection, "Ye shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.<a name=286:2></a>"He Himself was anointed and sealed with the Holy Ghost when He stood, the first man fully, perfectly, acceptable to God, who had ever existed since evil entered, perfect in Himself.<a name=286:3></a> God "anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power.<a name=286:4></a>"

		As regards the first part of the question -- the source of power is the same in the church now as it was in the days of the apostles, but its exercise manifestly is not the same.<a name=298:1></a> "Our word," says the apostle, "was in demonstration of the Spirit, and with power.<a name=298:2></a>" I believe that the demonstration was the external witness of the power, the exhibition of the deposit that was in the church to the world.<a name=298:3></a> As it regards the question of the power in the church being the same as in the days of the apostles, it does not exist; there can be no question as to that.<a name=298:4></a> If we come to discipline in the church, there is no limit to its power but the extent of its existence.<a name=298:5></a> We have not, in fact, the same power in exercise as the apostles had.<a name=298:6></a> I see two distinct divisions in the apostolic office: the one antecedent altogether to the church as gathered by testimony; the other did not exist till the Holy Ghost was poured out on the day of Pentecost.<a name=298:7></a>

		On the other hand as to God's dealing with His children in discipline, I do not believe that there is such a thing as God's hiding His face from a Christian: his standing is in God's faithfulness, and God looks on His people in Christ; but I do know that His people get out of communion themselves.<a name=304:1></a> I believe that, as to fact, communion may exist, and people think, because of it, that they have none.<a name=304:2></a> The feeling of finding out that you have been far from God is because you have found out His presence, which discovers to you the evil of the state you have been in, which was the lesson you wanted to learn.<a name=304:3></a> If a child had been slighting his father's commands, when he was in his father's presence, it would make him feel very uncomfortable, because it would bring to his mind his disobedience.<a name=304:4></a>

		REPLY TO JUDGE MARSHALL'S TRACT ON THE TENETS OF THE PLYMOUTH BRETHREN (SO CALLED)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is sufficient fairness in the statement of Mr.<a name=323:1></a> Marshall, in rejecting the greater part of the stupid charges in the paper he quotes, to make it easy as well as pleasant to deal calmly with his objections on other heads of doctrine.<a name=323:2></a> Though on one head Mr.<a name=323:3></a> Marshall is roused, in general he quietly discusses the merits of the case before him.<a name=323:4></a> I cannot be surprised that a Wesleyan minister should hold Wesleyan doctrine, though I may not agree with him; and I can assure Mr.<a name=323:5></a> Marshall, that (though he mistakes the Brethren's doctrine in some points, and I think of course there is ignorance of Scripture truth on others, yet seeing the spirit in which Brethren are generally assailed) I have rather to thank him for that in which he has spoken, than to complain of it.<a name=323:6></a> The best return I can make (assuring him at the same time of my sincerity in thus recognising the tone of his pamphlet, and my desire to reciprocate it) is to state what I, at least, hold on the questioned points, and to inquire whether the views he objects to, so far as they are justly stated, are supported by Scripture.<a name=323:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall only take up the really important questions.<a name=323:8></a> They are four: first, "The moral law is not the rule of Christian life"; secondly, "The doctrine of imputed righteousness"; thirdly, "Abraham has no place in the church, nor could any saint have till the Holy Ghost came after the ascension"; fourthly, "Sanctification," which is treated by Mr.<a name=323:9></a> Marshall in his remarks on imputed righteousness.<a name=323:10></a> There are other collateral points, as ordination to ministry, praying for the Holy Ghost, the sabbath, which I may touch on: the latter will come naturally under the head of law, and our deliverance from it.<a name=323:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our subjection to the law is a capital point.<a name=323:12></a> But the whole principle on which Scripture places the question is unknown to the writer of the pamphlet; namely, that the law has power over a man as long as he lives, but that we have died in Christ, and are not looked at as being in the flesh at all; not in the first Adam, but in the Last.<a name=323:13></a>

		Let Mr.<a name=324:1></a> Marshall allow me first to quote what Scripture says as to the law and our relationship to it.<a name=324:2></a> And first in Romans, in which epistle, and in that to the Galatians, the apostle has chiefly discussed the subject.<a name=324:3></a> I cannot but think that what he says must give subject for thought to those who insist on law.<a name=324:4></a> Many passages are much stronger in the original through the omission of the definite article inserted in English: thus, "But now the righteousness of God apart from law," that is, on wholly another ground, so that the question of moral and ceremonial law cannot be raised.<a name=324:5></a> It is apart from law in every shape and form.<a name=324:6></a> So in many other cases.<a name=324:7></a> But I shall take the ordinary English translation: enough will be found there to make all clear.<a name=324:8></a> Further, I am quite aware that it is alleged that they do not look to be justified by law, but only to be under it as a rule of life.<a name=324:9></a> Let the reader only pay attention to what the word of God says, and all will be clear as to this too.<a name=324:10></a> I will speak of it, moreover, further on.<a name=324:11></a> I desire that Scripture may be before the mind of Christians, so I will quote it; I can add any comments afterward.<a name=324:12></a>

		But further, although there be confusion of mind, and men really seek righteousness by the law, that is, by works, yet it is in terms generally admitted that the statements of the apostle set the law aside as a means of justification.<a name=328:1></a> His statements are too plain, for a person who respects the word of God, to contravene them.<a name=328:2></a> "If righteousness come by law, then Christ is dead in vain," "That no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident," and many other such, are too plain to resist.<a name=328:3></a> We read, "Christ is become of no effect to you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace," Galatians 5: 4.<a name=328:4></a> But they say, we take it as a rule of life: sanctification is as necessary as justification.<a name=328:5></a> Now that without holiness no man shall see the Lord is clearly written, and is assuredly true.<a name=328:6></a> I should have a great deal to say to this connected with a new life, Christ being our life; but at present I confine myself to our immediate subject.<a name=328:7></a> The question is: is the law the means of living rightly?<a name=328:8></a> Will a man under the law be victorious over sin?<a name=328:9></a> It is not whether a man must be holy: no real Christian denies it.<a name=328:10></a> Now many of the statements of the apostle, and many of the strongest which declare we are not under law, or that the law is not the means to live to God, apply, not to justification, but to freedom from the dominion of sin -- that under the law we cannot be set free from it, but that deliverance from the law is the way of bringing forth fruit to God.<a name=328:11></a> I shall quote some passages.<a name=328:12></a> The true means of deliverance, I shall speak of at the close.<a name=328:13></a>

		The apostle's reasoning in Galatians 3: 15-22 is this: God gave the promise to Abraham, and confirmed it to his seed -- which was really Christ, 430 years before the law.<a name=329:12></a> Now a confirmed covenant, if it be only man's, cannot be disannulled, nor can it be added to; that is, you cannot add the law to the promise.<a name=329:13></a> That was complete in itself, and confirmed before the law existed.<a name=329:14></a> To bring in the law was to alter and add to the terms of it, and could not be.<a name=329:15></a> How could the law then come in?<a name=329:16></a> It was added for the sake <i>(ton</i> page <i>charin)</i> of transgressions, to produce them -- not to produce sin: God does nothing to produce sin.<a name=329:17></a> The sin was there, but till the law came, it could not be a transgression; for where no law is, there is none.<a name=329:18></a> It is the same sense as in Romans: the law entered (the Greek reads <i>pareiselthe</i> "came in by the bye," that the offence might abound) till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made.<a name=329:19></a>

		I have added these passages for my reader's sake, as additionally clearing up the point; but the passages I have quoted prove that the law is not the means of living to God, any more than of justification (on the contrary, if we are under law, sin will have dominion over us), and that we must be delivered from it, in order to bring forth fruit to God.<a name=330:1></a> Scripture is distinct and positive as to this.<a name=330:2></a> The law is a distinct definite system and principle, under which Christians are not living.<a name=330:3></a> People have confounded law with various things and obligations enforced in the law.<a name=330:4></a> The truth is, the duties were all there before law was given.<a name=330:5></a> Law gives a divine measure of these obligations in contrast with evil, and enforces the obligations by an authority outside ourselves, involving, as it is given, a curse if they are not fulfilled.<a name=330:6></a> The law is the perfect rule for a child of Adam, but supposes sin and lust, and forbids them, but does not take them away, nor give a new life.<a name=330:7></a> It takes up our relationship to God and our neighbour, and insists on consistency with them.<a name=330:8></a> It is a transcript, not of God's character, as is absurdly said, but of man's duties.<a name=330:9></a> I say, absurdly.<a name=330:10></a> Could God love His neighbour as Himself?<a name=330:11></a> Or Himself with all His heart, as a duty?<a name=330:12></a> Away with such folly.<a name=330:13></a> Further, the ten commandments suppose sin, and unless one, forbid it.<a name=330:14></a> It is equally absurd, and I speak for others than Mr.<a name=330:15></a> Marshall now, to apply the commandments to Adam.<a name=330:16></a> How could he honour his father and mother?<a name=330:17></a> How could he steal, or know what it meant?<a name=330:18></a> He did not know what lust was till after he was tempted.<a name=330:19></a> Adam had a law; but it did not suppose sin in him, but forbad what would have been no sin at all, if it had not been forbidden, and was thus a simple test of obedience, and no more; and we can see the perfect wisdom of God in this.<a name=330:20></a> The law formally given on Mount Sinai (for the law was given by Moses) supposes sin, for sin was there, and forbids it, and maintains the relationship in which man stood to God and to man, and of course was all perfectly right in doing so.<a name=330:21></a>

		But did law deliver man from the power of sin and lust?<a name=330:22></a> That is at least one important part of the question, that is, where it is a rule; and we have seen the apostle stating, that it did not, but left man under it, yea, was an occasion to lust to act.<a name=330:23></a> But more, man must be delivered from it to bring forth fruit to God.<a name=330:24></a> To have godliness man must be delivered from law.<a name=330:25></a> But I add, for what is it a rule?<a name=330:26></a> Is it a perfect, adequate, rule?<a name=330:27></a> For a child of Adam it is: he is to love God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himself, and not to lust.<a name=330:28></a> Only note, it forbids what is in man, without giving life or force, and, because it is a right rule, condemns, and works wrath; and this is law, and this alone, and all that law is.<a name=330:29></a><a name=331>[Page 331]</a>

		A law is obligation, enforced by an authority outside us,<a href="#331:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> requires from us whatever the rule expresses, and in God's law, that there should not even be a lust, but is addressed to those who have lusts, who are alive in the flesh.<a name=331:1></a> Its requisition is right; but for that reason it condemns us to death, and because man is not what it requires, it is found to be to death.<a name=331:2></a> But in its contents it is a perfect measure, or rule, for man in the flesh; but it is not for him who is in Christ.<a name=331:3></a> For him who is a son of God the rule is, "Be ye therefore followers [imitators] of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ also loved us, and gave himself for us, a sacrifice and an offering to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=331:4></a>" "Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=331:5></a>" It is not reciprocated kindness, of which love to self is the measure, but a giving up self, as Christ did, in love.<a name=331:6></a> It is good in the midst of evil, which is what Christ was -- grace as displayed in Him, doing well, suffering for it, and taking it patiently, as He did.<a name=331:7></a> It is forgiving, laying down our lives in the prerogative of divine love, which is our rule, and walking being light in the Lord, as He walked, apart from the world, an epistle of Christ to it; and love and light are the two essential names of God, and Christ was the perfect expression of it as man here.<a name=331:8></a>

		Of all this the law knows nothing.<a name=331:9></a> It does know what a child of Adam ought to be for God, and that it requires: evidently just what it should do.<a name=331:10></a> Of what God is for him, it knows nothing; and of what a child of God ought to be, and a dear child as walking in the love he has learned, and which is shed abroad in his heart, it can tell him nothing.<a name=331:11></a> The law is God requiring from man what man ought to be, but which he is not; the gospel is God saving him in sovereign love, and, giving him eternal life in the Son, sends him to shew forth this life and the character of Christ (that is, of God manifested in a man) in a world that knows Him not.<a name=331:12></a> The law requires righteousness from a man alive in the flesh; and that flesh is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; so that they that are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=331:13></a> And if it is said "but Christianity takes him out of the flesh," I answer, it does, but at the same time gives him a much higher rule; he is to walk in the Spirit as he lives in the Spirit.<a name=331:14></a> The Christian, having Christ for his life, is to manifest the life of Christ in his mortal flesh.<a name=331:15></a>

		And now a word as to the manner of this.<a name=332:1></a> The law did not give life, and could not; it required righteousness from man such as he was.<a name=332:2></a> In Christ we have not only our sins wholly put away, which the law could not do, but only curse us for them if under it, but He becomes a new life, and a life as now risen from the dead.<a name=332:3></a> But Christ who is our life has been crucified, and God looks upon those who believe as crucified with Him, and so does faith.<a name=332:4></a> Ye are dead, says the word; Colossians 3: 3.<a name=332:5></a> I am crucified with Christ, says faith, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=332:6></a> It reckons itself dead to sin and alive to God, not in Adam but in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=332:7></a> In a word, as Christ died to the whole scene into which He had come -- died unto sin once -- so the Christian, crucified with Him, belongs to the place Christ is entered into, the new creation in Christ his life, and has died to the flesh and sin and the world.<a name=332:8></a> He is not before God in flesh at all; he knows this, that his old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed.<a name=332:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the law has power over a man as long as he lives; but we have died in Christ -- are not in the flesh.<a name=332:10></a> Hence we read, when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin[s], which were by the law.<a name=332:11></a> But when we know our death with Christ, and that sin in the flesh was condemned on the cross, the law having been unable to accomplish any such object, and have the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, then we read, Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be the Spirit of God dwell in you: now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His; and if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, and the Spirit is life because of righteousness.<a name=332:12></a> That is, practical righteousness is attained, not by a law which was weak through the flesh, applied to that flesh, which was not subject to the law of God, neither indeed could be, and withal cursed the disobedient; but by the gift of a new life, that is, Christ risen, and the power of the Spirit of God, and by being dead to sin, as crucified with Christ, and dead to the law by the body of Christ, sin in the flesh condemned in the sacrifice of Christ, but we dead therein to it, and alive in the power of a new life.<a name=332:13></a> The flesh, the law, and the world are gone together for faith through the cross of Christ.<a name=332:14></a> (See Romans 6: 6; chapter 7: 4; Galatians 2: 19, 20; chapter 6: 14; chapter 5: 24.<a name=332:15></a>)

		The great truth is this: we have died on the cross to our whole standing in Adam, and to the law that was the rule for it; and we are risen with Christ into the new creation in Him, alive from the dead to give ourselves to God.<a name=333:8></a> We have the treasure in earthen vessels, but our place before God is that -- in Christ, and Christ in us.<a name=333:9></a> We have died from under the law, but therein died to sin, and are alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=333:10></a> We are in a wholly new position, and, though the righteousness of the law be fulfilled in one whose life Christ is, it is because he walks after the Spirit, and does not put himself under law.<a name=333:11></a> He cannot (Romans 7) have two husbands at a time, Christ and the law.<a name=333:12></a> Remark here that I am speaking, as the passages I refer to are, of practical righteousness, a godly life, but if we are under the law for that, the law also curses us.<a name=333:13></a> As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse, and if the curse is not executed, the authority of the law is gone.<a name=333:14></a> If we are under law, we are under a curse, or its authority destroyed.<a name=333:15></a> If Christ has borne the curse, we have died with Him out of the position in which the law reached us; by the law dead to law, that we might live to God, crucified with Christ, yet living, but not we, but Christ living in us.<a name=333:16></a> He will not live wrongly.<a name=333:17></a> I do not enter here into failure, or Christ's blessed advocacy if we do fail, but only bring out the principles of the life in which we do live to God.<a name=333:18></a>

		Let me take another view of the subject which is afforded us in Scripture.<a name=334:1></a> From the fall to the flood, though individuals were blessed and testimony was there, there were no special dealings of God.<a name=334:2></a> The promise had been given to the Seed of the woman in the judgment of the serpent; for there is no promise to fallen man, though the object of faith is thus held up before him.<a name=334:3></a> But man went on in wickedness till God had to bring in the flood, to cleanse as it were the earth from the pollution.<a name=334:4></a> But after the flood, having instituted the restraint of government in Noah (the world having fallen into idolatry, and nations having been formed), God calls out Abraham to be a root of promise for Himself.<a name=334:5></a> Abraham is the head of a seed of blessing as fallen Adam of a seed of sinful men.<a name=334:6></a> I leave aside Israel the natural seed here to speak of Christ and the nations.<a name=334:7></a> In Genesis 12 the promise of all nations being blessed in Abraham is given, and confirmed to the Seed in chapter 22.<a name=334:8></a> This was sovereign grace, and no condition was attached to it.<a name=334:9></a> The Seed was to come, the nations to be blessed in the Seed.<a name=334:10></a> This raised no question of righteousness; there was no if, no condition.<a name=334:11></a> But the question of righteousness was of all importance; it was raised at Sinai.<a name=334:12></a> If they obeyed His voice, they should be His peculiar treasure; and they undertook to do all Jehovah should say, and made the golden calf before Moses was down from the Mount with the two tables.<a name=334:13></a> The question was raised by requiring righteousness from man, and this-was the law.<a name=334:14></a> Man has been tested on this ground and found wholly wanting.<a name=334:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add some details.<a name=334:16></a> The law simply by itself never even reached man as a covenant of works.<a name=334:17></a> The tables never entered into the camp (the golden calf was there), they were broken at the foot of the Mount.<a name=334:18></a> Moses interceded, and the people were for the occasion as to God's dealings forgiven.<a name=334:19></a> But Moses could not make atonement, and with the revelation of goodness the people were put back under law.<a name=334:20></a> "The soul that sinneth I will blot out of my book.<a name=334:21></a>" But God makes all His goodness pass before Moses.<a name=334:22></a> The Lord passed before Moses and proclaimed the Lord -- "the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear (the guilty), visiting," etc.<a name=334:23></a> Now, here we have provisional grace.<a name=334:24></a> They are the terms of God's government of Israel, but, in fact, grace which spares and forgives past sin; but no atonement effectual, final, and conclusive, perfecting for ever them that are sanctified, was made, as indeed there was no one there to make it.<a name=334:25></a> They were consequently replaced under legal obligation and the man that sinned was to be blotted out of God's book.<a name=334:26></a> It was grace and forgiveness, and law after.<a name=334:27></a>

		It was when Moses went down after this interview (Exodus 34: 29, 30) that his face shone.<a name=335:1></a> It is this law after grace and provisional forgiveness that is declared to be the ministration of death and the ministration of condemnation (2 Corinthians 3) in contrast with the gospel, which is the ministration of righteousness and of the Spirit.<a name=335:2></a> And now see how the apostle reasons on the whole matter.<a name=335:3></a> The promise, given to Abraham and confirmed to the one seed (Christ), could not be set aside nor added to by a transaction 430 years after.<a name=335:4></a> God had thus bound Himself, but the law came in by the bye till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made, that is, Christ.<a name=335:5></a> Then its function ceased, and consequent on Christ's work, all being sinners, the law broken, and Christ rejected (the last means by which God could seek for fruit from man), the attempt only proving that man hated both Christ and His Father -- that the mind of the flesh was enmity against God, then God's righteousness is revealed without law (the Greek reads "apart from law"), the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ.<a name=335:6></a> Man's probation as to the history of it, on the ground of getting good by any means from him, was over.<a name=335:7></a> Now, says Christ, is the judgment of this world.<a name=335:8></a> Hence it was Christ cursed the fig-tree never to bear fruit.<a name=335:9></a> Hence it is that it is said "now once in the end of the world [the consummation of ages], he hath appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<a name=335:10></a>"

		I will now take notice of Mr.<a name=336:1></a> Marshall's remarks.<a name=336:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place Mr.<a name=336:3></a> Marshall's statements make quite plain that if we are under the law at all we are under it not merely as a rule of life but as a question of righteousness or condemnation.<a name=336:4></a> He says expressly of a believer, if he act contrary to the law (page 10), he would then have come under its condemning power; so, on the same page, if a believer "acts contrary to the law, what then?<a name=336:5></a> Will not the law take hold of him and condemn him?<a name=336:6></a>" Thus all pretension that it is a rule of life but not the way of righteousness, failure under it bringing a curse, is wholly set aside.<a name=336:7></a> If I am told there is a remedy in looking to Christ; so there was in the prescriptions of the law.<a name=336:8></a> We have not advanced a tittle.<a name=336:9></a> Only remember, reader, that it is for this cause the apostle says "as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse.<a name=336:10></a>" If you are on this ground, you are at this moment, according to your theory, under the curse.<a name=336:11></a> And this is all true if we are under the law at all.<a name=336:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People talk of not taking it for this, but taking it for that.<a name=336:13></a> Who are you to deal with the law and testimony of God thus?<a name=336:14></a> It takes you, as God has declared it should if you are under it, and curses you.<a name=336:15></a> The curse comes with it, and sin revives when it comes.<a name=336:16></a> Mr.<a name=336:17></a> Marshall is right: it lays hold of a man and condemns him.<a name=336:18></a> And, if "As many as are of its works," they are all cursed.<a name=336:19></a> And Christ does not step in to weaken its authority.<a name=336:20></a> He bore its curse and delivered us from the law, but He cannot be made a curse for us now, and if it comes on us there is no way left of getting it off us.<a name=336:21></a> If it be a rule of life, then righteousness comes by it and Christ is dead in vain.<a name=336:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us see what Mr.<a name=337:1></a> Marshall has to say of it even as a rule of life.<a name=337:2></a> If it be God's rule of life, it must be a perfect one.<a name=337:3></a> Indeed a rule that is not a perfect one is pure mischief and deception.<a name=337:4></a> But what is Mr.<a name=337:5></a> M.<a name=337:6></a>'s account?<a name=337:7></a> "Christ enlarges it," that is, it is not perfect but has to be enlarged.<a name=337:8></a> Suppose I have to enlarge a measure to be honest in what I give; is my first measure right?<a name=337:9></a> Thus I must have the law enlarged to go right, a strange rule.<a name=337:10></a> But further: "The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat; all, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do.<a name=337:11></a>" Here then we have a clear, positive, and definite rule.<a name=337:12></a> All, and whatsoever they bid you, is to be done.<a name=337:13></a> "Of course," continues Mr.<a name=337:14></a> Marshall (page 9), "He only meant such parts of the moral law as were in accordance with His new dispensation; and nearly all parts of it are in such accordance.<a name=337:15></a>" Here is a strange rule for me.<a name=337:16></a> Nearly all of it is right, God's rule, mind; and I am to judge, by my estimate of the new dispensation, what is not.<a name=337:17></a> I am not to find it enlarged, but to pare it off as I see it is consistent with my position.<a name=337:18></a> But how can this be called a rule?<a name=337:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these remarks prove to me that Mr.<a name=337:20></a> Marshall is an honest man.<a name=337:21></a> He sees that you cannot reconcile Christianity and the rule Christians are, on this system, to live by; and he honestly says so.<a name=337:22></a> But then all becomes "nearly all," and whatsoever is not is cast overboard; and the rule is no rule at all, enlarged in one place and pared down in another by some other which is not given to us at all.<a name=337:23></a> Surely this is not establishing law.<a name=337:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The text universally alleged to put us under the law is, "I am not come to destroy the law and the prophets, I am not come to destroy but to fulfil.<a name=337:25></a>" Now what Christ's fulfilling the law has to do with putting me under it I never could understand.<a name=337:26></a> I should have thought that it would have rather been the contrary, and, if fulfilled, there was an end of the matter.<a name=337:27></a> Thus He fulfilled the sacrifices, and the rather as He speaks of the prophets, which gives to the word "fulfil," used as it is as to both, a force quite different from that sought to be made of it.<a name=337:28></a> It is a mere fancy, let me add here, that a Christian cannot use every word of Scripture for profit, law and all, without (that is) putting him under law.<a name=337:29></a> All that happened to Israel is written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the world are come, but that does not put us in the place they were in.<a name=337:30></a> All that reveals God to me, His mind, His will, His ways, is profitable to me, is light, without putting me in the place of those of whom I read.<a name=337:31></a>

		But there is another consideration to be referred to here, the sermon on the Mount.<a name=338:1></a> This, blessed as is the instruction contained in it, was before the cross which judicially closed the relationship of the Jews with God, breaking down the middle wall of partition.<a name=338:2></a> We have no hint of redemption in it from beginning to end, nor of the relationship in which men should stand to God by it.<a name=338:3></a> It gives, and gives most blessedly, the characters which were fitted to enter the kingdom of heaven just going to be set up.<a name=338:4></a> Now that kingdom was not yet set up, but announced as immediately to be so.<a name=338:5></a> Nor do I for a moment imply that they were to give up the character necessary in order to enter as soon as they had got into it.<a name=338:6></a> It would be absurd.<a name=338:7></a> But what it does is to give the characters suited to the kingdom, not to shew the effect of its being set up by the rejection and cross of Jesus.<a name=338:8></a> It is not the law, nor is it the gospel.<a name=338:9></a> Christ could not preach His death and resurrection as an accomplished ground of salvation.<a name=338:10></a> It is to disciples, though in the audience of all, that no man might mistake the true character of the kingdom, nor of those who were to get into it.<a name=338:11></a> That and the revelation of the Father's name are the subjects of the discourse.<a name=338:12></a> The law and the prophets were until John; since that the kingdom of heaven was preached, and every man passed into it.<a name=338:13></a> The gospel of the death and resurrection of Christ could not be preached, though long before and now prophesied of.<a name=338:14></a> The preaching was that they might receive Him, not crucify Him.<a name=338:15></a>

		Let us come to the direct proofs of the different positions of the New Testament and Old Testament saints.<a name=348:1></a> The Lord's own declaration should suffice: "On this rock I will build my church.<a name=348:2></a>" The confession that He personally, Jesus, was the Son of the living God -- this could not be before.<a name=348:3></a> Looking for a Messiah with true faith, for the promised Seed, was before, and was surely saving faith: but that Jesus was the Son of the living God could not be before Jesus.<a name=348:4></a> And hence the Lord says, "I will build": not that He had been long building, when in truth in that state as a man He did not yet subsist.<a name=348:5></a>

		We have two aspects of the church.<a name=348:6></a> It is Christ's body, and the habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=348:7></a> Neither could possibly have existed before Pentecost.<a name=348:8></a> First, till Christ ascended, there was no head in heaven for the body to be united to.<a name=348:9></a> You would have had a body without a head.<a name=348:10></a> Ephesians 1 and 2 declare that we are raised with and seated in heavenly places in Christ "according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand .<a name=348:11></a>.<a name=348:12></a>.<a name=348:13></a> and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=348:14></a>"

		Further, till after the ascension, the Holy Ghost did not come down to form the church and dwell in it.<a name=349:1></a> In 1 Corinthians 12 we read, "by one Spirit we are all baptised into one body.<a name=349:2></a>" They were, as we are expressly taught in the Acts, baptised with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost; Acts 1.<a name=349:3></a> So John, "He it is that baptiseth with the Holy Ghost," John 1.<a name=349:4></a> Now the Lord says, "If I go not away, the Comforter will not come; but if I go away, I will send him unto you.<a name=349:5></a>" I must here notice and correct a mistake.<a name=349:6></a> Mr.<a name=349:7></a> M.<a name=349:8></a> urges that Christ's breathing on the disciples saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost," was the giving of the Comforter, not the day of Pentecost; but John's Gospel is explicit.<a name=349:9></a> It was from Christ risen; as God breathed into Adam's nostrils the breath of life, so the Lord breathed on them that they might have the power of life by the Holy Ghost.<a name=349:10></a> But this was not sending the Holy Ghost.<a name=349:11></a>

		At all events we learn from 1 Corinthians 12 that it was that coming of the Holy Ghost which is called baptism, which we know (Acts 1: 5, answering to John 1: 33) to have been the day of Pentecost which forms the church, the one body of Christ here below, whereby the gathered saints become withal the habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=350:1></a> Thus the facts that the risen and ascended Christ is Head, and that the descent of the Holy Ghost forms the body, make it impossible for the church to have existed before Pentecost.<a name=350:2></a>

		Another and lower ground of reasoning, though perhaps more palpable to some, alike shews the impossibility of the church's existing before the cross.<a name=350:3></a> Jew and Gentile could not be united in one.<a name=350:4></a> The Jew was bound strictly to keep up the middle wall of partition.<a name=350:5></a> The church is formed by its being thrown down, Christ thereupon forming in Himself one new man; Ephesians 2: 14-16.<a name=350:6></a> The church was formed through the throwing down of that which Judaism was bound to keep up.<a name=350:7></a> It could not exist until Judaism was ended.<a name=350:8></a> Hence, too, in Hebrews 12 we have "the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven," and "the spirits of just men made perfect," as a distinct class (verse 23).<a name=350:9></a> The truth is that the bringing in the Old Testament saints into the church is only dropping the whole proper blessing of the church itself.<a name=350:10></a> The teaching of Scripture as to it is wholly lost.<a name=350:11></a>

		Saints may be individually blest and saved, though that truth is darkened, but a body united to a head in heaven is entirely out of sight.<a name=350:12></a> Thus Mr.<a name=350:13></a> Marshall diligently argues that, as we are Abraham's seed, Abraham must have been in the church.<a name=350:14></a> "Of one seed," he says in concluding, "or church.<a name=350:15></a>" But the seed are individuals, sons of God and heirs of God; which has nothing to do with being the body of a man who is in heaven, or builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=350:16></a> A man's bride and body is another idea from being children of a father.<a name=350:17></a> Viewed as children of God, we are Christ's brethren, not His body.<a name=350:18></a>

		Let me urge Mr.<a name=352:1></a> Marshall to read, not the writings of Brethren, but the Bible, and see if the church is not a wholly new thing, consequent on the exaltation of Christ to the right hand of God, and that it could not by any possibility have existed before; and not to confound the promise of a coming Saviour, received by faith, with membership of Christ's body, when He is exalted to be Head over all things to His body, the church; nor to think it impossible, because of the grace given to Abraham, that God may have "reserved some better thing for us.<a name=352:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will add a few words on ordination.<a name=352:3></a> Mr.<a name=352:4></a> Marshall cites a number of passages in which Paul exhorts Timothy as to his ministry, stirring up the gift which was in him.<a name=352:5></a> Most admirable exhortations assuredly, for indeed they are of the Spirit of God Himself, though we speak of Paul; but they have nothing to do with the ordination of ministers.<a name=352:6></a> But Mr.<a name=352:7></a> Marshall misquotes the only material citation.<a name=352:8></a> Timothy had been ordained, he tells us, by the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<a name=352:9></a> Scripture does not say "by," but "with"; and, when we see what Paul says elsewhere, we see the importance of the difference.<a name=352:10></a> The whole sentence is "the gift which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<a name=352:11></a>" Now here we find the real force of the matter: a gift was given, a very different thing from ordination; and elsewhere we find more information as to it, 2 Timothy 1: 6, "the gift that is in thee by the putting on of my hands.<a name=352:12></a>" A man was personally marked out by prophecy (as we see in the case of Paul and Barnabas, Acts 13, and again at Antioch), and then Paul laid his hands on Timothy and conferred a gift, which was the privilege of the apostles; as we see Paul and John going down to Samaria, and so conferring it, and Simon wanting to buy the power.<a name=352:13></a>

		Now I freely admit that the presbytery also accompanied this by the laying on of their hands, as a testimony to Timothy, just as in Acts 13: 3: an act interpreted in chapter 14: 26, and repeated again in chapter 15: 40.<a name=353:1></a> But the substance of the act was the conferring the Holy Ghost with a careful changing of the word, which has escaped Mr.<a name=353:2></a> M.<a name=353:3></a>'s notice.<a name=353:4></a> Hence in the Episcopal church, in which the officiating prelate professes to give the Holy Ghost, the laying on of his hands is ordered to be accompanied by that of other priests, but no one ascribes ordination to them but to the prelate.<a name=353:5></a>

		The difference between eldership and gifts is clearly established in every respect in Scripture.<a name=353:6></a> It was desirable that an elder should be apt to teach; still it was said "especially those who labour in the word and doctrine," so that some did not, and in their episcopal work -- for they were all bishops, that is, in their service as overseers of the flock, he was to be able "to exhort and convince gainsayers, holding fast" (if he had no special conferred gift of teaching on which he had to wait, Romans 12) "the faithful word as he had been taught.<a name=353:7></a>" He is even here contrasted with a teacher, and is to use in his service what he had learned, to stop people's mouths.<a name=353:8></a> Elders were appointed in every city (Titus 1: 5, compare Acts 14: 23), aptness to teach being a desirable qualification; but eldership was no gift at all.<a name=353:9></a> It is to be presumed hands were laid upon them, though it is never positively said so; but it was the common use in every signification of blessing, approved and commended to the Lord, used with the sick, used by prophets, or the church as to apostles, and, as Timothy was to lay hands suddenly on no man, it may be very well presumed he did so on elders.<a name=353:10></a> It is a mercy it is never said, or we should have apostolic succession.<a name=353:11></a> And it is not ever said.<a name=353:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us see on what a totally different footing gifts stand.<a name=353:13></a> First the Lord when He goes away gives talents to His servants, and they are bound to use them without other authority.<a name=353:14></a> He who had not sufficient trust in the Lord to do so was a wicked and slothful servant.<a name=353:15></a> Then I find the fact, "they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word," and afterward (Acts 11) "the hand of the Lord was with them.<a name=353:16></a>" I find Peter giving directions as to this, "As every man has received the gift, so let him minister the same, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God," 1 Peter 4: 10.<a name=353:17></a> In Romans 12: 6, "Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith, or ministry, let us wait on our ministering, or he that teacheth on teaching," etc.<a name=353:18></a> So in 1 Corinthians 12 it is elaborately stated that they had their gifts according to the dividing of the Spirit as He would, making one one member in the body, another another, and wherever a man was he was that member.<a name=353:19></a> So if Apollos taught at Ephesus, he taught at Corinth when there, and Silas and Judas at Antioch, and so on, and in 1 Corinthians 14 directions are given as to the use of gifts, when they were not to be used, how many were to speak, etc.<a name=353:20></a>, that all might be to common edification, concluding by saying, "for ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and that all may be comforted.<a name=353:21></a>" The women were to keep silence in the assemblies, it was not permitted them to speak, it was a shame for them to speak in the assembly.<a name=353:22></a> So persons (2 John) who went about preaching were to be judged by their doctrine.<a name=353:23></a> Then we get a warning in James not to be many masters (teachers), shewing by the moral warning that ordination to do it had no place.<a name=353:24></a>

		Finally, in the important passage in Ephesians 4 it is referred to gifts from Christ on high, when He fills all things in the power of redemption.<a name=354:1></a> Five permanent and regular gifts are mentioned, of which two had been declared to be the foundation, which is not laying now.<a name=354:2></a> Pastors, teachers, and evangelists remain, sadly hindered by the state of the church, still they remain.<a name=354:3></a> In addition to this we have "the increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part.<a name=354:4></a>" The difference of this and 1 Corinthians 12 is worthy of note.<a name=354:5></a> There it was mere power, by the Spirit of God, which might be, and was, abused; here it is what Christ, who cannot but be faithful to His own body, gives till all grow up to Him who is the Head.<a name=354:6></a> There, being by the present Holy Ghost, you have tongues, miracles, healings, etc.<a name=354:7></a>, but there is no "till we all come" as there is in Ephesians 4; on the contrary it is "as he will.<a name=354:8></a>" We may have lost a great deal, but the principle of Scripture is as plain as possible.<a name=354:9></a>

		Of ordination as connected with these gifts we have nothing, unless that apostles could confer the Holy Ghost and gift by laying on of hands.<a name=354:10></a> Committing doctrine to faithful men, which may be done in any age if one be capable to do it, has nothing to do with conferring official authority, and that is what ordaining means in modern language.<a name=354:11></a> And this is why "ordain" is objectionable, because it conveys a distinct meaning in modern language, which Scripture does not warrant.<a name=354:12></a> The English version is intentionally unfaithful in this.<a name=354:13></a> In Acts 1 it has "must one be ordained," where there is no word at all.<a name=354:14></a> It is simply "must one be a witness.<a name=354:15></a>" In Acts 14 it is "they chose for them," and they have put "ordained them," and in Titus "ordain elders" when it is simply "establish.<a name=354:16></a>" This was not without intention.<a name=354:17></a>

		PRESENT AND ETERNAL AND GOVERNMENTAL FORGIVENESS OF SINS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All forgiveness is founded on the blessed work of the Lord Jesus.<a name=357:1></a> But it is important to distinguish between the pardon which clears us once and for ever from all our sins before God, by which we are justified, and have peace with God, and the pardon which we may receive on the way as under God's government, supposing we are pardoned and saved.<a name=357:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Without the work of Christ, a holy and just God, yea a God of truth, must have held man to be what he really is, a guilty sinner, who must be judged according to his works; and we know beforehand from His word, that there is none righteous, no not one.<a name=357:3></a> The love of God, great as it is, so great that for us He did not spare His Son, could not say that sin was not sin, or that He was indifferent to good and evil, for He is not, and in His own nature cannot be; and if He judges and makes man himself answer for what he has done, He must judge him righteously.<a name=357:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, we are alienated from God in heart and mind, and so really already lost.<a name=357:5></a> I do not now mean finally, nor that we cannot be saved out of that state; but if we can, it is because Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=357:6></a> Judgment, if we come unrepentant, unbelieving, before the judgment-seat of Christ, will be according to our works, and therefore condemnation: for all have sinned.<a name=357:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God is love: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<a name=357:8></a>" God has thus anticipated, in grace, that day of judgment.<a name=357:9></a> The same blessed Son of God, who will as Son of man sit on the judgment-seat, and judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom, has already, before that day, come as a Saviour, and died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and he that believeth on the Son of God shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be condemned.<a name=357:10></a> Solemn as that warning is, I shall not say more of these last.<a name=357:11></a> The statement is plain enough and solemn enough without adding anything to it: they die in their sins and are doubly guilty; they have not only sinned against His holiness, but despised His mercy.<a name=357:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Supposing now we do really in heart believe in the Son of God, with a faith wrought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, and a conscience which feels the need of grace and forgiveness, for that is the great point; a faith which has wrought true repentance, that godly sorrow and sense that we have deserved to be condemned which make Christ and His grace and His work precious to us.<a name=357:13></a> I suppose we have been all brought up to believe in the blessed Lord Jesus as a divine history, but that is very different from believing in Him as meeting the need of an awakened conscience.<a name=357:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=358>[Page 358]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, supposing I have this true faith in Him, then it behoves me to be able to say what He has done for me.<a name=358:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He has died for our sins according to the scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15: 3); "He has borne our sins in his own body on the tree" (1 Peter 2: 24); "He died the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God," 1 Peter 3: 18.<a name=358:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that here is our question: Supposing I have true heart faith in Him, Christ having thus died for me, what is the effect or efficacy of His death for me?<a name=358:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have a perfect and eternal forgiveness and redemption according to the glory of God.<a name=358:4></a> I do not speak of those who neglect this great salvation; they are doubly guilty; but of what is the value of His work for those who have really a part in it?<a name=358:5></a> "Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; and by him, all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses," Acts 13: 38, 39.<a name=358:6></a> "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace," Ephesians 1: 7.<a name=358:7></a> "Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.<a name=358:8></a> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God," Romans 4: 25; chapter 5: 1, 2.<a name=358:9></a> "By the obedience of one shall many be made righteous," Romans 5: 19.<a name=358:10></a> "Whom he justified, them he also glorified," Romans 8: 30.<a name=358:11></a> "By his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption," Hebrews 9: 12.<a name=358:12></a> And its effect is complete (verse 14): "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<a name=358:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But is this valid for ever?<a name=358:14></a>
	</div>

		<a name=359>[Page 359]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen that it is eternal redemption, that it purges the conscience from dead works, and gives peace with God.<a name=359:1></a> But Scripture is more explicit.<a name=359:2></a> Christ is always at the right hand of God, and has presented His precious blood to God.<a name=359:3></a> It is always before His eyes.<a name=359:4></a> But Scripture is very explicit on this point.<a name=359:5></a> "But this [man], having offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down at the right hand of God.<a name=359:6></a>" Not like the Jewish priests standing continually at the altar, offering sacrifices which could never take away sins (Hebrews 10: 11), He sat down because, for redemption and forgiveness, He had done already the whole work; for (Hebrews 5: 14) "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=359:7></a>" He sits there at the right hand of God till His enemies be made His footstool; then He will come to deal with them in judgment.<a name=359:8></a> But all is done for His friends, that is, true believers, and He has sat down having finished the work, so that those who come by it have no more conscience of sins (verse 2).<a name=359:9></a> "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will impute no sin.<a name=359:10></a>" "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered," Romans 4: 7, 8.<a name=359:11></a> And is it only some of them?<a name=359:12></a> No, that were useless.<a name=359:13></a> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no sin, and the Holy Ghost testifies of it clearly in that same Hebrews 10 from which we have quoted: "And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more" (verse 17).<a name=359:14></a> And so plainly does He put it, that He declares that "where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin" (verse 18).<a name=359:15></a> So that, if all were not completely pardoned and effaced, there could be no remedy.<a name=359:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we consider it, the more plain it is.<a name=359:17></a> Christ is the Judge, and if now I can say by faith, He has loved me and washed me from my sins in His own blood, how can He, when I stand before the judgment-seat, impute to me the sins He has Himself borne and put away?<a name=359:18></a> He would be denying the value of His own work, which is impossible.<a name=359:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, if we are believers, we are raised in glory; 1 Corinthians 15: 43.<a name=359:20></a> Nay, Christ shall Himself come to bring us to Himself: "Who shall change our body of humiliation that it may be fashioned like unto his body of glory.<a name=359:21></a>" If Christ comes to fetch us, and puts us in glory, where is the place for raising any question then about our sins?<a name=359:22></a> And this is clearly said in John 5: 24.<a name=359:23></a> "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation [judgment]; but is passed from death unto life.<a name=359:24></a>"

		<a name=360>[Page 360]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it because God is indifferent to their sins?<a name=360:1></a> Impossible!<a name=360:2></a> But He has given His Son for us.<a name=360:3></a> Christ has borne them already, and cannot impute them to those who believe in Him and in the Father who sent Him in love.<a name=360:4></a> We know that the Lord says, "If ye do not believe that I am <i>he</i>, ye shall die in your sins," John 8: 24.<a name=360:5></a> But if we believe in Him, we have the forgiveness of our sins -- not of some, to be condemned for the rest.<a name=360:6></a> "Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more," because "by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=360:7></a>" And we possess the blessedness of this word, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man to whom Jehovah will not impute sin.<a name=360:8></a>" Hence repentance and remission of sins were to be preached in Jesus' name.<a name=360:9></a> The Christian has a new life from Christ, and this will shew itself in his walk.<a name=360:10></a> He is born of the Spirit; and the faith in Christ by which he has forgiveness makes Christ everything to him, as it is written in Colossians 3, Christ is all and in all, the "everything," that is, of our hearts, and He is our life.<a name=360:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I now confine myself to redemption and forgiveness.<a name=360:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is then a forgiveness identified with redemption and the abiding value of Christ's blood, so that our sins are none of them imputed to us: God remembers them no more.<a name=360:13></a> We have part in this through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and the door by which we enter is repentance toward God, which faith in the word of Christ always produces.<a name=360:14></a> We have our eyes opened, we are turned from darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto God, and we receive remission of our sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith that is in Jesus; Acts 26: 18.<a name=360:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Under the Old Testament among the Jews this full forgiveness was not known; they got a kind of absolution for each sin they committed; they were shut out from entering into the holiest by the veil, which hung before the place where God revealed Himself.<a name=360:16></a> Thus in Hebrews 9 it is written, "The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing.<a name=360:17></a>" But we learn, when the real work of which all these things were figures was accomplished in the death of the Saviour, that the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom (Matthew 27: 51), and we are exhorted (Hebrews 10: 19) in virtue of the work of Christ and the remission of our sins (verses 17, 18), "having boldness to enter into the holiest, by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh," to "draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.<a name=360:18></a>" That one work, done once for all, never to be repeated, and effectual to give peace to the conscience, is the ground on which we have eternal redemption, full forgiveness, so that God remembers our sins and iniquities no more, an entrance into God's presence and a part in the everlasting inheritance of God's children in glory.<a name=360:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=361>[Page 361]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This great difference in the state of believers before and after the death of the blessed Lord is celebrated by Zacharias at the birth of John the Baptist, Christ's forerunner; Luke 1: 77.<a name=361:1></a> "To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.<a name=361:2></a>" So the repentant thief went straight into paradise with Christ; so to the repentant woman in the city that was a sinner the Lord said, not only, "Thy sins are forgiven thee"; but, "Thy faith hath saved thee," Luke 7: 48-50.<a name=361:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is, then, for faith, a present but eternal forgiveness, founded on Christ's bearing our sins in a work which can never be repeated, its value never diminished, nor anything added to it.<a name=361:4></a> God has proved His value of its worth in setting Him who did it at His right hand in glory, where He was with Him as Son of God before the world was.<a name=361:5></a> "Without shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=361:6></a>" This cannot be repeated.<a name=361:7></a> "Christ is not entered into holy places made with hands (which are the figures of the true), but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.<a name=361:8></a> Nor yet to offer himself often .<a name=361:9></a>.<a name=361:10></a>.<a name=361:11></a> otherwise he must often have suffered since the foundation of the world; but now once in the consummation of ages he hath appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<a name=361:12></a> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment; so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, apart from sin, unto salvation.<a name=361:13></a>" Those whose sins were put away the first time He comes to take into glory, as to them having no more to do with sin which He put away the first time.<a name=361:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=362>[Page 362]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a government of God in this world over those who are thus redeemed, and ever has been.<a name=362:1></a> "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.<a name=362:2></a>" And when God exercises this discipline, which is always for our good in love, when a soul is truly humbled, He in His wisdom often takes it away, forgiving, as to His present government and ways, the sin which made it necessary.<a name=362:3></a> Not that all such visitations are because of sins.<a name=362:4></a> The world is in a state of misery through sin, and all are liable to be subject to this servitude of corruption.<a name=362:5></a> This the Lord states in John 9: 3.<a name=362:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor even when they are sent of God in reference to the state of the soul, are they always because of sins committed; they may be to prevent them, break the will, humble us as to our state.<a name=362:7></a> Thus Paul had a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should be puffed up through the abundance of revelations.<a name=362:8></a> Thrice he asked the Lord to take it away, but the Lord had sent it for his good; so He would not.<a name=362:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This government of God, and pardon as to the present inflictions of His hand, we find both in the Old Testament and in the New.<a name=362:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, when God had pronounced a terrible judgment on Ahab for his wickedness, Ahab humbled himself, and God said to Elijah who had carried the message to him, "Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?<a name=362:11></a> I will not bring the evil in his days; in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.<a name=362:12></a>" This had nothing to do with the saving of his soul; indeed, as far as this history informs us, he died in his sins; but he was forgiven as to that particular judgment on the earth.<a name=362:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So with David: when he had acted very wickedly in a particular case, though in the main one beloved of God, and glorifying Him in his walk, Nathan the prophet declares to him, "Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me.<a name=362:14></a>" Yet in his general walk he was a man after God's own heart.<a name=362:15></a> Very many such instances could be adduced from the Old Testament.<a name=362:16></a> There was pardon of the sin as to present chastisement.<a name=362:17></a> David was spared and not cut off, but the child of this sin was taken from him.<a name=362:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in Exodus: when God threatened to destroy all the people, He recalled His threat when Moses pleaded His promises, and sent His angel to guide them, but declared "Nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.<a name=362:19></a> And Jehovah plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made," Exodus 32: 34, 35.<a name=362:20></a> But their falling in the wilderness had nothing to do with the saving of their souls: Moses and Aaron died in the wilderness too, and we know they were saints of Jehovah.<a name=362:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=363>[Page 363]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is just what is taught us in the book of Job, where Elihu interprets God's ways in chapter 33: 17-30; and in chapter 36: 7 he speaks expressly of a righteous man, saying, "He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous," but He chastens them for their sins; and he warns Job not to fight against God.<a name=363:1></a> If he had bowed in heart, he would have been delivered from his affliction (verse 16), and he is warned, as God was thus dealing with him, to take care he was not cut off from the earth (verse 12).<a name=363:2></a> Yet Job was the godliest man on all the earth, but needed correction as beginning to think well of himself; chapter 31: 16 and following.<a name=363:3></a> Compare chapters 29: 11, and 42: 5, 6.<a name=363:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the New Testament we have the same chastisement and forgiveness as a present dealing of God with man on the earth for their good.<a name=363:5></a> See 1 Corinthians 11: 30-32.<a name=363:6></a> They took the Lord's supper as if it were a common meal, and the poor had not enough to eat, and the rich indulged in gluttony and wine, and many were sick in consequence and even "slept," that is, died.<a name=363:7></a> But all this was present chastening in this world, for the apostle says, "When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.<a name=363:8></a>" The Corinthians were chastened for their faults, but were not condemned as unbelievers with the world.<a name=363:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we read in 1 John 5: 16.<a name=363:10></a> And this makes us understand what mortal sin so called is.<a name=363:11></a> It is a sin that brings the death of the body as a chastisement, and is such that Christians cannot pray that the life of their brother may be spared.<a name=363:12></a> whereas in other cases they could, and their prayers were heard, and the man's life was spared who had sinned: he was pardoned in this sense.<a name=363:13></a> Thus Peter's indignation arose against Ananias and Sapphira, not his compassion; and they died, through their sin, as a present judgment.<a name=363:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in James 5: 14-16, "The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.<a name=363:15></a>" The man recovered from his sickness, being pardoned as a present thing, as to God's government in dealing with him in this world.<a name=363:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=364>[Page 364]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not confound this pardon which refers to God's dealing with us here, and the chastisements His love may inflict upon us, or deliver us from if we humble ourselves, and the eternal pardon of our souls which belongs to us through the redemption that the blood of Christ has wrought for us, the value of which nothing can alter or take away.<a name=364:1></a> Whereas we can easily understand that, if God chastens a man for his good when he is His child, He can take off the chastisement, and in this sense pardon the particular fault if a man humble himself, without the salvation of his soul being in question.<a name=364:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is only another passage, which it may be well to refer to, John 20: 23.<a name=364:3></a> The Lord, after He was risen, comes amongst His disciples and communicates to them the peace He had just made, and sends them out to preach that peace to others while He has gone away into heaven.<a name=364:4></a> In thus sending them out as His Father had sent Him, He conferred on them apostolic authority, so that they should administer this remission and forgiveness of sins to all those who believed, who became Christians.<a name=364:5></a> Thus when the Jews, convinced of their sin in rejecting Christ, said, thinking all was over through their rejecting Him, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?<a name=364:6></a>" Peter replies, "Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=364:7></a>" Thus becoming Christians through his ministry they received the perfect remission which Christ obtained for them.<a name=364:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in Acts 10: 43; only there, as Peter himself had great difficulty in receiving any who believed from among the heathen, God gave them a testimony, as Peter says afterwards, before they were received, so that men could not refuse to receive them.<a name=364:9></a> So Paul gives the same testimony; Acts 13: 38, 39.<a name=364:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And to this day, if a heathen believes in Christ and becomes a Christian by baptism, he then receives full remission of sins.<a name=364:11></a> Only the apostles could do it, with not only personal authority, but discernment as to the reality of the faith of those who came; Acts 8: 28, 29.<a name=364:12></a> The general truth remains sure, "By him all that believe are justified from all things.<a name=364:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same governmental forgiveness remains true, too, with the same difference.<a name=364:14></a> Peter does not pray for Ananias and Sapphira: it was a sin unto death, and they fell dead.<a name=364:15></a> So Paul (1 Corinthians 5: 3-5) judged to "deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.<a name=364:16></a>" There was apostolic discernment, authority and power.<a name=364:17></a> Then all were called on too to act on their responsibility as the assembly of God (verses 12, 13), and Paul associates them with him in this act of power.<a name=364:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=365>[Page 365]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this sense the apostles had no successors.<a name=365:1></a> There were local authorities, elders, deacons, etc.<a name=365:2></a>, but apostles were apostles, and did this with Christ's authority everywhere, only Peter specially among the Jews, and Paul among the Gentiles; Galatians 2: 7, 8.<a name=365:3></a> As such, even the greatest authorities among the Roman Catholics admit they had no successors.<a name=365:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a succession owned of God, whose authority flows from Christ where His presence is realised in lowly grace.<a name=365:5></a> In Matthew 18: 18, if a person were wronged, he was to speak to the wrong-doer, and win him if he could; if he could not, to take two or three more; if this did not succeed, he was to tell it -- not to the clergy, not to any priest, but -- to the assembly.<a name=365:6></a> If the wrong-doer would not listen to the assembly, the person was free to treat him as outside it -- as a heathen man and a publican.<a name=365:7></a> And the reason is given: that wherever two or three were gathered together in Christ's name, really met and looking to Him, so as to act really and humbly in His name, He being there according to this promise, the act would have in ordinary church discipline (as "putting out from among yourselves") Christ's authority, and He would own and sanction it.<a name=365:8></a>

		It is not individual apostolic power (Peter and Paul both announce these would not be after their decease, Acts 20: 29-33) acting in Christ's name as Peter could, saying, "Jesus Christ maketh thee whole," or Paul delivering to Satan, but an act within the limits of duty, presented by the word, and which Christ sanctions by His presence and authority, acting in the midst of two or three.<a name=365:9></a> This supposes they are in unity, really gathered to Christ's name, and truly looking to Him by the Spirit, as the only One who can exercise this authority, and taking His word for their guide.<a name=365:10></a> It is this that in the word of God takes the place (I do not say of apostolic power, for it is not individual, but) of apostolic authority, because it is Christ who really acts.<a name=365:11></a>

		Were I young, with (humanly speaking) life before me, there would be ground for staying, for the work is opening.<a name=366:4></a> It is in many respects on a new footing, and the question of this position and the truths of Scripture as to the full position, and the walk too, of the Christian is raised everywhere.<a name=366:5></a> But I am not young, and cannot think to carry out the work myself; and God, I trust, will raise up instruments, as He has a few.<a name=366:6></a> It is not His mind, I believe, to be out of weakness.<a name=366:7></a> In the state of the church it becomes us to take part in her sorrows.<a name=366:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards your first question, I think there is a mistake as to the position of the assembly, both in the sister and also of the brother who objected, perhaps in all.<a name=366:9></a> When a person breaks bread, he is in the only fellowship I know -- owned members of the body of Christ.<a name=366:10></a> The moment you make another FULL fellowship, you make people members of your assembly, and the whole principle of meeting is falsified.<a name=366:11></a> The assembly has to be satisfied as to the persons, but, as so receiving to break bread, is supposed to be satisfied on the testimony of the person introducing them, who is responsible to the assembly in this respect.<a name=366:12></a> This, or two or three visiting, is to me the question of adequate testimony to the conscience of the assembly.<a name=366:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the beginning it was not so, that is, there was no such examination.<a name=366:14></a> Now I believe it a duty according to 2 Timothy 2.<a name=366:15></a> Nobody comes in but as a believer.<a name=366:16></a> This again makes the distinction of member of the particular assembly.<a name=366:17></a> Still I do not think a practice such as this sister's is satisfactory.<a name=366:18></a> I admit fully every case must stand on its own merits, and so be dealt with.<a name=366:19></a> Where breaking bread is intermitted, it is all well to mention it, though this be in some cases uncalled for, where the assembly knows about it and is satisfied; but if persons break bread, they are as subject to discipline as if always there, because it is the church of God which is in question, though represented by two or three: Christ is there.<a name=366:20></a> If it is merely an occasional coming as a stranger, the person not being known, it is well to mention the fact.<a name=366:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=367>[Page 367]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is not satisfactory in such cases is, first, it is accepting the person by the assembly as if they had another fellowship besides membership of Christ, which I do not recognise at all.<a name=367:1></a> And, secondly, I should fear there was a reluctance to take honestly the reproach of the position, the true separated position of saints, and [the wish] to be able to say to others, I do not belong to them, I only go as a believer.<a name=367:2></a> <i>I</i> only go as a believer, but then I accept the position.<a name=367:3></a> Waiting for them to get clear is all well.<a name=367:4></a> A true believer has TITLE at the table; but if they meet as members of Christ's body, they are all one body as partakers of one loaf.<a name=367:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>I</i> do not admit them.<a name=367:6></a> I own their title, wait upon their want of light, but would not allow them to put me in the position of a sect (and "full fellowship" means that) making allowance for their ignorance, and waiting upon it.<a name=367:7></a> They do not come really to break bread with us on the ground of the unity of the body, if they think they are not one with us in coming; for if we are true and right, they are not one with the body of Christ, the only principle of meeting I know at all.<a name=367:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I repeat, in the present state of the church we must have much patience, as their minds have been moulded in church membership; but I ought not to falsify my own position, nor sanction it in the mind of another.<a name=367:9></a> If the person is known to all, and known to be there to break bread, all mention is needless; it is a testimony to the unity of the body.<a name=367:10></a> If an occasional thing, the person who introduces is responsible.<a name=367:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I remember a case, where one growing in truth came to help sometimes in a Sunday-school, and from the other side of London, and asked the brethren if he might not break bread when there -- time even did not allow of him to get back to his Baptist service -- and he enjoyed the communion of saints.<a name=367:12></a> Brethren allowed him gladly; and, if my recollection is right, his name was not given out when he came afterwards.<a name=367:13></a> Very soon he was amongst Brethren entirely, but his fellowship was as full when he was not; and had he given occasion, he would have been refused in discipline, just as if there every Sunday.<a name=367:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other question is for me a more delicate one, because it is a question of the state of the soul, as of the church, when darkness covers it.<a name=367:15></a> Many, many souls cry Abba Father (that is, have the Spirit of adoption), which are clear in nothing, save that their confidence is in Christ and His work only; and as doubting is taught in the church, and a plain full gospel unknown and even rejected by teachers, this state is the natural consequence; and it often requires spirituality to discern the real state of a soul, if really under law, undelivered or legalised by teaching.<a name=367:16></a> Hard cold knowledge of doctrine is not what I seek.<a name=367:17></a> Then there is the danger of throwing back a soul just when it wants to be encouraged.<a name=367:18></a> Doubts brought in by conflict, when a soul can really say Abba, are not a ground of rejection, though it shews a soul not well established.<a name=367:19></a> Yet a soul exercised, but not yet resting in Christ's work, is not in a right state for communion.<a name=367:20></a> So with young converts -- it is far better for them to wait until they have peace, only carefully shewing it is not to reject them but for their own good.<a name=367:21></a> I should not look for understanding deliverance, but being personally able to say, Abba, Father.<a name=367:22></a> The intelligence of deliverance is the consequence of sealing.<a name=367:23></a> But if a man be not sealed, he is not in the Christian position.<a name=367:24></a> "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.<a name=367:25></a>" Peace through forgiveness is, as to Christ's work, the evidence of faith in Christ's work, and that work received by faith is the ground of sealing.<a name=367:26></a> Then one is delivered; but the intelligence of this is another thing.<a name=367:27></a> Israel out of Egypt was brought to God -- delivered.<a name=367:28></a> Through Jordan they entered in, were circumcised, and ate the corn of the land.<a name=367:29></a> But a sealed person alone is in the true Christian position; and this is founded on the sprinkling with blood, that is, faith in Christ's work, by which we have redemption, not in the knowledge of deliverance.<a name=367:30></a> This is its effect.<a name=367:31></a>

		One thing that you relate gave me much to think of, as indeed it has been a subject of thought pretty often for a long while, nor am I sure that I have the Lord's mind clear upon it.<a name=369:1></a> I think evangelising the greatest privilege of any in respect to gifts, though I am not an evangelist -- only (when I can) doing the work of one as well as I can.<a name=369:2></a> This is not my difficulty, but what you say, that the evangelisation has enfeebled the teaching the saints.<a name=369:3></a> The gifts are clearly distinct; but I do not see that one should enfeeble the other.<a name=369:4></a> Paul assuredly evangelised, and as surely taught, and taught in evangelising.<a name=369:5></a> Witness the Thessalonians; and if he did not look for, he certainly found, present fruit.<a name=369:6></a> He distinguished being a minister of the gospel, and a minister of the church, to fulfil (complete) the word of God.<a name=369:7></a> This is not in the Thessalonians, where all is personal, not corporate.<a name=369:8></a> We must be with God for each, as called of Him to it: and then I do not see why power should not be for both.<a name=369:9></a>

		But a certain salvationism, instead of Christianity, I think, has to say to it; which God may bless, but which carries its effect with it.<a name=369:10></a> Few carry in their mind, "I endure all things for the elect's sake.<a name=369:11></a>" It is a general idea that God is love, and would have all men to be saved, which is blessedly true; but thus it ends in being saved -- man's safety.<a name=369:12></a> There is no purpose of God in it, no glory of Christ; all called upon to bow to and own Him.<a name=369:13></a> Hence, as to the preacher's state of mind, when he has got the person saved, and this confessed, he is content, going no farther.<a name=369:14></a> God's interest in His own is lost, which leads on to building up.<a name=369:15></a> If we were with God about them, the heart would soon be drawn out in testimony to them.<a name=369:16></a>

		There is another thing -- glory to Christ in His church.<a name=369:17></a> This, I confess, greatly absorbs my spirit, though I be a poor hand for this work too.<a name=369:18></a> But this leads us to prayer for saints, so also to testimony to them.<a name=369:19></a> The evil is not earnest devotedness to evangelising, which is itself the way of blessing to an assembly, or rather God, working in one by His presence, builds up the other; it is being absorbed by it.<a name=369:20></a> But this affects the evangelising itself: there is less of Christ in it, more of man's importance, and when pursued in a revival way, more of delusive work; it never gives a solid foundation to build upon.<a name=369:21></a>

		Propitiation is properly for sins, as Hebrews 2, and 1 John 2, and Romans 3: 25, 26 are to the same effect: only, Christ having taken the condemnation for sin, persons who do not search out words exactly may speak of the effect as for sin.<a name=375:1></a> Sin, as calling for it, was not properly known in the Old Testament.<a name=375:2></a> Leviticus 1 does not, as far as I see, apply to this, except in a very general way.<a name=375:3></a> It was as a <i>peri amartias</i> that God condemned sin in the flesh in Christ for us, so that there was no condemnation for us.<a name=375:4></a> In Leviticus 1, though blood was shed and atonement made, all is sweet savour.<a name=375:5></a> Man's state is no doubt assumed, that is, sin; but the condemnation side is not what is in view, but acceptance.<a name=375:6></a> In the <i>peri amartias</i> sin is properly in view.<a name=375:7></a> In propitiation sins are in view.<a name=375:8></a> Substitution is a human word, though a right one, but properly it is for sins, that is, the scape-goat in contrast with Jehovah's lot.<a name=375:9></a> Sin, as such, is never forgiven: God condemned sin in the flesh, but Christ took this place, was given <i>peri amartias</i>, and, He knowing no sin, the condemnation of sin in the flesh took place, and that in death, and we are dead with Him for faith; it has ceased to exist: the condemnation of it gone.<a name=375:10></a> Death in Christ involves both.<a name=375:11></a> Guilt is from sins.<a name=375:12></a> We are dead to sin with Christ, but He has died for our sins.<a name=375:13></a> This last is what is properly atonement, and meets judgment.<a name=375:14></a> Death to sin is a question of state, not of guilt, though of exclusion from God.<a name=375:15></a> A question of defilement, not guilt, refers, and rightly, to what was done in the sanctuary, which was defiled (not guilty), which in full apprehension of the work has its importance.<a name=375:16></a>

		The scape-goat had to do with personal guilt, the blood on the mercy-seat with approach to God, but the sanctuary was cleansed.<a name=375:17></a> The word "atonement" is very vague, and never used in the English New Testament but once, where it ought not to be.<a name=375:18></a> In the Old, <i>kaphar "to</i> make atonement" refers to the removal of positive guilt out of God's sight.<a name=375:19></a> And, as I have said, sin properly does not come into question in the Old Testament, though birth in it is recognised in one place (Psalm 51: 5) only.<a name=375:20></a> Even where the sweet savour of Christ's acceptance is figured, man's sinful condition is recognised, and the work that is infinitely acceptable is in view of this.<a name=375:21></a> But this though it assumes it, does not deal with sin in itself.<a name=375:22></a> Lost and guilty are different: one is my state; the other, my responsibility and guilty failure.<a name=375:23></a> I believe I have said all I can at this moment.<a name=375:24></a>

		I doubt whether you have got all the bearing of Scripture as to sin.<a name=377:1></a> Christ appeared once in the consummation of ages <i>eis athetesin amartias by</i> the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=377:2></a> It is not a question of guilt and imputation that is here.<a name=377:3></a> Judgment is according to works, but Christ was <i>peri amartias</i> when God condemned sin in the flesh; further, as to sin of the world, we have <i>airon ten amartian tou kosmou</i>.<a name=377:4></a> We have had an innocent garden, then a sinful world, by and bye a world wherein dwelleth righteousness.<a name=377:5></a> Of course there can be no sin in mere creation, but the status is one of sin, the bondage of corruption; defilement can be, if not guilt; hence the tabernacle, etc.<a name=377:6></a>, were sprinkled with blood.<a name=377:7></a> True, because of Israel's sins, but defilement attached to them.<a name=377:8></a> The heavens are not clean in His sight, and He who went into the lower parts of the earth is gone above all heavens, that He might fill all things.<a name=377:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sin in the flesh is not guilt; but it would defile and not allow us to be with God, were it not condemned in the cross through His death who was made sin for us.<a name=377:10></a> The full effect will only be in the new heavens and new earth.<a name=377:11></a> Sin is not put away in the lost, I fully admit; but I could not say there was no suffering for sin in the abstract.<a name=377:12></a> It is never said sin is put away: I know the work is done, and am at rest.<a name=377:13></a> But the fact will not be accomplished as an effect till the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=377:14></a> If taking away be not a sacrificial expression, <i>peri amartias is</i>, and the sacrifice of Himself is.<a name=377:15></a> I could not say there is no sin of the world except as regards guilt and responsibility.<a name=377:16></a> It does not recognise defilement by sin.<a name=377:17></a> Further, <i>kapper is</i> applied to the holy place (Leviticus 16: 16-20); So it is to the burnt-offering (Leviticus 1), where there was no actual sin committed.<a name=377:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The main effect of the burnt-offering is to shew the perfect sweet savour of the sacrifice of Christ to God, but it was made in respect of sin, not on account of actual sins committed.<a name=377:19></a> Man must come by blood because he is a sinner, and though we get Christ Himself here (not "of his own voluntary will," for this is a mistake, though it was so, but "for his acceptance"), yet, as it is for us, the element of sin must be brought in.<a name=377:20></a> As to speaking of atonement, which, although acknowledged, he did not bring adequately into prominence, the reason for it is very simple, as you may see in reading Leviticus 1: 4, where it is especially said to be so in the usual (we may say, technical) word.<a name=377:21></a>

		The question is as to reception of saints to partake of the table of our Lord with us: whether any can be admitted who are not formally and regularly amongst us.<a name=381:6></a> It is not whether we exclude persons unsound in faith, or ungodly in practice, nor whether we, deliberately walking with those who are unsound and ungodly, are not in the same guilt -- not clear in the matter.<a name=381:7></a> The first is unquestioned; the last, Brethren have insisted on -- and I among them -- at very painful cost to ourselves.<a name=381:8></a> There may be subtle pleas to get evil allowed; but we have always been firm, and God, I believe, has fully owned it.<a name=381:9></a>
