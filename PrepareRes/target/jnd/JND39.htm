		REVIEW OF THE REVELATION OF LAW IN SCRIPTURE¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dr.<a name=1:1></a> Fairbairn is infected with the desire of setting up man's part in divine things, and so below grace.<a name=1:2></a> He works in the boundaries fixed by nature.<a name=1:3></a>

		Page 15.<a name=1:4></a> 'When, in respect to things above nature, God reveals His mind to men, He does it <i>through</i> men, and through men not as mere machines, unconsciously obeying a supernatural impulse, but acting in discharge of their personal obligations and the free exercise of their individual powers and susceptibilities.<a name=1:5></a>' As regards Old Testament Prophets, this is not true, and even in tongues in the New, and is bad as really rationalistic.<a name=1:6></a> He says: 'It is within the boundary lines fixed by nature, and in accordance with the principles of her constitution, alike in the mental and the material world, that the work of grace proceeds.<a name=1:7></a>'

		Page 31.<a name=2:3></a> 'Distinguishing between the teaching or commandments of Christ, and the commandments of the law, holding the one to be binding on the conscience of Christians and the other not, is plainly but partial Antinomianism; it does not, indeed, essentially differ from Neonomianism, since law, only as connected with the earlier dispensation, is repudiated, while it is received as embodying the principles of Christian morality, and associated with the life and power of the Spirit of Christ.<a name=2:4></a>' He here does not even know what he is talking about.<a name=2:5></a> It is not law 'as connected with the earlier dispensation,' but law as a principle and system on which man may be placed as contrasted with redemption, grace, and the gift of life.<a name=2:6></a> Further, it is not received as embodying the principles of Christian morality, but human morality.<a name=2:7></a> God and love having come in, the path of the Christian, as expressed in the life of Christ, goes on much higher ground -- not merely maintenance of human relations, however right, but "perfect as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.<a name=2:8></a>" And, further, he has not an idea beyond amount of requirement and form of obligation of law, whereas the question is: Is law the form of obligation?<a name=2:9></a> He avoids, and professedly, defining what law is, i.<a name=2:10></a>e.<a name=2:11></a>, an undeviating course imposed by the authority or power of another, and asks, 'How far has it varied in amount of requirement or form of obligation, at different periods of the divine administration?<a name=2:12></a>'

		Page 33.<a name=2:13></a> 'The Protestant churches generally stand committed to the belief of the moral law in the Old Testament as in substance the same with that in the New, and from its very nature limited to no age or country, but of perpetual and universal obligation.<a name=2:14></a>' This supposes a moral law in the New, which is the whole question, and confounds the principle of law and the substance or contents of a law.<a name=2:15></a> 'Of perpetual and universal obligation' then brings in the authority or else confounds the relations, consistency with which the Law insists on, with its authoritative insistence on it.<a name=2:16></a> This is what he constantly confounds, though forced sometimes to admit the difference, i.<a name=2:17></a>e.<a name=2:18></a>, that there is no formal law in the New Testament.<a name=2:19></a> But, besides, a new relation with God is formed in the New Testament, and this changes everything; of this he knows nothing.<a name=2:20></a> "Herein is love, not that we loved him,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this is excessive ignorance of divine truth, and in the teeth of Scripture, and shows he does not know what law means.<a name=4:4></a> It supposes man had the knowledge of good and evil before the Fall, which is false, that he had it to be like God in it.<a name=4:5></a> Whereas God says "The man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil.<a name=4:6></a>" God did give a positive law which did not require that knowledge, but required obedience.<a name=4:7></a> There had been no harm in eating the forbidden fruit, if God had not forbidden it.<a name=4:8></a> It was a formal law, but the thing forbidden not wrong unless forbidden.<a name=4:9></a> It confounds a nature producing its fruits with a law, i.<a name=4:10></a>e.<a name=4:11></a>, an imposed rule involving the authority or power of another in its true sense.<a name=4:12></a> In page 40, he does not stint to say, 'In the permission accorded to man to partake even of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, though with a stern prohibition and threatening to deter him from such a misuse of his freedom.<a name=4:13></a>' It is hard to suppose a greater proof of where moral law-defending leads a man.<a name=4:14></a> A permission with a stern prohibition shows a strange state of mind, but the meaning is evident.<a name=4:15></a> It was not a simple forbidding as test of obedience, but called for the reflective quality of man's mind to decide, on grounds of judged good and evil, what he ought to do.<a name=4:16></a> It is hard to conceive greater error than this part of the book.<a name=4:17></a> It shows the author, or his principles, incapable of any real scriptural or right thought on the subject.<a name=4:18></a> It is well that the system of Adam's having had the law thus -- being only more fully developed at Sinai -- should be brought out clear.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Page 38.<a name=4:20></a> But, further, the 'destination of man' is this rational development in knowledge.<a name=4:21></a> This is false two ways.<a name=4:22></a> It was not the destination of man, but something infinitely higher, and his destiny was in the Second Adam not in the first.<a name=4:23></a> Hence, in this system, the Second is a perfecter of the first by better motives and power, with 'potential pardon.<a name=4:24></a>' This faculty, however, was to 'secure the good he was capable of attaining.<a name=4:25></a>'

		Then, page 39, he must have a will to choose -- not obey.<a name=4:26></a> He says: 'For this there must be a will to choose, as well as a reason to understand -- a will perfectly free in its movements,

		This of course ignores the Scripture that he got the knowledge of good and evil in the Fall.<a name=6:1></a> Surely enmity against God is a subversion of our nature -- not being possible to be subject to the law of God is an essential change.<a name=6:2></a> This is the secret of the mischief -- no true sense of sin.<a name=6:3></a> He confounds responsibility, which arises from relationships, and in innocence were naturally walked in, with a law which imposes them, or rather conduct which fulfils them or results in punishment inflicted according to it by power.<a name=6:4></a> His quotation from Harless is right enough: 'There is something above the merely human and creaturely in what man is sensible of in the operation of conscience, whether he may himself recognise and acknowledge it as such or not.<a name=6:5></a> The workings of his conscience do not, indeed, give themselves to be known as properly divine, and in reality are nothing more than the movements of the human soul; but they involve something which I, as soon as I reflect upon it, cannot explain from the nature of spirit, if this is contemplated merely as the ground in nature of my individual personal life, which after a human manner has been born in me.<a name=6:6></a> I stand before myself as before a riddle, the key of which can be given, not by human self-consciousness, but by the revelation of God in His word.<a name=6:7></a>' But Dr.<a name=6:8></a> Fairbairn's inference to Adam's state is a denial of the effect of eating the forbidden fruit.<a name=6:9></a> Conscience, save in a figurative sense, is a law, because God has placed it as a monitor, taking care that when sin came in conscience should come in with it.<a name=6:10></a> But it is the opposite of true law -- <i>nomon me echontes</i> (not having law) is the word.<a name=6:11></a> And God describes it by man's becoming "as one of us, knowing good and evil" in himself, i.<a name=6:12></a>e.<a name=6:13></a>, not imposed by authority to which he had to answer as responsible.<a name=6:14></a> To apply such a thought to God is absurd.<a name=6:15></a> I could say, God was a law to Himself, just meaning He was under none, but that His own perfection made Him always act so and so.<a name=6:16></a> As a fact, man has the knowledge of good and evil which is not a law, even so in the sense of a rule, for it may be vitiated, as in Saul and millions else.<a name=6:17></a> "I thought I ought.<a name=6:18></a>" But it is the faculty of making the difference and holding one thing for good, another for evil, making the difference between good and evil in my mind, whatever my rule may be.<a name=6:19></a> But you cannot speak of being 'subject and accountable,' when speaking of God.<a name=6:20></a> Obedience, conscience, and law, or the rule of conscience, are all distinct things.<a name=6:21></a> Obedience refers to authority -- law to a rule imposed -- conscience

		to my making a difference between good and evil, right and wrong in myself, if there was no authority, no obedience, no law.<a name=7:1></a> For that is as God does.<a name=7:2></a> He says: 'We are compelled to regard the absolute standard of right and wrong as constituted by the nature of the Deity.<a name=7:3></a>' The nature of the Deity as the absolute standard of right and wrong is all false till I get the Second Man, and supposes evil, as does revealed law after the Fall.<a name=7:4></a> For in God I have sovereign love, learnt in Christ's sacrifice, and I have divine purity in a nature which cannot sin.<a name=7:5></a> But to make a creature have the nature of the Deity as his absolute standard as such, falsifies duty, because God cannot be in the relations man is in, and duty flows from it.<a name=7:6></a> Hence, when the Decalogue is given, there is no revelation of God's nature at all, but simply the obligations of man's towards God and his neighbour.<a name=7:7></a> Christianity says, "Be ye therefore imitators of God as dear children" -- when we are such, and gives Christ as the pattern -- "perfect as your Father" -- but He is it first.<a name=7:8></a> "God commends his love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<a name=7:9></a>" In Him were the two poles of perfection.<a name=7:10></a> Absolute self-sacrifice (not loving a neighbour as oneself, which is no divine perfection, and cannot be) <i>for</i> us -- that is purely divine, no worthy object, but divine goodness; <i>to</i> God -- that is absolute human perfection, divine indeed but still of and in a Man.<a name=7:11></a> The Law knew nothing of this, but man's duties where he was, but Christ was God manifest in the flesh, and that is our pattern.<a name=7:12></a> But he who so walks will have no law against what he does.<a name=7:13></a> Of this there is no thought in Dr.<a name=7:14></a> Fairbairn's mind.<a name=7:15></a>

		Page 45.<a name=7:16></a> 'For what was the law, when it came, but the idea of the divine image set forth after its different sides, and placed in formal contrast to sin and opposition to God?<a name=7:17></a>' The Law being 'the idea of the divine image' is mere nonsense, if the Decalogue, as he says, is the grand display of it, for that image is not thought of in it, but man's duties towards God and his neighbour, which in the nature of things cannot apply to God.<a name=7:18></a> Much of, indeed all of it, in its nature supposes sin.<a name=7:19></a> And even when it is said, "Be ye holy," there is no thought of "as," but only "for," and perfection is "with Jehovah thy God," not "as.<a name=7:20></a>" That is in principle in Christianity alone, because Christ was come, the Second Man, not the first.<a name=7:21></a> It is this that makes it so dreadfully false, and falsifies the nature of law.<a name=7:22></a> The first Adam is the history of responsibility in man

		THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT AND THE KINGDOM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great mistake to apply the Sermon on the Mount in its positive statements to the law of the Ten Commandments, as if it was a spiritualising of them.<a name=69:1></a> The Law, as a system, is spoken of, taken up in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:17">Matthew  5:17</a>, 18, along with the Prophets.<a name=69:2></a> Prophecies, ceremonies, and all that is in the Law, were not set aside, or annulled, but fulfilled, the body was of Christ, and no doubt the Lord fulfilled its behests and precepts.<a name=69:3></a> It was to be kept till all was fulfilled.<a name=69:4></a> For faith, it was fulfilled in Christ, and, as to practical righteousness, is fulfilled in the Christian; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=69:5></a> But what the Lord goes then through is the contrast of an internal state of heart with Pharisaic outward formal righteousness.<a name=69:6></a> Only two of the commandments are mentioned as of the old times, and a subjective state is contrasted with a mere formal fulfilment of the letter.<a name=69:7></a> Duties to God are not entered on (never, I think, in Matthew, for God was revealing Himself in a new way).<a name=69:8></a> Man was not to think merely of killing -- if one hated his brother, was angry even without a cause, God took notice of it; so of adultery.<a name=69:9></a> You have thus the state of the heart judged.<a name=69:10></a> So, as to alms, and all else, it is a righteousness which exceeds the righteousness of Scribes and Pharisees, as in verse 20.<a name=69:11></a> But in no wise a spiritualising of the Law.<a name=69:12></a> As I have said myself, eight out of ten commandments are not referred to.<a name=69:13></a> Verse 20 is the key to it; compare chapter 6: 2, 16.<a name=69:14></a> There, of course, you get positive directions.<a name=69:15></a>

		The character of the end of chapter 5 is deeply important.<a name=73:8></a> After insisting on the subjective state and spirit suited to the kingdom, the putting down of will and unsubdued self, He takes up the principle of the Law, dealing with evil for its repression by the law of Talion, and then introduces the immense principle, known by Christ's coming into the midst of evil -- good entirely above evil, but acting in the midst of it -- takes notice of it, and as exercised against one's self, but above it, and acting from its own motives, and this is what God does, and here is made known to those born of Him, those connected with Christ.<a name=73:9></a> "As their Father," a totally new principle, they are to be like Him -- this was the perfect path of Christ -- a wonderful privilege, showing what, in this connection, "perfect" means.<a name=73:10></a> It is not reached by the evil, save to draw out the good, and make a new created but divine path in this world.<a name=73:11></a> It is not righteousness, in the sense of justice, not what presents us to God, but that wherein we are to be perfect like Him.<a name=73:12></a> What a place to put us in!<a name=73:13></a> But it is not holiness (though largely ministering to it; see <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>) not intrinsic purity though supposing it and inseparable from it, but as above evil and self, goodness, for such is God even our Father, evil would make it impossible -- it is goodness in the midst of evil.<a name=73:14></a> Goodness in the midst of good is heaven (but, in its highest character, result of redemption, for good and evil are now known -- in the Cross, absolutely and perfectly brought to an issue) but in itself, as result.<a name=73:15></a> Goodness in the midst of good, all answering to itself, and adoringly capable of enjoying it.<a name=73:16></a> This is.<a name=73:17></a> grace.<a name=73:18></a> Good above evil.<a name=73:19></a>

		REMARKS ON AN "ESSAY IN AID OF A GRAMMAR OF ASSENT" ¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking, to begin with, that in his three acts of the mind, he only speaks of 'doubt,' 'inference,' and 'assent.<a name=91:1></a>' He makes 'assent' different from 'inference,' and there he is right.<a name=91:2></a> I have often said, an inference is only 'must,' or therefore never really 'is.<a name=91:3></a>' Belief of a fact never rests on an inference, but on intuition, sight, etc.<a name=91:4></a>, or testimony.<a name=91:5></a> But a man's disbelieving is not believing the contradictory.<a name=91:6></a> Religion is revealed -- rather God and His truth; I do not believe it -- I do not think there is adequate evidence and do not believe it.<a name=91:7></a> But I do not believe there is none.<a name=91:8></a> If we put truth instead of revealed religion -- and the truth is -- this depends on a religion being in question as revealed.<a name=91:9></a> Now certain things being presented to me as revealed, my being unable to receive them is not my saying there is no revealed religion.<a name=91:10></a> And when truth is presented to me, it must be specific truth (and there can, if it embraces all our relationship to God, be but one) but if truth be presented to me, my disbelief of it, seeing it must be positive, is not saying 'there is none.<a name=91:11></a>' According to Dr.<a name=91:12></a> Newman there are three modes of holding and three ways of enunciating propositions -- each corresponding to each -- three mental acts.<a name=91:13></a> Taking free-trade as an example, he says: "These three mental acts are doubt, inference and assent.<a name=91:14></a> A question is the expression of a doubt; a conclusion is the expression of an act of inference; and an assertion is the expression of an act of assent.<a name=91:15></a> To doubt, for instance, is not to see one's way to hold that free-trade is or is not a benefit; to infer, is to hold on sufficient grounds that free-trade may, must, or should be a benefit; to assent to the proposition, is to hold that free-trade is a benefit.<a name=91:16></a>" "And, in fact, these three modes of entertaining propositions -- doubting them, inferring them, assenting to them, are so distinct in their action, that, when they are severally carried out into the intellectual habits of an individual, they become the principles and notes of three distinct states or characters of mind.<a name=91:17></a> For instance, in the case of revealed religion, according as one or other of these is paramount

		But his logic is wholly at fault too, the comprehension of the word wholly left out.<a name=92:5></a> In page 6, he says: "We cannot assent to a proposition, without some intelligent apprehension of it; whereas we need not understand it at all in order to infer it.<a name=92:6></a> We cannot give our assent to the proposition that 'X is Z,' till we are told something about one or other of the terms; but we can infer, if 'X is Y, and Y is Z, that X is Z, whether we know the meaning of X and Z' or no.<a name=92:7></a>" Thus the "is" is absolute, i.<a name=92:8></a>e.<a name=92:9></a>, X must be all Y, and Y must be all x to be always true.<a name=92:10></a> Thus, snow is white, white is a colour, therefore snow is a colour.<a name=92:11></a> This is nice logic!<a name=92:12></a>

		What follows is sufficiently judged further on -- the confusion of effect from the thing assented to, and strength in the assent.<a name=92:13></a> But further; he says: "The only question is, what measure of apprehension is sufficient.<a name=92:14></a> And the answer to this question is equally plain: -- it is the predicate of the proposition which must be apprehended.<a name=92:15></a> In a proposition one term is predicated of another; the subject is referred to the predicate, and the predicate gives us information about the subject; -- therefore to apprehend the proposition is to have that information, and to assent to it is to acquiesce in it as true.<a name=92:16></a> Therefore I apprehend a proposition, when I apprehend its predicate.<a name=92:17></a> The subject itself need not be apprehended <i>per se</i> in order to a genuine assent: for it is the very thing which the predicate has to elucidate, and therefore by its formal place in the proposition, so far as it is the subject, it is something unknown, something which the predicate makes known; but the predicate cannot make it known, unless it is known itself.<a name=92:18></a> Let the question be, "What is trade?<a name=92:19></a>" here is a distinct profession of ignorance about "trade"; and let the answer be, "trade is the interchange of goods"; trade then need not be known, as a condition of assent to the proposition, except so far as the account of it which is given in answer, "the interchange of goods," makes it known; and that must be apprehended in order to make it known.<a name=92:20></a> There is no reason why our knowledge of the subject, whatever it is, should go beyond what the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole force of <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>is the power of life in Christ manifested in resurrection, and complete in glory, founded on death so as to put a total end to the first man and to sin (He having been made sin), and hence an entrance as out of the first into the new creation where all things are of God.<a name=99:1></a> As to this, it is a most comprehensive statement.<a name=99:2></a> I would show the principle of this briefly.<a name=99:3></a> Beside death and judgment, we have it applied to our course here.<a name=99:4></a> All were dead since Christ died for all -- they have to live to Him who died for them and rose again.<a name=99:5></a> But this goes very far, because Christ Himself, in so far as He came connecting Himself with men in the flesh, disappears.<a name=99:6></a> He came under law -- Son of David -- a minister of the circumcision -- of whom according to the flesh Christ came.<a name=99:7></a> All this is gone.<a name=99:8></a> He died as to this, and died for all -- all were dead.<a name=99:9></a> Hence the Christian knows no one after the flesh in his new nature; risen in Christ, he has nothing, no connection with the world of Adam the other side of death.<a name=99:10></a> That belonged to the life of flesh, and the link is broken in the death of Christ, and the life in which he lives does not belong to it.<a name=99:11></a> He is entered into, as risen, and is of the new Creation -- the old things are wholly passed away, he is dead, and has no more to say to them.<a name=99:12></a> The life he lives belongs to another order of things, and he is entered into them in that life, having died out of the others, or holding himself for dead -- Christ having died to and out of it -- and risen up from this in a new life, Christ.<a name=99:13></a> In this new Creation all things are of God (we the firstfruits of it), all entirely new.<a name=99:14></a> Two things are attached to this: we are reconciled to God -- we are made the righteousness of God.<a name=99:15></a> But how entirely new all this is!<a name=99:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, the point of connection between the beginning and end of the chapter is, that the love of Christ being in his heart, the thought of the terror of the Lord urged him to persuade men.<a name=99:17></a> Then this love of Christ, i.<a name=99:18></a>e.<a name=99:19></a>, the way it showed itself, brought out the great truth of men's state and their bringing into a wholly new Creation which identifies itself with that power of life with which the chapter begins, while all is grounded, as to righteousness, on Christ being made sin for us.<a name=99:20></a> In the beginning, the power of this life, as to death and as to judgment, is remarkably brought out.<a name=99:21></a> On the whole,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Note further in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, after, as already noted, speaking of our direct positive condition as flowing from divine power in life, bringing us into glory, death being wholly annihilated, he contemplates death for us, as having this life, and it is of course gain.<a name=100:3></a> Here oneself (not in an evil sense) is brought in.<a name=100:4></a> And this, note, is the motive for our seeking to be acceptable to Him, knowing we shall be with Him in glory, and even our souls, if we die before the glory come.<a name=100:5></a> We like to be agreeable to One we love when with Him, besides there is the solemnity as well as the joy of the Lord's presence.<a name=100:6></a> But then, in taking up the second part of man's lot -- the judgment -- we get a distinct difference of the great principle, and the effect, where Christ's love is truly known.<a name=100:7></a> In the latter case, a person does not think of himself at all -- the love of Christ constrains him, and he thinks of others.<a name=100:8></a> Thus responsibility and being manifested before the judgment-seat, and receiving the things done, is kept as solid ground of warning before the soul.<a name=100:9></a> And there is the active toil of grace to be acceptable and pleasing to Him.<a name=100:10></a> But when judgment comes as terror before his mind as it is, the Apostle only thinks of others through the constraining love of Christ.<a name=100:11></a> Perhaps Paul had been accused of being beside himself, but at any rate he distinguishes between his own joy and blessing in rising up to God by the power of the Holy Ghost, and the sober judgment of what was suitable.<a name=100:12></a> I apprehend he spoke of his condition as in chapter 4, and even in chapter I, for their sakes, still his doing it thus brought him to the point of responsibility and view of the judgment.<a name=100:13></a> But the effect of this on himself, as we have seen, was to urge his love to others.<a name=100:14></a> This love in Christ being in the death of Christ had a double effect.<a name=100:15></a> He did not know Christ as a living Messiah before His death any more.<a name=100:16></a> He was now not his own at all, but Christ's.<a name=100:17></a> So if any man were in Christ, he was of and in a new Creation, of which Christ was the first fruits in resurrection, where all things are of God who has reconciled us to Himself by that work.<a name=100:18></a> The whole of that is then set out, verses 19-21.<a name=100:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, how very different the character (also noticed) of <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>and 3 -- the subduedness, readiness to suffer, watchfulness for God's presence and character in the midst of this world, in the first; and the spiritual energy which

	<div class="paragraph">
		looks forward to the next, and glory in it, Christ in glory being before his mind to win in the latter.<a name=101:1></a> I do not know but the first is the deepest.<a name=101:2></a> In the second we win Christ and glory -- blessed thing surely -- but it is more what we get.<a name=101:3></a> In the former, we are like Him, and His love and character are more thought of, and we living in and according to them to His glory.<a name=101:4></a> But both are perfect in their place.<a name=101:5></a> So most gracious, divine affections come out in chapter 2, but earnest zeal against evil, inconsistent with the glory, in professors in chapter 3.<a name=101:6></a> Still, in love, weeping; still chapter 2: 17, 30, enters far more into saintly feelings.<a name=101:7></a> We are among the <i>chasidim</i> (saints) on the earth, not thinking with weeping of those who slight the glory.<a name=101:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In sum, we have in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, the proper condition of the Christian.<a name=101:9></a> First, looking, God having wrought him for it, to having, according to what was divine power in life, what was mortal swallowed up of life.<a name=101:10></a> Death had wholly lost its power.<a name=101:11></a> Next, if he died, being so wrought, and having the earnest, being absent from the body and present with the Lord, these were his living, active motives as to his walk.<a name=101:12></a> Thirdly, as the judgment-seat of Christ was there, the effect of this on him was (and could not be with what went before, that he was wrought for glory), not to make him look on to being manifested, but his being now manifested to God.<a name=101:13></a> He was in the light really, walking in it in respect of that judgment, so that all was manifested to God now, before whom he walked, in the glory (for when we appear before the judgment-seat, we shall be in the glory, and glorified, and our hearts judge everything according to the glory -- so by faith, now).<a name=101:14></a> Then if he did think of the terror he thought of others; it woke up in his heart that love of Christ which had been shown in that which had brought him into that state, and proved all not brought in to be dead, turning it thus downward towards those who had no part in it.<a name=101:15></a> A blessed state -- upwards, in power over death, to God, all in perfect light -- or, according to Christ's own love, downward to sinners!<a name=101:16></a> What a <i>chasid</i> (saint) the Christian is, as to his position, by Christ!<a name=101:17></a> Nor do I at all say that this latter part is in any way inferior to the other.<a name=101:18></a> It takes more out of self into God's own nature.<a name=101:19></a> As I have noted as to <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>and 3, this leads more to God, that to glory delivering from the world.<a name=101:20></a> Still he would win Christ.<a name=101:21></a> It may be a lowly thing to work out our salvation,

		Note too the character of experiences in Philippians and 2 Corinthians, and what is practically such in 1 Corinthians .<a name=102:7></a> I have already spoken of Philippians, but I return to it here to compare it with the others.<a name=102:8></a> It is as walking in the Spirit, and filled with it, being above all that Resh could suggest.<a name=102:9></a> Flesh and sin are not at all recognised, thought of, or named, save as once saying "no confidence in flesh," and that is religiously.<a name=102:10></a> Hence we find he is not insensible to trial, but, by the wings of faith above it, all distress turns to his salvation.<a name=102:11></a> Self is so gone, and he so blessed he does not, for self, know whether to choose life or death, only as it is better for the Church he shall stay, deciding by faith his own trial for life.<a name=102:12></a> Careful for nothing, only doing one thing, pressing onward to win Christ and the prize of His calling, rejoicing in the Lord always, able to do all things through Him who strengthens him.<a name=102:13></a> Such is experience when laid by in the power of the Spirit.<a name=102:14></a> It was not his present engagement in the active service in the conflict, but his rising in the power of the Spirit above it all.<a name=102:15></a> In 1 Corinthians we have the Christian at the other extremity.<a name=102:16></a> They were going on, as we know, very badly.<a name=102:17></a> Paul would not even go there, and deals in earnest warning and reproof.<a name=102:18></a> But what is his own position as to them?<a name=102:19></a> Confidence in God.<a name=102:20></a> "Ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=102:21></a>" God is faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowship (knowledge) of our Lord Jesus Christ, who also shall confirm you to the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=102:22></a> From this point he can deal with them as connected with Christ.<a name=102:23></a> There is a reality in being a Christian, even when going on badly, though that is <i>never</i> allowed.<a name=102:24></a> So in Galatians, where he stood even more in doubt of them because it touched doctrine, "I have confidence in you through the Lord.<a name=102:25></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then anxieties for the Church, could not go to Corinth, could not stay at Troas, no Titus.<a name=103:7></a> In Macedonia, without fighting, within fears -- doubted as to having sent the Epistle.<a name=103:8></a> God comforts those that are cast down.<a name=103:9></a> Poor vessel, but rich grace!<a name=103:10></a>

		Then positive danger from flesh.<a name=103:11></a> He goes to the third heaven -- a man in Christ there, he can glory, but flesh would glory too -- a thorn comes.<a name=103:12></a> This he would have taken away, but looks to the Lord.<a name=103:13></a> It hindered his work, made his bodily presence weak, speech contemptible, tended to his being despised in preaching.<a name=103:14></a> But the Lord was there -- flesh, self, was put down, and Christ, strength and grace came in, and he glories in the infirmity.<a name=103:15></a> Now all this is power in weakness -- weakness felt as to the vessel, which we need, but therein God most blessedly and graciously meeting us, and making Himself better known.<a name=103:16></a> It is very instructive and sweet to the soul.<a name=103:17></a> How gracious of God, and wonderful!<a name=103:18></a>

		But further, in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, in turning, after the full positive condition of the Christian, to meet the natural portion of man by the same truth of life in Christ glorified, note that death is spoken of because a Christian may die.<a name=103:19></a> Death is not in itself set aside; it is a gain.<a name=103:20></a> Judgment is not, as to the Christian, at all.<a name=103:21></a> We must all be manifested there to receive the things done in the body.<a name=103:22></a> He knows the terror of the Lord, but the only action of this on his mind is to lead him to persuade others.<a name=103:23></a> We are always confident if we think of death, because we are formed for the glory into which Christ has entered in the power of life, and have the earnest of the Spirit -- it is, if we die, going from the burdening body and being present with

		I go back to point out that in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>, man is put down in himself.<a name=104:7></a> The power of God and wisdom of God is in what is foolishness for man.<a name=104:8></a> God's folly is wiser than man, and things that are not bring to nought things that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence.<a name=104:9></a> Then the new thing is brought in.<a name=104:10></a> "We are of God in Christ Jesus," and all that clothes us and brings us into blessing is in Christ too.<a name=104:11></a> "Of him are ye," i.<a name=104:12></a>e.<a name=104:13></a>, of God, "in Christ Jesus," and "He is, of God, made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification.<a name=104:14></a>" It is in life and competency for blessing, and entering into all -- Christ -- the new thing.<a name=104:15></a> In chapter 2 he will know nothing else but Christ in his ministry, and that in the way it was folly to men, but in this, flesh must be put down.<a name=104:16></a> When a great work was to be done, he was in weakness, and fear, and much trembling, and his speech was not with persuasive words of men, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and in power.<a name=104:17></a>

		Chapter 5 is interesting too in this way: after giving the full effect of the new power of divine life in Christ, reaching to mortality being swallowed up in life, it turns and meets the whole case of the full effect of the old thing, death and judgment; death (we having life) is "absent from the body, and present with the Lord" -- judgment makes us, knowing the terror of the Lord, anxious to persuade others, the love of Christ constraining us; compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>, and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:27">Hebrews  9:27</a>.<a name=106:19></a> The power is in "God who raiseth the dead," or has risen, and given us Christ risen, in this power, as Life.<a name=106:20></a> It is founded on His being made sin for us, we the righteousness of God in Him; the practical result is, knowing no man after the flesh -- living to Him who died and rose for us, and seeking in all to be agreeable to Him.<a name=106:21></a> But it meets <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:27">Hebrews  9:27</a>, wholly and exactly.<a name=106:22></a>

		As to Matthew's and Luke's account of the birth of the Lord -- first, in the brief accounts given, we find nothing but what bears on particular points which the Holy Ghost had in view.<a name=115:2></a> There is nothing more opposite to the intention of the Gospels than what is called a harmony.<a name=115:3></a> They treat different characters of Christ, and what bears on that is given, and all give a very small part indeed of His history.<a name=115:4></a> This produces difficulties which are attached to our ignorance of a multitude of connecting links.<a name=115:5></a> Often facts having the same moral bearing are put together, especially in Luke, with entire indifference as to date.<a name=115:6></a> The moral point is all that is sought.<a name=115:7></a> That the event happened before or after, is all one, nay, the historical order is neglected to maintain the moral, or distant events linked together without notice of interval, if bearing morally one on another.<a name=115:8></a> This is the general method of Luke, and is invaluable for our instruction.<a name=115:9></a> In reading the account in Luke's Gospel of the interval between the ascension and the resurrection, an unbeliever would at once take it for continuing, and that the leading out to Bethany was the day of His resurrection, and the ignorance of Luke, and the absence of inspiration proved by the contradiction of other Gospels.<a name=115:10></a> Now, in this case, we have the proof of the contrary at hand.<a name=115:11></a> Luke knew perfectly, if we look at him as a human writer, that there was an interval, and so true is this that he is the only one who gives the fact that forty days elapsed before the Saviour left the earth.<a name=115:12></a> But the simple truth is, this was not the Spirit's object in the Gospel -- it was in the Acts.<a name=115:13></a> But we learn here that such a bringing of events together proves nothing of what it is alleged to prove.<a name=115:14></a>

		But the truth is, while I see no proof whatever that the visit of the magi was immediate, yet from the universal character of Luke's Gospel, I am disposed to consider probable that all the account of Matthew is left out as not to his purpose, and that when he has shown the accomplishment of the Law in the Temple, he passes over at once to the moral continuation of Jesus' life, without touching on what referred to His position as Jewish King and taking the place of all Israel.<a name=116:11></a> When the ordinances were accomplished in the temple, the youth of Jesus begins in Galilee.<a name=116:12></a> The royal flight into Egypt had nothing to do with this -- it was a parenthesis in His moral history.<a name=116:13></a> We have a case exactly analogous in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:13">Luke  4:13</a>, 14.<a name=116:14></a> All <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>and 3, come in between.<a name=116:15></a> But this was not the Holy Ghost's subject in Luke.<a name=116:16></a> The proof is found in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:14">Mark  1:14</a>, and <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:24">John  3:24</a>.<a name=116:17></a> Biography is not a gospel.<a name=116:18></a> In each Gospel is the mighty and unfailing purpose of the Spirit of God.<a name=116:19></a>

		After the presenting Himself, and the principles of His kingdom in the midst of the people, and then, on rejection, declared that He was a server (not a fruit gatherer) and the character of His kingdom as thus set up on His rejection, what follows chapter 13, and on the actual rejection, and death of John Baptist, is the retirement of Jesus, and a testimony against the nation, but of continuous, sovereign goodness to the poor of the flock, whether then or hereafter, as in the double feeding, and then the Church and the Kingdom in glory.<a name=131:1></a>

		There is also a looking out to the full millennial blessing, not only in the satisfying the poor with bread, but in the looking out to the Gentiles -- yet these owning themselves as inferior to the Jews, dogs compared with the children, yet having to say to God in grace, having all their desire in connection with Him.<a name=131:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter brings out distinctly John's rejection (and the apostate king thus) but the Lord still in fact waits on Israel, though appreciating this act; verse 13.<a name=131:3></a> But the real bearing of all this, and result, is figured forth clearly in the close of the chapter.<a name=131:4></a> This itself connects the present state of the Jews, as rejecting and set aside, with the close of the dispensation.<a name=131:5></a> The interval is Christ on high, and the disciples toiling below, but they do not lose their Remnant character on earth.<a name=131:6></a> All is willingness on the other side, as those in the ship own His personal glory.<a name=131:7></a> The moral history of all this is given in the following chapter, and the manner of introducing the worst of the Gentiles in grace -- the Jews being still owned in their place, but this by faith -- chapter 11: 22, in outward government.<a name=131:8></a> In the close, while still in fact dealing with Israel in Jehovah blessing, it is after rejection.<a name=131:9></a>

		After the rejection, often remarked, of the Jews on their rejection of Christ in chapter 12, and the sowing and likeness of the Kingdom of heaven in chapter 13, we get the working of the principles of this process of rejection or breach between Messiah and Israel, and then, after the statement or exhibition of the new thing (the Church and Kingdom) the principles of the Church and Kingdom as regards those in it.<a name=131:10></a> This makes the middle part of Matthew most clear in order, and interesting.<a name=131:11></a> The series begins with verse 54 of chapter 13.<a name=131:12></a> He is the carpenter's Son for Israel, rejected in His own country.<a name=131:13></a>

		Chapter 14 begins the active and violent rejection -- John is put to death.<a name=132:1></a> Christ takes notice of this, and departs into the wilderness.<a name=132:2></a> Still, as long as could be, the grace of Christ exercises itself towards Israel, and, in the perfection of His divine and perfect human rights, He satisfies the poor with bread, and "the twelve" is the perfection of human governmental power -- as in the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=132:3></a> All this He came to present, knowing He was to be rejected, but sends the multitude away, and takes His priestly character, goes on the storm in which the disciples, the Remnant of Israel, would be, enters the ship, and the wind ceased.<a name=132:4></a> Peter's position is apart -- the state of the Remnant before Christ gets into the ship, but then He is received where He had been once rejected when He had shown His power over Satan, but Satan his over the unclean.<a name=132:5></a> In chapter 15 we get the moral ground of all this breach -- God would have real righteousness, the Pharisees, hypocritical outside service, drawing near with lip-service but in vain.<a name=132:6></a> All would go into the ditch together -- the inside must be clean -- but mercy reached on the other hand, in the very nature of God, beyond Israel, to the most reprobate of nations according to flesh, but not on the ground of being Son of David and promises, but of grace.<a name=132:7></a> Then Christ, in divine perfectness, not in connection with present Messiah government, feeds the Remnant and poor of the flock, who glorify the God of Israel.<a name=132:8></a> In chapter 16, as heretofore remarked, we have the generation rejected, and their spirit warned against, and the Church set up, for faith, on the Christ the Son of the Living God.<a name=132:9></a> But here the path was the Cross.<a name=132:10></a> He was no longer to be proclaimed Messiah to Israel.<a name=132:11></a> But not only the Church built by Christ, but the administration of the Kingdom of heaven confided to Peter.<a name=132:12></a> The Son of man was to be not merely as in Daniel, but to suffer, and come in glory.<a name=132:13></a> This Kingdom of glory is then shown in the Transfiguration.<a name=132:14></a> Elias was come already, had suffered, and so must the Son of man.<a name=132:15></a> The reason for His leaving that generation was their unbelief -- even His disciples, so that if He were not there they even could not cast out Satan, dispel that evil power which hung on man; with a word He could.<a name=132:16></a> There was not in them that nearness to God in which this power was exercised in abstraction from nature, and its force was wanting.<a name=132:17></a> However, by faith the mountain could be removed, and so it was afterwards.<a name=132:18></a> Then the Lord (who revealed the Father) shows that He and the

		Thus, from chapter 13: 54, to the end of chapter 15, we have the principles working connected with Christ's then relationship to the Jews, and its being closed; chapter 16 we have the Church, the Kingdom of heaven, and, chapter 17, the Son of man coming in His Kingdom (till then, Son of God to be heard).<a name=133:4></a> From chapter 18 we have the principles which belong to the Kingdom of heaven and Church, when they are set up, down to chapter 20: 28.<a name=133:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The order of this chapter is more complete and full than I had remarked.<a name=133:6></a> The first parable is not the Kingdom of heaven, though it be "the word of the Kingdom" -- it is individual; still the outward effect on the sowing of the word, not the question of grace, or how produced, but the fact and the hindrances, what operates morally, i.<a name=133:7></a>e.<a name=133:8></a>, we have the effect of the word in individuals.<a name=133:9></a> Then the Kingdom, the effect of the word in the world, and then God's part in the matter in purpose, or spiritual understanding.<a name=133:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not sufficiently noticed, I think, that this chapter comes after the rejection of Israel, on their rejecting Christ and the Kingdom of heaven in chapter 13.<a name=133:11></a> Hence we have the apostate King, and, that for which I now notice it, Jehovah, in His beneficence, unchanged according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>, satisfying the poor with bread, and perfection of administration in Man -- fragments gathered, but the twelve baskets full.<a name=133:12></a> Then the intermediate scene.<a name=133:13></a> He sends the disciples away, lone as the waves (the Remnant, when He is gone) -- He sends the multitude away -- goes up on high -- is perfect Master of what tosses them -- and, with the episode of Peter (which is more Christian place, going out to meet) rejoins the ship, all is calm, and the world that had rejected Him receives Him with joy, and He brings power in blessing.<a name=133:14></a>

		I have been occupied with chapters 14 and 15, for they occupy evidently a special place between the mysteries of the Kingdom, on the judicial rejection of the Jews at the end of chapter 12 (which, note, goes on to the end of the age) and the Church, and Kingdom glory in chapters 16 and 17.<a name=134:16></a> The contents are naturally special, for the Kingdom is set forth in chapter 13, after the rejection of Judaism, and the Church, and glory of the Kingdom come after.<a name=134:17></a> What is this special place?<a name=134:18></a> It is plain that chapter 13 gives the Kingdom of heaven in the peculiar character it assumes when the King is in heaven not manifested, and, as Mark says, it grows and springs up, He, seemingly, knows not how.<a name=134:19></a> What then is brought out between this and the revelation of the Church on earth?<a name=134:20></a> It is the actual proof of present rejection, and the incapacity of the disciples to avail themselves of His then present power -- the moral darkness of the scribes and Pharisees,

		This leads me to say a few words more in detail of chapter 14.<a name=135:13></a> The work of rejection begins.<a name=135:14></a> John is beheaded, and Jesus retires, but only to find a multitude, and He meets them in grace.<a name=135:15></a> He then shows Himself as the Jehovah that was to satisfy the poor with bread, let Him be rejected by the nation as He may.<a name=135:16></a> But He expects the disciples to understand and use this power, but they do not -- they judge by sight, "Give ye them to eat," "We have five loaves.<a name=135:17></a>" Then He sends the disciples away while He is on high, and joins them still in the ship, connected, I apprehend, with Judaism which He had left to cross the world by divine power (our part).<a name=135:18></a> But Peter cannot -- only that he was helped he was sinking -- and the Jewish Remnant re-enters the ship, but with Christ.<a name=135:19></a> The walking on water was, I apprehend, in principle, Church position -- walking simply by faith to meet Jesus, with no known fold, only by faith.<a name=135:20></a> When He rejoins the ship they own Him, not as Messiah in a carnal way and expectation, as even the disciples had done, but as Son of God, which was just what the nation would not do, and the disciples practically never did, though God taught individuals so.<a name=135:21></a> So the country of Gennesaret,

		On the whole, we have Israel rejecting the witness of God, Christ present as Emmanuel, the disciples, unable to profit by it, left and rejoined, moral principles of man's heart, and God's overflowing goodness, Israel rejected but owned.<a name=136:7></a> But plants must be of God's planting or rooted up.<a name=136:8></a> Still the Lord distinguished the disciples as possessed of personal faith (save of course Judas) -- plants of the Lord's planting, and, when He now simply leaves the Pharisees, He appeals to that faith.<a name=136:9></a> Ignorant as they were of God's ways, and incapable of availing themselves of what Christ was, yet the enquiry addressed to their personal faith brings out the answer, given of the Father, of that on which the Church should be built.<a name=136:10></a> They clung to Him, to His Person, when the nation rejected Him, and when even they could not profit rightly by His presence in Israel.<a name=136:11></a> But then, when Israel was for the time rejected, this Person became the foundation of every thing.<a name=136:12></a> And the Lord who had put the question to draw out this distinctive faith, however prejudiced and buried in traditions even they were, at once recognises the direct teaching of His Father.<a name=136:13></a> On this, now Israel was gone, the Church would be built.<a name=136:14></a> The contrast of verses 1-5 then 6-12, and what then follows is very striking.<a name=136:15></a> Read, in verse 18, "And I also say unto thee," in contrast or addition to the Father's revelation, and also to Peter confessing.<a name=136:16></a> He had said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" -- Christ says, "Thou art Peter," but this was authority, the really divine (or divinely given) title to give a name.<a name=136:17></a> The rest of the verse is a kind of parenthesis.<a name=136:18></a> By the revelation of what Christ was by the Father, he partook of the nature of the foundation, as all true believers do, though not distinguished as Peter.<a name=136:19></a> But the building of the Church comes out as Christ's

		In this Gospel we have the Kingdom of heaven in chapter 13, consequent on the rejection of the Jews -- the Church in chapter 16, and the Kingdom in glory and power in chapter 17.<a name=165:5></a> But there are some important remarks connected with it, though I am not quite master of all its hearings.<a name=165:6></a> The closing rejection of Israel in chapter 12, on to their final state under Antichrist has been fully noted -- Israel looked at as that "generation," i.<a name=165:7></a>e.<a name=165:8></a>, that had to do with Christ in unbelief.<a name=165:9></a> But then the Kingdom of heaven is continued from the sowing of the Son of man on the earth.<a name=165:10></a> It was not the Christ with Israel, and seeking fruit in His vineyard, but sowing -- out of the house -- on the seashore; but it was the word of the Kingdom, as Christ preached "Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand.<a name=165:11></a>" Then the Kingdom of heaven, the King being rejected, takes the form described in the parables, but it was not a direct, but still a continuance of Christ's work when here (like <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:1">Hebrews  1:1</a>, and chapter 2: 2).<a name=165:12></a> In the tares and wheat, the sowing is by the Son of man, but the field is the world.<a name=165:13></a> The first parable is Christ's true work, i.<a name=165:14></a>e.<a name=165:15></a>, bringing what was to produce fruit, but he has no character as the Sower, but the fact.<a name=165:16></a> It was an outward thing, then substituted in the world for the outward Jewish thing -- the carrying on in the world of the Lord's work in Israel, i.<a name=165:17></a>e.<a name=165:18></a>, sowing (not seeking fruit) with its effect <i>de facto</i>, and then God's mind in it.<a name=165:19></a> In chapter 16 it is different; it is the Person of Christ the Son of God (proved in resurrection) and His building the Church on this.<a name=165:20></a> The sign of the prophet Jonas (death and resurrection, which was the cutting off of Israel on its own old ground) the only sign given.<a name=165:21></a> God had revealed Himself as in nature beyond dispensation, in chapter 15, in the case of the Syro-phoenician, but divine grace in love to the people in spite of all.<a name=165:22></a> The moral rejection, under law, had been shown in the beginning of chapter 15 -- the evil of man, verses 18-20; then God Himself in goodness, in the Syro-phoenician.<a name=165:23></a> Then

		It is further of the greatest importance to remark that the keys given to Peter are not the keys of the Church -- Christ builds that -- (hence in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>, we have not any one building -- in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>we have) but the keys of the Kingdom of heaven, i.<a name=166:7></a>e.<a name=166:8></a>, the outward thing on earth, as we have seen, consequent on Christ's sowing, following up even His earthly sowing, which might or might not produce fruit, and certainly produced in result a mixed thing which could not be mended, had a treasure in it for which Christ took the world, a-gathering of good and bad fishes.<a name=166:9></a> Doubtless Peter's authority in establishing it was authenticated in heaven, but the result was not other than what Christ predicted.<a name=166:10></a> But then it is evidently personal.<a name=166:11></a> The Church the Son of God builds.<a name=166:12></a> The being with His disciples to the end of the age has nothing to do with Church matters.<a name=166:13></a> It is discipling the Gentiles.<a name=166:14></a> It is from a risen Christ in Galilee, not, as in Luke, ascending.<a name=166:15></a> It has the world for its field, but to disciple the nations, the Jews not being in question.<a name=166:16></a> It is really chapter 13, not chapter 16.<a name=166:17></a> In this mission Christ will be surely with those He sends, to the end of the world, even when the Church is gone.<a name=166:18></a> So far as the history of Acts goes, and Galatians, the mission to the Gentiles was given up to Paul and Barnabas.<a name=166:19></a> At any rate this was an extension consequent on Christ's receiving all power in heaven and on earth (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10">Matthew  10</a>); not the Body of Christ nor the building of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>.<a name=166:20></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10">Matthew  10</a>goes to the end of the world too, but excludes Gentiles.<a name=166:21></a> It is connected with Christ as then present, and will be renewed at the end, when the Church is gone and the Kingdom of heaven, properly speaking, closed.<a name=166:22></a> When risen, and having all power in heaven and on earth, the nations were to be discipled.<a name=166:23></a> In chapter 10, the starting point was from Christ on earth -- the Kingdom was at hand; in chapter 28, the starting-point is Christ having all power in heaven and on earth, now risen, the

		In chapter 24, it is not the cities of Israel, but Jerusalem, nor exactly the message of grace with the harvest great, but judgment on the rejecting Jerusalem, as the end of chapter 23 shows, and the sorrows (throes) of the Jews.<a name=168:13></a> It answers in character and time to chapter 10: 14-22, with the same declaration: "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<a name=168:14></a>" But then we have the additional truth that this Gospel of the Kingdom must be preached to all the nations (Gentiles) and then the end should come.<a name=168:15></a> This gives the full general history consequent on the rejection of Christ; verse 14 is a special addition, by the bye, so to speak, verse 13 closing the reference to the Jewish testimony; verse 15 then takes up the special case of Jerusalem, and is an instructive sign for those who shall see it when it does come.<a name=168:16></a> Verses 4-13 only gave the character of the times as a guidance, and could be applied as soon as the troubles began, but goes on to the end in similar circumstances in Palestine, only the Gospel must go out to the nations as witness before the end could come.<a name=168:17></a> Then,

		Note first, the missions in Matthew, Mark, and Luke have their character from the place and position, and close the scene of Christ's ministry, as in the particular Gospel.<a name=170:7></a> Not so in John; there there is no scene or close.<a name=170:8></a> It is Himself, a divine Person (though incarnate, and always taking the place He was in towards His Father) and the mission is from His Person, not from resurrection (as Matthew) merely, nor from ascension (as Luke) nor His exaltation from service (as Mark).<a name=170:9></a> He bestows peace on them as He had made peace for them, sends them out on this ground, and as His Father had sent Him He sends them, and gives them the Holy Ghost as the power in which they lived and wrought, carrying forgiveness with them (administratively) as He had, on earth.<a name=170:10></a> Then Jewish and millennial truth comes after; but verses 17-23 are the present condition and service in grace consequently on accomplished work, and from Himself as he is now (though then there) but all along here (from chapter 13, save chapter 15) as giving them a part with Himself where He is.<a name=170:11></a> It is not Bethany nor Galilee, but the Son going to His Father and their Father, His God and their God, and revealing Himself in their midst.<a name=170:12></a>

		There are still one or two points I would remark in chapter 1.<a name=191:13></a> First, this abstract part is light, and while such <i>in se</i> is thus for condemnation by opposition of nature, and speaks of God and light, whereas, verse 14, His actual coming in grace in flesh is grace.<a name=191:14></a> Hence we have the Father, and Christ as Son; as we have seen heretofore in chapters 8, 9 and 10, so chapters 3: 19 and 17: 3, and all through, as often noticed.<a name=191:15></a> But further, we must look at what Christ was thus abstractly as His divine place no doubt, but also as the Source of blessing for us, when grace does work.<a name=191:16></a> He was not only God, so that we know God, but He was with God (<i>pros ton Theon</i>).<a name=191:17></a> All He was, a distinct Person, He was towards God.<a name=191:18></a> This is an all-important truth, because when incarnate and returned into glory this does not cease, <i>ze to theo</i> (He liveth unto God) here not <i>pros</i> (with) -- that "was" (<i>en</i>) in His nature -- here the object and end of life, as such, in its purpose, as well as its character; <i>ze</i> (liveth) is the activity of what was, and now in manhood.<a name=191:19></a>

		Note the connection in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3">1 John  3</a>; first, as often remarked, Christ is seen as one Person -- God and eternal life, manifested in the Word made flesh.<a name=196:8></a> Hence He appears in chapter 2: 28, i.<a name=196:9></a>e.<a name=196:10></a>, is Man (in glory); we are born of Him, verse 29, and so He is God and we sons of God.<a name=196:11></a> And as He as Man in the world was not known, as the world did not discern He was the Son, "knew him not," so it does not know us who are sons (children) also.<a name=196:12></a> That we are, and here we are in His place in relationship with God as Father, and He being our life we are so completely associated with Him, that we know that when He appears we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.<a name=196:13></a> Thus we are fully like and as Christ, He being our Life, in the presence of God, with the Father, in the house, entered with the Son into the excellent glory.<a name=196:14></a> This grace has called us to, as alive in and by the Second Adam, the Son of God, as having eternal life, our calling as associated with Him our life.<a name=196:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All hangs here, in John, on Christ's being eternal life, here first manifested, then communicated -- He who is, and is not here separated in thought from God, and yet who is our life so that we are associated with Him in unity of place and nature -- "True in him and in you"; just as death put away the old thing, and resurrection brought us into acceptance in the Beloved, in the new estate, so we are dead to the old thing and alive according to the new.<a name=197:12></a> The difference between Romans and <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:9">1 John  3:9</a>, is that as Romans brings in man as a sinner, it leads him up to the point of death to that, and life to God through Jesus, whilst John speaks of the Life come down from God in its nature becoming our life, and John knows nothing but that as life in one born of God, though he well knows we cannot say we have no sin.<a name=197:13></a>

		But the character of divine righteousness is very distinct and definite, if we think of Christ.<a name=197:14></a> If I keep the law, I fulfil the obligation of a man.<a name=197:15></a> But Christ's work, though He did that, was a very different thing.<a name=197:16></a> He by His work on the Cross glorified God, which brought Him as Man into God's glory.<a name=197:17></a> All that God was, Righteousness, Love, His truth, His majesty wholly compassed by sin (really to be glorified) was perfectly glorified on the Cross.<a name=197:18></a> Otherwise, if justice had its way, no love; if forgiveness simply, no justice, but, sin or not, all alike.<a name=197:19></a> This was not God -- but through the Cross, Christ offering Himself through the eternal Spirit, God was perfectly glorified in the place of sin -- what God was.<a name=197:20></a> Hence it was divine righteousness, keeping the Law, made good man's place; the work on the Cross made good God's.<a name=197:21></a> Hence He enters

		Note as to dwelling in God and God in us, we have it presented in a triple way, and inverse order.<a name=200:15></a> First, when the great truth of God's dwelling in us is presented, of which the consequence is that we dwell in Him; thus, "Hereby we know that he abides in us by the Spirit which he has given to us," and again, "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him and he in God.<a name=200:16></a>" The latter being the consequence of the former.<a name=200:17></a> Now the consequence of God dwelling in us is that we dwell in Him.<a name=200:18></a> He is our dwelling place, in heart, we are sheltered, protected, at home in God.<a name=200:19></a> We abide there as our hiding place and perfect joy.<a name=200:20></a> But thus we realise the spirit and power of that in which we dwell, and this realisation gives an active, living character to the dwelling of God in us, so that we are said to dwell in Him first in this case, and He in us because this last is in power and grace.<a name=200:21></a> Hence it is said: "If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.<a name=200:22></a>" "Hereby we know that we

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, in chapter 4, we have first God -- His love manifested for life and propitiation; then His dwelling in us and so we in Him; and thirdly, love perfected with us in placing us as Christ before God, while in the world.<a name=201:9></a> As to what we are, there is first nature -- we love, therefore are born of God, and know God; next, God's dwelling in power, to fill, quicken, and animate this nature.<a name=201:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are also one or two points to be noticed in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5">1 John  5</a>, besides those already seen.<a name=201:11></a> We have the Spirit, the water, and the blood, agreeing in the witness, purifying, expiation are come, through the death of Christ to all association with man alive in Adam, and the Spirit too.<a name=201:12></a> He witnesses, the water purification by death also, and blood cleansing the conscience by blood.<a name=201:13></a> Death is sealed, even in grace, on the first man.<a name=201:14></a> Yet it is grace.<a name=201:15></a> God has not mended or reformed man in the first Adam -- there is death to that -- but the witness is that He gives eternal life.<a name=201:16></a> It is not derived from the first Adam; the way of having it is by death to that, not by Law -- that is no wonder.<a name=201:17></a> But grace does not act in leading on what was in man; it acts by death on it and for it.<a name=201:18></a> God has given, not wrought in what man had.<a name=201:19></a> What He has given is eternal life -- new, divine life to be enjoyed for ever with Him.<a name=201:20></a> What God has given must be blessing with Him, and it is for ever, but it is not life given to men in man -- a life to the fallen Adam in

	<div class="paragraph">
		Note further in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1">1 John  1</a>, there is more, as regards fellowship, than the fact of life suited as being from Christ, to give us capacity for fellowship.<a name=202:7></a> That eternal life was WITH the Father, as it is said in the Gospel, the Word was WITH God, i.<a name=202:8></a>e.<a name=202:9></a>, we have the Son as Life, personally distinct from the Father.<a name=202:10></a> It is that which was with (<i>pros</i>) the Father, which has been manifested.<a name=202:11></a> The Father has life in Himself, but here is Life WITH the Father.<a name=202:12></a> Hence, when manifested, we see the revelation of the Father in Him, according to that nature in which the Life was, and receiving of this Life we have communion with the Father with whom it was, and with the Son in whom it has been manifested (and so the Father livingly, and in Him; compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>and 14).<a name=202:13></a> This is important here as regards the fellowship -- it is in Christ manifested down here; nor can anything thus be more intimate than this communion.<a name=202:14></a>

		I return to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:15">John  14:15</a>, 16; it is this -- both refer to the point of His going away and their desire to keep Him.<a name=202:16></a> This is met by two considerations -- If ye love Me do not desire Me to stay, but keep My commandments.<a name=202:17></a> Besides, I will, by and on going, pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, who shall abide for ever.<a name=202:18></a> Both refer to their anxiety that He should stay as proof of their love, and as taking their trouble away.<a name=202:19></a> If it was love, prove it is genuine; trouble would be relieved.<a name=202:20></a> Thus, chapter 13, "clean" for heaven -- a "part with Me"; chapter 15, to produce fruit.<a name=202:21></a> But though on earth, chapter 15 very distinctly points to His removal.<a name=202:22></a>

		In Christ we have not merely miracles as proof of personal power, but the setting aside evil, universally healing all that were oppressed of the devil, universal setting aside of his power, and his goods seized.<a name=236:8></a> Next, they were miracles of deliverance -- the power of God.<a name=236:9></a> Next, He can give this power.<a name=236:10></a> This is met by the spirit of the world; His friends think Him mad -- for the unclean spirits who bound man's heart did not -- and in the ecclesiastical body wicked malicious opposition -- they preferred attributing good to Satan and throwing the people into his hands, to owning Him.<a name=236:11></a> Lastly, He rejects connection with Israel, or any, as to the flesh, owning only moral subjection to God.<a name=236:12></a>

		I do not know how far the beginning of Mark is made clear, as a whole, in the Synopsis, but I give it here with a view to resting somewhat on a particular part of it.<a name=236:13></a> Up to chapter 3: 13, we have a picture of the Lord's ministry after the introductory matter.<a name=236:14></a> The details thus: John's preparatory ministry with water -- Christ to baptise with the Holy Ghost; chapter 1: 1-8.<a name=236:15></a> Christ associates Himself with the Remnant being baptised, is anointed and sealed with the Holy Ghost, and owned of the Father; then meets the adversary who held man captive, is tempted in the wilderness with wild beasts (not Adam's place), served by angels (verse 9).<a name=236:16></a> Thus (chapter 5: 13) all prepared, and John cast into prison, He begins His ministry, preaches the Kingdom of God at hand, and repentance, gathers round Himself persons who leave all to be with Him.<a name=236:17></a> His doctrine with authority -- with power, for the demons own Him and are driven out.<a name=236:18></a> Next, He heals the diseases of man himself,

		But further, as to His ministry, the disciples cannot fast while the Bridegroom of Israel is there -- besides He cannot put the new power into the old vessels of ordinances.<a name=237:9></a> The sabbath tells the same story.<a name=237:10></a> To an outcast David, and surely an outcast Messiah, where was a Jewish covenant of rest?<a name=237:11></a> Freedom was there -- all should be for Him.<a name=237:12></a> Besides the sabbath was for man, the Son of man, the Heir of all man's rights and blessings from God, and therefore Lord of it.<a name=237:13></a> The scene in the synagogue tells the same story as to doing good.<a name=237:14></a> How clearly this tells all the characters of His ministry!<a name=237:15></a> The Pharisees and the Herodians seek to kill Him, but the crowds from all parts follow Him, so as that He should have a little ship to wait on Him, for He had healed, and the unclean spirits were forced to own Him.<a name=237:16></a> He forbids their telling it.<a name=237:17></a> This closes the characterising His ministry and service.<a name=237:18></a>

		Two points I would yet remark; first, the Lord so far from distress or uncertainty in His place with and relationship to God, not only sees the heaven opened, but has the direct witness of the Father, besides the descent of the Holy Ghost, to His relationship with Him, and delight in Him.<a name=237:19></a> This was the position in which in the course of His ministry Jesus was certainly set by God, not one of distress, anguish, indignation and anger.<a name=237:20></a> This is not true as of God, most surely not as of

		Further, Satan attacks Him, as he attacked Adam.<a name=238:4></a> This is true, but, led of the Spirit, He freely offers Himself to the attack, as He did to His final suffering from God's hand as a sacrifice on the Cross.<a name=238:5></a>

		Note, this chapter which closes the relationship of Christ with Israel as in ministry to win the nation, unites the choice of the Apostles with the rejection of the nation.<a name=238:6></a> Chapter 4 presents the connection of the responsibility of those who heard with the propagation and witness of what they heard, at the judgment of God which referred to it -- that the Lord seemed to let all grow up as it might, but He only watched the time of harvest, and then acted again Himself immediately -- lastly, that we are in the same barque with Jesus, foundering in the storm, though He seems to sleep, and as to perfect peace care is out of the question.<a name=238:7></a> Chapter 5, I judge, in this respect gives more details on the breaking up of the connection of the Lord with Israel, and its true character on its renewal -- a Remnant, under the power of the enemy, healed -- Himself expelled, and the healed left behind Him as a testimony.<a name=238:8></a> Satan hurries Israel, unclean, to ruin.<a name=238:9></a> The child whom He goes to heal, has really to be brought to life, though the Lord looks on it as only asleep.<a name=238:10></a> On the way faith, in the woman, heals -- a principle which lets in Gentile, Jew, or any.<a name=238:11></a>

		In following merely the dispensational bearing of these passages, we have the Lord scarce received, as being the carpenter's Son, in His own country, and thereupon He sends out the testimony of His disciples, urgent on the cities of Israel, bringing judgment, if rejected, worse than Sodom.<a name=238:12></a> Then the sin of doubting Israel summed up by the violence of Herod against the witness of the Lord as far as it had gone.<a name=238:13></a> So that Jesus and His are in the desert, but, the people thronging in their need, He shows His Jehovah power of blessing to the people's need, and, dismissing the multitude, He goes apart to pray (on high) and returns to His disciples walking on the sea.<a name=238:14></a> They perceive, and are alarmed, but He gets into the ship, and all was calm, and they astounded, though the previous testimony

		After the miracle of the seven loaves and the four thousand -- proof of His abiding love and care for the poor of the flock -- and the obstinate and stupid unbelief of the rulers and leaders of the nation, it seems to me that the condition and unbelief of the disciples comes on the scene.<a name=239:9></a> Do you not see, though having eyes?<a name=239:10></a> When He did open eyes, it was sometimes only as trees walking, that men saw.<a name=239:11></a> He instructs them in His sufferings, and Peter rebukes Him (for He spake it openly, and what was prudence, when things were so?<a name=239:12></a>).<a name=239:13></a> But the Lord presses the Cross, and confession of the Son of man, in the face of that generation, and then shows the glory.<a name=239:14></a> Then the rising "from the dead" (not "of the") puzzles the disciples.<a name=239:15></a> The Lord continues to open the real state of things to them as to Elias and John the baptist for example, and the unbelief of the disciples again meets Him, and the question of faith in the people, in whose unbelief as to full power the disciples are here involved, is plainly put.<a name=239:16></a> The power of Satan was there, and of old, and the power of the Lord now come in grace, and the man says, "If thou canst .<a name=239:17></a>.<a name=239:18></a>.<a name=239:19></a> have compassion" -- for indeed the unbelief of the disciples ministered to that of the poor man.<a name=239:20></a> The Lord, in a few plain words, declares the question of power lies in that of faith.<a name=239:21></a> The "if thou canst" is "if thou canst believe.<a name=239:22></a>" "Have you power to believe?<a name=239:23></a>" But indeed nearness

		On the whole, the disciples even had not the faith which made available His then manifestation of power.<a name=240:8></a> The nation therewith rejected Him.<a name=240:9></a> They must therefore take part with Him in that rejection -- reject and cut off everything which put a stumbling block in the way, and manifest the energy of grace in self-sacrifice, for the energy of divine judgment would apply to everything.<a name=240:10></a> Hence, again and again, in all this part of Mark, He insists on His sufferings and rejection as a central point in all their position, and the implicit reception of the Kingdom as a little child.<a name=240:11></a> All these chapters are exceedingly important for the dispositions of relationship.<a name=240:12></a>

		God, it knows it in itself.<a name=309:1></a> "Good Master," saith he, "what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<a name=309:2></a>" What a willing mind!<a name=309:3></a> would we have said.<a name=309:4></a> How encouraging, and amiable!<a name=309:5></a> How to be drawn on in such a course!<a name=309:6></a> There was ignorance of the first principles of truth now brought to light.<a name=309:7></a> He knew nothing and speaking only under the delusion of the enemy, though in the amiableness of the flesh, he knew not himself.<a name=309:8></a> The Lord stops him quite short.<a name=309:9></a> He came to Him as a Teacher, setting Him up Jewishly as such, in this ardent flow of youth.<a name=309:10></a> "Why callest thou me good," says Jesus; thus casting all this hope down in the young man's estimate of himself, and goodness -- he must reject it all.<a name=309:11></a> It would have been contrary to God.<a name=309:12></a> "There is none good but God.<a name=309:13></a>" Had He answered to the young man's mind and question, Jesus would to him have denied the first principle of truth, the very point the young man needed -- we ALL need.<a name=309:14></a> The law had said, "This do, and thou shalt live," but it included all.<a name=309:15></a> The young man, taking this principle on the assumption of his own goodness (which, if it had existed, could not have wanted the law) not the conviction of sin by it, asks what the good thing is that he should do, seeing Christ's holy wisdom and walk.<a name=309:16></a> The Lord, having stated the principle that none was good but God, takes the second table, so-called, and proposes these commandments to him.<a name=309:17></a> The young man, anxious to evince his desire to do right, and his avidity for eternal life as proposed as a portion of God for the soul, arrests the Lord with the answer: "All these have I kept from my youth.<a name=309:18></a>" There was something exceedingly amiable in all this -- it may be without knowledge of himself, but this alacrity of heart -- the flowers of a weed are often fair, and if they bear no fruit it, as to nature however fallen, God, who has so clothed the grass, He who made it and could look with that separated eye of goodness which could rise over the sin, and separate the creature in His own holiness, could recognise this.<a name=309:19></a> His heart was not unaffected by it; looking upon him, He loved him.<a name=309:20></a> It was very attractive.<a name=309:21></a> It is not to be above sin always to be occupied with the evil; he who lives in his mind in good, will congenially recognise the good handiwork of God, marred and ruined as it may be and is.<a name=309:22></a> It was the same thing, the same intimacy with what good was which made the Lord say: "There is none good but God," and love the young man.<a name=309:23></a> Nor did the ignorance of his judgment arrest, but rather draw out the compassionate love of the Saviour.<a name=309:24></a>
