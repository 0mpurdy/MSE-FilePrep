	<div class="paragraph">
		Whoever prays much for the Church will feel little disposition to let his desires evaporate pen in hand.<a name=1:1></a> Nevertheless, these prayers will give to him who perseveres in them a spiritual impulse, by virtue of which (far from letting himself be hindered by things which might have the appearance of meeting the need of souls, but which in reality would serve only to seduce and lead them aside) he will be constrained to manifest, as far as in him lies, the true character of that which, while clothing itself with this specious garb, might draw souls far away from the truth and from the Lord's blessing.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The controversy on the subject of the views put forth for some years past, as to the Church and the presence in it of the Holy Ghost, has assumed an entirely new phase.<a name=1:3></a> We no longer hear people say much of Korah, or hold similar language -- language which a spiritual activity, that does not enter into the framework of that which exists, has always to endure.<a name=1:4></a> It is now agreed that it is a question of serious principles.<a name=1:5></a> Events, and the imperious wants of the children of God, have brought all who reflect, no matter how little, to recognize as solemn and, so to speak, prophetic warnings -- warnings which God has verified by the sequel -- what had at first been taken for enmity against that which exists, and for a desire to upset an order and an authority which people loved to consider the assured channels of blessing.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Far more than this, the principles put forth as to ministry are recognized as being of all importance and essential to the existence as well as to the well-being of the Church.<a name=1:7></a> I do not mean that, on that account, those who have put them forth are the more loved; nor, by the fact of persons being obliged at last to recognize it, is a disagreeable truth the more loved for that.<a name=1:8></a> We find moreover, that when such truth cannot be denied, it is suddenly discovered that all the world knew it already, and that the one who has insisted on it has done nothing but exaggerate and thus spoil it.<a name=1:9></a> It little matters, if,

		FIRST PART -- PRESENT STATE OF OPINION ON THE SUBJECT OF MINISTRY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The universal priesthood of the children of God, a truth so precious -- what do I say?<a name=2:4></a> -- a relationship with their God and Father essential to their happiness and to that of the Church itself -- this priesthood is now admitted without contestation; but, in exchange, it is sought to carry on the combat with more success on another ground.<a name=2:5></a> We will follow our adversaries to the field which they have themselves chosen, namely, the question of ministry: that of the sufficiency of the word and the Spirit to lead Christians in every respect; finally, that of a formal organization, the great idol of the day, what is called a Free Church.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What had been refused to the testimony of the word is yielded to the force of circumstances.<a name=2:7></a> Wherever there is a little light, the clergy are absolutely unable to maintain themselves in the position they took pleasure in keeping.<a name=2:8></a> Spiritual activity is too great; eyes are too much opened to abuses; the position in which the clergy themselves find themselves is too false.<a name=2:9></a> By the goodness of God the attention of Christians is too much awakened as to these questions.<a name=2:10></a> But the exterior evil is more threatening than even this movement of minds in the midst of the flocks; and the ecclesiastical functionaries feel that they must leave it an undisputed field, or that still worse would come to them.<a name=2:11></a> They feel, besides, that what constituted their support is becoming a clog to them, and that they are obliged to leave in freer hands the work which they would like to direct, and which nevertheless they dare not undertake.<a name=2:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is certainly great confusion in this; but the establishment of such a principle is of the greatest importance.<a name=3:3></a> The author, it is true, makes a restriction -- a restriction which he presents not at all as flowing from divine right, but purely from human right.<a name=3:4></a> It is that for good order.<a name=3:5></a> The Church entrusts<a href="#3:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> these rights to men whom she sets up, to a Clergy.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Such is, in particular," continues this same article, "the evangelistic ministry.<a name=3:7></a> The minister receives his gifts from God only; his office from men.<a name=3:8></a> It is not a character which distinguishes him from other Christians, which makes of him and his colleagues a separate order, a caste, a clergy, according to the proudly pretentious word of the catholic hierarchy, which thus calls itself alone the heritage of the Lord, while it sees in the rest of the Church only the <i>laos</i> [the people], the laity.<a name=3:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides this, the article we are citing complains, because the author of the "Examination of the Darbyite Views on the Sacred Ministry" believes he finds in scripture a hierarchical government for each flock, concentrated in the person of the pastor alone, however right it may be, that he should "endeavour to utilize the religious elements he meets with among the faithful.<a name=3:10></a>" And he fears this monarch soon becoming a pope, "without reckoning that here again universal priesthood is found pitiably banished in the cloudy region of abstractions.<a name=3:11></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#3:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> The presence of the authority of the Holy Spirit, and, in consequence also, the authority of the gifts He confers, are ignored by our opponents. Priesthood does not confer the right of preaching; it is the *gift* which imposes this duty on the one who has received it. If, for example, a spiritual capacity for preaching is met with, the Church can neither confer nor take it away. Neither gifts, nor the right to preach, are the portion of all; and it is very wrong to consider the right of preaching as a right of man. It is a duty which flows from a gift, an obligation toward God. Woe to him who does it not, if God has conferred the gift on him. The Church cannot entrust him with that for which God has already made him responsible, nor take it from him; neither can it relieve him from the responsibility which is attached to it. On the other hand, the Church cannot entrust to him that which God has not given him. If he has the talent, the Lord calls him to traffic with this talent; if he has it not, no institution can fit him to do so.

		<a class="footnote" name="#5:f3"><sup>+++</sup></a> In saying "adversaries," I mean to refer only to views and the position taken with regard to them. I am not the adversary of the persons who have taken this position. The author of an "Examination of the Darbyite Views," a pamphlet written in a gentle and amiable spirit, is, to my knowledge, a brother who would not like to be an adversary of the children of God. He has, in general, represented my views with uprightness, with sincerity, and ordinarily with justness. Nevertheless, in the point which constitutes the thesis of the pamphlet, he has made me say precisely the contrary of what I have really said. Preoccupied with his subject (I only attribute this mistake to preoccupation), he has made me, from the distinction established between gifts and local charges, conclude their incompatibility -- a conclusion contrary to what I have written, of which he would have done well to take a little more account. The examination which, on this occasion, I have made of my previous publications, has convinced me of the justness of what I said, and has shewn me that God has given me grace to keep, with much more exactness than this brother, within the limits of truth on the subject in question, a subject on which I agree with him. The controversy bears upon the points which he has avoided; among others, that as to whether the Church's fall has not altered the position of the children of God. A system which prefers the Church of Neufchatel to the apostolic times exposes itself to be received with some distrust.

		SECOND PART -- REFUTATION OF SOME ERRORS CONTAINED IN THE "EXAMINATION OF THE DARBYITE VIEWS ON SACRED MINISTRY"
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1 -- ON THE COMPATIBILITY OF GIFTS AND LOCAL CHARGES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The author of the "Examination" says (page 21), "The entire doctrine of Mr.<a name=6:5></a> Darby on ministry rests, as we have seen, on the separation he establishes between the ministry of gifts, and charges.<a name=6:6></a> Charges, which appear to be characterized, according to him, by the absence of any special gift, by election through human intervention and employment for secular uses, are the diaconate and episcopate, or the office of elder.<a name=6:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, after having quoted from the epistles various passages containing lists of gifts, the author adds (page 24), "Mr.<a name=6:8></a> Darby cites especially, with confidence, four lists or enumerations of the ministries of the Spirit .<a name=6:9></a>.<a name=6:10></a>.<a name=6:11></a> lists which do not contain the denominations of elder or deacon, and which prove thus the decided separation established by the primitive Church between ministry and charges.<a name=6:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"This is assuredly the decisive point.<a name=6:13></a> If we find, as Mr.<a name=6:14></a> Darby contends, in the apostolic Church, on the one hand, gifts exercised in free ministrations for the edification of the

		Church; on the other, charges, the result of a human election for an external administration, and this, as two series without points of contact, the case is decided in favour of Mr.<a name=7:1></a> Darby.<a name=7:2></a> If, on the contrary, we can demonstrate, that these two series are two currents proceeding originally from the same source, and which, after having separated for a moment, tended more and more, from the apostolic times, to re-approach one another and to be lost in one single stream, the future instrument of the fruitfulness of the Church; then we are on the road towards justifying the present institution, which is, in its principle, nothing else than the fusion of the divine gift and the human charge in one and the same ministry.<a name=7:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, then, is the point to which the author has directed all his arguments.<a name=7:4></a> He affirms that I contend that gifts and charges are "two series with no points of contact.<a name=7:5></a>" Let us see how far my writings bear this out.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take the liberty of citing a passage from my pamphlet entitled, "On the Presence and Action of the Holy Ghost in the Church" (page 35), where I say: "That the bishop may be engaged in feeding the flock, I do not deny.<a name=7:7></a> But, from the fact that such a gift is useful in the episcopal office, it does not follow that all who possessed it were in this office, and still less that the office was the same thing as the gift.<a name=7:8></a> I may engage my clerk to write well and be a good accountant, and he must know these things in order to be clerk, but it does not follow that every scribe and keeper of accounts should be a clerk.<a name=7:9></a> This office supposes a confidence which extends to many other things, to the management of money and goods, to dealing with customers, etc.<a name=7:10></a> Thus, a man may be a pastor and lack many things necessary to a bishop, and never have been invested with this office.<a name=7:11></a> A man may lack the power of rule, discernment needed in order to watch over souls, gravity to have influence over light spirits in the details of life,<a href="#7:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#7:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> These expressions shew how the author of the "Examination" has misunderstood my thought, when he ascribes to me assigning to local charges as their object "employment for temporal uses." While presenting in good faith the general ideas I have put forth on ministry, he has, in treating the point in question, fallen into a preoccupation which has completely hidden from him all I have said, so that, in seeking to oppose me, he maintains *what I have myself maintained* in the writings from which he has gathered the exposition of my views. I beg all persons who honestly wish to know what I think, to read what I have written.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Bishops, and not a bishop, for there were always several, were local officers, who only acted in the midst of the particular church in which they were found.<a name=8:3></a> A bishop was not a gift, nor a joint in the body according to the measure of the gift of Christ; but a local office, for which the possession of pastoral capacity was suitable among many other things.<a name=8:4></a> Pastorship is never presented as an office established by men, although bishops, who were, according to God, established by men, with a special object of watching over souls locally, may have possessed this gift and used it in their locality.<a name=8:5></a> <i>These things are linked on one side</i>, as the authority conferred on the apostles by Christ was linked with what had been given to them.<a name=8:6></a> For apostleship, although directly from God, was also an office, and that, we may say, from Christ as man, acting with authority in the government of the Church; and authoritative charges flowed from thence.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The bishop may be called to pastoral care and teaching also, as qualities of his office.<a name=8:8></a> I do not doubt, historically speaking, that as man has continually more and more eclipsed the action of the Spirit of God in the Church, the gift became gradually lost in the office; but that makes no change in the word, and we live in times in which we must come either to the word or to Popery," pages 40, 41, 42.<a name=8:9></a>

		How the author of the "Examination," after having read the pages I have just recalled to notice, can have been able to affirm that all my system depends on the <i>incompatibility</i><a href="#8:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> of gifts and offices, as on the incompatibility of two series without points of contact, is to me a puzzle.<a name=8:10></a> I even have said that, historically, gift was gradually lost in office.<a name=8:11></a> And when, in speaking of these two series, the author compares them to two streams which, from the times of the apostles, tended more and more to approach one another and to merge in one river, it might be said his ideas were borrowed from mine.<a name=8:12></a> Whether this brings him nearer the justification of the present institution, is another question.<a name=8:13></a> However this may be, in the very pages

		"As to what concerns the difference which exists between the elder and the pastor, I say that pastorship was a gift of the Holy Spirit, which the office of elder was not.<a name=9:6></a> This office was established by men in the Church, according to God no doubt; but it was a governmental institution, and not a gift from on high, although certain gifts and qualities were <i>necessary</i> to the one who was named elder.<a name=9:7></a> I have said that <i>the gift of feeding the flock</i> of God in one way or other was necessary or suitable to him, because it appears, by the Epistle to Timothy, that the elders who laboured in the word and doctrine are distinguished from other elders.<a name=9:8></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		This Church, united by the Spirit, as the body to the Head, to this Jesus seated at the Father's right hand, will, no doubt, be manifested in its totality, when Christ shall be manifested in His glory; but, meanwhile, as being formed by the presence of the Holy Ghost <i>come down from heaven</i>, it is essentially looked at, in the word of God, as subsisting in its unity on the earth.<a name=32:2></a> It is the habitation of God by the Spirit, essentially heavenly in its relationships, but having an earthly pilgrimage, as to the scene in which it is actually found and in which it ought to manifest the nature of the glory of Christ, as His epistle of commendation to the world, for it represents Him and is in His place.<a name=32:3></a> It is the bride of the Lamb, in its privileges and calling.<a name=32:4></a> It is presented as a chaste virgin to Christ for the day of the marriage of the Lamb.<a name=32:5></a> Evidently this last thought will have its accomplishment in resurrection; but, what characterizes the Church, as being quickened according to the power which has raised Christ from among the dead and set Him at the right hand of God, is the realization and manifestation of the glory of its Head by the power of the Holy Ghost, before Jesus its Head is revealed in Person.<a name=32:6></a>

The magistrate may abuse his power, no doubt, and man is wicked; but there is a just Judge who knows how to maintain the oppressed, and who, as the apostle tells us, watches over that which He has ordained. The authority is the minister of God for good to those who do well. "Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same." If one is persecuted for the name of Christ, the case is different; it is our glory. But if we do good, the civil power, armed as it is with the authority of God, will not harm us. The Christian submits to the authority with joy, and that for conscience¬ sake, having confidence in God. He does it of good will. <p>As to the clergy, whence does their power come, when they have any? Who would put confidence in it? However, I confess, I have no fear that the Free Church, such as it has manifested itself in these countries, will come to that.

		SECTION 1 -- THE CLERGY, THE FOUNDATION OF UNITY IN THE FREE CHURCH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While setting aside the state, rejecting all alliance with it, and while refusing at the same time to take the position of the Christians who had previously separated from nationalism, the founders of the Free Church wished, in constituting themselves as a body, to preserve some bond which these did not possess

		and which the state did not furnish.<a name=45:1></a> This bond is the clergy, the clerical body.<a name=45:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Plainly, the churches whose association composes the Free Church have no other according to its constitution.<a name=45:3></a> The unity subsists in the body of the clergy and there solely.<a name=45:4></a> This principle, the importance of which cannot be overestimated, was that of the Church as fallen in the first ages, that which ended in popery in contrast with the Church of God.<a name=45:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Protestant or Reformed Churches, the state serves as a link, as a principle of unity; they are, consequently, national churches.<a name=45:6></a> The Romish system has another centre of unity, which I need not stop to notice here.<a name=45:7></a> The dissenters, whatever may be additionally the unity of ideas and of habit of association with which analogous principles furnish them, are in general independents or congregationalists; that is to say, their churches, as churches, acknowledge no bond of unity among themselves.<a name=45:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There remains then to the Free Church but one principle which can and does really make of it a body; it is the clerical principle.<a name=45:9></a> Little matters it whether the clergy is composed of pastors or elders.<a name=45:10></a> It is they, a body of officials, distinct from the mass of believers, who alone give a character of unity to this bundle of churches.<a name=45:11></a> The details of the Constitution shew it.<a name=45:12></a> General Church assemblies, church councils do not produce a shadow of unity!<a name=45:13></a> This unity resides in the synod; the synod is the principle of it.<a name=45:14></a> Everything which concerns the clergy is carefully kept in the hands of the clergy.<a name=45:15></a> The <i>veto</i> without a statement of motives is alone permitted to a flock to which a pastor is proposed.<a name=45:16></a> As to their internal matters, the assemblies may be consulted and may express their wishes when the church council calls them together; but all action whatever is reserved to the clergy.<a name=45:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is sad, to say nothing more, to use the word of God, and that in its most precious and profound teachings, to apply it to that which is a creation of man, and to that which has no right to pretend to be what the passage cited speaks of.<a name=46:3></a> It is sad to seek to clothe a purely human system with the lustre of the blessing which is connected with the work of God.<a name=46:4></a> The Free Church of the Canton de Vaud is not, and still less are its constituted bodies, the body of Christ, nor the bride of Christ, however it may clothe itself with these beautiful names by debasing their meaning and force.<a name=46:5></a> "She is resolved," say the authors of her Constitution, "to yield obedience (to Jesus Christ) as a faithful wife to her husband.<a name=46:6></a>" Wife!<a name=46:7></a> She is not a wife.<a name=46:8></a> There exists neither a Vaudois bride, nor a French bride, nor an English bride.<a name=46:9></a> By attaching such a name to bodies constituted by men, the idea of the unity of the body of <i>Christ</i> is falsified and lost, an idea of which the importance cannot be exaggerated.<a name=46:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Several details of the "Constitution of the Free Church" afford us a striking proof of the preoccupation of its authors, as to the maintenance of the clerical principle.<a name=47:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the nature of the quotations which are made from the word of God.<a name=47:3></a> Except the faulty application of a passage of Ephesians referred to above, the word of God, cited very carefully in order to support the authority of the clergy, is only quoted four times on other subjects, and these four quotations, have no reference to the principles of the Free Church, but solely to general principles of piety, and they might have been equally met with in the first religious book that might be taken up.<a name=47:4></a> If it is a question, on the other hand, of exhibiting all the passages which appear suited to exalt the authority and importance of the clergy, the New Testament is rummaged through and through.<a name=47:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here are further proofs of this preoccupation.<a name=47:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The laity may elect deputies to the synod.<a name=47:7></a> They have, besides, the power of refusing a minister, without having in addition the permission to express the motives of this refusal.<a name=47:8></a> To this is limited all the action which is granted them.<a name=47:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All discipline belongs exclusively to the clerical bodies.<a name=47:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All ministry has its source and direction in the synod.<a name=47:11></a> No one can act in the ministry of the word unless he be sent by the synod.<a name=47:12></a> People can neither receive nor open the door to a minister whom the synod has not sent or sanctioned.<a name=47:13></a> "The synod occupies itself with evangelization and with all work that has for its object the advancement of the kingdom of God.<a name=47:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In sum, it all comes to this: the clergy govern without being themselves under the authority of a government.<a name=47:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		SECTION 2 -- ABSENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT FROM THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FREE CHURCH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing which is more serious.<a name=47:16></a> In the whole of the organization of the Free Church the Holy Spirit is not even named; and, with the exception of the profession of faith contained in the second article of the "Constitution," it mentions it nowhere.<a name=47:17></a> It could not do so.<a name=47:18></a> The Spirit of God is the power of the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=47:19></a> "There is

		one body and one Spirit," <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:4">Ephesians  4:4</a>.<a name=48:1></a> Now the Free Church of the Canton de Vaud has an altogether different unity, a bond of quite another nature.<a name=48:2></a> For it, such as it has constituted itself, there is one body, and it is that one body; "The churches which have been formed since the year of grace 1845, in the Canton de Vaud, are, by the present act, united into one body.<a name=48:3></a>" There is the unity of the Free Church.<a name=48:4></a> It is not that of the body of Christ, it is such as leaves this on one side.<a name=48:5></a> The Spirit of God is not, consequently, nor can He be, recognized nor sought as the One whose presence forms, characterizes, and establishes unity, and gives it as a banner the name of Jesus alone.<a name=48:6></a> One Spirit and one body is what does not enter into the framework of the unity of the Free Church.<a name=48:7></a> Its unity denies the other.<a name=48:8></a> "<i>One</i> body" excludes everything which is not itself.<a name=48:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequence of this is, that, uniting the defects of the corrupt church of the middle ages and of present nationalism, the synod or the clergy which is substituted for the presence of the Holy Spirit, sets aside equally the action of the Holy Ghost in ministry.<a name=48:10></a> "The synod occupies itself with all work that has for its object the advancement of the kingdom of God.<a name=48:11></a>" That does not at all suppose the free action of the Holy Spirit nor does it permit the individual activity which is its fruit.<a name=48:12></a> There may be, if you will, instruments sent by the synod; but liberty of action, independently of a mission received from it, there is not.<a name=48:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to what concerns the unity of the Church the body of Christ, as well as the free development of the work of the Spirit of God in the ministry of the word, the constitution of the Free Church is in complete antagonism with the most precious instructions of the word, with those which, for the days in which we live, are the most important that God has given us.<a name=48:14></a> Instead of maintaining, as it says, the rights of Jesus, it wars against the rights of the Holy Spirit.<a name=48:15></a> It gives itself liberty as regards the government, to take it entirely away from the Holy Spirit and the faithful led by Him.<a name=48:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One could not, in fact, deceive oneself to the extent of treating a church of the multitude, as a body dwelt in, animated and directed by the Holy Spirit.<a name=48:17></a> Neither its unity nor its action could be those of the Spirit.<a name=48:18></a> The Spirit is therefore set aside in order to substitute the clergy.<a name=48:19></a> Alas!<a name=48:20></a> the constitution of the Free Church equally sets aside the word of God.<a name=48:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing in it, perhaps, seriously wounds orthodoxy.<a name=49:15></a> One even sees in it the desire for piety.<a name=49:16></a> Nevertheless, its profession of faith, the doctrines of which the "Constitution" presents as being the "centre and foundation of Christian truth," is a meagre and even false confession, and its orthodoxy is of a very pale hue.<a name=49:17></a> The work of redemption is put in it in the last line, and would disappear almost entirely save for the enumeration of the facts on which it is founded.<a name=49:18></a>

		The eternal redemption which Christ has obtained for us?<a name=50:1></a> No: it is something in man, it is "living faith.<a name=50:2></a>" And why "living"?<a name=50:3></a> True faith is no doubt living.<a name=50:4></a> Why then draw attention to this word?<a name=50:5></a> Because the tendency of this expression is to connect salvation with the qualification of a grace in us, instead of making it depend solely on the perfect work of Christ, on the righteousness of <i>God</i>, in which one partakes and to which one submits oneself by faith.<a name=50:6></a> I repeat it, the work of Christ, the redemption He has accomplished, are completely hidden behind the state of the soul which has embraced it.<a name=50:7></a> It is faith, and not the object of faith, which is put forward.<a name=50:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is something which is really nonsense: "Christ communicates to the faithful and to the Church all the graces necessary for regeneration.<a name=50:9></a>" How can they be called "faithful" and "the Church" if they are not yet regenerated?<a name=50:10></a> What does that mean: "the graces necessary to regeneration"?<a name=50:11></a> The Holy Spirit then does not regenerate!<a name=50:12></a> He communicates to unconverted man certain graces necessary for regeneration, graces which man makes use of to regenerate himself.<a name=50:13></a> Is that the obligatory doctrine, to which a formal assent must be given in order to become a member of the Free Church?<a name=50:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is added: "It is by the Holy Spirit whom He sends on the part of His Father.<a name=50:15></a>" This is not according to the truth.<a name=50:16></a> Jesus has sent this Comforter who shall abide for ever with the Church, as also it may be said that the Father has sent Him in Christ's name.<a name=50:17></a> As to what concerns the Holy Spirit, one finds thus, at the bottom of all the system of the Free Church, an unbelief and ignorance, involuntary no doubt, but not the less real.<a name=50:18></a>

		Again: "He will return to put his own in possession of eternal life.<a name=50:19></a>" One may, it is true, speak of eternal life to designate the power of the glory; but, met with thus by itself here, this expression only adds a little more vagueness to all the rest.<a name=50:20></a> The word of God teaches us and repeats to us that he who believes in the Son HAS eternal life.<a name=50:21></a>

		The manner in which it orders the exercise of it, the formula of its doctrines on this subject, betrays in a somewhat curious way the conflict between the need of pious souls and the difficulty which a church of the multitude puts in the way of it.<a name=51:1></a> The 31st Article of the "Constitution" lays down in principle that all discipline shall be in the hands of the pastor assisted by the church council.<a name=51:2></a> Next, if all gentle means fail, what will the council do?<a name=51:3></a> What rule will it follow?<a name=51:4></a> After having consulted the word of God, "it will follow the course which shall seem marked out thereby.<a name=51:5></a>" There would have been in any case this faculty or this latitude without an article of Constitution.<a name=51:6></a> This is but a declaration of incompetence, by which the assemblies will escape the organization intended by the "Constitution": for, suppose the church council saw in the word of God that the conscience of all the body ought to be concerned in discipline, the Free Church would see its constitution violated in its fundamental principle, and an independent authority established.<a name=51:7></a> Evidently, a church which should exercise this discipline in a regular manner, could not receive every member of a church not disciplined, even were he an elder, although he might belong to the Free Church; and, in fact, a church exercising this discipline would cease to form an integral part of the body, and would become a dissenting church.<a name=51:8></a> How, too, exercise this discipline by means of the conscience of the whole body, if the body is a church of the multitude?<a name=51:9></a> The presence of the Holy Spirit in the Church becomes here an essential question.<a name=51:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be on this point, and on the question of the nomination of pastors, that as a system the Free Church will be broken.<a name=51:11></a> Its "Constitution" will remain as a memorial of the powerlessness of man to constitute by human means that which is only of God.<a name=51:12></a> That which proceeds from faith on the part of the individuals who have taken part in it, whatever there is of conscience (and there is this), will remain as a precious proof of the goodness and patience of God.<a name=51:13></a>

		I should not have deemed it necessary to pass this work in review, if I had only had in view the Free Church of the Canton de Vaud.<a name=51:14></a> The work of God in that country will bear its fruit, according to the measure of the power which acts in it.<a name=51:15></a> If there is found there a testimony superior to that of the Free Church, accompanied by a power which God can put honour upon, this testimony will attract those who are truly spiritual.<a name=51:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no objection to make to the details given by the "Réformation" as to what ought to be done; but there is entirely wanting to them a principle, that of the action of the Holy Spirit, whether as a power, the source of the activity of man and acting to produce this activity; or as discernment as to that activity and as power for discipline with regard to it.<a name=53:3></a> The form is good -- God is not presented as being the power of it.<a name=53:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I could not admit that "whoever feels himself able to exhort" has the right to do so, unless two things be added: on the one hand, the responsibility of the one who exhorts to know that he is led of the Holy Spirit; on the other hand, the discernment by spiritual men of this action of the Holy Spirit, or it may be of the absence of it, and the discipline which flows from it, if there be occasion for it.<a name=53:5></a> It is God whom I seek in the assembly.<a name=53:6></a>

Under the pretext of making ourselves all things to all men, so as to gain some, we make ourselves all things to all men in such a way as to ruin ourselves with others. Nor is this enough. To gain worldly people, we employ worldly people themselves to draw the gospel chariot. Because such an one is rich, we place him in the front; because such another is clever, we make him a charioteer. We employ the crowd to push behind, and end by being lost in the herd of unbelievers whom we purposed to direct. In the midst of such a retinue, we ourselves lose faith, and we copy those who ought to imitate us. Can we then be astonished, if God allow our work to perish?

	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings me to two other points which I shall again present in the very terms of the "Réformation.<a name=56:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 2 -- DUALISM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read in the "Réformation" of January 28th, 1849: Everything in Plymouthism may be reduced to two points -- the idea of the action of the Holy Spirit and the idea of the authority of the scriptures.<a name=56:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Plymouthism wishes to substitute for human organization the action of the Spirit.<a name=56:9></a> This is the reason for their principal objection to ecclesiastical ministry.<a name=56:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, remarking on the following words of Mr.<a name=56:11></a> Recordon, "God only blesses the labours of the workmen; He is sovereign and He acts in grace by the instruments which it pleases Him to choose" (words that accompany a reproach addressed to the faculties of theology which venture to call, to choose, to designate, to send, to displace at their pleasure, the Lord's workman), the "Réformation" thus expresses itself:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"We see how it is: it is always a dualism set up between
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=57>[Page 57]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the action of God and means, between the Spirit and man, as if the divine work could be accomplished otherwise than in and by man.<a name=57:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "Réformation" says again, under date of the 29th November, 1846:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The religion and ecclesiastical system, which is set forth by Mr.<a name=57:2></a> Vermont, rests, it seems to us, on two principles: the authority of the Bible and the aid of the Holy Spirit.<a name=57:3></a> It is not, of course, against those two principles, considered in themselves, that we desire to protest, but against the use made of them.<a name=57:4></a> Thus the action of the Holy Spirit is taken in the point of view of a gross supranaturalism.<a name=57:5></a> The divine action is not conceived of in its dynamic harmony with human action, but rather as a purely objective and constantly miraculous power.<a name=57:6></a> It seems that God is to intervene in a way which excludes man; and that where calculation, the use of means, and well considered activity, come in, the Holy Spirit can find no place.<a name=57:7></a> The expectation of the faithful is to be entirely passive.<a name=57:8></a> It must await the unfolding of divine graces and abstain from action as much as possible, so as to leave them more liberty.<a name=57:9></a> In a word, spiritual graces are always brought back to the supernatural form they assumed in the apostolic age.<a name=57:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Alas!<a name=57:11></a> there is in this way of thinking and this way of speaking of the presence of God, and of the action of His Spirit, a lightness, a spirit of jesting, and a tone of petty philosophy, on the subject of holy things, extremely painful to those who feel how serious a thing it is to put oneself forward, to have to do with that which is so precious to Christ as His Church, and how solemn a thing to call oneself a workman together with God, to occupy ourselves with His work, and to say that He acts in us.<a name=57:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we shall see, the author of these articles has, moreover, entirely misplaced the question.<a name=57:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is not mistaken in presenting, as the foundations of what people are pleased to call Plymouthism, the authority of the scriptures and the action of the Holy Ghost.<a name=57:14></a> It is on these, in very truth, that I desire that my own work and that of my brethren should rest.<a name=57:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is this dualism between God and man, this singular rivalry of which we are said to be guilty?<a name=57:16></a> A rivalry singular truly, on the part of a wretched creature, a worm, with <i>Him</i> who has created man Such a thought enters not, either to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the author of these articles is mistaken in every respect.<a name=58:2></a> In order to get rid of the action of the Holy Spirit, such as he finds it put forward as one of our fundamental principles, he falls into a strange excess.<a name=58:3></a> According to our views, as he affirms, "spiritual graces are always brought back to the supernatural form which they assumed in the apostolic age"; and he had before affirmed with no less assurance that, according to our views, "the action of the Holy Spirit is understood in the sense of a <i>tolerably gross supranaturalism</i>.<a name=58:4></a>" The heart revolts in copying it.<a name=58:5></a> Does there really exist such a contempt for the action of the Holy Spirit?<a name=58:6></a> Alas!<a name=58:7></a> that at least betrays the thought of the author.<a name=58:8></a> He wants man to appear, man to act.<a name=58:9></a> The action and manifestation of the Spirit is for him a gross idea.<a name=58:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And again, the author is mistaken as to the facts of the apostolic age and as to the principles he condemns.<a name=58:11></a> The form which the work of the apostolic age assumed did not tend, in general, to a dualism of any kind -- very far from it.<a name=58:12></a> There was, in certain cases, a sort of dualism.<a name=58:13></a> For example, tongues were spoken, and the one who spoke them did not always understand what he said.<a name=58:14></a> When that was the case, the apostle declares that this action of the Holy Ghost was of a lower order; "for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret; that the church may receive edifying.<a name=58:15></a>" "He that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him, howbeit in the Spirit he speaketh mysteries .<a name=58:16></a>.<a name=58:17></a>.<a name=58:18></a> .<a name=58:19></a> He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .<a name=58:20></a>.<a name=58:21></a>.<a name=58:22></a> wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret .<a name=58:23></a>.<a name=58:24></a>.<a name=58:25></a> .<a name=58:26></a> But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:5">1 Corinthians  14:5</a>, 2-4, 13, 28.<a name=58:27></a> And Paul adds, as to himself (verse 19), "I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.<a name=58:28></a>" He will have, in speaking, his intelligence to have some part, not as if to produce in any sort another source of truth, but as a vessel blessed for himself and for others with what the grace of God communicated.<a name=58:29></a> By this means, there was blessing for himself and communion with others.<a name=58:30></a> The power of God

		by itself was something, no doubt; but the edification of the Church was the object which the love of God proposed to itself.<a name=59:1></a> The heart entered into it, spiritual Intelligence submitted to it and rejoiced in it.<a name=59:2></a> It is thus that, in promising the gift of the Spirit, the Lord Himself says, of the one who should receive it, that "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:38">John  7:38</a>); out of his belly, that is to say, from his innermost affections, according to the well known use of this expression in the scriptures.<a name=59:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This dualism, of which the "Réformation" accuses us, is so little in my thought, that, on the contrary, in my eyes, it is precisely, save in the case we have just seen, the absence of it which distinguishes (a general, but not absolute distinction) the revelations of the New Testament from those of the Old.<a name=59:4></a> As a general rule, there was, in the prophets of old, this separation between the intelligence of man and the communication of the Spirit.<a name=59:5></a> It is otherwise in the revelations of the New Testament.<a name=59:6></a> The prophets, serving as channels of the Spirit of God, said, "Thus saith the Lord.<a name=59:7></a>" Their hearts felt morally the state of the people, but the prophetic answer of God was communicated without the full intelligence of the prophet.<a name=59:8></a> This is why we find in the New Testament, that they "searched diligently .<a name=59:9></a>.<a name=59:10></a>.<a name=59:11></a> what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow: unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven," <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:11">1 Peter  1:11</a>, 12.<a name=59:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, the ancient prophets themselves studied their prophecies; and there was a further action of the Holy Spirit to make them understand the meaning of them.<a name=59:13></a> They then found that it was not for themselves, but for us, that they ministered these things.<a name=59:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We, on the contrary, know that these things are ours.<a name=59:15></a> Christ, this precious Saviour, has accomplished the work of eternal redemption.<a name=59:16></a> He has entered into His glory at the right hand of God, and the Holy Ghost has come down to be the revealer of this glory of the man Christ, the revealer of the Father's love, the seal of God upon us, as upon those who are to participate in it, and the earnest of all these blessings in our

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Throughout their whole extent, then, my thoughts (and I doubt not they are, in substance, given by my God) are precisely the contrary of the dualism in question.<a name=60:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is still something to add here upon the difference people wish to make between the past and present.<a name=60:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At the beginning of the Church there was not only the action of the Holy Ghost, but, besides this, new revelations.<a name=60:9></a> Now, in the communication of these divine truths for the Church of that age and of all ages, God preserved the mouth of those whom He employed for this work, so that no error should fall from it, where He saw good to give that which was to serve as an authority.<a name=60:10></a> It is not that this took away spiritual intelligence from the others.<a name=60:11></a> Even when an apostle spoke, they searched the word to see "whether these things were so," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:11">Acts  17:11</a>.<a name=60:12></a> If prophets addressed the assembly, the rest judged; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:29">1 Corinthians  14:29</a>.<a name=60:13></a> There were, however, divine revelations entrusted to those who were chosen of God to be the vessel of those revelations and organs of communicating them.<a name=60:14></a> Perhaps some of these communications were only for the moment; but those which were for every age of the Church are preserved for us in the written word.<a name=60:15></a> It is true also that, at that time, one was called upon to study that which the word of God reveals, so that one's profiting might be known to the whole Church; <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:13">1 Timothy  4:13</a>-16.<a name=60:16></a>

He will not fail to find his reward in doing so. I think that will be worth all the rest of my pamphlet to him. <p>I always maintain, as the only true and possible meaning of the passage @1 Peter 4: 10, 11 that *to speak as the oracles of God* does not mean to speak according to the scriptures, though this be also necessarily; the case, but *to speak as announcing the oracles of God*, as Martin translates it. For my part, if this be not done, I know not why I should listen. The reason given, namely, "that God may be glorified in all things," puts it beyond question that this is the meaning of the passage.

		If then any one objects, and says, No; it is he who introduces dualism; it is he who separates man from the Holy Ghost.<a name=62:2></a> That is indeed the dualism of incredulity, which makes of man a being capable of acting in the things of God without God's being with him, or acting in him.<a name=62:3></a> It is rationalism.<a name=62:4></a>

		The movement is impressed on man and effectuated in man; but it comes from God: if not, it is evil.<a name=62:5></a> This is a point as capital as it is elementary.<a name=62:6></a> And, whatever may be the contempt with which the journalist treats these things, and accuses this system of meaning that the faithful should abstain from action as much as possible and take a more passive position, I boldly avow that I desire for all my brethren, as also for myself, that we should feel even more and more our entire dependence on God; that it is the Spirit which quickeneth and that the flesh profiteth nothing; yes, that we should feel our constant dependence, and that, if the Spirit does not lead us, we should not pretend, either in a smaller or a greater way, to meddle with the things of God.<a name=62:7></a> I believe, then, that the Spirit of God acts in man and by man, and in particular by the members of the body of Christ.<a name=62:8></a> He gives understanding, power, and energy.<a name=62:9></a> He is a Spirit of power and of liberty!<a name=62:10></a> But if He thus acts, His grace produces in the heart of man a spirit of humility and of entire dependence on God, a spirit which would be unwilling even to do a miracle if one could, unless the express will of God led one to do it.<a name=62:11></a> The life of the new man lives by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, and does not dare to act out of dependence on Him.<a name=62:12></a> That the Spirit should act in man and not outside man (an idea foreign to any system whatever), this is not, whatever may be said, what is intended.<a name=62:13></a>

		This is what our opponents deny.<a name=71:7></a> They say that at the beginning God gave rules and forms needful for the walk of the Church, but that these forms do not concern us.<a name=71:8></a>

		Let us then examine the positive testimony of scripture on this subject.<a name=71:10></a>

		To my mind, it is evident that the coming of Christ was before the eyes of the apostles; and this, whilst at the same time caring for the Church in an indefatigable manner, and making provision that such care should not fail it.<a name=73:4></a> But the apostles could not cause that the power -- and there was power -- of their ministry should continue after their death.<a name=73:5></a> See what Paul says to the Ephesians (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:22">Acts  20:22</a>-30), and what Peter teaches; <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:14">1 Peter  1:14</a>, 15.<a name=73:6></a> Now, the kingdom of God is in power.<a name=73:7></a> The power of the ministry of the apostles has disappeared, and the consequence has gradually been the corruption of the Church and frightful disorder; so that one has seen what was called <i>order</i> and <i>holy orders</i> become the seat of the enemy's power, and what called itself the <i>Church</i> to be that which truth had to combat.<a name=73:8></a>

		Now, in the perilous times of the last days, when there should be the form of godliness and its power denied, to what does the apostle (in view of everything which, before his prophetic eyes was springing up in the Church) direct his beloved Timothy, his son in the faith, this devoted heart into which he was pouring out his own?<a name=73:9></a> Here is the language he holds to him, "But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them .<a name=73:10></a>.<a name=73:11></a>.<a name=73:12></a> .<a name=73:13></a> All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.<a name=73:14></a>" Now, it is very certain that this goes much farther than direction for the walk of the Church, that it embraces everything.<a name=73:15></a> The man of God is not simply a Christian; he is a man acting in the work and Church of God.<a name=73:16></a> This was the case with Timothy, to whom the epistle is addressed, and to whom Paul says, "Thou, O man of God," <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:11">1 Timothy  6:11</a>.<a name=73:17></a> He needed to know how he ought to behave himself in the house of God; <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>.<a name=73:18></a>

		One may have this precious knowledge necessary in order to walk intelligently before God (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:15">Ephesians  5:15</a>); but one may have it, boast of it, proclaim it, and with all this repel humble souls desirous of advancing, and throw them into the hands of those who have no wish that they should walk according to this knowledge.<a name=76:7></a> We ourselves must walk in seriousness, in humility, in the love which the <i>presence of God</i> produces.<a name=76:8></a> This supposes faith and life in the soul.<a name=76:9></a> Where it is found, blessing is not wanting to those who thus walk.<a name=76:10></a> Although this does not justify the unbelief or the opposition of others, if you present the truth in such a way as not to glorify God, you give them power and influence against it.<a name=76:11></a> Principles are not enough: we need God.<a name=76:12></a> Without this, mighty principles are but a sword in the hands of a child or of a drunken man; it were better to take it from him, or at least, that he use it not till he be sober.<a name=76:13></a> Let us shew the fruits of our principles.<a name=76:14></a> Let us be firm in the truth.<a name=76:15></a> We must be firm.<a name=76:16></a> The more some oppose the truth, and others profess to wish to possess it, and accommodate themselves, without their conscience unreservedly submitting to it, to the wants it has produced in other persons (and both these cases present themselves), the more we have to keep in the narrow path it has marked out in the word for our souls, according to the grace and power of the Holy Ghost who has sanctified us to <i>obey</i> Christ.<a name=76:17></a> Let our hearts be large and our feet in the narrow path.<a name=76:18></a> Often, when people talk of charity, their hearts are narrow and their feet are following the path which suits them.<a name=76:19></a> It is this which makes the heart narrow, because the conscience is uneasy, and people do not like those

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#77:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> I will say a word on the "Evangelical Alliance," because souls are sought to be gained under the sweet name of union. <p>The foundations of this Alliance are quite different from those which the Spirit of God would or could have laid, although the want which suggested this Alliance may have been, I doubt not, in great part produced by that Spirit. As usual, man has sought to arrange things in his own way. And, in the first place, the principle of clergy has been made fundamental. A second principle which has been established has been that, in becoming a member of the Alliance, no one was supposed, either to renounce the sect to which he belonged, or to renounce the putting forward of his own principles, a condition without which union would have been impossible. Dr. Chalmers strongly insisted on united action, saying that, without this, the "Alliance" would have no vitality and would not stand. People did not dare to follow this advice; and it was decided that the point should be left on one side! Later on, the English members of the "Alliance" decided not to admit any possessing slaves, a measure which excluded a certain number of Christians of the United States. People were thus led to subdivide the "Alliance" into a certain number of national districts, and to renounce a general union. <p>Can it be said that this is the unity of the Spirit? <p>As to the doctrines owned by the "Alliance," they comprise too much or too little to serve as a common ground for all those whom it is designed to unite. It is of little use to enter into other details; for, except a great annual meeting, a great deal of talk, and some local reading-meetings, from which are excluded the Quakers, those called Plymouth Brethren, and, through one cause or another, the *greater part* of Christians, this "Alliance" does next to nothing. <p>In France, under the name of "Union Evangélique," the "Alliance" is only an instrument of clericalism and exclusiveness, and even, it appears to me, without much good faith. I say this, because, if one pretends to seek the union of all Christians, and uses this pretension to make of it an instrument of exclusiveness, I cannot call that good faith. In proof of what I assert, I may mention the exclusive communications made to those who are thought to belong to the clergy; I may mention the fact that there is presented to those who wish to become members of the Alliance an engagement to sign, by which they bind themselves not to be present at a meeting held by any of the brethren professing what are called Plymouthist principles. Is this engagement required everywhere? I know not. What I do know is, that it is required; and it is certain that those who act in the "Union" and for the "Union," actively make use of the "Union" for the object indicated. That people should oppose views which they do not approve, is nothing surprising, and can readily be understood; but to set up the "Union," to attain this end under the pretext of *union*, is what I can understand but cannot honour.

		I answer to this, that, as the only means of strength, unity does not inspire me with unreserved confidence.<a name=84:8></a> I fear somewhat that, clothing itself withal with the character of the desire of unity, it is a want of faith with regard to the Head which seeks so strongly the support of the members.<a name=84:9></a> The conscience of our brethren has long felt the evil; but the importance in their eyes of those who shared in the same system themselves, but who had no strength from Christ the Head of His house, hindered them from separating from them.<a name=84:10></a> This subsists still in their minds.<a name=84:11></a> These brethren feared then to separate from the mass, because of the importance which their own want of faith lent those who formed it.<a name=84:12></a> They fear them in this same measure still; and that so much the more, as conscience and faith enfeeble themselves by hesitations, and delays and weaken themselves by the accrediting of things which they condemn.<a name=84:13></a> We know to what point influences so deleterious have led some brethren, otherwise respected by all.<a name=84:14></a> "Say ye not, A confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.<a name=84:15></a> Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.<a name=84:16></a> And he shall be for a sanctuary," <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#8:12">Isaiah  8:12</a>-14.<a name=84:17></a> Such is what occurs to the spirit of the believer on hearing these cries for union made to those who are departing from under a burden to which they have so long bowed their back.<a name=84:18></a>

We know what influence St. Augustine exercised on the Reformation, though the energy of the Holy Spirit acting in the Reformers far surpassed the measure of St. Augustine. It will be well to remember that the present movement seeks to bring us back upon the ground of the Reformation. And precious as that work was, is it at all the thought of God to bring us back to it?

		This constitution aims essentially at the establishment of a clergy, and in this manner it shuts up all the gifts into the establishment of the elders, which form a separate order.<a name=106:15></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose that (without having heard of the universal priesthood of believers) one has recognized that each can worship God, without this being granted by the constitution.<a name=107:2></a> And provided the clergy be recognized, it is generally admitted that every Christian is to be allowed to publish the excellencies of Him who has called us.<a name=107:3></a> But this is to admit the universal priesthood in such a manner as to limit it as much as is possible in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.<a name=107:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"However," adds the constitution, "the Evangelical Church recognizes the necessity of a special ministry as an institution of God and a permanent want of the Church.<a name=107:5></a> In consequence, she has elders and deacons.<a name=107:6></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#107:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> The manner in which the article quoted above speaks of worship is very unsatisfactory: the relations of the disciples with the Father are there completely forgotten. And it quotes @1 Peter 2: 9, omitting even chapter 2: 5, and confounds that with @John 4, of which it mentions verse 24, omitting verse 23. The relationship of the disciples with the Father, in Christ and His name, according to the power of @John 16: 26, 27, is omitted. These things become very important when the question is about setting forth the foundations of the believer's relations with God. They form the character of the faith of all who are cast into this mould; and God will even have it so, that their state be according to their faith. It is in the order of His government that the vital principle of things be reproduced through the whole duration of their existence. Accidental defects disappear through the influence of grace. The creative principles are reproduced, and even unfolded. Therefore it is not without importance carefully to weigh these ecclesiastical constitutions; and however they may contain very good things, the Christian ought to examine upon what foundation the whole rests, and whether it is the one Christ laid down. If it is not, opposition to one's brethren is not what keeps from joining them. We must exercise forbearance towards ignorance. It is seen in us in many things, even in those things that we ought to know. I need not tell my brethren that I am conscious of it. The reading of the Bible makes me every day feel it deeply, and I look above. But to accredit ignorance at the outset of one's walk is another thing. This dishonours Christ, and vitiates in its origin, and thus inasmuch as that is in man's hand) in the whole truth of its being, that which Christ has most precious here on earth, His Church, which they propose to restore.

		8. I shall add here three points of the deepest interest, in which the truth unfolds itself, and by which the Holy Ghost witnesses to souls.<a name=114:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before noticing them, I ask my reader to pay attention here to a consideration which renders the matter more clear.<a name=114:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Certain truths are at the foundation of Christianity itself as a whole.<a name=114:15></a> Others have to do with its efficacy or the making of it good towards men.<a name=114:16></a> There are, thirdly, some which relate to the means of its reception, and even of its communication.<a name=114:17></a> Thus, for instance, we find at the very root of Christianity the existence of one God, the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, His humanity, and such like doctrines.<a name=114:18></a> Just as the existence of one God was the fundamental truth of Judaism, and the truth alters not, so likewise the revelation of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and, in connection with that, the revelation of the Person of Jesus, distinguish essentially Christianity.<a name=114:19></a> Roman Catholic theology admits this.<a name=114:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=115>[Page 115]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is, besides, a class of truths which concerns the relations of man as a sinner with his God -- with God thus revealed.<a name=115:1></a> And here the work of Christ, as mediator, is unfolded in all its extent.<a name=115:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to this, I see three principal positions in which Christ has been manifested, or will be manifested: in the infinitely precious work on the cross; in the position of Jesus at the right hand of God (a position to which corresponds the presence of the Holy Ghost here on earth); lastly, the return of Jesus Himself in glory.<a name=115:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This relates to the sufficiency of Christianity for establishing certain relationships between man, as a sinner, and God, according to the counsels and love of that very God against whom man has sinned; and for placing the redeemed one in the joy and glory which are destined for him.<a name=115:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in this that the Roman system fails entirely.<a name=115:5></a> It attributes to the sinner, not the work (as regards which it is as a matter of history in the truth), but the appropriation of the efficacy of the work which Christ has accomplished, an appropriation which, it says, takes place either by means of the sacraments -- whence results the establishing of the clergy in a mediatorial position, and, in consequence, necessary to the soul -- or by works, so as to deny grace and the state of ruin in which man finds himself; to place him under the terror of the law; and to make him dependent on the priest, and not on God, to whom, as a hard Being, exacting the uttermost farthing, his heart is not drawn, and out of whose presence his unpurged conscience drives him.<a name=115:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh, how precious to our souls the grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ!<a name=115:7></a> What do we not owe to our God!<a name=115:8></a> In contrast with this darkness, the Reformation appears and shines in all its lustre, which is the brightness of the testimony of the grace of God.<a name=115:9></a> And, as a testimony of the grace of God, it has established with a happy clearness this foundation of grace, which is, at the same time, that of the work of Christ, upon which the relationship of the sinner with God has been established by God Himself.<a name=115:10></a>

		To put these things in the broad light of day, such was the beautiful work of the Reformation.<a name=116:11></a> We should always bless God for it.<a name=116:12></a> But we must not shorten His arm and say, Thou hast done all.<a name=116:13></a> He whose grace has given us the Reformation is the living God.<a name=116:14></a> The Lord, whose work made, for the instruments which God had raised up, the subject of their testimony, nourishes and cherishes still His Church, and purifies it by the word.<a name=116:15></a> Does He say nothing to us now?<a name=116:16></a> His own, who have ears, do they not hear anything in the midst of the storms which burst forth, and which proclaim to those who are hidden in the Rock of Ages that the Lord is coming forth.<a name=116:17></a> Or does the fear of these heralds of His power prevent them

		In bringing souls back to the Reformation, and to nothing farther, does one meet the need which, at this time, the Holy Ghost produces in them; that is to say, according to the thoughts of His grace?<a name=127:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think so.<a name=127:5></a> That you have motives sufficient for separating from a system which puts the true doctrine of the glory of Jesus on a level with the denial of that doctrine, I grant.<a name=127:6></a> But that is not the question.<a name=127:7></a> The question is about setting up the reformed churches of France, or the Reformed Church of France.<a name=127:8></a> It is not, observe, what were the symbols of the primitive Church, howsoever ineffectual they were.<a name=127:9></a> At that period, the Church was standing, and professed her own faith in rejecting certain errors; for, in fact, symbols are in the main always negotiation (that is to say, truths presented so as to guard against certain errors).<a name=127:10></a> But here, that is not what you do.<a name=127:11></a> By a profession of faith, you wish to place, or, if you like it better, to induce the churches to place themselves on a given basis, confessing, at the same time, that you do not copy even the institutions of the Reformation; and you expect (a desire in itself holy and excellent) that all Christians will unite with you.<a name=127:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The ensign for rallying which you propose, is it sufficient for gathering Christians together again?<a name=127:14></a> A great number of Christians, who share with you both in the same faith and in the principles of the Reformation, remain attached to the institutions which the Reformation created.<a name=127:15></a> They are wrong in your opinion; but they do it.<a name=127:16></a> You adopt the truth in the measure they profess it; only you wish it to be so set forth as to exclude those who deny it; that is to say, you make of this denial of error the basis of your new system.<a name=127:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What then would be the effect of your course?<a name=128:3></a> A division; the formation of two camps -- not of two camps, one of which would be united together by the truth, and the other by error, but of two camps of which one would admit truth and error, with traditional influences and the institutions of the system; the other, truth without error, making separation obligatory, and drawing its strength from that very separation.<a name=128:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Will this motive (a motive which will, I have no doubt, act upon a great number of upright consciences) suffice to reunite all the children of God?<a name=128:5></a> For, while laying down sound doctrine for the foundation, the truth in question is but partial.<a name=128:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You re-produce, at very best, the fundamental truths of the Reformation, truths which produced what you have just left; you reproduce them unfolded, so as to make a clear distinction between you and the sad denial of truth, which is the symbol of the camp which you no longer support.<a name=128:13></a> That is to say, when the question is about forming something beyond the sphere of individual salvation, you have nothing but a negative principle, which separates you from that which exists already, and which condemns it.<a name=128:14></a> Many of those that are found there, possess salvation as well as yourselves, and through the same truths.<a name=128:15></a> You re-gather Christians, by making such an exposition of these truths as separates those who adopt it from those who do not receive these truths.<a name=128:16></a>

If they have found them such, it would be useless for me to repeat that they are not so; and, in effect, those who think so would do well to separate themselves from them.

He builds, however, on the system of Mr. Olivier, only admitting the system of Mr. Rochat in a subordinate manner, and by the side of the other, and by paying his court to what he calls the new and amiable dissent of the Free Church (although it has not the veto of the church, the only safeguard against the entrance of the unconverted, and although there be clergy in it). It is all one. "The friendly division" is even a means fully admitted (pages 60, 61) in order to reach the desired end.

		<a class="footnote" name="#148:f3"><sup>+++</sup></a> It is important here to give its full force to this expression, "The unity of the Spirit." This unity is in no wise as Mr. M. presents it to us, a matter of feeling. The unity of the Spirit is the unity which flows from this, that the *One Spirit* has united the members in Jesus in one body. Look at the Epistle to the Ephesians. God has established Christ "to be the head over all things," and Head of the Church "which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all." That is to say, that the Church, as a body, is the complement of the Head, which is Christ. He has quickened us together with Him -- Jews and Gentiles also together. He has made us, as Christians, sit together with Him in the heavenly places. "For to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body ... . Now therefore ye [Gentiles] are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets [of the New Testament. See @Ephesians 3: 5], Jesus Christ being himself the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord [this is what has replaced the destroyed temple]: in whom ye [Gentiles] also are builded *together* for an habitation of God through the Spirit" Such is the unity of the Spirit, which in chapter 4 He exhorts the faithful to keep, by recalling to them that there was *one* Spirit and *one* body. And mark here that the descent of the Spirit, the power of unity for the body, is in such a way before the eyes of the apostle (and that founded on this, that Christ is gone on high) that he only knows the apostles in the Church as given, after the ascension, by Christ, the Head of the body. (See also @1 Corinthians 12.) There the unity of the Spirit is not so much in contrast with the previous separation of Jews and Gentiles as with the plurality of demons. "Now there are diversities of gifts, but *the same* Spirit ... . But all these worketh *that one and the selfsame Spirit*. For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body [whether Jews or Gentiles].  "Now ye are the body of Christ." <p>Such then is the unity of the Spirit, a reality in the power of God, and not merely feelings in man. The bond of peace is in order to keep this unity.

A body of men set apart for public religious instruction would have been an innovation totally opposed, even to the ideas of the Jews in apostolic times, and still more to those of Christians." <p>And page 65, "Let people shew me one single ordination, then I will believe all the others. To say that some of these men had miraculous gifts makes no difference to the question." And again, page 144 "I *regard then all nomination of the ministers of the word as an infringement on the divine order*." (Mr. M.'s italics.) "One may put oneself on the ground of divine right or of human order. It may be the Anglican priest in white, or the 'inevitable man in black,' or again, the Dissenting minister slipping in as if smuggled in *under the cloak of the biblical elder*. All nomination for speaking in worship is an evil." It appears that Mr. M. does not attach much importance at least to infringements on divine order.

John the baptist said, "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire." After His resurrection the Lord Jesus says to His disciples, 'Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence." Pentecost therefore was that baptism. It is by this means then that we have been formed into one body. The Church, its unity, its existence as a body, all that is therefore the result of the descent of the Holy Ghost here below, of the baptism of the day of Pentecost. This is the unity, the body, the Church, which the word recognizes, and it recognizes no other. It is certain that the completeness of it shall be manifested in the day of Christ; but that which the word of God recognizes as the body, the unity, the Church, is that which is formed where the Holy Ghost is, that is, on the earth. As God, the Holy Ghost is everywhere. By His divine power, He will keep for glory the very dust of the blessed (@Romans 8: 11). But as, whilst He was God, the Son descended here below, and that, with respect to the ways of God, His place was on the earth, so also the Holy Ghost has come down, and His place is on the earth. He speaks what He has heard. He forms the unity. <p>When once, by the grace of God, one has laid hold of this truth through faith, all becomes clear. This universal invisible Church, and arguments like those of Mr. Monsell, all this has -- and for ever -- lost its force.

The system of the minister of Neufchatel, the author of the "Examination," is not tenable according to the word. Besides, it is when death has laid hold of the Church that the actual institution has come in, that is to say, that the elders have monopolized the ministry. Then, after having shewn that all is antiscriptural, brethren are called on to submit to a system which places the sin of man on the same line with the judgment of God, and which wishes us to accept the one, as we submit ourselves to the other! Mr. M. sweeps away all other systems; let them protest if they think fit, we gladly leave to them all this debate. Meanwhile, we assuredly do not accept the horrid doctrine which the author puts in their place.

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Mr.<a name=174:2></a> Newton having put forth these doctrines in a reading meeting, they drew the attention of a brother, who, though he was quite under his influence, was nevertheless sound in the faith.<a name=174:3></a> He wrote on the subject to Mr.<a name=174:4></a> N.<a name=174:5></a> The latter answered him, justifying his doctrine, which he asked this brother to keep concealed, because, said he, there were saints who were not yet prepared to receive it.<a name=174:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is that doctrine: It is that Christ, born of Adam, is his descendant, so that the expression "made sinners" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:19">Romans  5:19</a>) applied to Him; that is, that through His being descended from Adam, the head of the human family, Christ was constituted a sinner, and exposed to all the consequences of the state in which He found Himself; that He had to obtain life by observing the law; that through His faithfulness He extricated Himself from this state; that at the time of the baptism by John He ceased, from being under the law, to be under grace; that He had to find His way up to a point where God could meet Him, and that this was in death, in the death of the cross: that consequently, Jesus experienced the feelings which an elect man, yet unconverted, must have experienced, if he had a suitable sense of his position; and that Jesus experienced them, not as our substitute, but as associated by His birth with man and with Israel in the condition in which they were respectively.<a name=174:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the very friends themselves of Mr.<a name=174:8></a> Newton told him, that if he did not retract such a doctrine, they would give up all intercourse with him, he withdrew the application which he had made of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:19">Romans  5:19</a> to the Lord Jesus, but expressly meanwhile maintaining all the rest of the doctrine up to this day.<a name=174:9></a> At least he maintained it still, when very lately I left England.<a name=174:10></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#191:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> This is very plainly the position of our brother, M. Foulquier. For he complains that the authority of the elders is made to rest solely on this nomination by men, when they say that without it they could not obey them. And without denying that at first they were officially set up, it is none the less a very evil principle to say, in the case where God had appointed them, that they could not obey them if man had not had a share in their appointment; for that is to substitute obedience on the ground of a human right for the spiritual and scriptural obedience of a new heart. I point out here an inconsistency which has been imputed to me, because, on the one hand, I desire to recognize them when manifested, and that, on the other hand, man has neither the discernment nor the authority necessary to nominate them. There is none. To recognize is a humble, fitting act -- it is the duty of every believer, when he sees any work of God. To nominate, is an act of authority. When the thing is manifested, it needs no discernment, and I recognize it; but to exercise an act of authority in placing men in that position, I have need of discernment. If I find in a bad soil splendid harvests, or peace amongst a disturbed population, I at once recognize of course the good farmer, the able ruler. But to choose the manager of an estate or the president of a republic, I must needs understand agriculture or politics; further, I must know men; and finally, I must have the authority necessary thereto.

		<a class="footnote" name="#191:f2"><sup>++</sup></a> Is the Church capable, after abandoning its normal position and its primitive rules, after having committed this sin, to re-enter as of right into that position and to re-establish all that the rules, long ago abandoned, had established, without taking account either of its failure or of the ruin consequent thereon? <p>The question, as I have stated it (and the whole is there) makes us understand without any difficulty the sentence of our brother, M. Foulquier. "Even had there been a positive commandment, I should not submit thereto, bearing in mind the state of the Church." The form of the statement seems to me faulty, inasmuch as it gives an idea of a refusal of the will to submit; but its sense is very clear, namely, that the actual state of the Church does not suffer the accomplishment of that which such a commandment demands, if it exists in the word, and that in the case where, under the pretence of obedience, elders are pretended to be set up in compliance with such a commandment, he could not submit to it, because of the state of the Church -- a reason expressed, moreover, by our brother in a thoroughly explicit manner. The authority of the word is nowise brought in question. That this expression might, for the moment, startle an upright soul, ignorant of what was in question, I can well understand: and it would have been desirable that our brother, M. Foulquier, had paid attention to it. Nevertheless the sense is plain. The manuscript of our brother, M. Foulquier, published by the author of the tract, "Are Elders to be established?" alludes to the passage found fault with, to that which had been said in a public conference, and relates but a portion of it. Further, all are agreed with respect to what was said. Our brother, Foulquier, told me that he added, "It is but a re-establishment of the clergy." <p>We must remember that those words, on the occasion on which they were so exclaimed against as blasphemous, were spoken at the end of a long discussion on the establishment of elders, as if there had been in the word of God a formal command to that effect. And it was after a discussion on details, on the question of ascertaining if any command to elect elders existed, that Foulquier said, "Even had there ... bearing in mind the state of the Church." However faulty the expression may have been (and I admit it), I scarcely understand for my part how, if any honestly desired to understand it, he could have misunderstood it, taking into account the subject which then occupied them, and the expressed reason, "bearing in mind the state of the Church." At the very moment, our brother, M. Kaufmann, said that everyone knew that our brother, M. Foulquier, did not reject any command. <p>Having mentioned the tract "Are Elders to be established?" it is needful to give some statement about the facts. <p>In alluding to some circumstances, the knowledge of which casts a light necessary to the understanding of the question which we are speaking of, I confine myself to that which is rendered indispensable by the tract in question. <p>From the opening of his tract the author declares that M. Foulquier has read the manuscript which he answers in an assembly of persons who share, like F., the opinions of Mr. Darby, and he adds, "None of these persons to our knowledge either disavowed or contradicted it.This silence ... authorises us perhaps to regard it as the more recent expression in Geneva of the principles of our brethren of L'Ile." <p>This explains to us what the author means by an assembly, and his desire to make the responsibility of the manuscript of M. Foulquier recoil on brethren. <p>Here are the facts: -- <br>This manuscript was never read either in the assembly of these brethren, or in any assembly, or in any meeting. Nor only this: the anonymous author had, in the presence of many persons with whom he sides, had conferences with some of these brethren, in which our brother, M. Guillaumet, who was occupied on this subject, had read a *totally different* treatise, intended to shew plainly the views of brethren on the point discussed. After the conferences the anonymous author had in his own hands the treatise of M. Guillaumet. <p>This is not all. <p>The anonymous author, returning on various occasions to the words of M. Foulquier, as unveiling the principles of the system and rendering the assembly of L'Ile responsible for the principle which he pretended to have found there, and which he denounced as a great sin, one who had been the chief organ of brethren in the conferences addressed the following note to him: <p>"I have just learnt, with much sorrow, that the expression dropped by M. Foulquier, in our last conference, and which is quite personal to him, has been hawked about by many and put forward as a principle, and not only that, but as *the* principle of the assembly. I declare solemnly, that it is a notable calumny, and that the brethren of L'Ile walk leaning on the word of God and on nought but that word, rejecting all tradition and every human organisation. And, further, our brother has explained to me the sense which he gives to his words, a sense which is very far from resembling that which has been given them. He rejects not the command, but the application made of it. How great the difference! I beg you to give its due weight to this note with brethren, in order to reassure them concerning our brother Foulquier. Adieu! in Him who has said we should pardon seventy times seven times, and who always does it to usward." <p>This communication was made to the anonymous author long before the publication of his tract. <p>From the moment when the manuscript of Foulquier had fallen into his hands, he abandoned the treatise which had been read at the conference to occupy himself with this one. He published it, or if he will, he gave it a demi-publicity, without asking leave of M. Foulquier, without acquainting him of it, and stating without proof and without foundation that it had been read in an assembly of persons who shared the views of Mr. Darby, adding that no one had disavowed it or contradicted it. <p>As to the manuscript of our brother Foulquier, this is its origin and history: -- <p>At the time when the brethren of L'Ile refused to take part in the proposed conferences, a brother, M.L., went to M. Foulquier to persuade them to go there, adding that they would not be clear of the blood of their brethren if they refused to make known to them the light they thought they possessed. On account of those words, Foulquier, after the conferences, shewed to M.L. a manuscript of some pages, to shew his general idea of the ways of God in regard to this question. Later, M.L. asked him if he might shew it to others. Foulquier replied that he might shew it to any one he wished, and that he, Foulquier, would do the same on his part. The anonymous author addressed himself to Foulquier himself on the subject of the words of which so much has been said, asking him at the same time if he followed the inspiration of the Spirit apart from the Bible. Foulquier replied, No; that he maintained nothing but that which he believed authorized by the word; that he did not know how to express himself as well as he could wish. But that as to the root of the matter, he could not withdraw any part of it, and that, whatever might be its form, the objections of the anonymous author would probably be nevertheless the same.

		<a class="footnote" name="#196:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> Here is the great lesson which we find at the beginning of the book of Samuel. The people failed in faithfulness, and this want of faithfulness, as is always the case, shews itself the most in that which is officially nearest to God. God is going to establish the only true remedy for the incapacity, in which man is, of keeping himself in the place of blessing. He is going to set up a Chief who cannot fall short of the glory of the Lord and who will assure the happiness of His people. It is the true King, the Christ. Before doing so, and before manifesting to the full the iniquity which rendered that necessary, or at least before exposing it in full daylight by judgment, God raises up the Spirit of prophecy, which communicates to His elect handmaid (the figure of a feeble remnant desponding and without strength) His power, which lifts up and shall exalt the horn of His Anointed. This grand fact changes all. Christ must be manifested as the support, the stay, of the blessing of His people. Then having shewn these things, God judges the priesthood, and assigns it its place before His Anointed. Nevertheless, He lets the iniquity of His people come to the full, by the contempt of prophecy and by the contempt of God Himself as the immediate King of His people. That is the history of the monarchy of Saul. It is not until the people have rejected God as their King, that the Lord puts into execution His counsels in the setting up of His Anointed. Still, as we well know, He placed the monarchy itself in the responsible hands of men. We know what has been the result of it; and that God was obliged to say that Israel was no longer His people. At the taking of the ark, Ichabod was written upon that people, and on the priesthood whose place was before the ark. At the taking of Jerusalem, in consequence of the iniquity of the kings, Lo-ammi (not my people) was written on all that remained standing of the ruins of Israel. The anonymous author seeks thus a proof that God re-established the primitive state of what is fallen! And Nehemiah, did he re-establish it? Is the fact of being the slave of the Gentiles, of those fierce beasts, the object of the final judgment of God, and at the same time a manifestation of that which the judgment of God had poured out on that people whose King He had Himself been, is this a proof that God re-establishes the primitive state of what is in a falling condition? Let the conscience of a man, endued with spiritual intelligence, judge of it.

In that I have not the slightest doubt. This just man whom God had raised from the East (@Isaiah 41: 2, 25; chapter 46: 11-13), acted on behalf of Him who has said of Cyrus, "He is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure, even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built, and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid." God desired that the order should go forth from the place where He had placed the government of the earth (@Daniel 2: 37, 38) when he said, "Lo-ammi" to His people. Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the faith of the people in inviting them to build. The order for it had already been given, and given on the part of him, to whom God Himself, in consequence of the unfaithfulness of His people, had expressly confided the care of them. <p>The anonymous author must have forgotten all that part of the word At least, he has not profited by it, and he did not know how to commit himself to the wisdom of Him who, on even this point, has confounded the iniquity of the Jews, who availed themselves of the fruit of their sin to perplex Him, in exhorting them to give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's. For, according to the providence of God, Caesar was the heir of Cyrus as regards the power of the world, if he was not the heir of his piety in recognizing the commands of the Lord.

At the request of the anonymous author this manuscript was handed to him and he examined it. Afterwards the writing of our brother M. Foulquier fell into his hands. These facts are the best answer to the accusation contained in the following words of his tract, page 20: "Thus, dear brethren of L'Ile, you leave us no other alternative than to believe your word, or to suffer by our refusal the most terrible judgments of God!!!

I confess I do not understand this. Mr. Wolff rejects, as I do also, the words "by the suffrages of the assemblies"; and insists upon it, that it had no reference to making their vote, and that the apostles had themselves alone established elders. The words, "they had ordained them elders," exclude even the idea that the flock had taken part in it. The fact is plainly that the Greek word, which means *choose*, *elect*, means, first, *to vote by raising the hand*; then, in general, *to elect*. The apostles chose the elders for the churches.

But it is plain that "of your own selves" is applicable to all the Christians of that place. To make oneself sure of it one need only read verse 29, "grievous wolves shall enter in among you." The words "among you" mark clearly the Christians of whom the elders were in charge; and these words "of your own selves shall men arise" are in contrast with the fact that some should enter within from without, and they apply equally to Christians. For this cause elders should watch, and watch not against themselves. And when the apostle says "I ceased not to warn every one," he does not mean to say that he warned the elders only. Thus the arguments, by which he would insinuate that the elders only are meant in the word "you" employed in this passage, are absolutely powerless.

		In the First Epistle to the Thessalonians I see that the apostle charges the faithful to take knowledge of those who were working amongst them and who went before them, and exhorts them to esteem them much for their work's sake; a motive more moral than dependent on their age, although I doubt not this entered into it, save in exceptional cases.<a name=224:18></a>

		There are three other important principles which I wish to point out to the reader before considering the passages I have to examine: principles which are in question in the formation of the different new churches.<a name=232:19></a> First, as to discipline at Geneva, I beg every sincere Christian to examine the printed constitution.<a name=232:20></a> I do not pretend to judge assurances given verbally in the midst of their assemblies; but I have before me their

		public profession of principles, and it is without controversy that discipline is either brotherly reproof, or, in extreme cases, the absolute authority of the presbytery, plain and open absolutism.<a name=233:1></a> The Church has no part in it, except submission.<a name=233:2></a> There is no discipline exercised for the purifying of the conscience of the Church, as Paul could say, "Ye have approved yourselves clear in this matter," <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#7:11">2 Corinthians  7:11</a>.<a name=233:3></a> It is true that they do not add "and not otherwise.<a name=233:4></a>" So that, according to the principle on which they chose their elders, leaving aside Paul and Titus, all the brethren may exercise discipline without looking to the elders and presbytery named in the rules, and take no account of them, without the least infraction of the rules.<a name=233:5></a> The absence of the "not otherwise" leaves the door open to every possible mode of acting, and the article preserves all its force and value .<a name=233:6></a>.<a name=233:7></a>.<a name=233:8></a> the institution subsists.<a name=233:9></a> Unless it be on this principle, discipline is either simply brotherly reproof or the absolute authority of the clergy.<a name=233:10></a> According to the word, pastors, elders, may enlighten the conscience of the brethren, counsel them, exercise a scriptural influence that the body may walk according to God; but according to the word it is the conscience of the Church which is brought into activity, it is the Church that removes from its midst the wicked person.<a name=233:11></a> The constitution of Geneva settles the matter quite differently, and the very explanations, which overthrow the article of the constitution, are themselves also contrary to the word.<a name=233:12></a> The elders pronounce after having informed the Church.<a name=233:13></a> The conscience of the Church has nothing to do with it.<a name=233:14></a>

		There are two more points which I wish to treat briefly, as being general principles of importance, which may exercise the heart on the occasion of the formation of these new churches.<a name=233:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point with which I shall occupy my reader, is that of the idea of union on the principle of mutual concession with respect to the divers views which are found among Christians, and of conciliation by these means.<a name=233:16></a> This principle has a great repute and a very fair appearance; but it is profoundly evil and presumptuous.<a name=233:17></a> <i>It supposes that the truth is at our disposal</i>.<a name=233:18></a> <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>teaches quite a different principle: there is no idea of concession nor of any arrangement in expressing the truth so as to reconcile different views.<a name=233:19></a> It is said, "Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.<a name=233:20></a>" It is not, Let us lower down the truth to the measure of him who has not come up to it; it is not two persons ignoring which of the

		two has the truth, or content to suppose the possibility of error in giving up more or less what they hold, in order to express themselves so as to be agreed: all that is an infringement upon the authority of the truth on us.<a name=234:1></a> "And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.<a name=234:2></a>" There is no question here of concessions, but of the revelation from God to enlighten him who is not perfect in the truth.<a name=234:3></a> "Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.<a name=234:4></a>" There is no question here of concessions, but of walking together in the things we possess, with regard to which, because recognized as being the truth of God, there is no giving up anything, all being subject to it.<a name=234:5></a> In that case, there is no concession, either on one side or on the other, for all possess the same truth, having already attained to it in a measure, and they walk together minding the same thing.<a name=234:6></a> The remedy for the diversity of mind which may remain is not to make concessions (how deal thus with the truth?<a name=234:7></a>) but the revelation from God in favour of him who is ignorant, as we are all of us on divers points.<a name=234:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I shall be told, On that footing, one will never come to an agreement.<a name=234:9></a> Where will you find in the word such a thing as coming to an agreement?<a name=234:10></a> To come to an agreement is not the unity of the Church of God.<a name=234:11></a> The truth is not to be modified, and we are not called to force our imperfect views on anyone.<a name=234:12></a> I must have faith, and one must have the same faith, to walk together; but in the things received as the truth of God by faith, I can make no concession; I may bear with ignorance, but I cannot arrange the truth to please another.<a name=234:13></a> You will tell me, In that case, how walk together?<a name=234:14></a> Why lay down grounds of unity which require either unity of views, or so evil a thing as concession on such or such a truth?<a name=234:15></a> As to the things on which we possess the truth, and with regard to which we have faith, we have the same mind, we walk in them together.<a name=234:16></a> If I acquire some knowledge more, I bear with the ignorance of my brother, until God reveals the thing to him.<a name=234:17></a> Our unity is in Christ Himself.<a name=234:18></a> If unity depends on concessions, it is only a sect founded on human opinions, because the principle of the absolute authority of the truth is lost.<a name=234:19></a> They will tell me, that true Christians will never yield on fundamental points.<a name=234:20></a> I was going to say "I understand"; but it is not so.<a name=234:21></a> There are many who are agreed in spite of the errors which affect the foundations; I know that others would not; but this does

		<a class="footnote" name="#235:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> Here is the thing better expressed than I could do it myself: <p>"There is something which is more compromised among us than the truth; it is its value and its claims. We are less far from finding the same dogmas in the scriptures, than from giving them the same authority over us; and we may be allowed to affirm that the questions on which Christians are divided would soon be settled, if they drew near to the Bible with the intention of taking seriously all the truths it proclaims. Alas! while we read, the devil murmurs in our ear, All that is not equally pressing, equally obligatory; we are commanded to bear with the weak; Paul made himself all things to all; he consented to offer sacrifice and to circumcise Timothy: on the other hand, edification goes before dogma; the principal dogma itself goes before the secondary dogmas, etc. One voluntarily opens the ear to a language which appears plausible and prudent; which appears not to attack a single truth, but which is only the more calculated to render them all powerless. From afar, one bows before each truth, but if it comes near to us, if it requires us to act, to sacrifice anything, at once the present truth is ranked among the truths that are out of season." *Archives*, Sept. 22, 1849.

	<div class="paragraph">
		And, again, pay attention to this.<a name=236:7></a> If I know the truth and make a concession so as to unite myself to others in a common profession, my concession is just simply yielding the truth to him who will not have it.<a name=236:8></a> If I, with others, make concessions because we only have opinions and are ignorant of the truth, or have no certainty as to it, what a monstrous pretension to lay down, in that state of ignorance, a rule to be imposed on others as a ground of the unity of the Church, under penalty of not forming part of it!<a name=236:9></a> I may be told, But, instead of this, you impose your views, as being sure of the truth.<a name=236:10></a> Not at all; because I believe in a unity which already exists, the unity of the body of Christ, of which every Christian forms part; whereas you establish union on views on which you have come to an agreement.<a name=236:11></a> You will tell me, You are indifferent then as to the truth.<a name=236:12></a> No; but you have used improper means to guard it, by imposing the profession of a part of the truth as a basis of unity.<a name=236:13></a> Some Christians in Paris, already in the truth, as I suppose -- these brethren in Paris are gathered on the ground of the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=236:14></a> By the power of the Holy Ghost and by discipline the body is guardian of the truth as of holiness.<a name=236:15></a> If any one upholds error and we have been unable to make him give up that error, he is not received or he is excluded.<a name=236:16></a> It is a duty towards Christ, Head of the

		See under what conditions I may take part in the union at Geneva.<a name=237:6></a> I must accept their system of elders, the popular choice of authorities in the Church of God by majorities, not to repeat what I have said on discipline and on the clergy.<a name=237:7></a> These are conditions which must precede.<a name=237:8></a> If I believe these things to be contrary to the word, I must force my conscience or withdraw.<a name=237:9></a> In France, one must accept a system of delegates, synods, church-inspection, a synodal committee, voting by majority which binds the churches, a proportional majority in certain cases.<a name=237:10></a> Suppose I believe that the principle which requires of us to decide in the things of God by majorities, is an utterly carnal principle (necessary in human things, but an abomination in the Church, since the Spirit must reign there, and two spiritual men may be right in face of a whole crowd), here am I, if I do not accept a principle which to my mind denies the authority of the Holy Ghost, excluded from the unity of what is called the Church of France.<a name=237:11></a> It is impossible for anyone who believes in the Church and its unity, and who believes that the Holy Ghost has any authority in the Church of God, to accept such a system.<a name=237:12></a> And I pray the reader to I observe here, how closely practice is connected with doctrine, and how those who are ignorant of a doctrine may act with great sincerity in establishing a common walk for Christians, without suspecting that they interfere with dogmas of the highest importance.<a name=237:13></a> There is no doctrine of greater importance, after the eternal foundations of truth have been laid, than the unity of the Church and the presence and authority of the Holy Ghost in the Church; it is a vital doctrine for these times -- the importance of which can scarcely be exaggerated.<a name=237:14></a> Now it is evident that a system of delegation, majority of votes, a synodal committee, with regulations for not re-electing immediately all the members of the latter, is a complete denial of the authority of the Holy Ghost.<a name=237:15></a> It is founded on human

		Here is the defence of this system: "Every one who was desirous of making for that union every sacrifice that can be reconciled with conscience and faithfulness.<a name=238:8></a> Here the concessions were genuine, for the question was not to reconcile that which is irreconcilable, the yea and nay on fundamental and distinctive doctrines of Christianity; but to reconcile different views on <i>secondary questions of application</i> and of ecclesiastical government -- questions with regard to which the most upright mind and the most scrupulous conscience can consent to submit.<a name=238:9></a>"

		The last principle I would point out, to which I have already alluded, and which has been largely insisted on for some years past, and which has recently been put forward in a particular way, is this: That which is not prohibited is allowed; or else one must find the words "not otherwise" joined to what is said in the Bible; if not, we may do the thing quite differently.<a name=240:5></a> Now the Bible, as far as I know, never says this.<a name=240:6></a> Certainly we do not find it in the New Testament, so that it is evident that all that is written therein furnishes no rule of conduct whatever; because, if when there is a walk traced out in the Bible one may act otherwise unless one finds the phrase "not otherwise" it is evident that there is in it no obligatory direction (that is, that the biblical directions and walk are nothing as authority).<a name=240:7></a> You cannot find a more iniquitous principle.<a name=240:8></a> People felt themselves without any authority in the word for a certain mode of acting; they spoke of a commandment; but after all, they felt that all that was alleged could not serve as a foundation to what they were building.<a name=240:9></a> Sometimes they will say that the word has not force of law.<a name=240:10></a> Sometimes they will not have a Gospel-code; and finally they do things as they please, alleging that the word has not said "not otherwise.<a name=240:11></a>" Let the Christian understand fully what this walk is, in order to brand it with all his spiritual might.<a name=240:12></a> This is what forms the basis of the whole Romish system.<a name=240:13></a> The word does suffice for our direction.<a name=240:14></a> If we find things done in a certain way, an authority committed to certain persons, we are quite as free to do it in another way, and to exercise the authority although it has not been committed to us, because it is not said "not otherwise.<a name=240:15></a>" For instance, here is what we are told with regard to the elders named at Geneva.<a name=240:16></a> They cannot deny that the apostle and his delegates did establish the elders.<a name=240:17></a> What are we to do now that the one or the others are no longer here?<a name=240:18></a> "We challenge our brethren to quote one single text where the Holy Ghost commands

		After all, to say that a direction given to a superior authority to know how one ought to conduct oneself in the sphere of his action confers on everyone to arrogate to himself that authority, even as a matter of obedience, would be too absurd a pretext to be put forward; and they feel it in spite of themselves, if it were not a question of justifying, when the thing is done, what is required by the principle we are now discussing, viz.<a name=242:4></a>, that the absence of this "not otherwise" leaves everything free -- a principle which sweeps away all that is said in the word, because we may do quite otherwise, without there being an infraction of the rule that is found in it and of the mode of action which is followed in it.<a name=242:5></a>

		There is a case of small importance, but I shall notice it, since it is a question of the word.<a name=242:7></a> The application of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#63:14">Isaiah  63:14</a>, and of <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#11:20">Nehemiah  11:20</a>, is perfectly right.<a name=242:8></a> It has been alleged that the Spirit was given after the captivity in a more excellent way, inasmuch as it was to abide.<a name=242:9></a> I answer: The prophet on the contrary encourages the Jews by telling them that just as the Spirit was with them when they came out of Egypt, God having vouchsafed it to them at that time, the Spirit remained and was abiding still in spite of the captivity; and I quote passages which prove that the Holy Spirit was given at the beginning, and that even after the captivity Nehemiah reminds them of this gift as being one of their special privileges.<a name=242:10></a> These were very appropriate quotations to shew that the words of Haggai mean that what had been given when they came out of Egypt was not lost, but still remained with them.<a name=242:11></a> That is evidently the sense of the passage, and it shews that the Spirit was also with them at the beginning.<a name=242:12></a> This is precisely what it was important to shew.<a name=242:13></a> I have perhaps been mistaken in thinking that everyone could lay hold of the force of the passage without an unfolding of it.<a name=242:14></a> We must remember that the prophet himself alludes to the time of their coming out of Egypt.<a name=242:15></a> "According to the word that I covenanted with you, when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not," <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:5">Haggai  2:5</a>.<a name=242:16></a> Is

		As to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, it is clear that it was the elders of Ephesus that the apostle was addressing.<a name=243:3></a> He had sent, calling them to come to Miletus, to avoid the loss of time which a visit to the whole church would have occasioned him (verse 16).<a name=243:4></a> Ephesus was a city where the apostle had dwelt for a long time, exercising a most blessed and powerful ministry, so that all Asia (the province) had heard the word, and thus this church had intercourse with all the Christians of the country.<a name=243:5></a> He calls the elders to Miletus, and addresses them in the touching discourse that we find in verses 18 to 35.<a name=243:6></a> Now it is evident that in sending for them he had on his heart not only those elders, but all the Christians of the place, and even of the whole province.<a name=243:7></a> He begins by shewing it.<a name=243:8></a> "Ye know," he says, "from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you.<a name=243:9></a>" It is clear enough already that "ye" does not mean the elders only; but it is in the midst of them all, of those of whom the elders were the representatives.<a name=243:10></a> See verse 25.<a name=243:11></a> The thing will appear still more evident from this passage; "And now, behold, I know that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.<a name=243:12></a>" "Ye all," does not designate the elders only.<a name=243:13></a> "Wherefore, I take you to record this day," this may apply better to the elders, but as representatives of all.<a name=243:14></a> "For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God "not to the elders only.<a name=243:15></a> "Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock.<a name=243:16></a>" Here the elders are particularly distinguished from the flock, "over the which," it is stated, the Holy Ghost made them "overseers," to feed the Church of God<a href="#243:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=243:17></a> "For I know that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you.<a name=243:18></a>" Was he then only thinking of the elders?<a name=243:19></a> Clearly not.<a name=243:20></a> It was the flock that was in danger; he thought of the sheep which the wolves would seek to devour.<a name=243:21></a> Not only some were to come from outside; but from among themselves, from the flock, should "men arise, speaking perverse things.<a name=243:22></a>" "By the space

		As to the bondage of Satan, I shall also say a few words.<a name=244:8></a> The word "Satan" often frightens persons, but the diligent reader of the Bible will not have failed to perceive that the word of God continually speaks of his influence, and attributes all evil to him, not to cover the lusts which open the door to him, but to shew the true source of that evil.<a name=244:9></a> All those who make a profession of Christianity, and who deny "the power thereof," are called by the apostle children of the devil.<a name=244:10></a> And as to the evil which has been wrought, where the word was sown, it is especially called his work "an enemy hath done this.<a name=244:11></a>" The apostle calls its instruments the apostles of Satan, as the tares are the seed of the wicked one.<a name=244:12></a> Now this evil has been principally done by a judaizing doctrine, and all those who undergo the influence of that doctrine undergo the influence of the enemy.<a name=244:13></a> The apostle calls this continually a bondage, as in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:4">Galatians  2:4</a>; chapter 4: 9; chapter 5: 1; so that the idea of bondage, and of bondage under Satan, in reference to Christians deceived by the enemy, is quite a scriptural idea.<a name=244:14></a> Moreover, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:16">Romans  6:16</a> fully warrants the use of the expression with respect to all that in which we obey the enemy, and with respect to all error and darkness in which we live, though we are Christians.<a name=244:15></a> I do not quote <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:26">2 Timothy  2:26</a>, because it can be applied to the unconverted.<a name=244:16></a> Let the reader remember that

		I now come to the priesthood, centre of unity to Israel, and to the change which took place at the time of the establishment of royalty.<a name=245:4></a> That a remarkable change then took place cannot be questioned.<a name=245:5></a> Ichabod had been written upon Israel, and every ordinary relationship with God had been broken, for the ark of the covenant had been taken.<a name=245:6></a> Hannah (in the song in which she celebrates, before this disaster, the goodness of God toward herself) had proclaimed that He would give power to His king, and would exalt the horn of His anointed.<a name=245:7></a>

		The kingly rule is established, but, at first, not such as was according to the will of God, but, in truth, by the great sin of the people, who, in making a king, rejected God who was their King.<a name=245:8></a> And from that time the ark was never restored to its place in the tabernacle, but David removed it to the Mount Zion; and having established all the order of the house of God, upon a new footing, he had to leave to his successor (Solomon) the execution of all that which he had received by inspiration, as well as the instalment of the priests in the temple.<a name=245:9></a> The order established by David was communicated to him by revelation, just as much as that of the tabernacle had been to Moses.<a name=245:10></a> Everything was arranged afresh, although there were elements common to both.<a name=245:11></a> It was, then, the epoch of a great change, when grace, acting by means of David, placed the blessing of the people upon a new footing at a time when all had been lost.<a name=245:12></a> The prophet comes in between the two states referred to, it is true, as a sort of mediator, in the person of Samuel; but we will leave this for the present.<a name=245:13></a> His office was the sovereign means, employed by God, to maintain His relationship with the people, when it was unfaithful and fallen into decay.<a name=245:14></a> That I have rightly estimated this standing of the kingly authority of David, is proved by the close of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>where it is said: --

		But before giving power to His king, and lifting up the horn of His anointed -- of whom the true Anointed was to be the descendant, and who bore, indeed, prophetically, his name of "Beloved" (David, see Ezekiel) -- before the existence of that kingly authority, what was the link between God and the people?<a name=246:13></a> What, I say, was the link when there was no king?<a name=246:14></a> For some link there must have been.<a name=246:15></a> He who is ever so little acquainted with the ways of God in the Old Testament will at once answer, "It was the high priest.<a name=246:16></a>" For after Moses (who was king in Jeshurun), who else could be the link?<a name=246:17></a> The only person who could have been so was Joshua; but in the very times of Joshua it was the high priest rather who was so.<a name=246:18></a> Let us cite the passages which speak of this.<a name=246:19></a> Take <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:15">Numbers  27:15</a>-23.<a name=246:20></a> There we see Joshua, who was to command, placed before Eleazar and the congregation; and when a portion of the honour of Moses has been conferred upon him, in order that the people might obey him, he must needs remain before

		God adds a sad history at the end of this book (but it is a history of facts which happened about the commencement of this period, for Phinehas was high priest) in order to give us an idea of the state of things within the country (for almost all the book is occupied with what passed between the people and their enemies); and therein we see that, in their affliction, it was the priesthood which was their resource and common centre; <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#18:26">Judges  18:26</a>-28.<a name=247:7></a> It is the same in the division of the land, as also in all else (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#14:17">Numbers  14:17</a>; <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#14:1">Joshua  14:1</a>), Eleazar is always placed at the head.<a name=247:8></a> This had never been the case in the time of Moses.<a name=247:9></a> And I ask any attentive reader of the Bible whether such was the place of the high priest in the times of the kings.<a name=247:10></a> I am aware it may be replied: "He always bore the breastplate with the names of the tribes.<a name=247:11></a>" Be it so, but it is forgotten that God had already abandoned the people upon that footing; that the ark had been delivered up to the Philistines, and that the king chosen of God, inspired by God, saviour to His people through grace, had taken possession of it, and resettled all upon a new footing, as type and representative of the Anointed of the Lord, of Christ the King of Israel, of the King who should establish the kingdom of God and govern all as such.<a name=247:12></a> From that time all hangs upon the conduct of the king.<a name=247:13></a> When the kingly office failed, the priesthood could preserve nought.<a name=247:14></a> Now the character of Christ in Israel, at that time, will be that of King, and, consequently, it is under that same character that His type and precursor has

		First, I do not see exactly that royalty was in failure during the reign of Saul.<a name=251:2></a> The king fell by the hands of the Philistines, but Saul was no more an unbeliever at the close than at the commencement.<a name=251:3></a> Sin came to its maturity in him; his heart hardened itself: alas!<a name=251:4></a> this is the history of man.<a name=251:5></a> But Saul never stood by faith; and the royal authority was not in worse plight at the close than at the commencement.<a name=251:6></a> He was disobedient, and God withdrew His favour from him as an individual; but I see not in what the royal authority, as such, failed.<a name=251:7></a> It is true, indeed, that the judgment which we have to form upon this, in measure, depends upon the principal question, viz.<a name=251:8></a>, that of the character of the royal authority of Saul, and to what point we can call it the royal authority willed of God.<a name=251:9></a> This we will now examine.<a name=251:10></a>

		Samuel sees so distinctively the will of the people in this matter, that he says (in substance in the terms of which I have made use), "Now, therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen," <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#12:13">1 Samuel  12:13</a>.<a name=251:11></a> This royal authority, was it that which was willed of God?<a name=251:12></a> The Spirit of God by Moses had anticipated the occasion in which the people of God would ask for a king, and had given rules to be observed when the occasion occurred; but the <i>will</i> of God is not found there; <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#17:14">Deuteronomy  17:14</a>-29, etc.<a name=251:13></a>

		It is clear that nothing can happen without the will of God.<a name=251:14></a> But it is certain that the establishment of Saul was not, morally, according to the divine will.<a name=251:15></a> Several passages in the book of Samuel furnish unanswerable proofs of this.<a name=251:16></a> "The thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us.<a name=251:17></a> And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.<a name=251:18></a> And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.<a name=251:19></a> Now therefore hearken unto their voice; howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them,"<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#8:6">1 Samuel  8:6</a>, 7, 9.<a name=251:20></a>

		We see here passages which shew, with the most entire evidence (unless the Lord willed that the people should reject Himself; unless, which is impossible, He willed a great sin, see <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#12:17">1 Samuel  12:17</a>, 19), that it is not possible that God willed the royalty of Saul.<a name=252:2></a> There is a collateral proof that this was not the royalty willed of God, viz.<a name=252:3></a>, in that the entire responsibility of maintaining its relationship with God is left to the people.<a name=252:4></a> (See end of chapter 12.<a name=252:5></a>) But the people having shewn that they could not do without that intermediate power -- could not walk with God in direct relationship, and God having also manifested the evil, the door opens for the accomplishment of His counsels in Christ: for there was a royalty which had its place in the counsels of God -- even that of Christ -- whose forerunner and type the Lord Himself raises up, without the will or thought of the people finding any entrance whatsoever.<a name=252:6></a> We have already seen the manner in which God (in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>) passes from His judgment upon Shiloh, by the way He had abandoned the tabernacle for ever, to His own choice, viz.<a name=252:7></a>, to David and to the place of His throne in the midst of His people -- the place chosen for His abode.<a name=252:8></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:17">Psalm  132:17</a>, where it is written, "There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.<a name=252:9></a>"

		And in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>(of which we have cited one verse) we find all the blessing of the people connected with the house of David.<a name=253:1></a> Moreover, his relation with Christ considered, this could not be otherwise.<a name=253:2></a> I would quote <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#13:11">Hosea  13:11</a>, but its application to Saul may be questioned.<a name=253:3></a> I have quoted passages in direct proof that the existence of the royal authority of Saul was by an act of sin; and that it was not what God willed to maintain as that which He had established according to His will; and that the royal authority of David was established by the very act and by the will of God during the very existence of the other.<a name=253:4></a> But, in fact, the manner in which the word expresses itself, as to the relationship between the royalty of David and that of Christ, the allusions of the prophets to Christ under this very name, the manner in which the Psalms speak, the history of David, its analogy with that of Christ, the bearing of all that is said, and the very history, all these things are (for him who takes notice of the ways of God) what manifest the divine thought as to His counsels in Christ; and they are evidence far more powerful than isolated texts in proof that the royalty of David was that willed by God, and that the royal authority of Saul (fruit of the will of the people, who in desiring him rejected God) was not so; although, in a certain sense, all things are according to His sovereign will.<a name=253:5></a> It is, consequently, in the royalty of David that the failure of this means of relationship with God is in question, and not in that which took place with the sin of the people, who, in establishing it, rejected God.<a name=253:6></a> When we speak of failure, we take for granted there was a state in which God had established man (or, indeed, angels) in blessing; but in blessing lost through the failure, so far as the responsibility of him who was placed in it goes, the sovereign grace of God alone remaining, and capable of re-establishing it according to His counsels of peace.<a name=253:7></a> And this proves, in an unquestionable manner, that God never re-establishes, in its primitive state, a thing entrusted to men and placed under responsibility; because, as to that which regards man, all these things are but figures of some part of the glory of Christ, who alone can uphold them.<a name=253:8></a> Thus Adam himself was the pattern of Him that was to come; and the blessings of an earthly paradise must needs be replaced in Christ by far better mercies, but could not be so out of Him.<a name=253:9></a> So the priesthood, the royal authority, and every other form of blessing whatsoever, can only be realized in Christ.<a name=253:10></a> Nevertheless, God

		The rejection of Judah, at the time of the taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and, consequently, the cessation of the application of the title "Ammi" to the whole people, has been the universal conviction of those Christians who have studied these subjects; and this for very simple reasons.<a name=254:7></a> One may be astonished that any one should call it in question, but I will briefly here present some of the proofs.<a name=254:8></a> To give them in full and in order, it would be needful to transcribe the greater part of the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<a name=254:9></a> Before producing some of these, it is well to recall the fact, that Israel is always the people of God; and if the affections of the heart and of the faith of a Daniel and a Nehemiah have called them so, nothing is proved thereby.<a name=254:10></a> Israel cannot cease to be the people of God.<a name=254:11></a> "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance," and it is of Israel that this is said.<a name=254:12></a> God never ceases to consider Israel as His people; but He <i>has</i> ceased <i>to govern</i> them as His people, and to have His throne in the midst of them upon the earth.<a name=254:13></a> Paul insists in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>upon this point after their rejection of Christ "I say, then, Hath God cast away his people God forbid" (verse 1).<a name=254:14></a>

		It might be said, perhaps, "But this is because Judah always remained the people of God.<a name=255:2></a>" One could hardly venture to say so after the death of Jesus.<a name=255:3></a> But the fact is, that the apostle takes no notice of the distinction between Judah and the ten tribes.<a name=255:4></a> He speaks of all Israel, and shews that they are beloved for the fathers' sakes -- that God has not cast off the people whom He had foreknown.<a name=255:5></a> Now this, evidently, does not apply only to Judah, but to all Israel, as the apostle expresses himself; and the distinction which he draws is between all Israel and the election according to grace.<a name=255:6></a> This will suffice for the moment; we shall see positive proofs of it farther on.<a name=255:7></a> Here I seek only to shew that the recognition of the people, as a people, applies to all Israel, and that it is entirely to misapprehend the force of the passages, and to mistake as to the whole question, to suppose that the faithfulness of God to His predeterminate counsel, and the precious faith of them that are His in that unchangeable faithfulness, according to which the title of His people is given to Israel, touches the question of the judgment of "Lo-ammi.<a name=255:8></a>" It is to confound the counsels of God with His government.<a name=255:9></a> In all times, Israel is His people, according to His counsels, and the thoughts of His love.<a name=255:10></a> This does not prevent their being called "Lo-ammi" (not my people) as to the government of God.<a name=255:11></a> Consequently, the fact that Israel has been called "His people" at any given epoch leaves the question entirely unanswered of "<i>When</i> was the sentence of 'Lo-ammi' pronounced?<a name=255:12></a>" Only we have made a step in our research after truth, to wit, in that we have found that this concerns the government of God.<a name=255:13></a> For "Lo-ammi" certainly applies, as to the government of God, to all Israel, and to the ten tribes, at one epoch or another.<a name=255:14></a> And as to the sovereign love and the counsels of God, Israel as a whole are always His people.<a name=255:15></a> The question then is of His government, and we can now ask, "When is it that God, in His government of the people of Israel, executes upon that people the sentence of 'Lo-ammi'?<a name=255:16></a>" I am about to shew my reader that it was at the time of the captivity of Babylon.<a name=255:17></a>

		OBSERVATIONS ON A TRACT, ENTITLED "PLYMOUTHISM IN VIEW OF THE WORD OF GOD"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the tract which forms the subject of these few pages was published, I did not think it worth answering.<a name=271:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the country where it was first brought before Christians, the subject of which it treats had been amply discussed in other pamphlets; and Christians were sufficiently supplied with arms to enable them to defend themselves against the errors which it contains.<a name=271:2></a> Its intrinsic character was not such as would invite a serious person to answer it.<a name=271:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in other countries the enemy has taken advantage of the fact of this article having remained unanswered.<a name=271:4></a> It has been reprinted in France, and circulated in places where Christians have had scarcely any opportunity for information on the points of which it treats.<a name=271:5></a> Triumph is easy where there is but one party engaged in the combat.<a name=271:6></a> Besides, one finds by experience that charity should hardly suppose that the mass of the faithful will judge what is presented, as unanswered, to their consideration; and above all if he who presents it has a just claim to their respect.<a name=271:7></a> Happily the faithful are for the most part occupied with other things than questions; but when once questions are laid before them, it is well that they should listen to what there is to be said on the part of those who have been attacked.<a name=271:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will justify what I have said as to the insignificancy of the pamphlet of which I speak, by shewing that, whilst written (according to what those who are well informed say) by an elder of the new Evangelical Church at Geneva<a href="#271:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>, it gives evidence of such ignorance of the word as ought, it seems to me, to have induced its author to remain silent, as being the most suitable course, if at least he desires the respect which one would suppose due to a person invested with the title of Elder.<a name=271:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Men having failed to meet the intentions of God, by transgressing, or rather by perverting, the laws and ordinances which He had given them for their security, therefore God suppressed the economy which had failed, in order to substitute another for it.<a name=272:2></a> There was consequently sin in wishing to re-establish what God had suppressed.<a name=272:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not thus that I should present my thought, for God is far from suppressing an economy as soon as man has failed to fulfil his duty under this economy.<a name=272:4></a> God uses long forbearance.<a name=272:5></a> He employs all sorts of means to recall man to his duty, until, as it is expressed in the word, there is no remedy.<a name=272:6></a> This is what He has shewn even with regard to those who did not enjoy a covenant, announcing to Abraham that his seed should go down into Egypt; and God adds that it should not yet possess the promised land, because the iniquity of the Amorites <i>was not yet full</i> (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:13">Genesis  15:13</a>-16).<a name=272:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The author will forgive my speaking openly; but really he does not know what he says.<a name=272:8></a> If God has suppressed anything, would it not be sin to wish to set it up again?<a name=272:9></a> The consequence he condemns, in what he imputes to the brethren, is perfectly just, and it would be an utter want of respect towards God to deny it.<a name=272:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The author will say, This is not what I deny; I deny that anything has been suppressed.<a name=272:11></a> It is not the consequence that I deny, but the fact itself whence it is deduced.<a name=272:12></a> God has suppressed nothing.<a name=272:13></a> The proposition therefore is true and incontestable.<a name=272:14></a> It is the fact alone on which it is founded that is disputed.<a name=272:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men having come short of God's intentions, God has suppressed or set aside a fallen dispensation, and has substituted another for it.<a name=273:3></a> It would be sin to wish to re-establish what God has suppressed, unless we are permitted to become Jews again.<a name=273:4></a> But it will be said, It is impossible to suppose that the author could mean to say that the Jewish dispensation has not been set aside and that another has been substituted for it.<a name=273:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, indeed, reader, no one could have supposed it; but it is what one may read in this tract written by an elder (ordained to "hold fast the faithful word as he has been taught," "to exhort by sound doctrine," and "to preserve the assembly from false doctrines").<a name=273:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what he says: "In <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#26:14">Leviticus  26:14</a>-16 we read, 'But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: I also will do this unto you,' etc.<a name=273:7></a> Then follows the exposition of the judgments reserved for those who shall have rejected the statutes and the covenants, but not a word of the withdrawal of the statutes or covenants which had been <i>Satanized</i>.<a name=273:8></a> Isaiah says (chapter 31: 2), 'He will bring evil and will not call back his words.<a name=273:9></a>' In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111">Psalm  111</a>we read, 'He will ever be mindful of his covenant.<a name=273:10></a>' 'All his commandments are sure.<a name=273:11></a> They stand fast for ever and ever.<a name=273:12></a>' The holy scriptures are full of threatenings against those who shall pervert or transgress the law; but nothing leaves room for the supposition that, on account of the transgressions, a new law is to be substituted for the first.<a name=273:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One can scarcely imagine such ignorance.<a name=273:14></a> The unconditional promises made to Abraham, the covenant of God made with him, the conditional covenant of Sinai, the law in its moral substance, the statutes and ordinances set up for a time amongst the Jews, and the immutable word of God, as well as the words of Jesus, all that, it is true, is jumbled together in this article, as may be seen by comparing what I have just quoted from it with what is said afterwards.<a name=273:15></a> But I do not wish to weary my reader by shewing all the confusion that reigns there.<a name=273:16></a> I shall confine myself to the main points of the author's assertion: "Not a word about the withdrawal of statutes or of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For my part, I did not think that there was any one, bearing the name of Christian, or any child learning his catechism, who could be ignorant that a new covenant was of necessity to be substituted for the old covenant of Sinai.<a name=274:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall now confront the teaching of the tract which I have just quoted, in comparison with the declarations of the word of God.<a name=274:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"But now hath he [Christ] obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the Mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.<a name=274:4></a> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.<a name=274:5></a> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.<a name=274:6></a> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.<a name=274:7></a> For this is the covenant, etc.<a name=274:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:6">Hebrews  8:6</a>-10).<a name=274:9></a> "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.<a name=274:10></a> Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away," <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:13">Hebrews  8:13</a>.<a name=274:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do you see?<a name=274:12></a> A person desires, as being an elder, to teach and hold fast the faithful word, and tells us that there is not a word about the withdrawal of the covenant made with the Jews.<a name=274:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The attentive reader may perceive that in the chapter of the book quoted by the tract, the Spirit of God says nothing about the covenant of Sinai, and returns in its promises to those made without condition to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.<a name=274:14></a> (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#25:42">Leviticus  25:42</a>; compare also <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6:38">Isaiah  6:38</a>.<a name=274:15></a>) But it would be useless to enter into such distinctions, in replying to a tract which, in presence of the positive declarations of the New Testament, can hold such language as this one does.<a name=274:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note that, according to the Epistle to the Hebrews, there is a first, or old covenant, and that there is also a second; that the first was ready to be abolished, and this was because Israel had not continued in the covenant that God had made with them; and that on every point the Epistle to the Hebrews

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The author seems to take pleasure in using all the words which could shew that he stands in open contradiction to the word of God about everything.<a name=275:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He not only tells us that a new covenant cannot take place, but that a new law cannot be substituted for the first.<a name=275:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is what the word says: "For, the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.<a name=275:4></a>" "For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof," <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:12">Hebrews  7:12</a>, 18.<a name=275:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same principle is laid down in chapter 10.<a name=275:6></a> "He taketh away the first that he may establish the second" (verse 9).<a name=275:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the author is not contented with saying directly contrary to the word through ignorance of its contents; he must twist it by omitting, through a prepossession which causes him to mistake the bearing of it, the most essential words of the passage in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:18">Matthew  5:18</a>, which he quotes, "For, He says, 'Verily, I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in nowise pass till all be fulfilled.<a name=275:8></a>'"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the author adds:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Either we are much mistaken, or this really includes the universality of the economies, of the institutions and ordinances of Jehovah as far as they are contained in His word.<a name=275:9></a> As to ourselves we do not know of any others.<a name=275:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this has a defect, and a defect of the most essential kind.<a name=275:11></a> The author has omitted the words "from the law.<a name=275:12></a>" The Lord Jesus said, "Till heaven and earth pass one jot or tittle shall in nowise pass from the law till all be fulfilled.<a name=275:13></a>" Then, after this omission, the author insists on its being a question of all the dispensations in this passage.<a name=275:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is, he does not know what is the matter in question.<a name=275:15></a> No one doubts but that the law and prophets will be fulfilled some day.<a name=275:16></a> This is not the question.<a name=275:17></a> The point is to know whether the dispensation under which the law subsisted in its integrity as a rule of the government of God, and under which the prophets exercised their ministry, has not been replaced by another.<a name=275:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the prophets foretold that there would be a new dispensation and a new covenant, does the setting aside of the old one under which they prophesied, and the setting up of the new

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the law brought nothing to perfection, if there has been the introduction of a better hope founded on better promises, and if God has introduced this better hope (the figures for the present time and the whole system founded on them being suppressed to make room for that which was better), does this weaken the force of those figures?<a name=276:4></a> On the contrary, they are accomplished in the reality that was foreshadowed; but the system established on the use of them is abolished.<a name=276:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the law, looked at even in its moral and eternal power, curses him who infringes it, and if Christ has borne this curse, does this striking proof of the authority of the law weaken it?<a name=276:6></a> Clearly not.<a name=276:7></a> Nothing gives such a testimony to it.<a name=276:8></a> Does it therefore continue to be the principle according to which our relationships with God exist?<a name=276:9></a> Certainly not.<a name=276:10></a> We should be lost if it were so.<a name=276:11></a> We are no longer under law but under grace; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:14">Romans  6:14</a>, 15.<a name=276:12></a> "It [the law] was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made," <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:19">Galatians  3:19</a>.<a name=276:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus placed the author's assertion about the withdrawal of the covenant in its true light, I will add a few passages which clearly prove that, historically, God threatened the Jews to set them aside -- looked at as placed under the dispensation of the law -- and that He did set them aside in consequence of their sins.<a name=276:14></a> Jehovah never forsakes the unconditional covenant which He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and He often recalls it in grace.<a name=276:15></a> Read <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#4:23">Deuteronomy  4:23</a>-31; chapter 8: 19, 20; chapter 28: 63-68; chapter 29: 28; chapter 30: 17, 18.<a name=276:16></a> All these passages shew plainly that judgment has fallen upon Israel by reason of their sins.<a name=276:17></a> By this judgment the relationships formed between God and Israel under the law, these relationships, the existence of which depended expressly on the people's obedience (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:5">Exodus  19:5</a>), have been entirely interrupted and even terminated.<a name=276:18></a> The first covenant, that of Sinai, has been suppressed -- abolished, as the Epistle to the Hebrews says, in order to give place to another.<a name=276:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word declares the same thing with regard to the kingly power, which was the means God in His goodness used to maintain His relationships with Israel.<a name=276:20></a> The relationships of Israel with God by its means were broken through the iniquity

	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps I shall be told, We fully admit this; but it was the husbandmen who were punished: the dispensation was not suppressed; the law was not altered.<a name=277:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Without repeating passages, which have been already quoted on this subject, I shall confine myself to the statements, that if you say that we are still under law, you do not know what the gospel is: if you say that we are under the same dispensation, you are ignorant of what Christianity is.<a name=277:10></a> The Jewish dispensation is not the Christian dispensation, and Christianity is in nowise the Levitical system.<a name=277:11></a> This system is suppressed.<a name=277:12></a> It is suppressed because of the sins of those who ought to have conformed to it.<a name=277:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We admit that this has happened to the Jews (people may perhaps say, giving up those assertions the absurdity of which might be evident to a child), but it will not be true of the Gentile.<a name=277:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I reply again: The word of God tells us the contrary.<a name=277:15></a> The apostle says (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:22">Romans  11:22</a>), "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off" That is, the apostle applies to us what has been fulfilled with regard to the Jews.<a name=277:16></a> Notice also that this is on account of sin.<a name=277:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principles of the tract are therefore entirely anti-scriptural.<a name=277:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to be convinced of it, one has only to compare the assertions contained in page 10 of the tract, with the quotations I have given from the Epistle to the Hebrews (quotations in

		Besides, the author advances a principle which it is important to take up: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The duration of the dispensation depends therefore neither on the faithfulness or on the unfaithfulness of Christians, but it abides independently of them, maintained by the powerful and unchangeable will of the Lord and visibly recorded in the word.<a name=278:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That God makes everything to serve towards the infallible accomplishment of His will is true; but to make use of this truth in order to deny the consequences of the responsibility of man placed under God's government on the earth, is anything but sound doctrine.<a name=278:3></a>

		Instead of having abandoned the doctrine of the apostasy, such as I understand it and as I have explained it, I continue to say that I most seriously believe that it is ever most important to warn Christians of it.<a name=296:3></a> The principle, which will end by this terrible apostasy, was already working in the time of the apostles.<a name=296:4></a> Jude points out this seed of the enemy as being already entered into the visible Church, and he declares that it is of those that Enoch prophesied when announcing the judgment to be executed at the coming of the Lord.<a name=296:5></a> To direct the attention of the Church to this germ of that which is the corrupting principle of the Church, and which is developed in bringing in an apostasy, an open revolt, is of the highest importance.<a name=296:6></a> This germ has been so developed since then, that its fruits have been treated by excellent Christians, as the full "accomplishment of the apostasy.<a name=296:7></a>" I think that they are mistaken; but it is such a development, that morally they are right; and Jude speaks of a much more partial development as being that which was to be judged at the end: how much more then when the evil had displayed itself in such a way as to invade the world, to take possession of its power, and to establish its empire everywhere, as if this world were the Church, and the Church of this world!<a name=296:8></a> I believe that those who seek to weaken the impression of the testimony with regard to this evil, and to destroy the thought that it is morally the apostasy itself, are doing the work of the enemy.<a name=296:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I insist then, more than ever, upon this, that the result of that which is passing here below with regard to the Church is an apostasy, and that it is of all importance to point out that which has already taken place, as being this evil, as being, morally speaking, the apostasy, although its public and open manifestation may still be deferred.<a name=296:10></a>

		Is it a little thing, that the evil which will bring down the terrible judgment of God upon Christendom exists though still bridled?<a name=296:11></a> Is it not important to give it its true name, its true character, although it hides itself, and because it hides itself?<a name=296:12></a> Now this is why people oppose this.<a name=296:13></a> The word declares that if this evil came in -- and it shews that it had already come in at the time of the apostles -- it would continue its course, would go from bad to worse, and there would be a cutting off, as took place in the case of the Jews.<a name=296:14></a> In a word, that judgment

		The author had made out that I said this.<a name=297:8></a> It is one of the passages which he has altered in what he said he copied.<a name=297:9></a> I have never entertained the thought, except to refute it when it was presented, if, by rejecting, they mean to suppress or to set aside.<a name=297:10></a> In the thoughts of God, however, they are indeed rejected; but His patience does not permit Him to suppress them till there is no longer any remedy.<a name=297:11></a>

		However, if I were anxious to be very exact, I should say that what they say I am obliged to acknowledge I do not acknowledge, for I believe that an economy is really rejected as soon as men have sinned against it.<a name=297:12></a> That which I <i>taught</i> in the passage quoted is that God did not suppress it directly, although they have made out that I say the contrary, which I have never thought.<a name=297:13></a> The economy which is founded on conditions is, at bottom, rejected as soon as man has failed in these conditions; it is only suppressed (on account of the patient goodness of God) when there is no longer any remedy.<a name=297:14></a> That which they make out that I acknowledge, I do not acknowledge; that which they make out that I say, I have never said, but quite the contrary.<a name=297:15></a>

		Finally, that the Mosaic economy was re-established, is what I do not accept, because it was not fully and definitively set aside before the coming and rejection of the Lord.<a name=298:6></a> The kingdom had been overthrown; worship had been interrupted, and never was completely re-established; but still there was a formal promise that at the end of seventy years there should be a return from captivity, their oppressors being judged.<a name=298:7></a> The author sends us back to pages 18, 19 of my "Observations.<a name=298:8></a>" Now in these two pages I find quite the contrary to what they affirm, in saying that I cannot deny the re-establishment of the Mosaic economy.<a name=298:9></a> For this is what is said in them, in detailing what was wanting in the second temple: "Well, could men re-establish what depended on the power, the authority, and the grace of God?<a name=298:10></a> <i>No, they could not</i>.<a name=298:11></a>" I said, "The ordinances were not abolished," which is quite true; they were not so until the death of the Lord, and as a judicial fact only when Titus took Jerusalem.<a name=298:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The author, the elder who was chosen, thinks that the Church has not followed the best course in the choice and installation of its elders and deacons -- "perhaps it is possible to do it much better.<a name=301:6></a>" This renders it perfectly certain, that the Evangelical Church has not acted according to the word, for, in that case, it would have followed the best possible course, the only good and true one; it would not have been possible to do much better.<a name=301:7></a> It is impossible to have a more positive avowal that the choice and installation of the elders of the Evangelical Church of Geneva was not according to the word.<a name=301:8></a> This is what I thought, this is what I said, and this is what I still think; and it is because it is not according to the word that I do not accept it.<a name=301:9></a> That, when it has made trial of its ways which are not according to the word, there is nothing to hinder it from modifying them as the Holy Spirit may shew it by the word, is no reason for conforming to its course, as long as it departs from the word.<a name=301:10></a>

		P.S.<a name=302:6></a> I do not read the religious journals, so that I do not see the attacks which they contain against what is called Plymouthism; but just at the time this pamphlet was coming out of the press, they put the "Archives du Christianisme" of September 11 into my hands, and I was begged to add a word in answer to the article signed "De Gasparin.<a name=302:7></a>" There is as little pleasure in answering anyone who does not know what the question is, as there is in replying to those who make out that you say things that you have never said, and who, when you repudiate them, triumph in your having, as they say, abandoned your views.<a name=302:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, I will add a few words.<a name=302:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They say that Plymouthism has tried several theories.<a name=302:10></a> First, it was the apostasy of the economies; then it was the corruption and the fall of the institutions; and, lastly, it was the impossibility of establishing elders since the death of the apostles.<a name=302:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Why "first," "then," and "lastly," as if they were different theories?<a name=302:12></a> I should not express these things as they are expressed here; but the expressions do not matter much.<a name=302:13></a> I believe all the three things together.<a name=302:14></a> Instead of one theory replacing another, the latter only prove accessory facts, which are connected with the more general one.<a name=302:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is an apostasy of this economy (for I find the remark on the expression too trivial for me to employ any other).<a name=302:16></a> The institutions have been corrupted without the economy being at an end.<a name=302:17></a> And I do not exactly believe in the impossibility of establishing elders after the death of the apostles, but in the incompetency of those who now pretend to do so: their work, according to me, is anti-scriptural.<a name=302:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover M.<a name=303:4></a> de Gasparin, as far as it appears, does not know what the question is.<a name=303:5></a> He says: "The Church and its offices belonging to the economy, and this economy having apostatized, there is nothing more to be said of offices and of elders to be set up.<a name=303:6></a>" Why?<a name=303:7></a> The offices might exist as any other form, although the fundamental principle of the existence of the economy might have been completely denied.<a name=303:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have already sufficiently answered that grossly anti-scriptural idea, that it is not the sin of man which brings about the suppression of an economy.<a name=303:9></a> I beg the reader to pay full attention to this.<a name=303:10></a> Such an assertion (and it is approved of by M.<a name=303:11></a> de G.<a name=303:12></a>), is sufficient to judge the whole moral system which it is employed to sustain, and to prove what is the biblical knowledge of those who employ it.<a name=303:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		They wish to make it appear that I have acknowledged that my first position was untenable.<a name=303:14></a> I am very sorry; but instead of believing it untenable, I believe it more important than ever.<a name=303:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I should have been quite ready to suppose that the first publication of my thoughts on this subject might have contained something inaccurate, as it generally happens when fresh light shines into the mind of man; but I have been led, by the attacks recently directed against this doctrine, to read this first publication again; and I find it more reserved than I should have thought, and very conclusive for whosoever recognizes the authority of the word.<a name=303:16></a> They add that I even expressly allow that the evangelical economy has survived the very profound failure of Christendom.<a name=303:17></a> Yes, I do allow it most expressly.<a name=303:18></a> Until now I have never found an idea to the contrary excepting in the dreams of my adversaries.<a name=303:19></a> Where have I said that the economy had come to an end?<a name=303:20></a> I have preached and taught by word of mouth and by writing that the coming of Christ will be the term of it.<a name=303:21></a>

		But again: Where is the duration of the economy itself fixed in the word?<a name=304:21></a> Where is it said that it should be long, and that there should be a means of prolonging its institutions?<a name=304:22></a> For my part, I deny that this is said.<a name=304:23></a> The scriptures speak of it in a perfectly different spirit.<a name=304:24></a> I plainly affirm that nothing is arranged in the word with a view to the prolonging of the economy, unless the sleep of the ten virgins be called an institution.<a name=304:25></a> That the Bridegroom has, in fact, delayed His coming, we know; but I challenge my adversaries to shew me any ordinance of God which sanctions the state of things which is the result of this.<a name=304:26></a> I assert that the word always treats this state as a state of ruin and of sin, which will bring in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it not true, sir, that this time it is not merely one of the elders of the Evangelical Church at Geneva (for it appears that I was not mistaken as to the author of "Plymouthism," etc.<a name=307:1></a>) who has laboured to bring forth these "Remarks addressed to my Brethren in Christ, on the subject of Mr.<a name=307:2></a> Darby's last tract"?<a name=307:3></a> At least here is my reason for thinking so: I have not, it is true, much acquaintance with him who enjoys this imposing position and has invested himself with a title to which he seems to hold greatly; but it is well known that it is not a person who has lived in obscurity like myself and many others, happy, as I esteem it, amongst the poor of this world.<a name=307:4></a> He has lived in public, been deputed by churches and societies to represent them in other countries; in a word, he has taken his place in the annals of the evangelical world.<a name=307:5></a> Well, as I suppose, at least, he has always been found upright, straightforward, sincere, incapable of those subtleties, of those roundabout ways, those cunning devices which, when employed in a publication, fix the attention of intelligent men upon the author, rather than upon the arguments directed against his opponent, which bring under notice him who employs them, rather than him against whom they are employed.<a name=307:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not had the advantage of the teaching of the elders of the Evangelical Church at Geneva, and the distinction is too nice for me.<a name=311:10></a> You have said that nothing in the word of God gives room for the thought that a new law must be substituted for the first, that heaven and earth shall pass away before the least tittle of it passes away, and I make out that you say that a new law cannot be substituted for the first.<a name=311:11></a> This is the form which I have given to your thought.<a name=311:12></a> Have the goodness to enlighten me, sir; for up to the present moment I cannot understand in what I have altered it.<a name=311:13></a>

		But I full well understand the alteration which you have made when you say that I was rendering a certain proposition when there was another one still, and when you say that the text of your tract contained something, as though that were all, whereas it contained other things also, and it was precisely those that were in question, and which you concealed by omitting them.<a name=311:14></a> This distinction, which you point out as an alteration which perverts your thought, is too nice for the perception of those who are not elders.<a name=311:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, the <i>consequence</i> which you deduce from what you call my principles is no consequence at all, unless the dispensation be rejected as soon as corruption and ruin come in; for the dispensation is not rejected, as an accomplished fact, because of corruption having come in, if it be not rejected when the corruption is come in.<a name=317:15></a> Now, I had expressly denied this doctrine.<a name=317:16></a> I said, on the contrary, that God was longsuffering, until there was no longer a remedy.<a name=317:17></a>

The author says, "It is necessary to transcribe here the passages from 'Plymouthism,' in which Mr. Darby's system is formally expressed." He immediately, in effect, gives the passages from "Plymouthism," in which he had presented, in his way, Mr. Darby's system, introducing most important alterations in it in order to facilitate his arguments. But he avoids the use of inverted commas. And why so? He was conscious of these important alterations: he did not wish to present these passages to the reader's eye as being quotations. He did not wish, by the use of inverted commas, to draw the reader's attention to them as if such were their character. But, in fact, they are passages in which he pretends to give the former expression of Mr. Darby's system, and he expressly says, "It is necessary to transcribe here." I leave to my reader the task of appreciating all this. It was needful for me to notice this absence of inverted commas, because it might have been said he does not pretend that it is a quotation. But, in that case, what does "transcribe here" mean? I feel assured my reader will sympathize with me in the pain which I feel at being forced to have to do with such a way of acting.

		I here beg my reader to remark, that the object of the arguments in the second pamphlet, is to bring forward the institutions, as being laws, established by God in an abstract way, and to deduce from this as a consequence, that, since a law once given always remains the same, institutions and laws cannot be corrupted.<a name=320:6></a> Men may fail as regards them, but the institutions exist.<a name=320:7></a> Here is the reason for "fail as regards the institutions of God.<a name=320:8></a>" What could not be denied with regard to men has been changed into "fail as regards the institutions of God.<a name=320:9></a>" This is why, instead of "by perverting the laws and ordinances which He had given them," we simply find "by perverting the laws which He gives them.<a name=320:10></a>" For no one can deny that men have perverted the ordinances.<a name=320:11></a> This is why, when I said "the ordinances were not abolished," they made out that I said "the ordinances of the law existed after the captivity of Israel"; and this becomes, a little farther on, "He does not change <i>His laws</i>, not considering them corrupted and ruined," and then, "if, therefore, the ordinances of the law were maintained after the captivity," etc.<a name=320:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is clear that the laws themselves cannot be corrupted; and if one considers the institutions in an abstract manner, that is to say, the law that institutes them, they are what they are according to that law, and that comes to the same thing; it is a law.<a name=320:13></a> But the word "institutions" and above all the word "dispensation" have another meaning.<a name=320:14></a> It is a question of an established thing entrusted to man.<a name=320:15></a> The royal power in David's hands was an institution of God; the intention, rule, and thought of God have not changed.<a name=320:16></a> The institution, speaking abstractedly, is not abolished, for Christ will be King of the Jews.<a name=320:17></a> But was not the institution, the ordinance, in point of fact corrupted in the hands of men?<a name=320:18></a> Was not the royal power corrupted in the hands of Manasseh, ruined in the hands of Zedekiah?<a name=320:19></a> The institution of the Lord's supper,

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this has occurred with regard to the Jewish dispensation, and the Christian dispensation is threatened with the same doom.<a name=321:11></a> Now it is a sophism, and a sophism having the most antinomian tendency possible, to say that, because <i>the law that founds</i> the institution or the dispensation cannot be other than it is, therefore <i>the thing that is founded</i> cannot be corrupted.<a name=321:12></a> Nothing can abrogate the authority of that which has been said on the part of God; but if man has entirely failed with regard to it, and if thus a thing which required the power of God to establish it fails in the hands of men (the kingly power among the Jews, for example), the pretension to re-establish it is a false pretension, derogatory at the same time both to the judgment which removes the ruined thing, and to the authority of God which alone can establish it.<a name=321:13></a> Now, I said in the most distinct manner, that the dispensation is not yet brought to an end, and that it will continue to the end of the period ordained by God, until Christ leaves His Father's throne.<a name=321:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now it will be understood to what I apply the word "antinomianism"; it is when, on account of the authority of a law or an institution, regarded as a rule established by God, one seeks to destroy the consequences of man's responsibility, when man has failed in the obedience due to the law, or corrupted an institution which was entrusted to him.<a name=322:7></a> The kingly power amongst the Jews, the Lord's supper amongst Christians, are institutions of God; but they are things entrusted to man; both have been corrupted: the one has been abolished among the Jews; the other has not been abolished amongst Christians.<a name=322:8></a> He who would have pretended to set up again the kingly power among the Jews would have fought against God; he who purges the Supper from the corruptions which man has introduced uses it with blessing.<a name=322:9></a>

		Again, they pretend that I say that the Christian dispensation or new covenant is rejected.<a name=328:6></a> This is not the place for discussing the extent of the new covenant, nor its relations to the Christian dispensation; but I do not believe that the new covenant is set aside, because the Jews will be brought in again by means of this covenant, when the Church is in heaven.<a name=328:7></a> If the covenant were set aside, the dispensation founded on it would necessarily fall at the same time; but God, by taking up the Church to heaven and by rejecting the order of things which has existed in connection with it on the earth, can deal with Israel on the ground of the covenant founded on the blood of Christ.<a name=328:8></a> The Church, properly speaking, the body of Christ, is not a dispensation, it does not belong to the earth; but there is an order of things connected with it during its sojourning here below -- an order of things whose existence is linked with the Church's responsibility.<a name=328:9></a> The dispensation of the new covenant is, properly speaking, the millennium on the earth, as it is easy to be convinced of by reading the prophecy of Jeremiah who speaks of it.<a name=328:10></a> But, the blood of the covenant having been shed, Christians enjoy the practical and spiritual effect of what has been done (and this even in a more excellent way than that in which the Jews will enjoy it in the age to come), although the Jews as a nation have refused to avail themselves of it.<a name=328:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But if, according to the general language of the Christian world, we call the present order of things a dispensation or economy, it has not yet been rejected, as I have already very plainly said.<a name=328:12></a> It does not follow from this that Christians have not lost some things which they cannot again re-establish, nor

		Let us now see how the question is presented through the use of the word "<i>law</i>," to the exclusion of "covenant and institutions.<a name=329:2></a>" It is said, "God punishes the sinner, but He does not abrogate His laws on account of sins.<a name=329:3></a>" And who imagines such a thing, if it is a question of abrogating the authority of the law?<a name=329:4></a> But God certainly has set the whole covenant of the law aside, and the whole system from beginning to end, viewed as being the principle of God's relationship with man on the earth.<a name=329:5></a> No one would dare deny it, not even an unbelieving Jew, who suffers the consequence of it.<a name=329:6></a> He expects something better -- the coming of the Messiah.<a name=329:7></a> To pretend that the change has not taken place is folly, it is the denial of Christianity: to present the thing as if it meant that God abrogates His laws because man has sinned is a wretched quibble, worthy of the cause it is employed to uphold.<a name=329:8></a>

		Then it is said that, since I acknowledge that the New Testament dispensation is not yet at an end, and that the new covenant consequently still continues, "it is a strict duty of obedience for the churches, to return to what it teaches, no doubt according to the measure of what is possible.<a name=329:9></a>" Certainly, as far as regards my walk in the position in which God has placed me; but the question is quite different here.<a name=329:10></a> This is it: Am I placed by God in a position which authorizes me to establish elders?<a name=329:11></a> and where ought I to establish them?<a name=329:12></a> In every town?<a name=329:13></a> This is truly what Titus had to do.<a name=329:14></a> And you, the Evangelical Church at Geneva, you do not pretend to do so outside of Geneva.<a name=329:15></a> You are not therefore in the position to which these instructions are addressed.<a name=329:16></a> This is what I deny -- <i>your authority</i>.<a name=329:17></a> Your teaching here is, however, very harmless.<a name=329:18></a> <i>Obedience, according to the measure of what is possible</i>, you say, is a <i>duty</i>; and you affirm that it is possible to fulfil it.<a name=329:19></a> Be assured that Mr.<a name=329:20></a> Darby does not at all deny that it is possible to fulfil duty, that is, according to the measure of what is possible.<a name=329:21></a> On the contrary, he is struck with the wisdom of your remarks.<a name=329:22></a> There is only one thing you have forgotten here, namely, that the word <i>possible</i> is a relative word, and that it answers to the power of him who acts.<a name=329:23></a> It is your power that I question.<a name=329:24></a> One may have the pretension to appoint elders;

		Allow me, sir, to tell you, without bitterness, that it is you who, I will not say, detract from, but who lay aside, the authority of the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, because you pretend to ordain elders otherwise than the Holy Spirit orders it to be done.<a name=342:8></a> This was why it was insisted on at Geneva that, in ordering it to be done so, the word has not said "and not otherwise.<a name=342:9></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Notice, sir, that it is not the Epistles to Timothy and Titus which have conferred on these apostolical delegates the authority to establish elders.<a name=343:10></a> These inspired letters, given to the Church for all times, remind one of the fact that this authority had been confided to them, so that, for my part, I do not dare to say what was the extent of the power of establishing elders on the part of the apostles.<a name=343:11></a> It is by no means impossible that Paul may have sent several delegates.<a name=343:12></a> It is possible that he may have commanded them to do so after his death.<a name=343:13></a> The word tells us what he did, so far as that is profitable for the Church at all times, and not all that he did -- far from it.<a name=343:14></a> What I believe therefore is not precisely that it was impossible to ordain elders after the death of the apostles.<a name=343:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To sum up.<a name=343:16></a> Your assertion that God would not have founded and established institutions, knowing that they would fail directly, is entirely without foundation.<a name=343:17></a> The principle is shewn to be false by the history of man, of the Jews, of the priesthood in Israel, of the kingly power in this people -- by the whole history of the Bible.<a name=343:18></a> At the same time this manner of reasoning on your part is a confession that the word is entirely

		silent with regard to the appointment of elders after the apostolic times, because you are forced to have recourse to an argument, and to allege that God would not have founded else.<a name=344:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your second point, namely, that it is not a question of man's failure, but of a necessity which is connected with the death of the apostles, is only a denial of the omniprescience of God; since, if God foresaw the spiritual declension, He might very well not make mention of an institution which would invest with a positive and scriptural authority from Himself that which would be in this moral state of declension, although He might have given authority for a nomination as from Him to those who were the suitable instruments of His grace, before the Church had declined.<a name=344:2></a> Now this declension is stated in the word.<a name=344:3></a> There is an appointment of the first elders in the Gentile churches, but no decree for so doing continuously, so that you are forced to argue on a supposition of what God ought to have done.<a name=344:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In fact, your question is founded on the supposition that one must be an apostle in order to appoint elders.<a name=344:5></a> "If it is true that one must be an apostle," etc.<a name=344:6></a> Your supposition is still false.<a name=344:7></a> Timothy and Titus were not such.<a name=344:8></a> It is possible that others were employed to appoint elders.<a name=344:9></a> It is not impossible that they were so employed after the death of the apostles.<a name=344:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the conclusion we must come to is this, that you are incorrect in what you say; that I have been very scrupulous not to assert more than the word authorizes me to say; and the necessity of apostolic succession is a dream on your part.<a name=344:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I leave to you, sir, the choice of continuing the discussion, or of remaining silent.<a name=344:12></a> The discussion will only make truth more evident, and your silence will only be the proof that you have nothing more to object to what I put forth.<a name=344:13></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#347:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> It is Monsieur Demole's famous argument, that it is not said "and not otherwise" an argument which annuls by a single dash of the pen all the rules and directions of the New Testament. It is never said, that I know of, "and not otherwise"; so that in every case one might change everything, and say, it is not said "and not otherwise." It is a complete justification of all the additions and alterations that popery has introduced in Christian worship and ordinances. Doubtless that system does not act according to the word, but it is not said "and not otherwise," or, "in fact things may also have occurred otherwise." So that it cannot be reproached with anything on that score. And these gentlemen, who annul all the directions of the word by this single principle, that they may do otherwise when such is not forbidden by a "and not otherwise," accuse us of abandoning the word, and teaching the abolition of the command! I do not know a more fearful principle, or one more destructive of the authority of God and His word, than this, which has now the sanction of Mons. de Gasparin. Remember, reader, that according to him, when the word gives a direction or a uniform example, and that it cannot be proved that it has not been also done otherwise, you have full liberty to abandon the direction of the word and do things as you please.

	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we have, in the two cases of baptism and preaching, the proof that, when all was to be free, the Holy Ghost takes special care to prove this liberty undeniably.<a name=349:10></a> In that of the elders their ordination is carefully restricted to the apostles and their delegates.<a name=349:11></a>

		Was I not right in saying, in the presence of such frivolous reasons, that I was almost ashamed to answer your article?<a name=350:2></a> There is so little truth in calling it an apostolical act, that the apostle declares that, when he should arrive, he would send to Jerusalem those whom they should approve of by their letters, or that he would send with letters those who should be approved of; and, if it were meet that he went himself, they should go with him; and in the Second Epistle he declares to us that he wishes that there should be others for this work, so that no man should blame him in money matters (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:20">2 Corinthians  8:20</a>, 21).<a name=350:3></a> In a similar way the twelve refused to occupy themselves with it, because it did not become them to leave the preaching of the word to serve tables.<a name=350:4></a> And you see, in the case of collections, an example of the acts that the New Testament relates as accomplished solely by the apostles!<a name=350:5></a> If you speak of the collections themselves, the apostle ordered that the faithful should lay by in store their offering every first day of the week, and he adds, in writing to Corinth, "so that there be no gatherings when I come.<a name=350:6></a>" This is a singular way of figuring in the collection, thus to insist on everything being done through pure Christian liberality, and that, in order to that end, all should be done without him that he might not appear in it at all, and to take particular care that others and persons chosen by the churches should take charge of it, so that no one might reproach him with anything, adding that, in case of his going to Jerusalem, they should go with him!<a name=350:7></a> He was very willing to be employed in it, because it was for the poor Jews whom the apostles had particularly recommended to him (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:10">Galatians  2:10</a>).<a name=350:8></a> If to this we add the case of the other apostles (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6">Acts  6</a>) we have a proof of his thesis, perfectly worthy of the logic of Mons.<a name=350:9></a> le Comte de Gasparin and of the cause which he defends, namely, that there are some acts which the New Testament relates as accomplished by the apostles alone.<a name=350:10></a> The proof of it is that the twelve formally refused to do it as a thing which did not become the apostleship, and Paul takes good care that others should have the charge of it, and that, in the case of his going to Jerusalem, they should go with him; but as to the collection all was to be done without him.<a name=350:11></a> It is perfect in point of proof.<a name=350:12></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#352:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> In the primitive Church the churches founded by the apostles were carefully distinguished from all others. According to the Catholics it is this which gave so much importance to the Church of Rome. They quote a doubtful enough passage from Irenaeus (we have only a bad Latin translation of this passage, and of the greater part of the work of this good and pious father), after having spoken of other similar cases as an argument against heretics, he says, "Go to Rome" -- *propter potiorem principalitatem*. Protestants justly allege that it was *archen* (origin), because the Church of Rome had two apostles, Peter and Paul, as its founders. For my part, the Epistle to the Romans is a proof of the contrary. However that may be, the Christians of the first century would have been astonished to have heard that all the churches were founded by the apostles. It was said that the celebrated church at Alexandria had Mark as its founder. But I do not wish to go beyond the certain proofs which the Bible furnishes. Here is, if you have not already noticed it (and I must suppose so from what you say), that which may be useful to you in your controversies with those who still bear that name.

		If you reply No, I have, sir, in this case, only to repeat (for respect for the word of God is more important than human considerations), that the superficiality and lightness (I say it with sorrow), with which you treat these serious subjects, are evident, and that they are accompanied in you with a root of unbelief; for, knowing that the laying on of the hands of the apostles conferred extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit, you put it on the same level with the imposition of hands now in the bosom of a faithful church -- on the same level with a blessing or a prayer.<a name=375:15></a>

		This is not all that may have wearied me; but it is not well for me to speak of this any more.<a name=376:1></a> Let us come to what is at the bottom of the question.<a name=376:2></a> You say that "Paul founded neither the Church of Rome, nor that of Colosse" (say rather that of Hierapolis and of Laodicea): "granted; but it is not anywhere written, that the other apostles were equally strangers to the birth of these churches.<a name=376:3></a>" Which of the apostles?<a name=376:4></a> Do you even think that other apostles had been in these towns?<a name=376:5></a> Does any one think so who has studied the New Testament?<a name=376:6></a> Who believes that the apostles who remained at Jerusalem had been to Rome before the sending of Paul's epistle to the Christians in that city, or that they had been into Asia Minor to found the churches to which Paul wrote, when it was they who all agreed that Paul should go to the Gentiles?<a name=376:7></a> I ask every sensible man, if the history of the Acts, the Epistles to the Galatians, Colossians, Ephesians, and Romans are not sufficient to shew that the work of the apostles did not precede the sending of the letters which Paul addressed to these churches.<a name=376:8></a> But the cases on which you insist are still plainer with regard to this principal point.<a name=376:9></a> You say: "Moreover, in the two only cases in which the first work of evangelization is expressly attributed to private Christians at Antioch and Samaria, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>and 11 mention the immediate mission of delegates from the apostles and the church at Jerusalem.<a name=376:10></a> By what right, then, could one in these days found a new church, since there are no longer apostles to preside in the work, nor delegates from the apostle to confirm it by the imposition of their hands on the newly converted and by conferring on them the Holy Spirit?<a name=376:11></a>"

		This time I will not say that you weary me, sir.<a name=376:12></a> You furnish such suitable cases to demonstrate that my views are true that I have only to be satisfied with you.<a name=376:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do you know what this case demonstrates?<a name=376:14></a> That "faithful disciples" went forth to do the work of evangelization without asking what the apostles would do afterwards: then those who were the fruit of their labours took their position as Christians and as an assembly.<a name=376:15></a> This is exactly what we do.<a name=376:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostles laid their hands on them, and acted in order to confirm them in the faith; and in other cases appointed elders, either personally or by a delegate.<a name=376:17></a> The labouring brethren do not pretend to do the apostolical part of the work, because they are not apostles; and it is precisely this part which you have the pretension to do (that is to say, the apostolical

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that the serious and scriptural thing is to carry out the distinction which you make: to do that which private Christians did according to their gifts, and to leave to the apostles and their delegates what was done by the apostles and their delegates.<a name=377:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But you insist on another fact in your letter.<a name=377:6></a> You say, as to collections, only one is related in the New Testament, and in that single account the participation of an apostle is positively stated!<a name=377:7></a> Must I repeat to you, sir, that the apostle refused to take part in this collection, unless there were other persons with him?<a name=377:8></a> But this is not all.<a name=377:9></a> I must here thank you for the support which you lend to my views.<a name=377:10></a> This case also, as well as the other which you quoted, overturns your arguments.<a name=377:11></a> If you give yourself the trouble to read <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:26">Romans  15:26</a>, you will find, "For it hath <i>pleased</i> them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.<a name=377:12></a> It hath pleased them verily, and their debtors they are.<a name=377:13></a>" So that, on this point, the principle recognized in the word of God is that of the full liberty of the saints, and under certain aspects their moral obligation.<a name=377:14></a> "It pleased them.<a name=377:15></a>" Hence, when it pleases us, we do it, acknowledging often that it is an obligation.<a name=377:16></a> If you wish to see the spirit in which the thing was done, you can read <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8">2 Corinthians  8</a>where the apostle says, "I speak not by commandment"; and elsewhere (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16">1 Corinthians  16</a>) You will find other collections also.<a name=377:17></a> You will see that the apostle speaks of the collection at Corinth, as of a thing which was being made, and of his participation in it as a discretionary thing "if it be meet.<a name=377:18></a>" He had given orders to the Galatians as to how the collection was to be made.<a name=377:19></a> Hence, while quite admitting that there is often a moral obligation (and in this case one does not wait for an apostle), we find perfect liberty, we find spontaneous action as an essential thing, and that the participation of the apostle is a question of seasonableness.<a name=377:20></a> The examples which you quote,

		I am very glad that you openly repudiate the principle "that it is lawful to do otherwise than what is expressed in the word of God"; but in the face of this assertion allow me again to quote M.<a name=378:2></a> de Gasparin's writing (December 23, 1854) on the subject of the establishment of elders, etc.<a name=378:3></a> "Because things appear to have happened thus in the two or three instances which the New Testament mentions, it does not the least in the world follow that they could not also have been done otherwise.<a name=378:4></a>" Now the facts are always there -- the thing was not done in the Gentile churches otherwise than by the apostles and their delegates.<a name=378:5></a> I have already said that there does not appear to have been any nomination of elders amongst the Jews, so that, if you make elders, you cannot escape from the perplexity of "doing it otherwise" than according to the way which scripture presents to us.<a name=378:6></a> But this is not all.<a name=378:7></a> Whilst openly repudiating this principle in 1856 at the end of one paragraph, you again lay it down at the end of the following sentence.<a name=378:8></a> In order not to make elders, etc.<a name=378:9></a>, you say it would be necessary to find in scripture a passage confining this act exclusively to the apostles and their delegates, a passage declaring that elders must be appointed by them "and not otherwise.<a name=378:10></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is you who put "and not otherwise" between inverted commas.<a name=378:11></a> To shew that if the passage does not say "and not otherwise," Count de Gasparin has a right to do it in a way different from that authorized by the word, since it is necessary to find these words to prevent your doing it as you list.<a name=378:12></a> Finally, you cannot deny that things were done thus in the two or three cases narrated in the New Testament: the elders were established exclusively by the apostles or by a delegate of the apostle.<a name=378:13></a> It is an incontestable fact; but there is not a passage to be found which says "and not otherwise.<a name=378:14></a>" Consequently you are not obliged to follow the example of the apostles; <i>you do it otherwise</i>!<a name=378:15></a> And this whilst "openly repudiating the convenient theories in virtue of which it would be lawful to do it otherwise.<a name=378:16></a>"

		In your parable you speak of the appointment of judges; if judges represent the emperor's authority by executing justice, and if their nomination be placed in the hands of a confidential person (and that is the case here) to arrogate to oneself the right of appointing a judge is to usurp the rights of a sovereign.<a name=380:3></a> The mission of Timothy and Titus was an act of authority on the apostle's part; can you not understand this, sir?<a name=380:4></a> And the exercise of the authority which had been confided to them, as well as instructions for the application of this authority, do not belong to every one.<a name=380:5></a> Do you deny the mission of these delegates of the apostle to have been an act of authority; and that what Titus and Timothy did, they did in virtue of that authority?<a name=380:6></a> Have you that authority?<a name=380:7></a> No, you have not.<a name=380:8></a> Let me once more place the expressions of the apostle before you -- "These things I write unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly.<a name=380:9></a> But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself," etc.<a name=380:10></a> These words of the apostle are only addressed to his confidential delegate; they served to direct his conduct in a task which the apostle had himself entrusted him with.<a name=380:11></a> He was not bound to shew the letter to any one.<a name=380:12></a> Even if he did so, no one was bound to act according to its contents excepting himself.<a name=380:13></a> Thanks be to God, there would be light for us all in the letter; by it also the behaviour of Timothy might be judged; but not one word of the letter is addressed to the assembly.<a name=380:14></a> Why "If I tarry"?<a name=380:15></a> What would his delay mean, if it were a question of an absolute command for all Christians and for all times?<a name=380:16></a> Would it be a command for the Christians of that time, to whom the apostle's letter was not at all addressed, and to whom Timothy was not obliged to communicate it, to whom also he probably never shewed it, since this letter was confidential?<a name=380:17></a> Is it thought that Titus shewed to the Cretans the letter which confidentially declares that the Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies; and that consequently he was to "rebuke them sharply"?<a name=380:18></a> When the apostle says to Titus, "exhort and

		rebuke with all authority," is this a command for everybody?<a name=381:1></a> It is destructive of authority to say it is.<a name=381:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it not evident that all these communications are confidential ones, made by the head of the executive power to his delegates?<a name=381:3></a> I acknowledge that, as inspired epistles, they are always valid; but this supposes that I make use of them according to the Spirit, and not that I appropriate to myself, rightly or wrongly, the things which Christ has not entrusted to me.<a name=381:4></a> Then you say, "Hence there is not only a command, an absolute command for all Christians, and for all times (how one ought to behave oneself in the house of God); but this command is declared essential as regards the Church.<a name=381:5></a>" Where, sir?<a name=381:6></a> This is pure imagination; there is not a single word nor a single thought which affects this point.<a name=381:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the main and principal point of your assertion is that there is a command, and a command for all Christians and for all times.<a name=381:8></a> I reply, that there is not a command for all Christians, since there was none for the Christians at Ephesus; the letter was not addressed to the latter, and there is not the least reason for supposing that it was communicated to them.<a name=381:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At all events this communication would have been purely voluntary, so that the words addressed to Timothy could not be a command for them -- the Christians at Ephesus.<a name=381:10></a> The reason of this is plain: the epistle was addressed to a single individual.<a name=381:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But further still, there was no command given to any one to establish elders, not even to this individual.<a name=381:12></a> Timothy did not receive any command to establish elders at Ephesus; the apostle teaches his beloved disciple what were, in the case of any one desiring to be a bishop, the qualifications which ought to characterize him; but he gives no command to Timothy to establish any.<a name=381:13></a> He was left at Ephesus for another purpose.<a name=381:14></a> It is very probable that elders had already been established there, since the apostle speaks of them and gives no command to establish any.<a name=381:15></a> Besides, the essential thing is that the apostle's letter is addressed to Timothy, and to Timothy alone, in order that he, he only, might know how he ought to behave.<a name=381:16></a> Consequently, the words of Paul were not and could not be a command for the Christians at Ephesus.<a name=381:17></a> Add to this, that the apostle wrote epistles to churches, and under circumstances in which the action of elders would be of the highest importance, and never in any case does he suggest to Christians or to any one

		amongst them, the idea of choosing or establishing elders; whilst we have <i>one</i> epistle addressed to a confidential person who, as well as Timothy, is a delegate of the apostle; and in this epistle the apostle entrusts to him the task of establishing some, and gives him rules to this end.<a name=382:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To sum up the subject.<a name=382:2></a> We have found in the account of the apostles, and in the writings which regulate this point, the commission to establish elders exclusively entrusted (if the apostles did not establish them themselves) to confidential delegates of the apostle, and where there were churches, this mission was entrusted to those persons to the exclusion of those churches; for the letters were not addressed to the latter; and when the apostles were on the spot, it is said, "they chose them.<a name=382:3></a>" In other words, the choice is attributed exclusively to the apostles and their delegates.<a name=382:4></a> Only it is not added "and not otherwise.<a name=382:5></a>" Ought we to do it "otherwise" by neglecting the authority of the word, whilst we openly repudiate "the convenient theory" that it is lawful to do otherwise?<a name=382:6></a> Is it right to acknowledge what is said in the word, while pretending to repudiate these convenient theories which allow one to do otherwise; and to do it otherwise all the time, because the words "and not otherwise" are not to be found there?<a name=382:7></a> Let us add that in the letters addressed to the churches, one does not find a single word on this point; but that there are, in more than one of them, moral directions, and they are therefore valid for all times, formally addressed to all Christians and applicable to submission to rulers, even when there might be no elders.<a name=382:8></a>

		The thesis of Mons.<a name=382:9></a> de Gasparin and his associates is, on the one hand, the denial of authority in the Church of God, if one regards this authority as derived from Christ, and existing in the persons of those whom He has sent for that purpose, namely, His apostles; and on the other, the destruction of submission founded on the moral precepts of the word addressed to all the faithful, even when there might be no authority formally appointed, and submission in which the word and grace of God exercise all their power, and have all their rights.<a name=382:10></a>

		I do not think that there is any other point in Mons.<a name=383:1></a> de Gasparin's article which is worth taking up, and I desire to be brief.<a name=383:2></a> I will only again remark that in what Mons.<a name=383:3></a> de Gasparin calls his motives, he avoids touching on the question of authority.<a name=383:4></a> He speaks of ordinary actions, such as eating and drinking, etc.<a name=383:5></a>, and of religious acts, as preaching -- actions which are common to all Christians.<a name=383:6></a> He speaks of founding new churches; he speaks of collections, etc.<a name=383:7></a> Finally, we have treated of these points.<a name=383:8></a> But it is a question of executive authority.<a name=383:9></a> On this point Mons.<a name=383:10></a> de Gasparin maintains complete silence, and instead of speaking of executive authority, he gives us the parable of a legislator.<a name=383:11></a>
