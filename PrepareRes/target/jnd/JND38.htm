		As to presenting Christ or Scripture.<a name=1:1></a> It is clear, if we love souls, we shall present Christ; so it was in the Apostles' preaching, though to Jews.<a name=1:2></a> They might start from, and reason on their Scriptures which they received.<a name=1:3></a> Scripture is what we teach from -- have our standard of truth in -- not what we teach as a subject, save where there is special occasion.<a name=1:4></a>

		How beautifully in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>the Lord's perfection, in submission to His Father's will, opens out into the large sphere of blessing into which that submission introduced Him.<a name=1:7></a> He had been rejected in Judea -- a sore trial and sorrow to Him, as to the beloved people, and had taken His way where "He must needs go," "wearied with the way," and sat, as He was, on the well.<a name=1:8></a> Here grace flows forth -- such was the effect, in His perfect love, and rejection of promises in His Person, and then His "meat was to do the will of Him that sent Him.<a name=1:9></a>" This opens, thereon, out for His heart into fields "already white for harvest.<a name=1:10></a>" And it was more than Jewish promise -- it broke forth into life eternal, and, in point of fact, does take up all that was of God in the previous ways of His grace -- reaped what they had sown.<a name=1:11></a> We have other instances of this, as <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>.<a name=1:12></a> Oh, for littleness, and lowliness of heart.<a name=1:13></a>

		It is remarkable, all through John, how the divine character of Jesus shines through, but never going out of the human, and place of receiving and obedience.<a name=2:5></a> If He and the Father are one, the Father who gives the sheep is greater than all.<a name=2:6></a> If He has power to lay down and to take again His life, He has received commandment from His Father; so everywhere.<a name=2:7></a>

		It is interesting to compare the two characters of Mary who anointed Christ's head in Bethany, and Mary Magdalene, both so attached to the Lord, yet how different as to the way of it -- one sitting at His feet, the other rescued by His power from the full dominion of demons.<a name=2:8></a> The first does not, that I am aware of, appear after that blessed proof of her instructive understanding of the position of Christ -- to the other, who had nothing in the world but Christ, He first reveals Himself after His resurrection, and makes her the messenger of His grace to the disciples; no doubt, in this, she was a figure of the Jewish Remnant.<a name=2:9></a>

		It is very simple, but important, to see that miracles do not necessarily imply the setting aside laws.<a name=2:10></a> Man produces previously unknown effects by them -- change them he cannot; surely God can.<a name=2:11></a> The only difference is that man uses the laws themselves, and force, to produce the effect -- God, the <i>fiat</i> of His will.<a name=2:12></a> God may act beyond laws, without setting aside any existing ones, because He can quicken and create.<a name=2:13></a> But the argument that there are laws, and God would not set aside His own, is perfectly without force.<a name=2:14></a>

		I have found it necessary, in dealing with others, to distinguish between "sitting in heavenly places," and "entering into the holiest.<a name=3:1></a>" They would have it, the latter did not apply -- we were always there.<a name=3:2></a> This is a mistake -- in Christ, we are sitting in heavenly places always.<a name=3:3></a> But we are, in Hebrews, always men on earth, not united to Christ as in Ephesians, but He, a Priest apart on high, and, our conscience being purged, we enter into the holiest boldly by a new and living way.<a name=3:4></a> It is another and very blessed thought.<a name=3:5></a>

		It is well to remark that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, the Spirit is sent by the Father on the intercession of the Son -- in chapter 15 by the Son from His place in glory, in the Father's name -- and in chapter 16 He is here below, Himself, in His own Person, acting.<a name=3:6></a>

		How exceedingly beautiful is the unfolding of affection in Christ in the beginning of Philippians!<a name=3:8></a> Though the Apostle, in writing to the Corinthians, could give God thanks for them, is it quite different from Philippians.<a name=3:9></a> He thanks God "always," and "for all the grace shewed to them" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:4">1 Corinthians  1:4</a>) and this is most lovely and instructive; but his heart cannot say "at every remembrance," nor can he say "with joy" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:3">Philippians  1:3</a>, 4).<a name=3:10></a> Oh!<a name=3:11></a> why are not Christians always so walking, that their affections and communion should be fresh and unhindered?<a name=3:12></a>

		PROPHECY

	<div class="paragraph">
		Prophecy is direct when the people exist.<a name=6:1></a> It is addressed to the people because God cannot but own them, cannot but speak to and reprove them till there is no remedy.<a name=6:2></a> When He has said <i>lo-ammi</i> (not My people), then what the Jews call, as to several books <i>Hagiographa</i> (holy writings) <i>khethubhim</i> (writings) begins, as in Daniel; he says nothing to the people -- there was no people to say anything to.<a name=6:3></a> He is the depository for the people of the purposes of God as to them.<a name=6:4></a> But yet more, of what would befall the Gentiles, he could not address himself, properly speaking, to the Gentiles save in the first responsibility of the head, but he reveals and interprets dreams of God about them, and receives instructions himself as to what was to come, what the Gentile beasts would be, and what would befall his people.<a name=6:5></a> In the Apocalypse I find this same difference.<a name=6:6></a> To the Churches there is a direct address.<a name=6:7></a> The Spirit of God recognises the people, however low their state, but, after the Churches, not at all -- He talks about the beasts, gives their character and doings, the persecution of the saints, and the resulting position of the saints at the end, but addresses nothing to them.<a name=6:8></a> It is as if to them also, on the earth, it was <i>lo-ammi</i>; there is no people on earth to address.<a name=6:9></a> The Church is not found there -- this is remarkable; see <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>; He testifies therein.<a name=6:10></a> "He that hath an ear is to hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches.<a name=6:11></a>"

		It is interesting also to remark, in a time of ruin and partial restoration, how we get the estimate of the ruin with full knowledge of God's ultimate manner of bringing in the final blessing, though owning clearly the present timeliness of service, and, on the other hand, the partial energy of restoration placing on the ground of responsibility, and revealing the circumstances, in connection with what was so restored, of the guilt that brought judgment, and the deliverance.<a name=6:12></a> But what I desire to remark is the two things we have to recognise -- the Daniel, and Haggai, and Zechariah position, intelligence, and service.<a name=6:13></a> The Lord make us capable.<a name=6:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1, the judgment of Judah and Jerusalem, for their iniquity in general.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 2, their establishment as the head of nations, connected with the judgment of these last.<a name=7:2></a> Israel had been forsaken for their departure from Jehovah.<a name=7:3></a> This setting aside man, in his pride and pleasure, must be, for Jehovah judges (chapter 3) His own people.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 4, they are brought very low, but then there shall be a complete blessing, the glory being in Zion fully sanctified, though by judgment -- the Lord's presence being then openly over them, as the cloud in the wilderness.<a name=7:5></a> This is complete in itself.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 Jehovah enters into an immediate pleading with His vineyard.<a name=7:7></a> Christ is distinctly brought in.<a name=7:8></a> It is Jehovah, but addressed by the Spirit as the Well-Beloved, and having done all possible for it, and only had wild grapes, as Jehovah He gives it up to the wild boar out of the forest.<a name=7:9></a> The various causes, in the ways of Israel, are stated, and the progressive judgments of God detailed.<a name=7:10></a> This takes in all Israel, and is thus more historical.<a name=7:11></a> The anger of the Lord is kindled against His people, and His hand stretched out.<a name=7:12></a> They are smitten and cut off (verse 25), but His anger is still there.<a name=7:13></a> This, I think, brings in Babylon, and the kingdoms of the beast, and darkness falls upon them.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this brings in (chapter 6) the revelation of Christ as Jehovah, and desolation rests on the Land, only the people are preserved in the Remnant or holy Seed.<a name=7:15></a> We then have Christ in connection with the house of David, but as Emmanuel -- God with His people -- the Virgin's Son.<a name=7:16></a> With this, the passing away of Israel and Syria, and the inroad of, not the Beast, but the Assyrian.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 7 this is discussed more fully.<a name=7:18></a> The Land being now Emmanuel's, He is to be the hope and trust of the Remnant.<a name=7:19></a> They were not to make conspiracies and seek help elsewhere, but make Jehovah their Sanctuary.<a name=7:20></a> Christ's first coming (Jehovah) is then brought in, His rejection, and the shutting up of good in the narrow circle of His disciples (chapter 8: 16 - 18).<a name=7:21></a> The nation are left in darkness, still it is not like what seemed less, for Messiah has come in, and, when the nation, in the last days, are in

		their darkest hour, the full revelation of Messiah in delivering judgment breaks forth.<a name=8:1></a> All is here the last scene, from Christ's rejection to the judgment when He comes.<a name=8:2></a> Chapter 6 to chapter 9: 7, is thus a parenthesis, introducing the House of David, and Messiah.<a name=8:3></a> Then the history of Israel is resumed and taken up, as a whole, from the then attacks of Rezin and Pekah (which are the occasion of all this prophecy) and carried on to Babylon, but with the still outstretched hand to the Assyrian, whose judgment is stated; chapter 10: 33.<a name=8:4></a> Christ is revealed as the Heir of the House of David -- His character, and then peace in God's holy mountain, and full blessing on the people.<a name=8:5></a> Israel is all gathered, and all wars cease.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 12, the song arises, for Jehovah has done great things, and He dwells in the midst of Zion.<a name=8:7></a> This closes the opening of the prophecy.<a name=8:8></a> The question of Babylon is then taken up.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what follows, after Babylon, the Assyrian having been introduced especially, from the end of chapter 17 (Damascus) the prophet looks out, in a remarkable manner, to the latter days (chapter 18 being the centre) though partially applicable to the present encouragement.<a name=8:10></a> There is a certain mingling of prophecies, which regard the then present time, to bring out a perfect testimony as regards the last day.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident, as indeed it long ago struck me, that the destruction of Babylon, which God had specially set up as the golden head (though many historical successors) had to come in -- yet made epoch, because the Jews were delivered, and what God had set up judged, and indeed by one who was God's servant.<a name=8:12></a> The world and idolatry were judged.<a name=8:13></a> This, chapters 13 and 14 give us, and they go to the end, though the present coming judgment is also before the prophet's eyes.<a name=8:14></a> The day of the Lord was at hand, the prophet being rapt into the time to come.<a name=8:15></a> These two chapters are, in a certain sense, complete.<a name=8:16></a> We have Babylon judged -- the heaven and earth being shaken.<a name=8:17></a> The Assyrian destroyed on the mountains, and land of Jehovah, note, and then the country cleared of its internal possessors, and "Jehovah hath founded Zion.<a name=8:18></a>"

		Chapter 16 I should judge <i>me-atz</i> (from of old) (verse 13), to mean "from ancient days" -- His original, general purpose connected (verses 4, 5), with the establishment of the throne of the Son of David.<a name=8:19></a> But now is the more immediate judgment,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose, by Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=9:1></a> "From the east," says Ezekiel, if it be the same time.<a name=9:2></a> No doubt chapter 15 begins with the impending judgment in view, but the prophetic mind passes on to God's counsels "from of old" (<i>me-atz</i>) returning then, in verse 14, to what was immediate.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 17 is proof how the object is the last days through present circumstances.<a name=9:4></a> Here the Assyrian, not Babylon, is the occasion -- the inroads of Shalmaneser, Sargon and Sennacherib, but especially Tiglath Pileser and Sennacherib.<a name=9:5></a> But Jacob is brought low at the same time; but in the Remnant there is deliverance and salvation in the lowest estate of Israel, but the Remnant looking to God.<a name=9:6></a> The nation judged for leaving Jehovah and trusting its own ways, the multitude of nations come up, but are destroyed.<a name=9:7></a> This seems clearly to introduce chapter 18, or the condition of Israel in that day -- the last days.<a name=9:8></a> Egypt comes in for present judgment, probably then by Sargon, but the prophecy evidently goes on thence to the last day.<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 20.<a name=9:10></a> This gives the invasion of Sargon.<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 21.<a name=9:12></a> My impression is that this chapter refers to present or more immediate times -- the then fall of Babylon.<a name=9:13></a> But we must remember that this was the judgment on the golden head set up by God, and the deliverance of Israel, and, in this sense, a characteristic event in its bearing.<a name=9:14></a> Seir is judged, but her judgment has also a special character -- she seems to have exulted in the destruction of Jerusalem, when taken by Nebuchadnezzar; see Obadiah and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#137:7">Psalm  137:7</a>.<a name=9:15></a> Its final judgment will be directly from the Lord, see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#34:5">Isaiah  34:5</a>, and Obadiah, where the Jews seem to take part, as well as the heathen; compare also <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84">Psalm  84</a>.<a name=9:16></a> Arabia and Kedar come under present judgment, connected with the fall of Babylon.<a name=9:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 22.<a name=9:18></a> This is a remarkable chapter.<a name=9:19></a> It would seem to be (verses 1 - 14), the state of the city in Zedekiah's time, and its capture by Nebuchadnezzar, but the end of David's responsible family, and the setting up of the Gentiles, makes this of all importance.<a name=9:20></a> Jehovah had no longer a throne upon earth.<a name=9:21></a> It is the judgment of Jerusalem by the hand of the Gentiles.<a name=9:22></a> Along with this, we have a prophecy (verse 15 to the end) which clearly in its immediate reference, speaks of personages of Hezekiah's time.<a name=9:23></a> One is deposed, and another set up, alluding, I apprehend, to the last days -- verse 25 referring clearly to "that day" -- the last days.<a name=9:24></a> The setting aside of

		Chapter 23.<a name=10:2></a> The judgment of Tyre is by Nebuchadnezzar, yet looks out beyond it, in verses 9 and 18.<a name=10:3></a> Up to this, it had long been the untouched power of commerce, and its pride.<a name=10:4></a> This was judged now, just as the natural pride of man was in Egypt.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 24.<a name=10:6></a> This chapter is a remarkable witness of this passing on from present to future, and final judgment.<a name=10:7></a> When Tyre was taken, after a long siege, by Nebuchadnezzar, the whole land was laid waste -- the Land of Canaan -- not merely Canaan, as in chapter 23: 11, but the Land.<a name=10:8></a> Hence it stretches out to a judgment on the whole earth; compare chapter 3: 1, connected with chapter 2, where the direct subject is Israel, the land, the people, and the priest, but it is connected with the judgment which casts Satan and his angels down, and judges all the kings of the earth, and Jehovah will reign in Zion -- the following chapters bringing in the full result; to the end of chapter 27, they celebrate the last days.<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 25.<a name=10:10></a> This may have had its primary fulfilment in the fall of Babylon, but it is the setting aside of human power in favour of the needy.<a name=10:11></a> The darkness of this world will then be removed, and the resurrection take place, and the rebuke of His people be removed.<a name=10:12></a> This is celebrated then in a prophetic way, in which the Lord's ways are unfolded, and His people called upon to hide themselves for a little moment.<a name=10:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 26: 19 is in contrast with verse 14.<a name=10:14></a> They have wholly perished, but Israel is renewed on the principle of resurrection, as the "sure mercies of David" are cited by the Apostle as a proof of it.<a name=10:15></a> Israel has wrought no deliverance, their restoration is power in resurrection.<a name=10:16></a> At the same time it is the time of the definite judgment of this world.<a name=10:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		In the Ephesians, though we get the divine nature and presence, without "now" or "then," holy and without blame before Him in love, yet we do not get "being born again," but "being quickened together with him," and "raised up together," putting "off the old man" and putting "on the new man.<a name=76:10></a>" We are "risen with him," "created again," and the like.<a name=76:11></a> Christ, as in the world, spoke of being "born again," a new nature, for He was then, in life, the new thing, but had not wrought redemption.<a name=76:12></a> Therefore He says, "If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things," and then goes on to the Cross.<a name=76:13></a> Hence He could speak of being "born again," but He could not say "reckon yourselves dead.<a name=76:14></a>" Now, we do -- we say, "I am crucified with Christ," "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God," reckoning Christ dead and now risen again.<a name=76:15></a> We receive life in that way, i.<a name=76:16></a>e.<a name=76:17></a>, as dead and risen again, and our place is in Christ thus risen.<a name=76:18></a> Thus we are "dead to sin," "crucified to the world," "dead to the Law.<a name=76:19></a>" To the two former, it is having done with them -- the nature

		A NEW STATE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am more deeply convinced than ever, by renewed study of Romans and other scriptures, that the view I have insisted on, as to a new nature and place in resurrection, as contrasted with flesh under law, is not only true, but is the great fundamental point on which the Apostle Paul insists as distinguishing Christianity.<a name=78:1></a> That, while surely sins are expiated and put away, "all are under sin" is what he is dwelling upon, and that wholly as in flesh, and hence death and a new state come in, through grace, in Christ.<a name=78:2></a> Besides the blessed fact of putting away sins, this is the truth of the Romans -- righteousness being established by the obedience of Christ as such.<a name=78:3></a> But this, too, in contrast with law.<a name=78:4></a> Even as to convincing power, he does not say by the law is the knowledge "of sins," for conscience told that, but the knowledge "of sin.<a name=78:5></a>" "All have sinned," is in the end of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>; so in verses 12 - 16 is offences under law specially.<a name=78:6></a> Both "sins" and "sin" in chapter 4: 7, 8; so verse 25.<a name=78:7></a> In chapter 2: 12, is actual sinning, as in chapter 3: 23.<a name=78:8></a> From chapter 6, where death is applied, "sin" is the subject.<a name=78:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The details, I have given here, serve as reference, but only show the force of the Apostle's argument.<a name=78:10></a> It is well to note them specially.<a name=78:11></a> I add, when I have said above, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, it must be remembered that that is founded on the great truth that we must not look to law, which is individual, but beyond it to the two great heads, Adam and Christ -- one of sin, the other of righteousness and life.<a name=78:12></a> Only "for that all have sinned" comes in.<a name=78:13></a> In Galatians we have only chapter 3: 22, where all are "concluded under sin," where we have help to see what the force of "righteousness" (chapter 5: 21) is, in contrast with "sin.<a name=78:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clearer and clearer to me every day that the whole gist of the Apostle's teaching, especially in Romans, is that as the law was correlative with flesh, and so, we being sinful, a ministration not of deliverance but of death, we are brought in Christ into a new condition by the Spirit of life in Him, and that, this being by death, we are free in the new man according to the law of the Spirit of life.<a name=78:15></a> That deliverance is not by the law, but by having life in the power of the Spirit in contrast with flesh.<a name=78:16></a> The law came in by the bye, to bring clearly out

		FURTHER NOTE ON ISAIAH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		More definitely as to Isaiah.<a name=83:1></a> The first four chapters are introductory.<a name=83:2></a> Jerusalem being judged, all the earth will smite it, and then the glory be over Jerusalem.<a name=83:3></a> Then in chapter 5 we have Israel judged as a responsible people in this world, according to the government of God in it, and, in the close of it, smiting within by Jehovah, and bringing on them enemies from without.<a name=83:4></a> Chapters 6 to 9: 7, take up the question of Christ as an introduced subject, as it historically was, into the midst of this history.<a name=83:5></a> He being introduced, we have first the general fact of the Assyrian over-running the whole land.<a name=83:6></a> Then Immanuel, as the seed in it -- a confederacy of nations, but the Remnant, who, associated with the Rejected Stone, wait for the Lord, delivered by the intervention of God in judgment -- and the Messiah-reign celebrated.<a name=83:7></a> In a word, though chapter 5 closes in itself, chapters 6 to 9: 7, come in parenthetically in connection with Christ, and chapter 9: 8 resumes the general history from the time of the prophecy.<a name=83:8></a> God's hand is stretched out still.<a name=83:9></a> Then the governmental dealing with the people is carried on to the Assyrian at the end, and the blessing of Jehovah in the midst of Zion.<a name=83:10></a> Chapter 13 begins Babylon, which is no part of the general history (i.<a name=83:11></a>e.<a name=83:12></a>, of Israel -- God dealing with them as His people) because Judah was in captivity there.<a name=83:13></a> The only question is, Who is the king in chapter 8: 21?<a name=83:14></a> I suppose the evil king, only so noticed in Isaiah; see chapter 30: 33.<a name=83:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, in passing, chapter 7 as an instance of how literal facts are made to assimilate to typical circumstances, though they detail literal prophetic facts.<a name=83:16></a> We may remark how this pictures the rebellious people and the world within the limits of mystic Israel, setting up Antichrist in opposition; yet, I doubt not, literal fulfilment.<a name=83:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 21 seems to me to give us Babylon in its mystical character at the end, drawn it may be, as the prophecies ever are, from present circumstances.<a name=83:18></a> I note it, because we have the prophecy as to Babylon proper in chapter 14.<a name=83:19></a> This, too, goes on to the end, but gives the actual taking of the city there far more fully; still it goes to the end in the worldly history.<a name=83:20></a>

		prophecy which is not <i>idias epiluseos</i> (of its own particular interpretation) and which are used to complete the scene, while the final reference is to the latter day.<a name=84:1></a> The Assyrian (Israel being owned) Nebuchadnezzar, his inroad, setting up the beast, and times of the Gentiles.<a name=84:2></a> His destruction which leads on to the last days, and the restoration of Jerusalem.<a name=84:3></a> Chapters 13 and 14 take up Babylon, representing there the new formed power of one Gentile beast as a whole, and goes on to Jehovah's founding Zion.<a name=84:4></a> This was anticipatively represented by Cyrus s action.<a name=84:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moab is then judged as all within the promised Land, and while the main prophecy goes on the establishment of the throne of David (Christ) making allusion to David's history, who sent his parents there, and also to the tribute paid to the kings of Israel, but also to the fugitives of Judah in the last days.<a name=84:6></a> The present fate of Moab is also announced, I suppose, from the hands of the Assyrian, but it may be from those of Nebuchadnezzar, as he hesitated whether he should first go against Jerusalem or Ammon, verse 14, but rather, I apprehend, the Assyrian.<a name=84:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Damascus and Ephraim, chapter 17, we know to have been the Assyrian, but the chapter goes on in the clearest way, to his doings in the last day.<a name=84:8></a> This introduces the general history of Israel in the last day expounded elsewhere.<a name=84:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapters 19 and 20 we have the judgment of Egypt, and its healing for full latter-day blessing.<a name=84:10></a> Here it is again the Assyrian; chapter 20: 4.<a name=84:11></a> We have then a mysterious Babylon -- the desert of the Sea -- and Edom, where we know the last judgments are to fall.<a name=84:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 21: 16 declares the then present judgment of Edom, as before of Moab.<a name=84:13></a> We have then Jerusalem itself judged, and Eliakim, he whom God shall raise up, substituted for Shebna, the false and judged holder of the key of the house of David, or who at least is over the house.<a name=84:14></a> Moab, Damascus which introduces, by the figure of Assyria, the inroad of the nations of the last day, come first -- they are the clearing of the promised Land.<a name=84:15></a> Then the condition of Israel on their return into the Land.<a name=84:16></a> Then we come to what is outside -- Egypt -- and it and the Assyrian are blessed with Israel.<a name=84:17></a> Then mystic Babylon, and Idumaea, the final judgment of Babylon and of the beast, and hostile power in Idumaea.<a name=84:18></a> Then the judgment of Jerusalem, but the house of David set up.<a name=84:19></a>

		Tyre, I apprehend, represents the world, perhaps to be accomplished in this place -- its gain and merchandise consecrated to Jehovah, though it remain the world; chapter 24.<a name=85:1></a> Though it be the land as the sphere where all is brought to an issue, yet it takes in the earth, the known formed sphere, as all judged there.<a name=85:2></a> The then coming judgments are also noticed, as chapters 20, 21, and 16: 14.<a name=85:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 24 clearly unites the thought of the Land and of the earth.<a name=85:4></a> Thus in verse 5, we have, one cannot doubt, the Jew order of things, though it may extend further.<a name=85:5></a> In verse 16 we begin a series of verses which reach to a wider earth; in verse 17 we have the expression of Revelation, "them that dwell on the earth" <i>katoikountas epi tes ges</i>.<a name=85:6></a> Then in verse 18, though the Land is still the scene of judgment, yet "the earth" goes out to the wider sense; verse 21 is clearly so.<a name=85:7></a> But it always, I think, contains the sense of those that have had to say to God, and the revelations of His ways, and rejected, oppressed, opposed, or despised, apostatised from the revelation He has made of Himself.<a name=85:8></a> There is a wider scene called the world.<a name=85:9></a> The earth is a moral thing, "When thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.<a name=85:10></a>"

		THE FATHER'S NAME
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the revelation of the Father's Name, and Sonship, Christ being on earth and afterwards, it is clear Christ did reveal the Father's Name, but there was nothing that really entered into the place of sons in the disciples.<a name=86:1></a> But more than this -- when Christ revealed the Father's Name, He Himself stood in the place of Son as a Man on earth, and it was only supposing the disciples had got hold of it, "Our Father, who art in heaven," the disciples being consciously on earth; for the highest form in which the Son made the Father known was with a Son on earth.<a name=86:2></a> In His Person it was the same thing, but His position was only of a Son on earth, with whom the disciples were associated, and, at the utmost, according to His then relationship as on earth, or they would have been above Him on earth, which is absurd.<a name=86:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now the Son is gone, as Man, into the place of Sonship in glory in the Father's house -- the glory He had with Him as Son before the world was -- yet as Man there, as Son.<a name=86:4></a> With this we now are associated, His Father and our Father, His God and our God, and we are associated with Him as sons in heavenly places, according to the glory He had with the Father before the world was.<a name=86:5></a> This again connects the eternal purpose and heavenly glory.<a name=86:6></a> But now my object is to compare it with the earthly state of Sonship -- relation, which was of man on the earth, as such, with the Father in heaven (as in the Lord's prayer), is, as risen into the new condition into glory, entered, according to full purpose (the perfect thoughts of God in the heavenly relationship), into the Father's house as sons, according to immediate relationship with the divine nature.<a name=86:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This connects itself too with another point, the nature of atonement work, already alluded to elsewhere.<a name=86:8></a> We were under responsibility as men -- take the Law as a measure.<a name=86:9></a> Christ dies for us, bears our sins, and meets that responsibility for us.<a name=86:10></a> But the work of the Cross did more.<a name=86:11></a> He glorified God there.<a name=86:12></a> Hence our portion is with God according to His own nature, in our new one.<a name=86:13></a> One was represented by the brazen altar, the other by the blood on the mercy-seat.<a name=86:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say the Father's Name is given up in the former sense, in the note above -- the walk on earth, and we cared for by a Holy Father, as so walking.<a name=86:15></a> But it now carries us further -- we enter as sons into the Father's house where Christ is entered.<a name=86:16></a>

		THE THRONE OF GRACE

	<div class="paragraph">
		Note the expression "Throne of Grace," <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:16">Hebrews  4:16</a>.<a name=88:1></a> "Throne" is connected with government, and the principles and character of Him who governs.<a name=88:2></a> God deals in grace, and governs in grace, but He does so according to His own nature and character -- He governs.<a name=88:3></a> Israel, on Moses' intercession, was dealt with in grace, but that was not exactly a throne, and Israel was replaced under law.<a name=88:4></a> Here God governs a people who walk in this world, but, on the principles of grace, we come boldly to a throne of grace, to obtain mercy and seek grace to help in time of need.<a name=88:5></a> The Father takes a positive interest, as from his own heart, in the children, but an "Advocate with the Father" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2">1 John  2</a>) is not simply "their Father" -- that would not do -- it is "the Father" "of whom ye say he is your God.<a name=88:6></a>" The Son has revealed God, necessarily thus as Son.<a name=88:7></a> He Himself loves us because we have loved Christ, but it is a revelation of God the Father by the Son -- not in the way of a relationship with us, though that be true.<a name=88:8></a> But it is a much fuller revelation of God, and in a new way.<a name=88:9></a> A child has not an advocate exactly with his father, but "if any one sin, we have an advocate with the Father.<a name=88:10></a>" We have communion with the Father and with the Son, but it is with God who is Light.<a name=88:11></a> On sinning and getting out of communion, the nature of the revelation is not changed to put me under Law and Jehovah, but restoration is needed according to its nature.<a name=88:12></a>

		Note, further, that in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>, we have, at the end, three great and important principles for going through the wilderness -- the Word, the Priesthood, and the Throne.<a name=88:14></a> This is very instructive.<a name=88:15></a> The Word searches the thoughts and intents of the heart -- all that is working in the mind (desire) and will -- as the eye of God.<a name=88:16></a> The Priesthood sustains, in grace, in every infirmity and in difficulty and trial.<a name=88:17></a> The Throne is perfect grace, but it is a Throne -- absolute sovereign power, positive government though in grace, and according to the character and majesty of Him who sits there.<a name=88:18></a> We go there "boldly," for all is grace, and the great High Priest is for us with God.<a name=88:19></a>

		But it appears to me that there is a point here of new light breaking in -- the Gog, the Assyrian, becomes the representative of power over Babylon, when Antichrist is put out, and, though put out by God's mighty ones, he will think it is all to his dominion; see Joel, and the account of the Assyrian in Isaiah.<a name=91:2></a> Then, having come against the Jews, he will say, "Where is now their God," setting himself as "the man of the earth" against "the God of the earth," as the other against Antichrist -- for the earth is his sphere, power not infidelity and antichristianism, which is the distinctive point of the former.<a name=91:3></a> But Antichrist is in fact the inferior power.<a name=91:4></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#14:12">Isaiah  14:12</a>, clearly, I think, applies to him, Antichrist, but the passage which I will go into here, seems to embrace a larger scope, and to open out this very position of the last king, as finding his destruction in having all drowned in his person, except the head who shall then see that their power is gone, "none shut up nor left.<a name=91:5></a>"

		We have observed, elsewhere, the distinctness of character in Antichrist and the king of Babylon in this point of view, i.<a name=91:6></a>e.<a name=91:7></a>, the virtual headship of confusion, on the destruction of Antichrist, but who holds it in power (for in this God will vindicate it as between them) but who, then turning that power against God, as having all, touches not them, the Remnant but the apple of His eye.<a name=91:8></a> "The king of Babylon" is not, in my opinion, used of Antichrist, which is a most important point, and opens out the whole question, and reflects light on many others; compare the connection in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#14:22">Isaiah  14:22</a>, 24, 25.<a name=91:9></a> Verse 13 shows the other's assumed dominion in his origin.<a name=91:10></a> He is not power but popular, the head "of" not "over," in his principles, as Buonaparte said, "I am the representative of the people"; consider also verse 29, <i>et seq</i>.<a name=91:11></a> Then <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#48:2">Psalm  48:2</a>, determines, I think, verse 13, and thus the whole matter is made plain.<a name=91:12></a> We have also, hence, a very definite understanding of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#16">Revelation  16</a>and 17 and the time of chapter 18: 21, confirming generally the view heretofore taken, the details not being there unfolded; see note on the passage now.<a name=91:13></a>

		As regards the shaking of the heavens this age (<i>aion houtos</i>) properly began at Sinai.<a name=154:1></a> It was true, Noah began power in the earth, in restraining of evil on the earth, from God, but that was the abstract principle by itself.<a name=154:2></a> Power might be transferred to Nebuchadnezzar, here below on earth, when raised up to the dominion of the children of men, wheresoever they dwell, on the departure of the glory from Jerusalem; so the 'times of the Gentiles,' and Abraham called out on the ascription of that power by man's heart (given to Noah) to devils as its source -- so in <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24">Joshua  24</a>and Paul, "They offer to devils and not to God" -- a condition speedily proved to be in force and vigour, in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon, when given to Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=154:3></a> But when Moses was king in Jeshurun, the upright, the Lord came from Mount Sinai, and from His right hand went a fiery law for them, when He spake from earth unto them, and they sat down at His feet, then, through the disposition of angels, receiving the law.<a name=154:4></a>

		MORALITY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Morality is in connection with the relationships which God has formed in connection with the first Adam.<a name=158:1></a> These relationships God has fully sanctioned, for He formed them, sanctioned, I mean, in Christianity.<a name=158:2></a> But Christianity itself is the introduction of a new life, a new power, and of man, thereby, into a new creation entirely outside of all these relationships.<a name=158:3></a> This power may cause me to live out of the old creation and its relationships -- know no man after the flesh -- but sanctions them all as of God; so Paul, for example.<a name=158:4></a> By bringing in divine power and light, it has given a moral force to these old obligations, and hence a blessing to the world.<a name=158:5></a> But then the maintenance of the old relationships, however happy, is no proof whatever of an introduction into the power of the new.<a name=158:6></a> Husband, wife, parent, child, brother, sister are all relationships of the first creation.<a name=158:7></a> The order of the world morally depends on them, but one may walk in them all, and not belong to the new creation.<a name=158:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other duties which, though of the old creation, only belong to it as fallen, and as far as we know, and I think connected with man's becoming like God, but in evil.<a name=158:9></a> Property, and the relationship of master and servant -- it is evident that this relates to a fallen state in us historically, but it seems to me to hang on what is divine, though abused by man.<a name=158:10></a> In the first place, the earth was given to the children of men, i.<a name=158:11></a>e.<a name=158:12></a> subjected to them -- their title depending on God.<a name=158:13></a> But when man had separated himself from God, his will became a separate and wilful centre -- he referred all to self, even the whole earth to himself if he could.<a name=158:14></a> This was restricted by government, and thus property exists.<a name=158:15></a> Hence the condition of property is according to the law of each country's government, and, where the government is absolute, is absolutely to the government.<a name=158:16></a> Theoretically so even in feudal law.<a name=158:17></a> It depends on the existence of government, or is, otherwise, mere appropriating will or force.<a name=158:18></a> Hence morality as to <i>mens</i> and <i>thoro</i> differs, as to its terms, not its principle, in each country.<a name=158:19></a> The rights of property are limited according to the laws of each country, not so the relationships God created, though laws may interfere with them as to master and servant, i.<a name=158:20></a>e.<a name=158:21></a>, the relationships setting aside engagement, contract between two, etc.<a name=158:22></a>

		DANIEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The way in which God is spoken of in Daniel is remarkable, and I note it here.<a name=159:1></a> His early first relationship, before the evil is manifested, is "the God of heaven," both to his companions and to the king.<a name=159:2></a> This was as natural as it is instructive.<a name=159:3></a> God was "the God of the earth" at Jerusalem.<a name=159:4></a> "The God of heaven" had given Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom.<a name=159:5></a> Chapter 3 is the God of the faithful Remnant.<a name=159:6></a> In judgment He is the Most High; chapter 4.<a name=159:7></a> This is found again in chapter 7: 25.<a name=159:8></a> With Belshazzar He is merely God as God.<a name=159:9></a> In chapter 6 He is again with the Remnant; only for Darius, He is "the Living God.<a name=159:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In none of the visions of Daniel is God introduced in any way whatever, which is remarkable -- Messiah is.<a name=159:11></a> "Ancient of days" stands apart, identifying the supreme Jehovah with Him that comes, verse 22, compare <a href="../bible/Apocalypse.htm#1:11">Apocalypse  1:11</a> - 16 (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:11">Revelation  1:11</a> - 16).<a name=159:12></a> In the prayer of chapter 9, Daniel's faith rises to the true relationship of God with Israel, and we get the name "Jehovah" -- so good is confession!<a name=159:13></a> And all the chapter proceeds on, and gives the fruits of this relationship at the close, though with the judgment connected with it.<a name=159:14></a> But all is connected with promise, blessing, and Jehovah's relationship with His people, though judgment and sorrow may be there.<a name=159:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be thought that chapter 7 introduces God in a vision of Daniel, but it is only so far as to show the secret source from which all judgment flows.<a name=159:16></a> The judgment itself is spoken of generally.<a name=159:17></a> "Most High" is only spoken of as characterising the blasphemy.<a name=159:18></a> Though faith owns Him, in chapter 9, as Jehovah, yet there is no relationship with Israel, nor can be.<a name=159:19></a> The "God of heaven" characterises Him, generically, all through the Book.<a name=159:20></a> There is, at most, the mysterious intimation of a time when the Ancient of days will sit in heaven, and then that He will come.<a name=159:21></a> But when He comes, we know it is as "Son of Man.<a name=159:22></a>" In fact we know that it is Christ's coming which destroys the beast; Apocalypse 19 (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19">Revelation  19</a>).<a name=159:23></a> The setting of the thrones -- assumption of power in judgment -- is only an epoch in the vision of the beasts.<a name=159:24></a> The third vision is of the new kingdom -- the Son of Man, verse 13.<a name=159:25></a>

		The first chapter, then, concerns the Land (and takes in all the desolators) calls for a fast as to this, from "the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land.<a name=197:12></a>" The second chapter speaks of that which the Lord had chosen for Himself in it, above all the dwellings of Jacob.<a name=197:13></a> "Blow ye the trumpet in Zion.<a name=197:14></a>" In bringing in this, "the day of the Lord" accordingly appears more specifically in the cry resulting from the other, chapter 1: 15 - 20.<a name=197:15></a> Then the prophetic warning of "the day," to Zion, now involved with the inhabitants of the Land.<a name=197:16></a> It is on the people of the Jews from the Lord.<a name=197:17></a> This was the alarm -- they were to plunder the city, passing through it all like a thief.<a name=197:18></a> Then the trumpet of summons, or the call to repentance.<a name=197:19></a> When this takes place, appealing to Him against the heathen, His instrument, His rod (of indignation) but now saying in their folly 'where is their God,' then will Jehovah be jealous for His Land, and pity His people, and turn back the Northern army.<a name=197:20></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>we have three very important points: man resisting the Holy Ghost -- man full of the Holy Ghost (being redeemed and washed in the Lamb's blood) -- and religion, established on earth in connection with Creation, entirely set aside as belonging to the first Creation, into which sin and disobedience had entered.<a name=231:2></a> This gave the whole character of man established in relationship with God.<a name=231:3></a> The earlier history of resisting the Spirit is given distinctly in connection with Israel -- Joseph, Moses.<a name=231:4></a> But here it was resisting God, when they had failed under Law, and the Spirit worked in testimony, and that in sovereign grace, proposing, on their repentance, Christ's return when already rejected.<a name=231:5></a> On the other hand, we have heaven opened, the Holy Ghost in the believer making him look steadily in (note, it is not heaven opened to man, looking down on the Man of delights, <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>, but man filled with the Holy Ghost, in virtue of redemption, looking into heaven on the Son of Man there) testifying to the Son of Man being at God's right hand.<a name=231:6></a> This was the great testimony.<a name=231:7></a> This brings the Cross, and complete conformity to Jesus.<a name=231:8></a> But the resisting the Spirit, the setting aside all carnal ordinances, all power on earth, and then, in contrast, the saint being filled with the Spirit and looking into heaven, and all association of God, religiously, with the earth being set aside is very remarkable.<a name=231:9></a>

		Note further, in the latter part of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22">Luke  22</a>, when all is brought to a point, and Christ, victorious over Satan, as he tempted the first Adam by will, rejected as delivering man down here, the things concerning Him have an end.<a name=231:10></a> So that, brought to the point of death, unless He gave up His work, death, as having the character of judgment and wrath, was in Satan's hand as power, as in God's in righteousness against the sinner.<a name=231:11></a> We have this great crisis brought out in three ways -- flesh incapable of it, when there was the best intention, for man was there, Satan in malice and power, and God in righteousness.<a name=231:12></a> Satan sifts and man fails, cannot go through.<a name=231:13></a> If he does not fly off in despair, and still hold on to God, whatever his failure, it is God's grace, and Christ's intercession.<a name=231:14></a> Man is worthlessness

	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, we have Christ going through this same crisis, and the whole fulness -- blessed be God!<a name=232:4></a> -- of Satan's power in this way seeking to drive His soul back from accomplishing this terrible work in obedience.<a name=232:5></a> He is perfect through it.<a name=232:6></a> Being in the conflict, He is only nearer to God.<a name=232:7></a> Here we have, not the flesh breaking down at the first shadow of it passing on the soul, but grace going through it in perfect obedience.<a name=232:8></a> All entered into with God -- all done when man came -- it was then but the occasion of obedience.<a name=232:9></a>

		Thirdly, we have the efficacy of the work itself in the passage of the thief into Paradise -- not the kingdom, we are all beyond that so that we leave failing flesh, when Satan is out with the power of death in his hand.<a name=232:10></a> Perfect submission and obedience, so that Satan is wholly overcome, and his power in this respect annulled for faith, and the work of going under judgment and wrath so perfectly performed for the sinner, that he goes into Paradise with Jesus immediately.<a name=232:11></a> They are the three phases of man in connection with death and the Cross.<a name=232:12></a> Another place of man is his active and wilful connection with Satan -- in the lowest points a Judas -- but of this I have spoken elsewhere, and do not touch here.<a name=232:13></a> It is embraced in the words, 'Your hour and the power of darkness.<a name=232:14></a>'

		The reason why we are not said to be 'Love,' which God is, but are said to be 'Light,' which He is, is evident.<a name=233:1></a> Love is sovereign goodness -- a source towards others.<a name=233:2></a> God is it, no doubt, but as regards others it is sovereign, and has an object in its exercise, and, outside the Trinity, for the Father loveth the Son, it exists when active on objects which must be inadequate as motive, though thereby glorifying sovereign goodness, and showing it is divine.<a name=233:3></a> But purity is a nature perfectly pure, and manifesting this all around it, and we can be purity -- it is a subjective state -- it is the state and character of a nature.<a name=233:4></a> There is nothing of a source, a <i>fons</i> of blessing in it, which we cannot be, though we may walk in love because we are given to be streams where the source is.<a name=233:5></a> I do not know if I have sufficiently noticed this, though I have in a measure.<a name=233:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have noticed the distinction between the first Epistle of Peter, that to the Ephesians and that to the Colossians, that the first sets the Christian, on the ground of the redemption and resurrection of Christ, as a stranger and pilgrim in the desert towards the inheritance laid up in heaven, which is a hope.<a name=262:1></a> The Ephesians place him seated in heaven, in his Head, with whom he is risen; the hope is the whole accomplishment of the purpose of God, made known to the Church, sealed for it by the Holy Ghost.<a name=262:2></a> Colossians presents heaven as a hope, but they were slipping away from the Head, but then the Apostle insists that they were risen again with Him, and their life hid there.<a name=262:3></a> He brings them back on the ground of their resurrection with Him.<a name=262:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Peter, it is always His appearing, His manifestation (as he had seen Him go) a salvation ready to be revealed.<a name=262:5></a> In Ephesians we have it not, because the saints are viewed in heaven, and united with Him, waiting the inheritance.<a name=262:6></a> In Colossians, being risen, His appearing is recalled, but we appear with Him with whom our life has been hidden.<a name=262:7></a> This is clear, but now I ask -- Is not the position of the enemy of souls also presented accordingly?<a name=262:8></a> In Peter he goes about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour -- evidently in persecutions, 'the same afflictions.<a name=262:9></a>'

		In Colossians the Lord has triumphed over principalities and powers on the Cross, making a show of them openly, and is now raised from the dead.<a name=262:10></a> It is the power in which He has taken us up in life hid with Him in God.<a name=262:11></a> Triumph is what we have, that life being needed for the position in which the saints are put.<a name=262:12></a>

		As regards the outward conflict with Satan, remark that we contend with spiritual wickedness in heavenly places where all passes, in Ephesians, and we are called upon, 'having done all, to stand.<a name=263:3></a>' We are in possession of our place, and our business is to hold good, and hence, being spiritual, the arms of God are what are called for.<a name=263:4></a> The proper service in power is 'building up' according to the stature of the Head, the fulness revealed in the Epistle.<a name=263:5></a> Hence it is not gaining ground on Satan as if he was in possession, for we are supposed there above, and the object is to grow up to the fulness.<a name=263:6></a> Doubtless we have to gain ground here, but it is positive ground in good that belongs to us without question.<a name=263:7></a> The object of the enemy is to turn us away from this by whatever sleight and ruse.<a name=263:8></a> Hence in conflict the matter is to stand against the wiles, and having done all to stand.<a name=263:9></a> Then we go on with our own proper Holy Ghost work in building up in and to the Head.<a name=263:10></a>

		REMARKS ON "THE ORIGIN OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer has scraped together a good deal of reading, but he has left out God and the truth altogether.<a name=264:1></a> He looks for no origin of man or his state, and takes him as a capable wild man of the woods, to be formed, yet his present state as the key to everything normal, and what he is subjectively the measure of what is true objectively.<a name=264:2></a> It is an excessively superficial book -- an amiable, but unserious, shallow pluming itself on free thinking, but would bring in Christianity, as man would have it, by it.<a name=264:3></a> He thinks of everything and knows nothing, and likes giving his thoughts because he thinks well of them.<a name=264:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If ever leaving out God was proved to lead to superficiality and folly, it is this book.<a name=264:5></a> A few true ideas, but which come to nothing because all root is wanting.<a name=264:6></a> I dare say the man thinks he is right, but it is a few secondary causes strung, most frequently falsely, to general reading, and all that is important left out or forgotten.<a name=264:7></a> Not even conscience is admitted, nor man, morally, more than God.<a name=264:8></a> People forget, too, that, in forming a system of man, they are denying another; God has given one.<a name=264:9></a> But I think it a useful book in this, that it shows the perfect moral mud and folly into which the exclusion of God throws the mind.<a name=264:10></a> The passage, through the powers of Nature to Polytheism, is, I believe, just and well enough, but though as Hesiod and Homer may have elaborated, I do not doubt priests concocted it, not a moment.<a name=264:11></a> Who made these 'synonyms'?<a name=264:12></a> 'The sun a warrior clad in golden panoply, the moon a queen, the stars armies of heroes or spirits'?<a name=264:13></a> Who were consulted about everything?<a name=264:14></a> In Egypt and India one cannot hesitate.<a name=264:15></a> If he left out God before, he leaves out the Devil before, and the progress from one God and mere powers of nature to Polytheism is clear in all religions indeed but in the Vedas, Myths and Puranas.<a name=264:16></a> But there was an unknown God in all, behind the actual worship.<a name=264:17></a> On the star-worship, he is very weak, and deifying heroes and ancestors.<a name=264:18></a> Doubtless there is truth in it, but the verbal source is poor.<a name=264:19></a> The whole has little depth.<a name=264:20></a> The end is very superficial.<a name=264:21></a> All the Indian gods are mortal, and the converse of his statement

		REMARKS ON "THE DOCTRINE OF INSPIRATION"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is perfectly right practically to say, the Bible is infallible, but, strictly, revealed truth cannot be infallible; it is simply, perfectly true.<a name=271:1></a> A person is fallible or infallible -- God alone is so -- He, while He acts in, uses a man, is, and makes the man while so exclusively using him, <i>de facto</i> infallible.<a name=271:2></a> But the man is not so.<a name=271:3></a> The question is not if Mark or Luke are infallible, but whether what is written be "given by inspiration of God" (<i>theopneustos</i>) -- a revelation given of God, so that I can rely on it as given of, coming from Him.<a name=271:4></a>

		THE TITLES IN THE EPISTLES

		There are but Paul and Peter who name their apostleship at the beginning of their Epistles; and Paul, in supposing the Epistle to the Hebrews to be his, which I do not doubt, does not call himself so there.<a name=280:1></a> This title is not found in Philippians 1 and 2 Thessalonians, or Philemon.<a name=280:2></a> The character of these Epistles is much more personally fraternal.<a name=280:3></a> (He associates also others, but this is not by itself an absolute reason.<a name=280:4></a>) But these facts show the title is assumed with a definite purpose and meaning -- Paul and Barnabas, and, in result, Paul having mission to the Gentiles, and Peter to the Jews, assume their title when in special exercise of their mission.<a name=280:5></a> The others write according to the wisdom and gift of God.<a name=280:6></a> This is the case with Paul in the Hebrews, for he had not the place of Apostle with them, and the kind of intercourse with the Thessalonians and Philemon, instead of claiming such a title, rendered it unsuited to the occasion.<a name=280:7></a> It was not authoritative revelations, or mandates, or the assumption of this place, as tide and ground of intercourse, but brotherly occasions of tender care or thankful communication.<a name=280:8></a> Though the truth he might announce might be the same, and its authority equal, in the cases in which it is used its proper bearing is evident.<a name=280:9></a>

		The tendency here was to bind up the law among His disciples whom He begins to call to Himself, and, the testimony to the kingdom being fully given, so as to spread His renown all around, He begins to bind up the testimony.<a name=285:3></a> But then I find in the sermon on the Mount, not only in the Beatitudes, blessing or perfection reflected and showing forth in the Person of Christ here below, but, in principles as to the whole sermon, Himself in the two great features noticed heretofore -- the perfection of the Law written for He was born under it, and the perfection of His Father shown forth in Him -- as He tells us that hatred was murder, and to be perfect as our Father was perfect.<a name=285:4></a> Thus the testimony given to His disciples, but before all, of the principles of the kingdom, left from the outset, on its true moral ground, its rejection or reception, and, at the same time, was full instruction to His disciples, as receiving the kingdom, and that in its patience.<a name=285:5></a> And note here how the character of the service of the testimony of the kingdom may run on, and inlock itself into a further testimony, and yet not be it, though there may be a mediate ground.<a name=285:6></a> The same remark applies to chapters 10 and 24.<a name=285:7></a> Here it is seen thus.<a name=285:8></a>

		The sermon supposes the reception, the possibility of the reception of the kingdom.<a name=285:9></a> The Adversary was likewise still in the way, and addresses Himself to the disciples, and supposes the case of the reception by some, and of its rejection by the mass, and therefore the suffering of the faithful for righteousness sake, and for love of Him.<a name=285:10></a> He presents, consequently, without going out of the testimony of the kingdom, the case of persons whose reward would be great in the heavens, not only of the faithful who should inherit the earth.<a name=285:11></a> He unites them, consequently, together as in one single class.<a name=285:12></a> Now those who suffered thus in fact would begin by the testimony, but they were the commencement of the Church, yet still at the beginning in connection with Israel, compare <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>, the last

		THE PRAYERS IN @EPHESIANS 1 AND 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prayer in chapter 1 is, as the counsels and plans of God are unfolded towards us and about Christ as One He is glorifying, and so our inheritance with Him, for the working of God towards us in enlightening us as to our place in these counsels, and the power that brings us into it far above every name and near and like Himself.<a name=305:1></a> Wondrous thoughts of God!<a name=305:2></a> But Christ Himself (and that is our blessing) is looked at as a Man dead, and we dead in sin, and God raises Him, and us in Him, and sets us all in the highest place of blessing and glory -- but it is man dealt with.<a name=305:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prayer of chapter 3 is relationship -- the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=305:4></a> And he sees already every family brought under this Name, and looks for another thing, the capacity to be at the centre as our portion -- that God might grant, according to the riches of His glory developed in all this, to be inwardly strengthened with might by His Spirit.<a name=305:5></a> We are not heirs here, but are divinely made competent inwardly to be at the centre, and seize it all around.<a name=305:6></a> And thus it is Christ (He is the Centre of all) to dwell in our hearts by faith -- known there, not merely on our lips, but faith realising Himself in the heart.<a name=305:7></a> Now this puts us in the divine centre in its very nature.<a name=305:8></a> We are rooted and grounded in love, but that is what God is.<a name=305:9></a> So there is a moral capacity to apprehend all that in which He displays Himself; for, dwelling in Him, we can comprehend what He displays, and "he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.<a name=305:10></a>" Thus the soul can look out in every direction, and all directions, into the display of divine glory.<a name=305:11></a> Still this, in itself, would be dazzling, and for the heart cold in a certain sense -- the heart though adoringly admiring, would want an intimate object; and here consequently the Spirit, by the Apostle, returns to Christ again, and to "know the love of Christ" -- One we know in the depths of the intimacy of His love, yet it passes knowledge for it is divine, and thus we are filled to the measure of the fulness of God.<a name=305:12></a> So the "Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb was the Light thereof.<a name=305:13></a>" We are brought into the whole sphere thus of the divine glory by Christ, dwelling in our hearts by faith, being our Strength and Capacity through the Spirit; but this puts us at its centre in love, and that love in the endeared intimacy of Christ, yet
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=306>[Page 306]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in the fulness of divine nature, for the love in which we are, and know, passes knowledge.<a name=306:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence "Glory to him" is looked for in the Church in all ages, according to His power that works in us.<a name=306:2></a> That is the practical result; what a place it puts us in as to this!<a name=306:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the wonderful prayer of chapter 3, I think I see more order than heretofore.<a name=306:4></a> Under the name of "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," every class of being, "every family in heaven and earth" comes.<a name=306:5></a> It is not our knowledge, as in chapter 1, of our place as to calling and inheritance, and the power that brings us into it as Christ from death to the throne of God -- wondrous translation!<a name=306:6></a> -- but the whole scene of the display of God's glory under that Name, and Christ the central point; it is under His Father that they hold their place.<a name=306:7></a> Then the prayer demands that, according to the riches of His glory, of all the display of Himself as such in this universal sphere, we may be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man to be able to seize it all, but it is by His dwelling in our hearts by faith, who, while loving the saints perfectly, is the Centre of all this glory.<a name=306:8></a> Having Christ, who fills all the glory, thus in our hearts, we are capable of reaching out to all this, and this according to that love of which He is the expression and power to us, and He thus dwelling in us we are rooted and grounded in it.<a name=306:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus filled with that which is really God as to nature, and the wisdom of God as to understanding, we comprehend with all saints -- for, having Christ in our hearts, it is impossible to be separated from them -- the whole sphere and display of God's glory, breadth, length, depth, height, and not only so, but, Christ dwelling in us, we know that love which passes knowledge, but, thus apprehending the whole sphere and display of His glory, and the love of Christ which passes knowledge, we are led up to that out of which this flows, and of which this is the display.<a name=306:10></a> We are filled into (<i>eis</i>) -- to this completeness -- all the fulness of God.<a name=306:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we get the internal competency, verses 16, 17 -- the intermediate sphere and display, verse 18, and beginning of 19 -- leading us to the whole fulness of God in itself.<a name=306:12></a> The Apostle then desires that, according to His power that works in us, this same strength, the effect may be produced -- Glory to Him in the Church throughout all ages.<a name=306:13></a>

		The preceding remarks are connected with the unsearchable riches of Christ, but further, as to the bearing of parenthesis, i.<a name=307:1></a>e.<a name=307:2></a>, chapter 3: 2 - 21.<a name=307:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note too in chapter 3, verse 18 resumes morally what precedes.<a name=307:4></a> It is not 'That ye being rooted and grounded may,' but "being rooted and grounded in love, that ye may.<a name=307:5></a>" It is a nominative absolute, and, I think, gives the Apostle's consciousness of what the effect in a soul of what precedes in verses 16, 17, or what the practical reality of such a strengthening and dwelling is.<a name=307:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection between the prayer in this chapter and the mystery is striking.<a name=307:7></a> God has established Christ as Centre and Head over all things, both in heaven and earth, but the Church is in immediate connection with Him.<a name=307:8></a> Being strengthened in might by His Spirit, Christ dwells in our hearts by faith.<a name=307:9></a> Thus the Centre, as to Spiritual understanding, is in our hearts that we may comprehend.<a name=307:10></a> But the centre of all, as to what characterises the source of the whole plan, is Love -- this has made it -- that is, God Himself.<a name=307:11></a> And we, Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith, are rooted and grounded in love, and thus have the source, the motive centre which makes capable of comprehending -- Christ being the revealed Centre as to the counsel, while bringing as He alone does, the love, for He is its manifestation and power.<a name=307:12></a> Then, if it is Christ's love, God's love, I must associate all saints, for that is the first circle which that love forms, and itself thinks of Having got this, which is intimate and immediate, I go out into the whole extent of that in which the God of love glorifies Himself -- breadth, length, depth, height.<a name=307:13></a> But while this gives me the sphere, my soul wants to find the centre for itself, something more intimate, that is a stay for the soul in this vast scene -- that is, it knows the love of Christ, One well known, tender, familiar, who serves, One who is ours in grace.<a name=307:14></a> Yet it is infinite, passes knowledge.<a name=307:15></a> Thus in counsels, nature, and the perfect revelation of love, we are filled up to the fulness of God.<a name=307:16></a> Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith, the actual Centre of all, thus introduces us, in understanding and communion, into all.<a name=307:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, this is attributed to the One God and Father of all, in an abstract way, in chapter 4: 6, and to Christ in the power of redemption, verses 9, 10.<a name=307:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The exhortations of chapter 4 are more especially founded

	<div class="paragraph">
		on the end of chapter 2 -- naturally so, as that is the responsible side of the Church, though not excluding the other character, as verse 4 shows, and also from verse 7 on.<a name=308:1></a> Chapter 3 comes in, not only as enlargement of the truth stated in its various bearings, but it brings the other, and more Colossian side of the mystery, in -- Christ dwelling in the heart by faith -- so that we are able to take it all in, look out at it as from a centre.<a name=308:2></a> Hence it looks by this power to the glorifying of God in the Church by this; that naturally brings the Apostle back to the exhortation to make it good now.<a name=308:3></a> In chapter 2: 21, 22, we have the Church in the place in which it is to glorify; in chapter 3: 20, 21, we have the power in which they fill this place, and then comes exhortation.<a name=308:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, too, how in chapter 4: 15, the power of that in which Christ is said to have come is looked to be realised by the saint.<a name=308:5></a> "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ"; here, "speaking the truth in love" (<i>aletheuontes en agape</i>).<a name=308:6></a> And this confirms the connection of "in the truth," and "in truth," as in John.<a name=308:7></a> There is no truth in the inward parts but by the Truth and Word of God, which searches the thoughts and intents of the heart, in Christ's, the Truth's, being there.<a name=308:8></a> "Hence too the truth as it is in Jesus," putting off the old man, and putting on the new, renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created us.<a name=308:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, further, in chapter 4, we have the two parts of verse 12, in verses 13 to 16.<a name=308:10></a> The first in verses 13 - 15; the last in verse 16.<a name=308:11></a> Nor is the middle part wanting, for the supply of the joints is the work of the ministry, and this connection is put in its arrangement; verses 13 - 15 is the main point governed by <i>eis</i>, and the ministry is connected with the edifying of the Body by <i>pros</i>, and so in verse 16.<a name=308:12></a> And this shows us what the work of the ministry is.<a name=308:13></a> There are permanent gifts used in service in a definite way, but there is a ministry by the supply of every joint.<a name=308:14></a> The Body edifies itself by the effectual working in the measure of every part.<a name=308:15></a> This makes permanent ministers, and the supply by every joint for the edifying of Body very clear, as to the place it holds.<a name=308:16></a> "He ascended up and gave gifts.<a name=308:17></a>" Here are individuals given a place -- some of them antecedent to the formation of the Body -- all of them derived directly from Christ, and dependent on Him.<a name=308:18></a> But besides, and through this, and with it, there is a Body which, in all its parts, by the operation of the Spirit in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		each part, edifies itself.<a name=309:1></a> A pastor may come in in his place in this ministry, still he has a direct responsible service to Christ.<a name=309:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The three measures and principles of good in chapter 4 are the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, the new man created after God, and not grieving the Spirit.<a name=309:3></a> Then, as a general and wondrous rule, blessed as it is wondrous, "Be ye imitators of God as dear children.<a name=309:4></a>" In this last, we have the most perfect expression of a divine walk in the world -- following God in the affections of dear children -- walking in love.<a name=309:5></a> That is the perfect, divine principle, love also to others; but, next, giving Himself, that is absolute and perfect -- the giving up, not much by self, but self itself.<a name=309:6></a> Then, though there were love, perfect love to others, yet God was Himself objectively before the eyes, an offering and a sacrifice to God, to be a sweet smelling savour to Him.<a name=309:7></a> So with the incense, though others might smell the sweet odour, yet all was burned to God.<a name=309:8></a> This was the perfectness of Christ.<a name=309:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were not to grieve the Spirit; that referred to subjective state and walk.<a name=309:10></a> Then, when they have had their objective measure of love and light, they are to be filled with it.<a name=309:11></a> But then in this we get the sobriety, and the 'beside ourselves.<a name=309:12></a>' Verses 15 - 17, it is sober; verses 18, 19, besides oneself, so to say.<a name=309:13></a> Will is gone, and honouring God's goodness, he can give thanks always for all things.<a name=309:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, we are light -- that is one divine name -- partakers of the divine nature.<a name=309:15></a> But it is never said we are love, because that is supreme goodness in its essential nature; but we love because we are partakers of it.<a name=309:16></a> Light, though intrinsically pure, shines.<a name=309:17></a> Love, save as the Father loves the Son, does not necessarily go out of itself, and indeed there it really does not.<a name=309:18></a> It delights in itself, when it exercises itself out of itself.<a name=309:19></a> It is sovereign, and hence we cannot be said to be it.<a name=309:20></a> But light always manifests itself, then other things.<a name=309:21></a> Hence, though essential, it is not so properly so as love.<a name=309:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, too, here besides the order noticed elsewhere in chapter 5: 25, <i>et seq</i>, there is another point.<a name=309:23></a> Christ's first act is wholly written Himself.<a name=309:24></a> He loved the Church, and gave Himself for it.<a name=309:25></a> This is summed up in 'Himself,' but it embraces the whole of Himself.<a name=309:26></a> Now this is as is right.<a name=309:27></a> The first must be of and within Himself as being divine.<a name=309:28></a> It was a divine work, and so absolutely complete within Himself, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=310>[Page 310]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hence the love was perfect -- He gave Himself; nothing was kept back.<a name=310:1></a> It was not a gift of something, but giving Himself.<a name=310:2></a> Yet it was love, and a work, we must remember, which had a specific object, which makes it so precious to us, and supposes that divine Person to be a Man indeed too -- He loved the Church -- for in giving Himself He was Man, though the gift, the thing given and He who gave was divine.<a name=310:3></a> But what I note now is, that before any application, any cleansing, or presenting another thing to Himself, He had accomplished by Himself a work -- was complete in His own act and work -- and that this suited the glory and perfectness of His divine Person.<a name=310:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note too in this chapter, how, with the most perfect, devoted love, personally exercised and given as blessing, perfect, divine, moral excellency is looked for and wrought out too.<a name=310:5></a> He gave Himself.<a name=310:6></a> That is perfect love, for indeed the Church was in fact in the sink of this world.<a name=310:7></a> He would present it to Himself.<a name=310:8></a> There is the perfection of His love and her enjoyment.<a name=310:9></a> But between there is what is called for in order to the latter, and divine necessity morally -- sanctifying and cleansing by the washing of water by the Word.<a name=310:10></a> The divine perfection applied morally, judging all of flesh, all evil, and revealing, requiringly but cleansingly, all good.<a name=310:11></a> And so we ought to take things, adore, trust to the love, but look for God's character as equally necessary and to be desired, what must be if it be a divine blessing.<a name=310:12></a> The purchase of love, giving Himself, comes first -- what is His by perfect grace, He cleanses to have it according to His heart.<a name=310:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is in chapters 4 and 5, another, and to me an interesting point.<a name=310:14></a> The relationships, up to speaking of wives, are with God.<a name=310:15></a> So Christ offers Himself for us to God.<a name=310:16></a> We have the objective perfectness of motive in God Himself, and so in the character of the work, as well as perfect self-sacrifice for others.<a name=310:17></a> But in chapter 5, in His loving the Church, it is a love of relationship.<a name=310:18></a> He still gave up self in love.<a name=310:19></a> He gave Himself for it, but it ends in the perfectness of His own acts, and He presents it to Himself.<a name=310:20></a> This is beautifully in its place, and perfect.<a name=310:21></a> How perfect Scripture too is!<a name=310:22></a> Christ ought to have the Church to Himself.<a name=310:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am inclined, too, to think that "The fulness of him that filleth all in all," is not simply Godhead, but Christ in redemption.<a name=310:24></a>
