		The law is a testing of human nature, to see whether it can produce righteousness for God, and a perfect rule of righteousness for that nature in all it owes to God and to a man's neighbour.<a name=1:4></a> So that it claims subjection, and that man should fulfil its requirements under penalty moreover of judgment.<a name=1:5></a> The authority of God, the subjection of man to His commandments, and a perfect rule of conduct for man in his present state as a child of Adam are all involved in this system.<a name=1:6></a> But man, conscious he ought to fulfil it, his own conscience telling him it is right, and not suspecting his own weakness and the depth of his ruin, and seeing that keeping it would be righteousness for him before God, readily takes it up as the way of having that righteousness, and enjoying divine favour, of being right when judgment comes.<a name=1:7></a> When unawakened, observance of its outward claims satisfies the natural conscience; if understood spiritually, it leads to the discovery of that law in our members which hinders all success in the attempt.<a name=1:8></a> But God having established the law, it was a very difficult and delicate thing to shew that, as a system, it was passed away, not because it was not in its right place, and useful too for its own real purpose, but to make way for a system of grace purposed and promised long before the law was established; and that by the discovery that it was death and condemnation to be under it, that the mind of the flesh (the nature the law dealt with) was not subject to it, and could not be, and that we escape its curse as under it, not by the destruction of its authority, but by dying as so under it, and that by the body of Christ in whom we then found ourselves in a new life beyond its condemnation.<a name=1:9></a> The cross makes all things clear.<a name=1:10></a> But the credit of the flesh (that is, of himself) is dear to the natural man, and till he had discovered that in him (that is, in his flesh) there was no good thing, he was loth to give up a rule he knew to be right, in the humbling confession that he was such a sinner that it could be only his condemnation, the law of sin so strong in his members, himself so disposed to evil, that the law, weak through the flesh, could only condemn him.<a name=1:11></a> Judaising teachers, proud in their own conceits, zealous of the law as the credit of their nation, could not bear to have it set aside as necessary for the way of righteousness and life with God; and the ministry which judged the flesh in Jew and Gentile, and freed the latter from all subjection to the Jewish system, was intolerable to them.<a name=1:12></a> Man always clings to the law, speciously alleging God's claims and holiness, till he experimentally finds (in the discovery of the true character of the flesh) his true state, that as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse.<a name=1:13></a>

		Hence Paul, both as to his own ministry and the place the law held, was in perpetual conflict with these Judaising teachers.<a name=2:1></a> The more intimate we are with his writings, the more we shall find how he was harassed by it, and how his writings continually bear on the point that you cannot mix the two systems, law and grace.<a name=2:2></a> This lay at the root of all his doctrine, and in all its highest developments, as well as in its first elements.<a name=2:3></a> The counsels of God, in the second Man, were formed before the world was, or man was responsible at all, and revealed only after that second Man was come, and had accomplished the work on which the bringing all these counsels into effect was founded.<a name=2:4></a> The apostle's doctrine, fully unfolded, brought out the ground and scope of these counsels in their full development in Christ, and, as to us, in a new and heavenly position of man in and with Him; while the true state of the first man, responsible for his walk, of which the law was the perfect rule, gave occasion for insisting on the first elements of the truth, and the necessity of setting aside the first man, and thus for the application of the law, which could reach him only as long as he lived, in order to substitute grace and divine righteousness, not because the law was wrong, but because being right it was death and condemnation to man under it.<a name=2:5></a> Christ met this responsibility for us on the cross, magnifying the law by bearing its curse, but bringing us, dead to sin and alive in Him, into connection withal with another -- Himself raised from the dead.<a name=2:6></a> In His death God had condemned sin in the flesh, and brought in what was divine in righteousness and life in place of man, when Christ was for sin a sacrifice for sin on the cross.<a name=2:7></a> These elements the Epistle to the Galatians fully instructs us in, without going into the counsels whose accomplishment is based on the cross.<a name=2:8></a> These are found elsewhere, most fully in the Ephesians.<a name=2:9></a>

		The first part of the Epistle to the Galatians is occupied with the independence of Paul's ministry.<a name=3:1></a> It was neither of nor by man.<a name=3:2></a> From the apostles he received nothing.<a name=3:3></a> The revelations he received, and his apostolic authority were immediately from the Lord.<a name=3:4></a> But on this part it is not my object now to dwell.<a name=3:5></a> At the end of chapter 2 the apostle gives, in earnest and burning words, the whole bearing of the law on the gospel, and how they were related one to another; but of this at the close.<a name=3:6></a> I will now shew how he sets the law and the gospel over against one another.<a name=3:7></a>

		Up to the flood, save the testimony of godly men and prophets, God did not interfere after the history of man's perverseness was complete, in Adam and Cain.<a name=3:8></a> That issued in the judgment of the flood.<a name=3:9></a> After that, God began anew to deal with man, to unfold His ways to him in the state in which he was.<a name=3:10></a> And they were carried on till the full proof of man's irreclaimable state was given in the rejection of Christ.<a name=3:11></a> The first of these dealings, after scattering men into nations and tongues and languages, was His taking Abraham out of them all for Himself, and making him the stock and root of a new family on the earth, God's family fleshy or spiritual: the former Israel; the latter the one seed, Christ.<a name=3:12></a> Leaving aside for the moment Israel, the seed according to the flesh, to whom the promises will surely be accomplished in grace, we find the promise made to Abram in chapter 12, and confirmed to the seed in chapter 22.<a name=3:13></a> This referred to all nations who were to be blessed in the Seed, the one Seed, typified by Isaac, offered up and raised in figure.<a name=3:14></a> On this the apostle insists.<a name=3:15></a> The blessing came by promise.<a name=3:16></a> This, confirmed as it was to Isaac, could not be disannulled, and (what is more directly to the point) could not be added to.<a name=3:17></a> The law could not be annexed to it as a condition.<a name=3:18></a> To that there were two parties; but God was only one.<a name=3:19></a> The accomplishment of this conditional promise depended on the fidelity of both, and hence had no stability.<a name=3:20></a> God's promise depended on Himself alone.<a name=3:21></a> His faithfulness was its security, and it could not fail.<a name=3:22></a> But the law, coming four hundred and thirty years after, could not invalidate or be added to the confirmed promise.<a name=3:23></a> The law is not against the promises of God, but merely came in by the bye till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made, bringing in transgression but not righteousness.<a name=3:24></a> The law was not of faith; its blessing was by those who were under it themselves doing it.<a name=3:25></a> Promise, and faith in the promise and promised One, went together.<a name=3:26></a> The law brought a curse; Christ, the promised Seed, was made a curse for those under it, and when Christianity or faith came they were no longer under it at all.<a name=3:27></a> The law was an intermediate added thing whose place ceased when the promised Seed came.<a name=3:28></a> The law and grace are contrasted, as the law and promise, faith and the Seed are, first for justification.<a name=3:29></a> A man under the law was a debtor himself to do the whole of it; and a Christian taking this ground was fallen from grace: Christ had become of none effect to him.<a name=3:30></a> A man who looked to the law frustrated the grace of God: if righteousness came by it, Christ was dead in vain.<a name=3:31></a>

		But the contrast is applied to godly walk.<a name=4:1></a> The Spirit is opposed to the flesh.<a name=4:2></a> They are contrary one to the other in their nature.<a name=4:3></a> We are to walk after the Spirit, having the things of the Spirit before us, to do its works, to produce its fruits; but if we are led of the Spirit, we are not under law.<a name=4:4></a> Life and power and a heavenly object characterise the Spirit, in contrast with the law which deals with flesh, and in vain, instead of taking us out of it.<a name=4:5></a> Thus, as to godly walk as well as for righteousness, the law is contrasted with grace.<a name=4:6></a> On one side are grace, promise, faith, Christ, and the Spirit, and, I may add, a righteous standing before God; on the other, the law claiming obedience from the flesh, which does not render it, and out of which the law cannot deliver us.<a name=4:7></a> It gives no life.<a name=4:8></a> If there had been a law which could have given life, then, indeed, righteousness should have been by the law.<a name=4:9></a> It is this full contrast which makes the Galatians so striking.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result is this.<a name=4:11></a> Being led of the Spirit we are not under law.<a name=4:12></a> What, then, is our state?<a name=4:13></a> We through the Spirit wait for the hope that belongs to it, that is, glory.<a name=4:14></a> How so?<a name=4:15></a> Being righteous in Christ, we have received the Spirit, and in the power of that we wait for what it so richly reveals.<a name=4:16></a> The contrast of the flesh and Spirit, and the power of the latter leaves the law functionless as to walk, whether in power or character.<a name=4:17></a> Law was a rule for flesh, a perfect one, but not for Spirit.<a name=4:18></a> This reveals heavenly things, Christ in glory, and changes us into His image.<a name=4:19></a> This was in no way the law's object.<a name=4:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How, then, is its real use and power stated in the epistle?<a name=5:1></a> Peter, when certain came from James, would no longer eat with the Gentiles.<a name=5:2></a> Paul withstood him to the face, the weakness of one yielding to the presence of Jews, the energetic faith of the other holding fast the truth of the gospel.<a name=5:3></a> Peter had left the law as the way of obtaining righteousness, and he was going back to it, building again what he had destroyed; he was then a transgressor in destroying it.<a name=5:4></a> Now Christ had led him to it.<a name=5:5></a> Christ then was the minister of sin.<a name=5:6></a> What was the effect of the law?<a name=5:7></a> Ah!<a name=5:8></a> we have, through grace, in the earnestness of a holy conscience, its true work.<a name=5:9></a> It wrought death.<a name=5:10></a> The law had killed Paul (that is, in his conscience before God).<a name=5:11></a> He had been alive without it once.<a name=5:12></a> But thereby he was dead to it; and this, that in another way, in another life, he might live to God, which the flesh could not do.<a name=5:13></a> Had it been simply given effect to in himself, it had been curse and condemnation as well as death, but it was in Christ, who had died under its curse for him, and he was crucified with Christ, being thus dead, dead to law, and to sin at the same time, having done with the old Adam, to which the law applied; he was, nevertheless, now alive.<a name=5:14></a> Yet not he (which would have been the flesh) but Christ lived in him.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law, and condemnation, and the flesh, were gone (so to speak) together as to Paul's position before God, and replaced by Christ and the Spirit, on which last he largely insists in what follows -- chapter 3.<a name=5:16></a> But there is more; there is the object before the soul.<a name=5:17></a> "The life which I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.<a name=5:18></a>" This is the great point.<a name=5:19></a> That divine Person, who has so loved us and given Himself for us, whom we thus know in perfect grace, in love even unto death, is the sanctifying object of the whole life.<a name=5:20></a> We live by it.<a name=5:21></a> The law gave no object, any more than it gave life and strength.<a name=5:22></a> Here we have the most blessed one, where the heart is filled with love, and led out into confidence with an object that conforms it to itself.<a name=5:23></a> The principle of dealing, grace, life, power, object, are all contrasted with law, which afforded none of these, and could therefore no more produce godliness than it could righteousness before God.<a name=5:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle thus contrasts grace, promise, faith, Christ, the Spirit for righteousness and walk alike, with law and flesh.<a name=6:1></a> The law was useful as bringing death on us, that is, on the old man, condemnation being borne by Christ, in whom we have died to it and flesh.<a name=6:2></a> A new place, and life, and righteousness, beyond the cross, is that into which we have entered, with Christ in heaven before us.<a name=6:3></a> I have written at intervals, and interrupted, as well as weary, and not given in this paper, I fear, what was suggested to my mind.<a name=6:4></a> But I trust the great principles of the Epistle, on this point, will be sufficiently clear to be helpful to some in studying the Epistle itself.<a name=6:5></a>

		NOTES ON THE EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle seems here to dwell on the purposes of God with regard to us.<a name=7:1></a> He does not so much speak of the means which God has made use of in order to reconcile us with Himself (the satisfaction that has been made to His justice, though the Spirit dwells thereon likewise); but the subject is specially the blessedness in which God has placed us in His counsels of grace.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is certainly a blessed thing for us fully to understand the means which God has made use of, in order to bring us to Himself; but God has made known to us these things, in order that we may be occupied with the things to which we are called.<a name=7:3></a> It is in the enjoyment of these things that we put on the character of the Christian, and that the soul grows.<a name=7:4></a> They enter into our very existence; and when the heart has laid hold of them, there is much more of the Christian and of testimony in us, so that, by the power of the Holy Spirit working in us, there results a much clearer and stronger point of attraction for the world.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those who dwell in Spirit in heaven partake of its spirit, and go on increasing in the things which they find there.<a name=7:6></a> They are in relationship with God; they enjoy what God has given, and that is certainly most precious; but above all, they enjoy God Himself: and here is the exceeding grace of Him who desires that we should always dwell near Him, and that we should know His thoughts and His counsels.<a name=7:7></a> This is what we should desire and seek after, and thus we shall understand better what is well pleasing to the Lord, and what is worthy of Him.<a name=7:8></a> Such are the subjects of which the apostle speaks to us in the chapter which is before us.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1-3.<a name=7:10></a> In Jesus Christ, the Head of the body, we are blessed with all spiritual blessings.<a name=7:11></a> It is there God sets us; and we know it, beloved, we know it, but more in theory than in practice.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 4.<a name=7:13></a> As I have already said, the apostle here not only speaks to us of the means, but of the source of our blessing in the unspeakable counsels of God, and of the end which God proposes to Himself; for it is said, "That ye may be holy and without blame before him in love.<a name=7:14></a>" This is the thought of God about us: He wishes to have us before Him, and to have us there happy and for Himself.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is only one thing in which God does not suffice for Himself, and that is, in His love.<a name=8:1></a> His love has need of other beings beside Himself, in order to make them happy.<a name=8:2></a> He desires to have before Him beings in harmony with what He is, and He sets us before Him "holy and without blame.<a name=8:3></a>"<a href="#8:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This is what He is Himself, He who is the Holy One, He who certainly is without blame; for it is impossible to find any fault in Him.<a name=8:4></a> He calls Himself the Holy One; He is love Well; He sets us holy and without blame before Him in love Precious and most important thought for us!<a name=8:5></a> He has resolved that the church should be such that He could take delight in her, and behold in her before Him the reproduction of Himself, the most perfect happiness possible.<a name=8:6></a> He sets before Him beings like to Himself in order to make them as happy as it is possible; He communicates to us His nature, and takes His delight in us.<a name=8:7></a> In order for that, He makes us "holy and without blame in love"; and these things are accomplished here below by the Spirit, though the effects are not fully shewn till above in the place of perfectness.<a name=8:8></a> So, where is our place even now below?<a name=8:9></a> Before Him; and this place is not a joy only, but the most precious thing that can be imagined, to be before Him!<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not like to be before Him when we are not holy; but when the conscience is cleansed by the blood of Christ, we are truly happy before Him.<a name=8:11></a> In order that we may be happy before Him we must be holy, we must understand the tastes of the divine nature -- our nature.<a name=8:12></a> We ourselves must find our happiness in being "holy and without blame in love.<a name=8:13></a>" The apostle John shews in his first epistle (chapter 4: 13), that the divine nature is produced in the Christian: the Christian has received God's own Spirit; it is a man who loves, and God is in him and he in God.<a name=8:14></a> What is granted is nothing less than the communication of the divine nature, by which we dwell in God, and God in us, "that we might be holy and without blame before him in love.<a name=8:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we shall be above ought to be our aim here below, not as a task imposed, but as being made partakers of the divine nature to the glory of God.<a name=8:16></a> Now if we would realise these things, our thoughts must be above, according to the nature of the grace which we have received.<a name=8:17></a> It is most strengthening for us to think of the things which are above -- of their source, of Jesus, of the fulfilment of this purpose of God in glory.<a name=8:18></a>

		Verses 5-7.<a name=9:1></a> The apostle has ever this adoption in view; God wills to have us for Himself before Him through Jesus, according to the good pleasure of His will, as His children.<a name=9:2></a> Now this is the glory of this grace which has placed us there.<a name=9:3></a> In these verses Paul speaks to us of the basis, of the means which God has employed, and on the certainty of which we can count.<a name=9:4></a> He speaks of it as a settled thing, as of a thing which we possess, and the possession of which, indeed, is necessary to us, in order that we may partake of all that of which he is about to speak to us.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the door by which we have come in; and having passed through the door, in Jesus, I have the certainty of being in the house.<a name=9:6></a> But it would be sorrowful to have Jesus only as the door, though it is precious to understand that.<a name=9:7></a> If we are not sure of a hearty welcome, and of the love of the Father, we depreciate the riches of His grace, for "we have redemption by his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace," verse 7.<a name=9:8></a> If in uncertainty we do not enjoy this grace, we do not really acknowledge it; and in order to do so we must give ourselves up entirely to God, to the power of the love of Him who tells us to come inside.<a name=9:9></a> Here we may remark, that the Spirit, whilst declaring to us very plainly what is the means of our salvation, does not reason upon it as elsewhere, making known to us its character and its sufficiency; but He speaks of it as of a privilege that we possess; He tells us what we have in Christ, before shewing what belongs to those who enjoy the effect of this redemption.<a name=9:10></a> We have redemption; and instructed in all things, we wait for the redemption of the body, in order to enjoy it.<a name=9:11></a> The only thing that we have to do is to contemplate the riches of the grace of God; this will be a means of drawing us close to Him.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen in the preceding verses the purposes of God with regard to us, and the means which He employs to render us partakers of them, namely, redemption through Christ's blood, according to the riches of His grace.<a name=9:13></a> Now what we have before us is the portion we have now here below, the understanding of the mystery of God.<a name=9:14></a>

		Verses 8, 9.<a name=10:1></a> God has given us of His grace in all wisdom and prudence.<a name=10:2></a> He is not content with only giving us this portion, by bringing us into it hereafter; but He wishes to give us now, here below, the knowledge of it in all wisdom and prudence, according to His good pleasure.<a name=10:3></a> We have not to do with a God who sets us before His justice, but with a God of grace who acts according to His own thoughts.<a name=10:4></a> God wills that the church should not be only such before Him, but that it should be also, here below, the depository of all His counsels; that it should have the understanding of the mystery of His will.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 10 gives us the explanation of this mystery.<a name=10:6></a> God gathers together in one all things in Christ in the dispensation of the fulness of times.<a name=10:7></a> All that which preceded was preparatory; as the law, the prophets, etc.<a name=10:8></a> This verse speaks of the fulness of times, when God will arrange all things according to His mind, by setting Christ at the head of all things; and it is by being united to Him that we are made partakers of the inheritance.<a name=10:9></a> God acts of His own will to bring about what He wills.<a name=10:10></a> All shall be gathered together in one in Christ.<a name=10:11></a> It is by Him that all has been created, and by Him all is to be reconciled; and this is set forth here as the result of the counsels of God.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 11, 12.<a name=10:13></a> There are two parts in this mystery:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. all things shall be put under the headship of Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. the church, which is His body, will have part in the inheritance.<a name=10:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall be before God according to the perfection of His nature.<a name=10:15></a> Christ having been put to death, God and the sinner have met together.<a name=10:16></a> But here it is rather a question of the accomplishment of the mystery of the will of God for the glory of Christ.<a name=10:17></a> The church will have part in the inheritance.<a name=10:18></a> "in whom," it is said, "we have obtained an inheritance"; but the whole of the mystery is not the church only, and this is very simple if we receive the thoughts of the Bible; not, indeed, that we shall understand the whole extent of the glory, but we shall see that all things created are to be gathered together in one in Christ.<a name=10:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Epistle to the Colossians Christ is presented as Creator; the Person of Christ is in the prominent place rather than the counsels of God as to the church.<a name=10:20></a> Christ is the first-born of every creature, and the first-born from the dead; Head of His body, which is the church.<a name=10:21></a> But here, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, it is the privileges of the church in Him which we are given to know.<a name=10:22></a> In verse 6 it is said that what we possess already is to the praise of the glory of His grace; and in verse 12, where he is speaking of the glory to come that is before us, it is said -- "that we should be to the praise of his glory" The church has a portion quite apart and most glorious.<a name=10:23></a> All things are to be gathered together in one in Christ.<a name=10:24></a> The church, being united to Him, is made partaker of the inheritance, that we should be to the praise of His glory.<a name=10:25></a> The glory of God is understood by its being seen in us; and the world will then see that we have been loved as Christ is loved.<a name=10:26></a>

		Verse 12 might seem a difficulty, where it is said, "We who first hoped in Christ"; but he is here speaking of the Jews, who have believed before the revelation of Christ to the nation, at His second coming, and before the national call to the Jews at the end: such of the Jews as have believed, as have hoped beforehand, they are glorified with Him.<a name=11:1></a>

		There is a difference between regeneration by the Spirit and the presence of the Spirit as a seal.<a name=11:8></a> A person must have believed, for God to be able to put His seal on him; the Spirit may act before this, as for instance, in breaking up the heart; but it is not as a seal.<a name=11:9></a> Sometimes the power of the Spirit produces fruits in us; at other times it humbles us, making us sensible of good and evil; but this is not joy.<a name=11:10></a> The fact is, that this work is even more precious than the joy itself, because there are sometimes things in us which are not judged before God on account of the very joy.<a name=11:11></a> When God has given us the enjoyment of the true object which we ought to enjoy, He begins to break up the heart in order that the work may be deeper.<a name=11:12></a> The Spirit makes us sensible of the things which are not according to God, and this knowledge of one's self is necessary, in order that we may know God.<a name=11:13></a> I do not say that, if we were to walk exactly as God would have us, this work could not be carried on without the loss of the joy; but it is not generally so with the Christian.<a name=11:14></a> It becomes needful for God to turn us toward Himself, and to work inwardly, that we may discover what our carelessness has prevented us from seeing.<a name=11:15></a> Often this exhilarating joy of a Christian is found in one who has not judged things that ought to be judged in the presence of God.<a name=11:16></a> The wants and the desires which the Holy Spirit produces by regeneration are not the seal of the Spirit, any more than the joy which flows from the affections being occupied with a new and divine object, nor even the fruits which the Holy Spirit may produce when He dwells in us.<a name=11:17></a> The seal is the Holy Spirit Himself, given to that faith which is in Him who is our righteousness, and is the answer to all our wants; and then we have peace and joy.<a name=11:18></a> It is the Spirit in us who is the seal.<a name=11:19></a>

		The word "prophets" of verse 20 has led many into a mistake.<a name=21:18></a> Here it is quite a new revelation that is spoken of, one which could not be spoken of before.<a name=21:19></a> It was a hidden mystery.<a name=21:20></a> God could not reveal the church during the Jewish dispensation; for the existence of the church then would have denied the special position of this people Israel.<a name=21:21></a> God could reveal that the Jews would be rejected and punished, and from the moment He brings out that, He turns back to the mercy which will cause the Jewish nation to return into blessing.<a name=21:22></a> This is what will take place when the Jewish people will be the royal people upon earth, when Israel will be restored by a new covenant.<a name=21:23></a> But this new man, this new revelation, is that those who now believe and belong to Christ become members of His body; and they are in the blessedness which belongs to it.<a name=21:24></a> Verse 19 expresses that we are in the house of God; and from verse 20 it is evident that, in order to begin to build, the corner stone must be laid.<a name=21:25></a> This is what we have seen before, and now we come to the results of it.<a name=21:26></a> Verse 21.<a name=21:27></a> We are not yet the temple of God; the church will be that holy temple in glory.<a name=21:28></a>

		When the apostle has spoken of God dwelling in us by the Spirit, he prays that we may be filled with all the fulness of God; and there are here two things to remark:

	<div class="paragraph">

		CHAPTER 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1-6.<a name=23:1></a> The apostle had set forth in the preceding chapters the hope of glory and the oneness of the body of Christ; he had presented the Spirit given as the seal and earnest of the glory, the Spirit as the centre of the oneness; and while we wait for this glory, he has presented the church, not only as the co-heir of this glory in hope, but as being the habitation of God by the Spirit during the present time.<a name=23:2></a> Paul, in these two chapters, shews us first the glory with Christ; and afterwards the church, the bride of Christ and habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=23:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, introducing the Gentiles into the oneness of the body, the apostle says, "I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles.<a name=23:4></a>" All that follows from verse I to the end of the chapter is in parenthesis, as is seen by chapter 4: 1, "I, therefore, the prisoner.<a name=23:5></a>" What is said at the beginning of chapter 4 is connected with the end of chapter 2, where it is seen that we are the habitation of God, the dwelling of God; this is the calling of which it is said, "I beseech you .<a name=23:6></a>.<a name=23:7></a>.<a name=23:8></a> to walk worthy of the calling with which ye are called.<a name=23:9></a>" In such a position we are always humble; and this it is which enables us to walk worthy of the calling revealed.<a name=23:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the beginning of the chapter there are two things to observe: personal humility which leads us to walk in oneness; and the individual gifts.<a name=23:11></a> There is one body, one Spirit, and the gifts alone are different in the members of the body.<a name=23:12></a> Chapter 3 is an unfolding of this truth, that the Holy Spirit dwells in His habitation, which is the church.<a name=23:13></a> Paul says, "I, Paul, prisoner for you Gentiles," etc.<a name=23:14></a>; and the consequence was, that since, as to the church, Paul would not place the Jews above the Gentiles, by reason of the malice of this people he became prisoner for the love of the Gentiles; here is the testimony which Paul gives about it.<a name=23:15></a> "That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel.<a name=23:16></a>" It is wonderful how slow Christians are to understand the largeness of the counsels of God; for Paul was obliged to say even to the Ephesians, who were certainly a blessed church, if they had the understanding of the ways of God as to him, Paul; "If so be ye have heard.<a name=23:17></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In general we are obliged to be much more occupied with the details of the Christian life than with the great principles of this life.<a name=24:1></a> God is patient; but it is sorrowful that the state of the church should be such.<a name=24:2></a> Because of the want of spirituality, the Spirit cannot go on to unfold the riches of the thoughts of Jesus; He is then forced to be occupied with the walk, that the gospel may not be dishonoured.<a name=24:3></a> The understanding of the counsels of God depends on the faithfulness of the walk, and what will be the consequence of this faithful walk?<a name=24:4></a> It will be a state of struggle with all, especially with all that Judaises.<a name=24:5></a> It is impossible but that, in the actual state in which the world is, opposition should not be shewn against the one who is faithful; and the fact of having more light excites opposition even with Christians.<a name=24:6></a> Paul is a striking example of it.<a name=24:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle often repeats this; that the church has not been revealed in the Old Testament.<a name=24:8></a> Certainly, the prophets of the Old Testament confirm the blessed position of the church, inasmuch as this truth is based upon the blessing of God being extended even to the nations blessing which they (the prophets) had testified of.<a name=24:9></a> (Psalm 18: 49; Deuteronomy 32: 43; Psalm 117.<a name=24:10></a>) There it is the Gentiles who are to rejoice with His people; but what the church is, is never spoken of.<a name=24:11></a> In the Colossians it is said of Christ, "Christ the hope of glory"; whilst that Christ whom the Jews expected was to be a Christ personally present -- a Christ who was to bring in the glory (this will take place at the end) -- so that a Christ who was only a hope when He was there was a thing which could not be understood.<a name=24:12></a> It was a mystery, of which the prophets had never said a word: they had spoken of a Christ who was to accomplish such or such things, but never of a Christ in us the hope of glory for the church.<a name=24:13></a> Christ as in us is the practical and actual point of this mystery.<a name=24:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Romans 16: 26<a href="#24:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> the apostle teaches the same truth, that the church was a mystery, unknown before the death of Christ.<a name=24:15></a> God had always had the thought of the church; but it was hidden.<a name=24:16></a> Paul, in his communications to the Gentiles, rests upon what the prophets had said of the grace of God towards the Gentiles, and he quotes these prophets; Romans 15: 9-12.<a name=24:17></a> It is certain that a Christ promised, and who was to be rejected, is clearly revealed in the prophets; but we know that this was an enigma for the Jews -- "We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever" -- and the thought of a Christ who had other members, and those too among the Gentiles, would have been still more incomprehensible.<a name=24:18></a> The church is united to Christ; and if we wish to find it in the Old Testament, we must seek Christ Himself, and see it in Him.<a name=24:19></a> See, for example, Isaiah 50: 8: "He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me?<a name=24:20></a> let us stand together: who is mine adversary?<a name=24:21></a> let him come near to me.<a name=24:22></a> Behold, the Lord God will help me; who is he that shall condemn me?<a name=24:23></a>" and Romans 8: 32, 33.<a name=24:24></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#24:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I do not doubt but that in this passage the "prophetic writings" are those of the New Testament; but the apostle constantly makes use of the writings of the Old Testament, to shew grace extending to the Gentiles.

		This challenge to all the world (because it is God who justifies us), which in Isaiah is spoken by Christ Himself, is in the Romans applied to the church.<a name=25:1></a> God only sees Christ; and these things are applied to us as being united to Christ.<a name=25:2></a> We are accepted in the Beloved.<a name=25:3></a> The thought of a people united to Christ by a spiritual life, or rather of a people united to Christ by one Spirit who was in Him and them, was never touched upon in the Old Testament.<a name=25:4></a> Christ Himself had not this position as Head of the body; and consequently the Spirit was not yet thus given.<a name=25:5></a>

		The apostles and prophets, the foundation upon which the church is built, are not the prophets of old; for we see here it is things now revealed to these prophets that are spoken of, in contrast with the times past; they are then the prophets of the New Testament.<a name=25:6></a> In 1 Peter 1: 12 it is written, that the ancient prophets knew it was not for them that these things were written; and verse 6 of this chapter explains to us this mystery, namely, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs.<a name=25:7></a> It declares to us the good news, that the middle wall of partition was broken down by the death of Christ; that all that which had made the difference between Jews and Gentiles had disappeared, and that Jews and Gentiles were made one in Christ.<a name=25:8></a> We see the difficulty the apostle Peter had in admitting this truth (for example, with Cornelius); Paul was obliged to resist him at Antioch to the face.<a name=25:9></a> The ancient Jews had great difficulty in acknowledging this glorious truth, and the oneness of the church.<a name=25:10></a>

		The unsearchable riches of Christ are those riches of which we cannot fathom the depth, so immense are they; and the glory which God will give to Christ, according to what He is, and according to the worth of His work, this is the measure of these unsearchable riches.<a name=26:9></a> All has been done by Christ and for Christ; all has been created by Him and for Him: and the fact of having presented Christ to the Gentiles outside the limited revelation of the ancient prophets, brought out the riches of Christ as unsearchable; God can stand in presence of the power of sin, and in Christ, as Man, display the power of His grace for the manifestation of His glory.<a name=26:10></a>

		It is striking to see what is now the position of the church set in sight of heaven; it is in the heavenly places she bears witness; her conflicts (Ephesians 6) are in the heavens; her blessings are there also (Ephesians 1); and it is there again that she is seated (Ephesians 2); the witness borne by the church in the heavenly places, gives importance to the present testimony of the church down here.<a name=27:1></a> I do not here speak in thought of the glory to come; but in thought of God's dwelling in the church by the Spirit.<a name=27:2></a>

		As Son of God, Christ is the first name in this family which the Spirit reveals to us, that Spirit by whom we are strengthened in the inner man; for our feeble hearts, though they are converted to God, would be incapable without His help of entering into this glory and the extent of these counsels; the trials of the flesh are not an obstacle to our realising these things; the more the apostle suffered as prisoner, the more he entered into this mystery of the glory of Christ.<a name=28:14></a> His imprisonment was the cause of this epistle, as well as those to the Colossians, Philippians, and others: it is thus that God provides for the needs of His church.<a name=28:15></a> We ought so to lay hold of Christ glorified, as that He should be there with us; His presence ought to be realised and acted on constantly in the heart.<a name=28:16></a>

		It is by entering into the love which is the source of it, that we understand the immeasurable expanse which is spoken of in verse 18; that love of God whose thought is to put all things in subjection to Christ, and to glorify the church with Him.<a name=29:5></a> When we have understood this love, we can, in a certain sense, measure the ways of God which have brought us in there where God displays Himself, for it is not told us of what he is describing the length, the breadth, the depth and height, but it is love which has introduced us and orders all things.<a name=29:6></a> The Spirit includes the whole church, which is very nigh to God in this glory; it is impossible that any of its members should be set aside.<a name=29:7></a>

		We have here the present and practical application of the principles which form the subject of this epistle.<a name=30:14></a> The beginning of this chapter joins on to the end of chapter 2, where is shewn to us what the calling of the Christian is.<a name=30:15></a> The apostle beseeches the Ephesians to walk worthy of this vocation.<a name=30:16></a> That which is its special mark is, the habitation of God on earth by the Spirit.<a name=30:17></a> The whole conduct of the Christian flows from the church being the habitation of the Spirit.<a name=30:18></a> When the Spirit is presented as the seal, this is more for the individual: it is not the church which is sealed, but she becomes the habitation of God, as does the individual also.<a name=30:19></a> The conduct of the Christian ought to flow out of the presence of God.<a name=30:20></a> There is a conduct which becomes this presence: not only ought I to obey God, but there is a manner of acting which flows out of this presence, and which is the expression of this dwelling of God in us.<a name=30:21></a> When God was in the temple there was something in particular which was suitable for that presence.<a name=30:22></a> We are His temple.<a name=30:23></a> The presence of the Spirit in us becomes power as much as motive.<a name=30:24></a> There are things which become the temple of God.<a name=30:25></a> The estimation that we form of one another depends on the same thing.<a name=30:26></a>

		Verses 1-3.<a name=31:1></a> The apostle does not speak of obedience, but of the Spirit which leads to it; the practical effect of the presence of God by the Spirit, is humility.<a name=31:2></a> Love always makes itself nothing.<a name=31:3></a> To have bad thoughts about oneself is humiliation, but not humility.<a name=31:4></a> Humility is produced by the presence of God; we are occupied with God and not with ourselves; God is there to comfort us and to bless us; the pride of man being broken down there is gentleness.<a name=31:5></a> This making nothing of oneself produces patience and love.<a name=31:6></a> When we know ourselves to be nothing, we have the consciousness of the strength of God; and more than that, there is the activity of love.<a name=31:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Consciousness of the preciousness of the presence of God, gives us the energy of the Spirit of God, which makes us careful to keep the oneness of the Spirit, that is to say, the union of all the members of Christ as one temple in which God dwells in this world by His Spirit.<a name=31:8></a> The moment that I forsake this, the unity is broken.<a name=31:9></a> In the flesh we are two, in the Spirit we are one; and when, by the Spirit, we enjoy love, there is this desire to keep the oneness of the Spirit.<a name=31:10></a> The flesh is never peaceful, whereas in God all is peace and quietness.<a name=31:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable how often God is called the God of peace.<a name=31:12></a> See Philippians 4: 9; 1 Thessalonians 5: 23; Hebrews 13: 20.<a name=31:13></a> The bond of peace is indeed the result of being thus in the presence of God; it is on this account that the apostle adds, "There is one body and there is one Spirit.<a name=31:14></a>" Oneness is a thing which is actually realised on earth, the outward unity of the body in one expresses what there is within.<a name=31:15></a> If this bond of peace is wanting, the oneness of the Spirit is not kept.<a name=31:16></a>

		Verse 4.<a name=31:17></a> Paul turns back to the thought put forth in chapter 1, "The hope of glory.<a name=31:18></a>" This same Spirit which has given the same hope, has given the oneness of the body; this outward unity which manifests the Spirit as well as oneness in the glory.<a name=31:19></a> There is but one body here below.<a name=31:20></a>

		Verse 7.<a name=32:14></a> The apostle now comes to the members of this wonderful body; Christ is the power which unites this body to Himself, and He is also the energy in each one of its members.<a name=32:15></a> If I speak of the church as a body, there is more glory; the unity of the body connects itself with nearness to God rather than with our individuality.<a name=32:16></a> We ought to look upon the members of the body as in action for the good of this body; evangelisation produces also this same end by bringing souls to the Lord.<a name=32:17></a>

		Verse 13 speaks of the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God -- in the which we have fellowship.<a name=34:16></a> Difference of views there may be; but as it was said to the Philippians, "God shall reveal even this unto you.<a name=34:17></a>" There is, therefore, the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=34:18></a> Ministry is the means to it, and this ministry always exists.<a name=34:19></a> If attention be paid to what is said about ministry, it will be seen that when the apostle speaks of the perfect man, he does not allude to the perfection which follows resurrection, but to the perfection of this knowledge.<a name=34:20></a> We have seen that this is connected with the basis which the Spirit has laid for all these truths; that is Christ fulfilling all things and dwelling in us here below.<a name=34:21></a> The Holy Spirit, who dwells in the church, makes each member to grow according to that which is in Christ and according to the measure of Christ.<a name=34:22></a> As there is unity in the body, there is also the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son.<a name=34:23></a> Here, the Spirit's thought is to make all the members grow according to the revelation of the glory of Christ; and this shews us what our desires ought to be, and what we ought to desire for our brethren.<a name=34:24></a> Christ has grace enough in Himself for this.<a name=34:25></a> We should desire that all Christians near us should be full of knowledge, even to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; and this knowledge of the revelation of the glory of Christ here below, naturally produces fruits.<a name=34:26></a> Such is the meaning of the word "perfection.<a name=34:27></a>" The question is as to knowing Christ.<a name=34:28></a> Christ is altogether perfect as risen from the dead: the Christian is so when he has risen up to that position of Christ.<a name=34:29></a> Paul said, "Not that I have already attained.<a name=34:30></a>" But he had attained to that spiritual joy, that knowledge which revealed to him the object set before him.<a name=34:31></a> When it is thus with the Christian, he is at peace, and he can grow as to practical conduct; he has the consciousness of being in that which is infinite, of being in the enjoyment of Christ before the Father, according to the accomplishment of all the counsels of God.<a name=34:32></a> As to his soul before God, he no longer travails, so to speak, as when he drew nigh to God, conscious in himself of his need of expiation.<a name=34:33></a> As to his soul, he has nothing to search after; all being accomplished, he finds himself set before God, in that fulness itself, even in reference to all the circumstances which may befall him; he knows that Christ has all power in heaven and in earth.<a name=34:34></a>

		Verse 17.<a name=37:4></a> There is a principle here, which it is of importance to have a firm hold of: it is, that the whole conduct of the Christian flows from salvation, and is not in order that he may be saved: it is not that we do not gain something, or that Paul does not exhort us to run towards the mark (1 Corinthians 9: 24); but the whole walk of the Christian ought to be the manifestation of a new life.<a name=37:5></a> The moment that we hear an exhortation as to conduct, and that we do not hear it as addressed to a saved person, the gospel is displaced.<a name=37:6></a> All must be addressed to me as a child of God; this is why the apostle says, "I beseech you," etc.<a name=37:7></a> It is because of this grace that I beseech you.<a name=37:8></a> The moment that I mix up an exhortation with the freeness of salvation, man is not in the position in which Christ has set him; it may have the appearance of piety, but the fact remains, that if I exhort, and at the same time admit a question about salvation, I deny, and I have not a right consciousness of, the state of ruin in which man is, any more than of salvation.<a name=37:9></a>

		Verses 18-20.<a name=58:1></a> The second weapon which is given to us is prayer in the Spirit; it is that prayer which springs from the energy of the spiritual life when the Spirit is not grieved in us; the same Spirit, which acting in us, uses the word, becomes a Spirit of intercession and seeks the interposition of God in favour of the saints, and of the work of God in the world.<a name=58:2></a> It is a soul at ease in the presence of God -- a soul watching, instead of allowing itself to be surprised; and its prayers, instead of being complaints, will be according to the power of the Spirit; we can then use prayer as men who have watched, and who have found in watching subjects for the intervention of God.<a name=58:3></a> We may be afflicted, cast down, without being under the power of the enemy.<a name=58:4></a>

		If I hear bad news, whether relating to the church of God or to a brother, it will make me sorrowful and cast me down, as it did Paul, who had fightings without and fears within.<a name=58:5></a> But though thus sorrowful, if Satan has nothing in us, the consequence of this depression will be communion with God, instead of having allowed our affections to wander; we are in the presence of God, we watch with Him in order to speak to Him; but if this is not the case, Satan will take us unawares in moments of carelessness.<a name=58:6></a> If we walk with God, this will cause prayers according to the mind of God.<a name=58:7></a> The broken heart finds in Jesus the full certainty of God's favour.<a name=58:8></a> The Philippians, in their suffering state, had met with God instead of being frightened by it (Philippians 1: 28); and though afflicted, if I am in the power of the Spirit, it will only cause more lively intercession.<a name=58:9></a> It is precious to see what is produced by affliction, even by chastening; if our walk is spiritual, it will only be an opportunity for gaining the victory, and for driving away Satan.<a name=58:10></a> All the members are united to the Head, and by His Spirit interested in all that concerns Him.<a name=58:11></a> They cannot always act themselves in such or such a case, but they can, like the centurion, say to Christ, "Speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.<a name=58:12></a>"

		As we have seen that the word of God is the sword of the Spirit, so also what importance does the Lord attach to prayer!<a name=59:1></a> There are two kinds of prayer: that which is the expression of our wants; and that which being made in the energy of the Spirit, is therefore infallibly answered.<a name=59:2></a> Whether for handling the sword of the Spirit, or for prayer, the Christian life must already exist; in order to be able to pray for others, our own life must be with God.<a name=59:3></a> There is amongst Christians too little intercession; because they come to a meeting for prayer, after leading a life of languishing, absorbed by present things.<a name=59:4></a> The consequence is, their prayers discover the weakness of the individual, and not the work of the Spirit for the good of the church.<a name=59:5></a> Too often alas!<a name=59:6></a> it is a settling as to our own failures.<a name=59:7></a> If we were watchful therein in our daily walk, our prayers would be intercessions, instead of supplications each day for our own faults.<a name=59:8></a> What we should desire is, that our individual prayers should be such as to enable us to pray for all saints; without this they will never have this powerful energy of the Spirit.<a name=59:9></a> Satan will find some means for overthrowing Christians.<a name=59:10></a> How desirable this makes it that there should be some able to bring in the aid of God!<a name=59:11></a> The more, whether it be an individual or a body of persons, we are faithful as to our position in this world, the more shall we be exposed to the ambushes of the enemy; and if we do not thus keep close to God, the enemy will find some way of making havoc.<a name=59:12></a>

		We see here, that the most faithful and advanced Christians feel their dependence upon God, and on all saints.<a name=59:13></a> The apostolic gift of Paul depended in one sense on the prayers of the saints: God intended it to be so, in order that the church might be united in its affections; 2 Corinthians 1: 11.<a name=59:14></a> The apostle was in a prominent position, and perhaps he received power through the prayers of a poor bed-ridden woman; but all hidden fruits will be seen in the last day.<a name=59:15></a> It is an encouraging thing to see that God honours the hidden members which are the least honourable to the eyes of the flesh.<a name=59:16></a> This thought encourages us to walk humbly in our place.<a name=59:17></a> Frequently there are persons hidden out of sight, who are the means of blessing for those who are in a very prominent place.<a name=59:18></a> We ought to think of the praise which God gives, and not of that of men.<a name=59:19></a> The only thing in our service is to glorify God.<a name=59:20></a> If my heart, which no one sees, does not beat, I cannot run.<a name=59:21></a> There are individuals who are truly the heart of the church; it is not often the things that are seen which are the most precious in the sight of God.<a name=59:22></a>

		SUBSTANCE OF A READING ON EPHESIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The nature of the Epistle to the Ephesians is quite distinct from that of Romans.<a name=61:1></a> In Ephesians we have nothing to do with the responsibility of man; we have with Christ, and man is looked at as dead in sins, and there is a new creation.<a name=61:2></a> Consequently the question of justification is not raised in Ephesians, but acceptance is.<a name=61:3></a> We have seen before that these are the two great subjects in connection with the gospel: namely, the meeting of the responsibility of man; and the counsels of God before ever there was a responsible man at all.<a name=61:4></a> These counsels are in the second Man, not in the first.<a name=61:5></a> The first man was the responsible one; the Lord Jesus is the Man of God's counsels, the last Adam or second Man.<a name=61:6></a> In Ephesians these counsels of God are taken up; in Romans the responsible man (in grace, but still responsible), sinners, every mouth stopped, and a propitiation through faith in Christ's blood, the whole question of God's meeting us in grace in our responsibility and failure, is fully brought out.<a name=61:7></a> In the Ephesians there is nothing of this.<a name=61:8></a> It begins with the counsels and intentions of God, and puts us in Christ.<a name=61:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the structure of the epistle is this.<a name=61:10></a> In chapter 1 we have these counsels of God as to glory, as to Christ, and as to our inheritance.<a name=61:11></a> Only at the end the apostle begins to unfold how far the foundation is laid for their accomplishment in what He has already done.<a name=61:12></a> So that, after stating the counsels, he enters on what God has done.<a name=61:13></a> That is, He has taken Christ from the dead and set Him up far above all heavens, principalities, and powers, and every name named.<a name=61:14></a> He commences, observe, with the raising of Christ from the dead.<a name=61:15></a> There you get not merely counsels, but the accomplishment, so far as exalting the second Man into glory above all heavens.<a name=61:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 2 shews how far God has accomplished that mighty work in us.<a name=61:17></a> We have been raised from being dead in sins and put into Christ, sitting in Him (not with Him, we are not there yet) in heavenly places.<a name=61:18></a> It is the operation of God putting us into His place.<a name=61:19></a> It is in Christ I am sitting, not with Him.<a name=61:20></a> This makes us God's workmanship; and then He brings us forth a step farther in making both Jews and Gentiles one.<a name=61:21></a> It is still what He has accomplished or is doing so far.<a name=61:22></a> He has put down the middle wall of partition, and reconciled us in one body by the cross, that is, down here; and He is not only building a holy temple to the Lord (it is not built yet), but we are builded together, Jews and Gentiles, for the habitation of God by the Spirit down here.<a name=61:23></a> This is what God has accomplished.<a name=61:24></a> He has raised Christ from the dead, and set Him in glory; He has raised us up spiritually from the dead and put us into Christ; He has abolished all differences of Jew and Gentiles, and He has not only made peace between Jew and Gentile, reconciling them, but He has reconciled them both in one body by the cross.<a name=61:25></a> They are reconciled to one another and reconciled to God, and they are going to be a temple, and they are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit, that is, down here.<a name=61:26></a> This is what is accomplished of His purposes, the foundation being laid for them all.<a name=61:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 follows another thing.<a name=62:1></a> It is neither God's counsels nor God's operation, but Paul's administration of all these, the dispensation committed to him.<a name=62:2></a> As to the substance of it, it is Paul's administration of the mystery, not God's counsels about it, but the apostle's administration of it; and at the end, as it refers to earth, there is the second prayer which is addressed to the Father of our Lord Jesus, where Christ is looked at as Son.<a name=62:3></a> The first prayer, which is found in chapter 1, is addressed to the God of our Lord Jesus as the glorified Man; but this is addressed to the Father, and Christ is looked at as Son, a divine Person.<a name=62:4></a> Therefore it is here not the object, or the thing objectively, but rather that Christ may dwell in our hearts, that is, power brought in down here according to His counsels.<a name=62:5></a> So that there is to be glory to God in the church in all ages.<a name=62:6></a> This is a power that works in us, as the other was toward us.<a name=62:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having the counsels, and the operation, and Paul's administration, the effect is looked for in chapter 4 as regards there being a habitation of God through the Spirit down here; and then, secondly, here too the individual gifts.<a name=62:8></a> This goes down to the end of verse 16.<a name=62:9></a> Verse 17 begins the ordinary exhortations as to how to walk.<a name=62:10></a> They were to walk together.<a name=62:11></a> All distinctions of Jew and Gentile have disappeared.<a name=62:12></a> He has brought them together as one habitation of God through the Spirit, and now they are to walk together and keep the unity of the Spirit.<a name=62:13></a> Then we go on to individual gifts, and in verse 17 we begin the practical exhortation for all saints, which is continued in chapter 5.<a name=62:14></a> At the end of chapter 5 occasion is taken from the case of the husband and wife to bring in the relationship of Christ and the church.<a name=62:15></a> After going into the different relationships in which saints are to be faithful, the conflict in heavenly places is taken up.<a name=62:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another thing may be remarked as to the epistle, that is, that everything refers to heavenly places; not that we are not upon earth, for we are, but that now to principalities and powers in heavenly places may be known through the church the wisdom of God.<a name=63:1></a> We are blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places, and we are sitting in heavenly places in Christ, we are a testimony to principalities and powers in heavenly places, and we are fighting with wicked spirits in heavenly places.<a name=63:2></a> Our blessing, our place, our testimony, and our conflict are all in these heavenly places.<a name=63:3></a> Now you will find that ministry here is connected with all these.<a name=63:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Farther, what God is working in chapter 2 is that the whole building effectually framed together groweth into a holy temple.<a name=63:5></a> It is only growing up to this end.<a name=63:6></a> But moreover "ye are builded together for a habitation of God.<a name=63:7></a>" This is taking place.<a name=63:8></a> The holy temple will be in glory.<a name=63:9></a> They are to be a building for a temple even as Christ said, "I will build my church.<a name=63:10></a>" The temple that is to be is that spoken of by the Lord in Matthew 16: "Upon the rock I will build my church, and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it.<a name=63:11></a>" You get it also in Peter, "Ye also as living stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood.<a name=63:12></a>" There they are built up stone after stone.<a name=63:13></a> So in Ephesians, "and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone, in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.<a name=63:14></a>" It is growing unto an holy temple, but it is not yet finished.<a name=63:15></a> The house that Christ builds is a perfect thing, it is not finished yet, but what people commonly call the invisible church.<a name=63:16></a> But then there is an actually manifested thing by the Holy Ghost being here: "Ye are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=63:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In short there are two characters of the assembly, the body of Christ, and the habitation of God now by the Holy Ghost.<a name=63:18></a> When we speak of the body of Christ, the members are looked at as united to the Head in heaven, and, spoken of as the house, will be a holy temple; when we speak of the habitation, it is by the Holy Ghost down here.<a name=63:19></a> It is the same thing as far as they went, but they soon ceased to be identical.<a name=63:20></a>

		In verse 21 it is a temple not yet completed; when it is completed, it will be in glory.<a name=64:1></a> We are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit (verse 22); this is the present thing.<a name=64:2></a> It is just the confounding of these two things that has made popery and ritualism.<a name=64:3></a> That is, they have attributed all the privileges which belong to what Christ is building and has not yet finished to the thing that is built on earth.<a name=64:4></a> Now when you get a thing built upon earth, God sets it up all right; but like everything else, like man himself when he was created, it is put into man's responsibility.<a name=64:5></a> God carries on His own purpose, and against what Christ builds the gates of hades shall never prevail.<a name=64:6></a> But always in the first instance, whatever God sets up, He puts into man's responsibility; and then it is all ruined.<a name=64:7></a> Nevertheless God's purpose is all accomplished in Christ.<a name=64:8></a> This is true of everything.<a name=64:9></a> It is true of Israel.<a name=64:10></a> It is true of individual saints, and of the whole church.<a name=64:11></a> What Christ is carrying on, the gates of hades shall not prevail against.<a name=64:12></a> The administration of it is on earth.<a name=64:13></a> In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul says, "As a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon.<a name=64:14></a> Let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<a name=64:15></a>" This is not Christ's building.<a name=64:16></a> It is not Christ carrying out, "I will build my church"; nor the living stones coming and growing into a holy temple.<a name=64:17></a> In the latter case there is no agent but Christ.<a name=64:18></a> It is He that is building; and therefore, of course, Satan's power cannot prevail against it.<a name=64:19></a> In 1 Corinthians 3 it is not Christ building; it is man's responsibility, as it is said, "Let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<a name=64:20></a>" Wood and hay and stubble can be built in; and if you attribute to wood and hay and stubble the security of what Christ is doing, you will be making a grave mistake.<a name=64:21></a> Papists and Puseyites are taking what has been built by man, and confounding it with Christ's work, saying the gates of hades cannot prevail against it.<a name=64:22></a> They confound two different works.<a name=64:23></a>

		Observe the two in Romans 8.<a name=85:11></a> "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" (that is, the new man) "hath made me free from the law of sin and death; for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=85:12></a>" When Christ was on the cross, He not only bore our sins and put them away, but God condemned sin in the flesh there, so that I see it is all put off.<a name=85:13></a> Faith reckons it.<a name=85:14></a> Christ died to sin; He is the only Person that died to sin; so God reckons us alive unto God, not in Adam, but in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=85:15></a> My life in which I live is not flesh: "ye are not in the flesh," but in Christ.<a name=85:16></a> When you come to realise it, you take the putting off first; you say I have put off the old man -- I am not a child of Adam -- and put on the new man, that is, Christ.<a name=85:17></a> In short I believe in the testimony of 1 John 5 where it is said, "this is the record [or, testimony] that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=85:18></a> He that hath the Son hath life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<a name=85:19></a>" It is entirely a new thing in Christ; and as a proof that eternal life is not in Adam but in Christ, he shews the Spirit, and the water, and the blood -- what has living power and what cleanses, what expiates -- all coming consequent upon Christ's death.<a name=85:20></a> The water came out of His dead side, as did also the blood, while the Spirit came after He was glorified.<a name=85:21></a> These are all witnesses that eternal life is not in the first man but in the Second.<a name=85:22></a> I reckon myself dead, I am crucified with Christ.<a name=85:23></a> Thus it is a nature that is after God Himself.<a name=85:24></a> Then we get another element -- the Holy Ghost dwells in me, and I am not to grieve Him.<a name=85:25></a>

		The putting off of the old and the putting on of the new occur at the same time really; but practically, when you come to details, you find you have the one first, and then you realise the other.<a name=85:26></a> In real truth you put on the new man first.<a name=85:27></a> When you come to practice, you have to treat the old thing as dead, and the other comes free.<a name=85:28></a> In point of fact we must get the new man in order to treat the old man as dead.<a name=85:29></a> If the old man was treated as dead first, I would have no man at all.<a name=85:30></a> When I have got Christ as my life, I come to look at myself, and it is all over with the old man.<a name=85:31></a> There are many who own that they must be born again, but they do not recognise that they put off the old man.<a name=85:32></a> The moment I have got the death and resurrection of Christ, I say I am not a debtor to the old man.<a name=85:33></a> This is not merely the fact of being born again; it is not merely saying I am born again, but the other thing I have put off, that is, to faith.<a name=85:34></a>

		Romans 8: 13 ("Ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body"), and Colossians 3: 5 ("mortify your members") are but a different way of expressing the same thing.<a name=86:1></a> In Romans we are not viewed as risen with Christ, whereas in Colossians and Ephesians we are.<a name=86:2></a> In Romans we are presented as dead with Christ, because the object of Romans never is to take us out of our place in this world.<a name=86:3></a> It shews us that we are in Christ, but at the same time still here; whereas in Colossians the apostle will not let them be alive in the world.<a name=86:4></a> "Why," he says, "as alive in the world, are ye subject to ordinances?<a name=86:5></a>" All ritualism flows from not knowing we are dead.<a name=86:6></a>

		The man is justified in Romans; he is a new creation entirely in Ephesians; while in Colossians you get both.<a name=87:1></a> In the latter there is death and the new creation, but not yet seated in heaven.<a name=87:2></a> They are looked at as on the earth, and there is a hope laid up for them in heaven -- "ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=87:3></a>" In chapter 2: 11, 12, we read, "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism [there I get the doctrine of Romans], wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead [I have now got beyond the Romans].<a name=87:4></a> And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him.<a name=87:5></a>" There we get Colossian doctrine, but it does not take us up to heaven.<a name=87:6></a> When he speaks of that in Ephesians he says, "He hath quickened us together with Christ, and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=87:7></a>" Colossians is, as it were, between Romans and Ephesians.<a name=87:8></a> Therefore in Colossians you get, instead of sitting in heavenly places, "set your affections or things above," "the hope that is laid up for you in heaven," and such expressions.<a name=87:9></a> He does not talk of the Holy Ghost in Colossians.<a name=87:10></a> What we find in Colossians is life, and this is as important in its place as the Holy Ghost dwelling in us.<a name=87:11></a> In Ephesians you get the Holy Ghost dwelling in us, and therefore the body; whereas in Colossians you never get the Holy Ghost mentioned except in the expression "your love in the Spirit.<a name=87:12></a>" For example, in Ephesians we read, "Putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour, for we are members one of another," whereas in Colossians he says, "Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds.<a name=87:13></a>" Instead of the Holy Ghost dwelling in us, it is God's nature the measure of how we are to behave ourselves.<a name=87:14></a>

		We have had the two subjective elements (that is, the state I am in) consisting of the new man, and the old man put off, and the Holy Ghost dwelling in us.<a name=88:12></a> Then follow as a measure the two essential names of God -- love and light.<a name=88:13></a> This is what Christ was in this world.<a name=88:14></a> "While I am in the world," He says, "I am the light of the world," and He was the expression of divine love.<a name=88:15></a> You are to be an imitator of God, and if you ask, How can that be carried out in man?<a name=88:16></a> you get Christ, that is, God manifested in a man.<a name=88:17></a> How clearly the thing is entirely above law!<a name=88:18></a> If law was carried out in the world, we should have the world all happy, and righteous, and peaceful; but this supposes the world to be all right.<a name=88:19></a> I am to care for another as much as for myself, but that will not do in this world, and therefore I get this, "He gave himself.<a name=88:20></a>" It is not taking love to self as the measure of love to my neighbour, but going beyond the law, and giving oneself up for others.<a name=88:21></a> If all went on rightly, the law would be your rule now, but it is otherwise.<a name=88:22></a> As Christians, when you come to a world of wickedness, you have to follow God.<a name=88:23></a><a name=89>[Page 89]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look at the double character of this love, which is entirely practical.<a name=89:1></a> There are two kinds -- what I may call love up and love down; and they are entirely different in kind.<a name=89:2></a> The care of a father and his child will illustrate the difference.<a name=89:3></a> The father loves down, and the child loves up; the one is to something above it, whereas the other is in condescending goodness.<a name=89:4></a> If you take a case of loving up, the more excellent the object the more excellent the affection.<a name=89:5></a> If one love a base thing, it is a base affection.<a name=89:6></a> If one love a man of noble character, it is a noble affection.<a name=89:7></a> If one love God, of course, it is the highest of all.<a name=89:8></a> Then on the other hand, if you take love down, the baser the object the greater the love.<a name=89:9></a> Such is the character of God's love to us.<a name=89:10></a> We get both in Christ.<a name=89:11></a> He loved His Father perfectly as Man (which was loving up), and He loved us when vile sinners (which was loving down); and we are to go and do likewise.<a name=89:12></a> Therefore I read here "as Christ hath loved us and given himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=89:13></a>" He gave Himself <i>for</i> us and <i>to</i> God.<a name=89:14></a> This is perfection.<a name=89:15></a> He had an infinitely high object, and an infinitely low one, and He was perfect both ways.<a name=89:16></a> We have to seek to walk as He walked.<a name=89:17></a> There is fellowship also one with another.<a name=89:18></a> Of course when we can see, the thing to imitate is Christ walking in love -- "as Christ loved us and gave himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God.<a name=89:19></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the side of love wherein you are imitators of God.<a name=89:20></a> Then you get the other essential name of God, and that is, light; which he says we are too.<a name=89:21></a> We are partakers of the divine nature -- "ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.<a name=89:22></a>" God is love, and God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.<a name=89:23></a> We were darkness, but now in Christ we are light in the Lord.<a name=89:24></a> "Awake, thou that sleepest, and Christ shall give thee light.<a name=89:25></a>" I get the full light in Christ, also the full love.<a name=89:26></a> Thus are the two essential names of God brought out.<a name=89:27></a> I am a partaker of the divine nature, and the Spirit of God dwells in me, and I am to act as God acted, and that acting was in Christ.<a name=89:28></a> "Awake, thou that sleepest," that is, looking at Christians, not committing sins, but gone to sleep in the world.<a name=89:29></a> In the world the people are all dead: but if a man goes to sleep, he is just as much alive as when awake, but he is as much as dead; he does not hear, nor speak, nor think; he is like a dead man.<a name=89:30></a> Look at the Christian that is going on with the world -- he is with the dead.<a name=89:31></a> What am I to do, then?<a name=89:32></a> Christ is the light of the world, and "ye are the light of the world," He says to His disciples.<a name=89:33></a> It is a wonderful exhibition.<a name=89:34></a>

		COMPARISON OF THE EPISTLES TO THE ROMANS AND THE EPHESIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An attentive consideration of the Epistle to the Romans and that to the Ephesians, will afford us some interesting light on the question of the position of the believer in Christ.<a name=103:1></a> The whole question of our place in Christ is viewed under a different aspect in the two epistles.<a name=103:2></a> I would briefly consider this.<a name=103:3></a> The doctrine of redeeming grace may be viewed in two ways.<a name=103:4></a> God's own purposes as to His children in glory may be developed on the one hand; or the condition of man portrayed, and met by grace visiting them in mercy to deliver them on the other.<a name=103:5></a> The Epistle to the Ephesians follows the first of these methods; the Epistle to the Romans, the second.<a name=103:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians we have at once the saints blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ -- placed in the blessed image of God before Him, and adopted to be His children.<a name=103:7></a> Redemption itself comes as a means in the second place.<a name=103:8></a> The knowledge of the mystery -- the gathering together in one all things in Christ, and our sealing as heirs till the redemption of the purchased possession follow.<a name=103:9></a> The Romans, after some introductory verses, commences by the description of the dreadful state in which fallen man was, unfolding the depravity of the Gentiles, the hypocrisy of those who pretended to moralise and yet were personally no better, and finally the sad condition of the Jews, who, if they had the law, broke it.<a name=103:10></a> In chapter 3, at the close, grace meets this state.<a name=103:11></a> But this leads to the consideration of the work of grace, in each epistle, in a different way.<a name=103:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To speak first of the Ephesians, the sinner is seen dead in trespasses and sins -- walking, doubtless, in them, but, before God, wholly dead.<a name=103:13></a> But even here this is not the first object presented.<a name=103:14></a> As chapter 1 presents the position in which the saint is placed, so the second the work which brings him into it.<a name=103:15></a> With this view, what is first brought before us is God's power towards us manifested in what was wrought in Christ.<a name=103:16></a> God had raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His right hand, far above all principality and power, above and beyond all created glory, not only in this age, but in that to come, where all hierarchies will be in their true glory and unclouded elevation, but He above and out of them all.<a name=103:17></a> Divine power in its exceeding greatness had brought Him from death up there.<a name=103:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the origin of our life is before all worlds (John 1; 1 John 1), so our place before God is out of and above all worlds and creature powers.<a name=104:1></a> It is to be remarked here, however, that Christ Himself is looked at as already dead.<a name=104:2></a> The whole work is thus of God; for Christ being dead, is looked at, of course, as Man, and this wondrous power is exerted, and He, as Man, is at God's right hand.<a name=104:3></a> Then the saints are brought before us, Gentiles or Jews, as alike children of wrath by nature, and are seen once utterly dead in trespasses and sins, quickened together with Him, and raised up together, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=104:4></a> The whole is entirely God's work.<a name=104:5></a> We are created again.<a name=104:6></a> It is not living men who have to be dealt with, who are without law and under law, must die with Christ, and are set free by death.<a name=104:7></a> They are found dead in sins, and we get the perfect full blessing of the work, because it is entirely God's.<a name=104:8></a> Man is for nothing therein, for what has he to do with creation?<a name=104:9></a> He is created; all that man (that is, the believer) is is God's work.<a name=104:10></a> Hence, also, remark, we have peace, making nigh, reconciling, exalting to sit in heavenly places in Christ, but not justifying; because it is a living, responsible, existing man who has to be justified before God.<a name=104:11></a> But we have Christ exalted, and ourselves exalted in Him.<a name=104:12></a> It is God's work in Christ and in us, not our being justified before God.<a name=104:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I turn now to the Romans, it is otherwise.<a name=104:14></a> I get Christ alive on the earth, come of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared Son of God with power by resurrection.<a name=104:15></a> Still flesh could not live unto God, nor they that are in it please Him.<a name=104:16></a> Hence we find Christ as come in grace for them, not dead but dying, and then alive to God.<a name=104:17></a> I get the condition and quality of man, not simply the work of God as to one dead.<a name=104:18></a> So as to men; I get the means of standing in righteousness before God, and not an absolute work.<a name=104:19></a> Nor is this all.<a name=104:20></a> In the Romans the exaltation of Christ to the right hand of God is not contemplated, nor the union of the church with Him.<a name=104:21></a> Hence we are not said to be quickened together with Him, nor made to sit in heavenly places in Him.<a name=104:22></a> His exaltation is just mentioned in chapter 8, with "who even is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us" -- which last thought does not, of course, contemplate union.<a name=104:23></a> In chapter 12 the practical effect of union among ourselves is spoken of; but, in general, these topics form no part of the instruction of the epistle.<a name=104:24></a> Men are living, guilty beings, the whole world guilty before God; and to learn that, in the remediless state of their nature, death is the only remedy; in itself fatal, doubtless, but perfectly saving when in Christ.<a name=104:25></a> It is atonement for all sin, and deliverance from the position in which we were: for death is evidently the end of that, and our life thus wholly new, Christ being risen from the dead, and we are to walk as alive to God through Him.<a name=104:26></a> We are justified by His blood; and the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.<a name=104:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=105>[Page 105]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Romans, as teaching the justification of a sinner, necessarily first views him as a sinner to be justified.<a name=105:1></a> Hence it goes through the whole question of law; and we have the experiences of the man not justified, though convinced of sin, and then justified from the sin -- alive in conscience without law, dying under law, and alive in Christ, where there is no condemnation.<a name=105:2></a> The practical process is gone through.<a name=105:3></a> The effect is this, that he is brought up to the point where the Epistle to the Ephesians begins with him.<a name=105:4></a> He finds that there is no escape from the condition he is in, as a child of Adam, or a Jew, but by death.<a name=105:5></a> Yet, were it his own, it would of course, lead him to judgment, not to justification, but where all guilt is proved.<a name=105:6></a> It is Christ who dies, and is set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood; so that God is just, and the justifier of him that believes in Jesus.<a name=105:7></a> That meets the case of guilt, but is not life; for so Christ would be dead, and we brought in Him into death.<a name=105:8></a> This could not in any way be.<a name=105:9></a> For not only would there be no life, but it would even prove, as the apostle shews in 1 Corinthians 15, that there was no remedy.<a name=105:10></a> Our faith would be vain; we should be yet in our sins.<a name=105:11></a> But we believe that God has raised up our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.<a name=105:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequence of this different view of things is seen in the practical result in man under the operation of God's Spirit.<a name=105:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		In the Romans we have experiences flowing from the conflict of the newly introduced principle of life with flesh, or the effect of deliverance from it, by the knowledge of the power of deliverance in Christ.<a name=105:14></a> The former we find in chapter 7, where the conflict of the new nature with the lusts and will of the old under law are depicted; and the second in chapter 8, where the spiritual blessings of one who is made free from the law of sin and death, by the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, are drawn out before us in a way to produce the profoundest interest in the soul that enters into it.<a name=105:15></a><a name=106>[Page 106]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Ephesians the man is dead in sins, and transported into heavenly places by the operation of God; being created anew in Christ Jesus, unto good works, which God has afore prepared, that we might walk in them.<a name=106:1></a> The works belong to the new place and condition in which alone we are known in the Ephesians.<a name=106:2></a> God has afore prepared works for His new created ones.<a name=106:3></a> Hence, we have no experience of passing through conflict, and deliverance, and its results; but there is a demand to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called, and a desire that the saints, being rooted and grounded in love, may realise in their hearts, by Christ's dwelling in them by faith, the full effect, even to filling to all the fulness of God, the greatness of the infinite scene of glory into which they are brought, and know that love of Christ which passeth knowledge.<a name=106:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In result the general principle of the difference is this.<a name=106:5></a> In the Romans, the man is found alive in sin, is convicted of it, and has (Christ having died for him to put it away) to come, in the conviction of the hopeless badness of his nature, to death, and then rising again, alive through Jesus Christ, be thus justified before God, and by God, on the one hand, and alive in a new life on the other; then nothing shall separate him from the love of Christ.<a name=106:6></a> In the Ephesians the man is found dead in sins; but then he is raised up, and set in heavenly places in Christ (according to the power in which Christ, when dead, was raised of God, and set in the heavenly places, far above principalities and powers, and every name that is named), and brought as a new creation, children withal, and heirs into immediate nearness to God.<a name=106:7></a> The additional truth is brought out, that we are united to Christ in this place, as members of His body, and His heavenly bride.<a name=106:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot here -- time does not allow it -- do more than draw out the great general principles of the different aspects of truth presented by the two epistles.<a name=106:9></a> He who searches as a devout learner into the truth of God, will, I am sure, find (in what I here notice in these epistles) elements of deep and profitable instruction, as to his own relationship with God, the Christianity of his soul and of the word, and of his soul according to the word.<a name=106:10></a> Perhaps some one, for his own and our edification, may furnish us with further results which flow from it.<a name=106:11></a>

		COMPARISON OF EPISTLES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The comparison of certain epistles illustrates with much interest and instruction the path of the Christian.<a name=107:1></a> I send you the thoughts which have suggested the remark.<a name=107:2></a> I refer particularly to the Epistle of Peter, Colossians, and Ephesians.<a name=107:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Peter we have Christ risen, having accomplished redemption; then His own actings, in that resurrection, of that power of life which is the spring of all our hope, and sets it in lively exercise towards its end, which is in heaven, and hence makes a man, and even a Jew (who once had other thoughts), a stranger and a pilgrim here.<a name=107:4></a> We will examine this in the statements of the epistles.<a name=107:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to make my meaning more clear, I will first refer to the Ephesians.<a name=107:6></a> There the saints are seen sitting in heaven -- there already -- not on the way there; their conflicts and position in general flow from this.<a name=107:7></a> Hence they are seen risen with Christ, seated in heavenly places in Him, and this, through union with their Head, by the Holy Ghost sent down; on which last great fact their earthly position also depends.<a name=107:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Colossians is based indeed on the same principle; but there they were in danger of not holding the Head.<a name=107:9></a> Hence they are addressed on somewhat lower ground, and urged up to the point which should have been the spring from which their thoughts and feelings flowed.<a name=107:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To turn now to the epistles themselves, remark, in Peter, the ground on which the Spirit of God places the saints, the sojourners of the dispersion, that is, the believing Jews scattered through the provinces.<a name=107:11></a> They are "begotten again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<a name=107:12></a>" It is not that they are not risen with Him.<a name=107:13></a> Of course they were; yet they are not viewed under this aspect, but as redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot; travelling through the wilderness towards Canaan -- not seated in the land eating of the old corn of it (whatever conflicts were before them there), but through the efficacy of redemption made strangers and pilgrims in the desert.<a name=107:14></a> It is the Christian's place here below -- not the privilege and joy of faith, but the life of faith; and hence, all through which he passes here become not distractions for his heart, whether painful or pleasant, but trials of his faith.<a name=107:15></a> This is exceedingly gracious and loving of our God (and what is not?<a name=107:16></a>), and the consequences in many respects exceedingly precious.<a name=107:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=108>[Page 108]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Ephesians we have, however, the Christian in another point of view.<a name=108:1></a> Heaven is not presented as a hope; the Christian is there.<a name=108:2></a> It is not that the resurrection of Christ has begotten him to such a hope; the same power which raised Christ, and set Him at the right hand of God, far above all principality and power, has wrought in him; and he is raised up together with Him, quickened together, and sitting in heavenly places in Him.<a name=108:3></a> Thus he is viewed as in heaven in Christ the Head, not as hoping to arrive there.<a name=108:4></a> Peter views him as toiling along the road, being redeemed by the precious blood of Christ -- as Israel in the desert, with Canaan before them; the Ephesians, as sitting there in his Head, Christ.<a name=108:5></a> Hence neither is the coming of Christ presented as a hope in the Ephesians.<a name=108:6></a> What is set before us in the way of hope, in the form of intelligence communicated of God, is the gathering together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth -- in Him in whom we have received an inheritance.<a name=108:7></a> The power which has wrought in Christ has wrought in the believer, God having given Christ to be "the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=108:8></a>" God, of His great love wherewith He has loved us, has, when we were all together children of wrath, quickened us together with Him, and made us sit, raised up together, in heavenly places in Him.<a name=108:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Colossians, at first sight, we seem to have lost this position.<a name=108:10></a> But the epistle does but serve to bring out more distinctly the great and precious truth.<a name=108:11></a> The apostle is obliged to bring out heaven prominently before them.<a name=108:12></a> They needed this; and we have, as in Peter, "the hope which is laid<a href="#108:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before.<a name=108:13></a>" Why this difference where, nevertheless, Christ is put forward as the Head of the body?<a name=108:14></a> They were beginning alas!<a name=108:15></a> to be beguiled, and to be subject to ordinances, not holding the Head.<a name=108:16></a> But the apostle urges them, as it were, back to the point from which they were slipping away.<a name=108:17></a> He presses on them their resurrection with Christ; once dead in trespasses and sins, but buried in baptism with Him, and raised through faith in the operation of God who hath raised Him.<a name=108:18></a> If dead with Christ, how could they, as alive, be subject to what related to flesh and perished with it?<a name=108:19></a> And then he draws the conclusion, which associates the two practically: "If then ye be risen with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.<a name=108:20></a> Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth; for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=108:21></a>" This was their real position.<a name=108:22></a> They were indeed in danger of slipping away from it; but he urges them upward to their privilege and place in Christ.<a name=108:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the coming of the Lord, it is also introduced in a way which remarkably confirms this character of instruction.<a name=109:1></a> They were not taught to wait for Him as if they were on earth, and He to appear.<a name=109:2></a> Nor is it omitted in order to contemplate their association with Him in heaven.<a name=109:3></a> His appearance is spoken of; but then their association with Him, in a life which is with Him now hidden in God, is pressed upon them, by this remarkable truth, that when He appears, so identified were they with Him that they would appear with Him.<a name=109:4></a> Their hearts and affections, then, are urged upwards, but it was to lay hold on the consciousness that they were one with Him that was there.<a name=109:5></a> Their life was hid with Him there, but they were not holding the Head as they ought.<a name=109:6></a> I do not go farther here; perhaps I may, at another time, notice the different way the Lord's coming is spoken of connected with this.<a name=109:7></a>

		WHAT GOD IS TO US IN CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ephesians 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which we may look at our relationship to God, and rightly: first, our coming to Him; and secondly, our souls looking at the dealings of God towards us.<a name=110:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of Abel, it is said, by the Holy Spirit, God had respect unto his gifts -- he came with his needed offering.<a name=110:2></a> We are looked at in the Epistle to the Hebrews as drawing near to God.<a name=110:3></a> Who could draw near unless he could bring Christ as an offering?<a name=110:4></a> We must have that sacrifice in order to bring us near, consequently in that case our relationship to God is measured by our need.<a name=110:5></a> We come near because we find we cannot do without it, and we accept that offering as needed to accomplish it.<a name=110:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In another way, the measure of God's blessing we never know until we look on our relationship as measured by God's thoughts of us -- by all that which He loves to display when He satisfies His own heart of grace with His ways of shewing it out.<a name=110:7></a> We never enjoy our true blessing unless we see how He thus feels and acts.<a name=110:8></a> My mind must rise above what I am, to what God is; then it is my mind is formed by the revelation of what God is.<a name=110:9></a> To this we are called.<a name=110:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must come in by our need, as the prodigal did.<a name=110:11></a> Man cannot by searching find out God.<a name=110:12></a> There cannot be any knowledge of God in grace by man's competency to know Him.<a name=110:13></a> There would be no need of grace if he could know God without it.<a name=110:14></a> If I can claim this grace, I do not need grace at all.<a name=110:15></a> The way a sinner must come in must be by his need; in that way he learns grace, learns love.<a name=110:16></a> But when I have got to God, it is another thing.<a name=110:17></a> Then He would form our minds and hearts by what He is Himself.<a name=110:18></a> I come as a sinner, because I need it -- just as a hungry man needs food; but when brought, I have fellowship with the God who has brought me to Himself.<a name=110:19></a> The measure is given in this epistle -- "growing up into Christ, in all things.<a name=110:20></a>" It is a wonderful thing that God has called us into fellowship with Himself -- to have the same thoughts, the same feelings as God, and to have them together.<a name=110:21></a> All flows down from Him and we are brought into it by grace, and we enjoy it just so far as we are emptied of self.<a name=110:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, He makes us partakers of the divine nature -- the same nature as Himself.<a name=110:23></a> This gives the capacity -- I do not say power.<a name=110:24></a> The new nature is capacity; the Holy Ghost is power.<a name=110:25></a> The new nature is entirely dependent and obedient.<a name=110:26></a> The Holy Ghost being there gives me power.<a name=110:27></a> In the first Epistle of John this capacity is brought out in a remarkable manner (chapter 4).<a name=110:28></a> Every one that loveth is born of God -- has this nature; and he that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.<a name=110:29></a> Then being partakers of His nature, we, by virtue of the blood being sprinkled on us, have received the Holy Ghost which gives power.<a name=110:30></a> In order to communion there must be perfect peace as regards the conscience.<a name=110:31></a> There is no communion in conscience.<a name=110:32></a> I am alone as to my conscience, and so are you.<a name=110:33></a> In order to communion, I must have nothing to settle with conscience: a perfectly purged conscience is the basis of communion.<a name=110:34></a> We must know that God has settled the whole question of sin.<a name=110:35></a> The moment a child of God fails, communion ceases.<a name=110:36></a> The Spirit then becomes a reprover to bring him back; but there is no communion.<a name=110:37></a> Communion is the full enjoyment of God and of divine things; when there is nothing to think of as regards oneself.<a name=110:38></a> God can now let flow into his heart who has a conscience purged, all that He delights in.<a name=110:39></a> He loves to communicate what He Himself has joy in.<a name=110:40></a> All that Christ is is for us to enjoy.<a name=110:41></a> You are called into this place of Christ Himself -- He, the Head of the body; and that the delight God has in Christ should flow down into your heart.<a name=110:42></a> How rich then the saint must be!<a name=110:43></a> but he is entirely dependent on the Spirit of God for power.<a name=110:44></a> There is no power to enjoy anything without Him.<a name=110:45></a> There must be an emptying from self to enjoy what He gives.<a name=110:46></a> The Spirit of God has no place to act where self and imagination are in exercise.<a name=110:47></a> It is not the glory at the end that is so much the object of the believer's thoughts, as the source of it -- God Himself.<a name=110:48></a> There is more happiness in the fact of being in communion with Him than in the things He communicates: and I say again, because of its importance, a soul cannot have the enjoyment of the things of God without having peace, which is connected with the conscience.<a name=110:49></a>

		The beginning of this chapter shews how we are presented to God.<a name=111:1></a> It is a test, whether the judgment-seat brings any terror to your minds.<a name=111:2></a> Does it give you any uneasiness?<a name=111:3></a> How does the saint get there?<a name=111:4></a> Christ comes to fetch him.<a name=111:5></a> He said, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself.<a name=111:6></a>" Do you ever think of your coming before the judgment-seat being the effect of His having come to fetch you?<a name=111:7></a> Not sending or you, but coming Himself for you, because of His desire to have you with Him where He is, to be fashioned into the same image.<a name=111:8></a> You are to bear the image of the heavenly, as you have borne the image of the earthy.<a name=111:9></a> When you are there before the judgment-seat, you will be with Him, and like Him: every trace of God's unwearied hand, all His patience, here brought out.<a name=111:10></a> We shall be like the One who is the Judge.<a name=111:11></a> You will never (I speak, of course, to saints now) be before the judgment-seat of Christ without His coming to fetch you into the same glory in which you are to be.<a name=111:12></a> It is the knowledge of grace, or redemption, that leaves me at perfect liberty; and all my life should be a witness to the enjoyment of this blessedness into which we are being brought.<a name=111:13></a> The whole of this is through looking at Christ.<a name=111:14></a> He is the Firstborn among many brethren in the Father's house.<a name=111:15></a> We shall be with Christ and like Christ before God the Father.<a name=111:16></a> There will be the blessedness of being with Christ, in the presence of the Father, loved as He is loved.<a name=111:17></a> This is what we have in this chapter -- set in the presence of God.<a name=111:18></a>

		THE PRAYERS IN EPHESIANS 1: 15-23 AND 3: 14-21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One prayer is attached to the name of the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, because He is looked at as Man; the other to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, because He is looked at as Son.<a name=116:1></a> The beginning of chapter I gave us God's calling, that we should be "holy and without blame before him in love," that we might receive "the adoption of sons.<a name=116:2></a>" After stating His purpose concerning Christ Himself, that all things are to be gathered together in one in Him, the apostle goes on to the inheritance of which the Holy Ghost is the earnest, and then to the prayer for them on this ground.<a name=116:3></a> At the very close of the chapter he adds our relationship to Christ Himself, "the church which is his body.<a name=116:4></a>" It is always well for us to remember that Christ has purified to Himself a peculiar people, a people of possession, and we cannot rise up to the counsels of God and mind of Christ unless we be brought into these intentions of God.<a name=116:5></a> The most immediate and closest object of His thoughts is His saints.<a name=116:6></a> I necessarily take in all saints if I am in His thoughts; I cannot have the mind of Christ without taking in all of them; it is the very spirit of Christ Himself.<a name=116:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two parts in this prayer of the apostle.<a name=116:8></a> The first is, that they might know the place itself; the second, that they should know the power that brought them there.<a name=116:9></a> The very fulness of the blessing we have got is that we are blessed with Him.<a name=116:10></a> As we were associated with the first Adam in ruin, so we are associated with the second Man in glory.<a name=116:11></a> There is nothing He has that He does not bring us into.<a name=116:12></a> This is the character of perfect love.<a name=116:13></a> Christ gives "not as the world giveth.<a name=116:14></a>" The world may give generously sometimes, but it has done with what it gives; Christ gives by introducing His own into what He is enjoying Himself.<a name=116:15></a> Take glory: "the glory which thou gavest me I have given them.<a name=116:16></a>" Take joy: "that my joy might remain in you.<a name=116:17></a>" Take peace: "peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.<a name=116:18></a>" Take love: "that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=116:19></a>" Having become man and accomplished perfect redemption, He would not take the inheritance without His joint-heirs.<a name=116:20></a> He is the source and head of all the glory that is given.<a name=116:21></a> "What is the hope of His calling?<a name=116:22></a>" Not of your calling -- this would not do at all.<a name=116:23></a> Here it has the fullest and highest character.<a name=116:24></a> He takes the heart up to these thoughts and counsels of God.<a name=116:25></a> We are called to be before God holy and without blame; we are called to be in Christ's place before God, before the Father, perfectly answering to His love.<a name=116:26></a> He does not pray that they may have it, but that they may know it.<a name=116:27></a>

		As to His inheritance in the saints, if our minds took in the Jewish place compared with our own, this would be extremely simple.<a name=117:1></a> Whose land was Israel's?<a name=117:2></a> It was God's inheritance; and those in whom He inherited it were Israel.<a name=117:3></a> We are not an inheritance, but we are heirs of God.<a name=117:4></a> We have nothing below what God would have in His mind here.<a name=117:5></a>

		Observe the prayer is, "that the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened.<a name=117:6></a>" We must not think that we ought not to know these things.<a name=117:7></a> The New Testament carefully tells us that we have them laid open to us expressly.<a name=117:8></a> "But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.<a name=117:9></a>" "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" -- such was the state of the Jews; but it is not our state.<a name=117:10></a> These things are not only given to us, but we are given to understand them; we are not in the condition of the Old Testament at all.<a name=117:11></a> In 1 Corinthians 2 we have the three steps; revelation by the Holy Ghost; communication of the word given by the Holy Ghost; and the reception of the word by the Holy Ghost.<a name=117:12></a>

		Take the account of the heavenly city in the Apocalypse -- it means something.<a name=117:13></a> All those images are characteristic in Scripture; I quite admit they are only figures, but they convey thoughts.<a name=117:14></a> The more we live in the mind of God, the more intelligent we are.<a name=117:15></a> The same things I see through a glass darkly, I shall see more clearly, but not differently.<a name=117:16></a> Thus the "white stone" is a symbol full of power.<a name=117:17></a> We have common joys, but there is the immediate approbation of Christ to the individual.<a name=117:18></a> "Gold" is always the sign of divine righteousness in itself.<a name=117:19></a> In the laver the priests were to wash and be clean; but with the sea of glass like crystal I walk upon purity.<a name=117:20></a> So "fire" is judgment, as "a sea of glass mingled with fire"; it is perfect purity as the result of judgment.<a name=117:21></a> "The street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.<a name=117:22></a>" Instead of walking through the dirt of this world, I am to walk in holiness and righteousness according to God.<a name=117:23></a> In the Apocalypse we do not go beyond the idea of God in government.<a name=117:24></a>

		Now we come to the power that brings us into these things.<a name=118:1></a> "According to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead.<a name=118:2></a>" What an immense truth there is in connection with this!<a name=118:3></a> The Messiah was not merely the promised Son of David, but the One in whom all God's counsels would be accomplished.<a name=118:4></a> He went down below all things, and then goes far above all heavens.<a name=118:5></a> This dead Man is raised above all principality and power.<a name=118:6></a> He had gone down into the place of death, and men are consequently looked at as dead in sins, not as living in them.<a name=118:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to note here that to look at the sinner as alive in sins, or as dead in them, is just the same state, but a different aspect of it.<a name=118:8></a> In Romans man is seen alive in sins, and Christ meeting that state.<a name=118:9></a> There is nothing of justification in Ephesians, not a single stir of life there; we were dead in the sins, and Christ died for the sins.<a name=118:10></a> God comes in and takes us all up together, looked at as in the mind and counsels of God.<a name=118:11></a> God quickens us together with Him.<a name=118:12></a> Christ comes down to this place of death, having cleansed our sins on the road, and God raises Him.<a name=118:13></a> Man is looked at consequently as united to Christ.<a name=118:14></a> This you do not find in the other epistles.<a name=118:15></a> The same power has wrought in every individual who believes in Christ that wrought in Him.<a name=118:16></a> Christ had gone into death for us, entering into the whole thing in grace and finding us where we were, and, He having wrought the work that entitles Him to take us out of it, we are raised with Him, seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=118:17></a> This is your place; He does not ask you what you think about it!<a name=118:18></a> There is no person who has the Spirit of Christ without this as his place.<a name=118:19></a> We are waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body, but one must be either in Christ or out of Christ.<a name=118:20></a> There are never two places for the Christian.<a name=118:21></a>

		All things are to be put under Christ's feet as Man, for God "gave him to be head over all things to the church, which is his body" -- a short sentence, but the whole mystery is in it.<a name=118:22></a> It is a quotation of Psalm 8, "all things are put under his feet.<a name=118:23></a>" In Psalm 2 He is seen as Son of David, King of Zion, Son of God.<a name=118:24></a> Nathanael refers to this psalm; and Jesus says to him, "Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.<a name=118:25></a>" He is rejected, and then comes out Psalm 8.<a name=118:26></a> Now He is crowned with glory and honour, but we do not see all things put under His feet yet.<a name=118:27></a> He is now sitting on the Father's throne.<a name=118:28></a> "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne.<a name=118:29></a>" "Sit thou on my right hand," says Jehovah, "till I make thine enemies thy footstool.<a name=118:30></a>" The day of grace is before that "till.<a name=118:31></a>" There is our comfort and blessing, that He has finished the work for His friends.<a name=118:32></a> "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them which are sanctified.<a name=118:33></a>" We stand therefore between the work which He perfected at His first coming, and His second coming.<a name=118:34></a> We are not, like the Jews, waiting to see that His offering is accepted, because the Holy Ghost is come out meanwhile and seals those who believe in Christ.<a name=118:35></a> I know the acceptance; I know that He is our forerunner.<a name=118:36></a> Then He deals with His enemies.<a name=118:37></a> When thus set over all things, the Son Himself will be subject to Him who put all things under Him -- a most blessed truth for us.<a name=118:38></a> He will reign while He brings all into absolute order for God; when this has been done, He will take His place as Man and never give it up.<a name=118:39></a> He is the first-born among many brethren.<a name=118:40></a> Over everything He created, He is set as Man: but a head without a body would not be complete.<a name=118:41></a> The supplement is wanting; the church is His body.<a name=118:42></a>

		Thus, if in chapter 1 we have exterior power bringing up Christ, or ourselves by grace, into a position of glory at God's right hand, in chapter 3 we find divine power in us as in the position, and we sought to be strengthened and filled accordingly, in order to realise what it and God Himself is in the fulness of it.<a name=120:1></a> It is not God dealing with man, but Christ's relation as Son and dwelling in us by faith -- He, the centre and divinely entitled light of the fulness and display, dwelling in us to give competency to enter into all the scene.<a name=120:2></a> Rooted and grounded in love we are at the centre thus in its moral or rather divine springs, and so embrace all that partake of the divine nature, because it is the action of that nature.<a name=120:3></a> Thus we look out into the wide extended scene of glory, whose limit none can tell; yet still this is a display, not a source, a scene, not Himself.<a name=120:4></a> In love we are at the source of all.<a name=120:5></a> We know the love of Christ that passes knowledge.<a name=120:6></a> What I know it in has made it wholly and peculiarly mine, yes, mine as being nothing in it.<a name=120:7></a> Christ is divine, infinite in nature.<a name=120:8></a> It is so proved in the way it adapts itself to all my wants and weakness, known in adapting itself to them, yet known in itself.<a name=120:9></a> As Christ's love it is for man, is manifested in man, and adapts itself to man; yet therein as divine it passes knowledge and brings man, as spiritual (he can feel, think, and apprehend as man), into the enjoyment of the scene, in which God is displayed, and to God Himself according to His own fulness, and this filled with love as in the centre of it consciously.<a name=120:10></a> It is we, not brought into a scene by power, but filled up to the measure of the fulness of God, Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith.<a name=120:11></a> Thus love is the spring of power in us, so that we estimate the scene of that fulness according to the title, character, and nature of God in it, He Himself being the ultimate blessedness of which we are conscious.<a name=120:12></a> What makes us familiar there is, that that which is in us, and which is the central light of all, is One we know, who dwells in us by faith, the nearest and most confided in of all, yet the fulness of Deity is in Him.<a name=120:13></a> Compare Revelation 21: 23.<a name=120:14></a>

		We get here the whole scope of God's thoughts and purposes.<a name=122:1></a> The Epistle to the Ephesians takes in two things: the presence and power of the Holy Ghost on earth, and the condition that we are in as the result of it; and what this is founded on, the exaltation of Christ at God's right hand.<a name=122:2></a> Ephesians does not speak of the coming of the Lord, because the way our glory is brought about is not its subject, but the present blessing of the saints.<a name=122:3></a> There is a distinct part at the end where our conflict with Satan comes in, but the general scope is what I have said: the basis, the exaltation of Christ; then purpose, what is in God's mind; and then the knowledge of it, by the Holy Ghost come down.<a name=122:4></a> "He raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand"; this was needed for us to know our place and the most important consequences flowing from it down here.<a name=122:5></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost who has come down from heaven, the seal of our being heirs, and the earnest of the inheritance, is our present condition, based upon Christ raised to the right hand of God.<a name=122:6></a> A Man is sitting at the right hand of God: a wonderful truth for us.<a name=122:7></a> His "delights are with the sons of men.<a name=122:8></a>" Being a Man, and having died and therein perfectly glorified God, God has raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His own right hand; and thereupon the Holy Ghost is come down here, so that we are associated with Him and the things that are on high, in heart and mind, though not yet there as to our bodies.<a name=122:9></a> This is where the heart has to be; our conversation is in heaven, for the Lord is there, not here; He is coming to make our bodies like unto His glorious body, but at present we have the Holy Ghost associating us with the place where He is.<a name=122:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has "blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=122:11></a>" That is God's mind.<a name=122:12></a> We are not yet there in fact, but it is the thought of God about us, and we ought to have it always before us.<a name=122:13></a> Blessings of the Jews in earthly places under Christ will be fulfilled in time, but for us it is "spiritual blessings," and "in heavenly places," and "in Christ" Himself; and our present connection with it all comes through the Holy Ghost.<a name=122:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We next get, in verses 4 and 5, two aspects of these spiritual blessings: they are brought before us in connection with the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=122:15></a> That is, Christ is looked at as Son and looked at as Man.<a name=122:16></a> The Father owned Him in manhood as the Son in Matthew 3, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<a name=122:17></a>" God is called the God of our Lord Jesus Christ as Man; He is called His Father as Son.<a name=122:18></a>

		This is the great basis of the wonderful place in which we are.<a name=123:1></a> It is man that God has in His mind put in this place of glory in His own Son.<a name=123:2></a> And this is not without its consequences, and those of the very highest nature.<a name=123:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's choosing us before the foundation of the world is not what affirms in the time of choosing the sovereignty of grace, for, supposing for a moment that God were to choose us now, it would be just as sovereign an act as doing it then.<a name=123:4></a> The practical truth brought out in His choosing us before the foundation of the world is, that it proves that we have nothing whatever to do with the world; before its very foundation we were chosen; we have nothing to do with it but to get through it.<a name=123:5></a> God would bring us into this blessedness with Himself which has nothing to do with the world.<a name=123:6></a> We have just to go through it "unspotted"; that is all we have to do with it.<a name=123:7></a> Our living place was settled with God before ever it existed.<a name=123:8></a> God had this thought to have a people in Christ, "holy and without blame before him in love.<a name=123:9></a>" This is what God Himself is.<a name=123:10></a> He thus brings us to be according to His own nature -- "holy and without blame" before Himself.<a name=123:11></a> We have an infinite object before whom we are, and having the divine nature we can enjoy that object.<a name=123:12></a> We are not taken out of the world yet, nor are meant to be; but we are to pass through it as Christ did.<a name=123:13></a> If one look at it in another point of view, it is just what Christ was Himself, and that before God.<a name=123:14></a> This is the thought of God.<a name=123:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then (verse 5) I get the Father.<a name=123:16></a> He might have had servants like the angels, but this was not His thought: "He predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself.<a name=123:17></a>" He insists on that, it is the blessed part of it -- that it is before God, and to Himself as Father.<a name=123:18></a> If it be a relationship, it is to Himself.<a name=123:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have the nature, "holy and without blame.<a name=123:20></a>" It does not say there "according to the good pleasure of his will," for God could not have beings in His presence in a sinful state.<a name=123:21></a> But when it is relationship, it is "according to the good pleasure of his will": He chooses to have us as sons.<a name=123:22></a> I get love, the nature of God -- "in love" -- and love of predilection too.<a name=123:23></a> The place we get into is one that is according to the good pleasure of His will, and He brings us according to His own nature before Himself; there is not a cloud because He has "made us accepted in the beloved" -- Christ assuredly; but He gives that name to Him to mark the full character of the blessedness, and thus brings us into His own presence.<a name=123:24></a>

		This is the purpose; it does not say here how much of it is accomplished: it will not be fully until we are in the glory.<a name=124:1></a> Only in the end of the chapter we get what is accomplished in fact, as the groundwork of all our present enjoyment of it in spirit.<a name=124:2></a> God takes Christ out of death and sets Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places.<a name=124:3></a> This is an accomplished thing; it is "wrought in Christ": Christ as Man is in the glory of God.<a name=124:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we get the third thing: the Holy Ghost has come down meanwhile.<a name=124:5></a> Before the purpose is accomplished, but when the work in Christ is accomplished, the Holy Ghost comes down, the seal with which God has sealed those here who have part in His purpose, and the earnest of their inheritance.<a name=124:6></a> We are then competent to see God's plans about Christ Himself, His purpose "to gather together in one all things in him, both which are in heaven and which are on earth.<a name=124:7></a>" Then it is glory.<a name=124:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first verses were our calling; now it is our inheritance.<a name=124:9></a> And this inheritance is "after the counsel of his own will.<a name=124:10></a>" It is sovereign grace to poor sinners that brings us into this place.<a name=124:11></a> It will not be accomplished until He come; it is in Him we have obtained it, being "predestinated according to his purpose.<a name=124:12></a>" That which is believed in order to our being sealed is "the gospel of our salvation.<a name=124:13></a>" John the Baptist was the forerunner of Him who was to accomplish it; but now we have the glad tidings of it consequent on the actual exaltation of Christ, and the seal of the Holy Ghost as the earnest of what is to come.<a name=124:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is where we are whilst still in the world which is no part of the purpose of God, but in which, passing through discipline, we learn the difference between flesh and spirit; it is His ways, but not part of His purpose.<a name=124:15></a> The Holy Ghost comes down from heaven, gives us to know Christ, reveals to us our inheritance, bears witness to us that we are "heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=124:16></a>" He makes us know where we are; that we belong to heaven and not to this earth at all.<a name=124:17></a> As we read in Proverbs: "In the beginning of his way, before his works of old, from the beginning or ever the earth was, then I was by him, as one brought up with him, and my delights were with the sons of men," so Christ became Man, and is gone into glory as our forerunner.<a name=124:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has purposed in Himself to have before Himself that which shall reflect His own blessedness -- He taking pleasure in us, and we taking pleasure in Him; as it is said here, "that we should be holy, and without blame before Him in love.<a name=126:1></a>" He will have His people of the same nature as Himself, gathered around Himself, happy here, and for Himself.<a name=126:2></a> His thought is not merely that we should have an inheritance; as we read of "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.<a name=126:3></a>" He "hath chosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love; having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.<a name=126:4></a>"

		And this is just the character of this Epistle; the apostle, in speaking of redemption, does so, not so much as of something needed by us, in order to appear before God, as of these purposes of God concerning us.<a name=126:5></a> We may look at God as a Judge; but, more than this, God is working for the display of the riches of the glory of His grace.<a name=126:6></a>

		This lifts up the soul.<a name=126:7></a> God has thoughts and intentions about us.<a name=126:8></a> As in the case of a young man, whom, a person has (in ordinary language) "taken up," and is about to provide for, it is not a question of what the one was, but of the thoughts and intentions of the other -- of what, in a word, he is, and will do, for the young man; so, though in a much more blessed sense, has God "taken up" poor sinners, that He might act towards them worthily of Himself, to the praise of the glory of His grace.<a name=126:9></a> The other thing remains true: God is a Judge, and "we have redemption, forgiveness of sins, through his blood" (Christ's); and we must understand this before we can enjoy our privileges in Christ.<a name=126:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		As soon as our hearts have personally found Christ connected with the glory of God, there are two things which we are called to enter into and distinguish.<a name=142:1></a> The first is the place of grace in which we stand as the children of God; in other words, the church's or Christian's position.<a name=142:2></a> The second is the government of God.<a name=142:3></a> This last unfolds itself in various ways.<a name=142:4></a> There is the millennial time, when a "Prince shall reign in righteousness": and it shall be said of the Lord, "Thou hast taken to thee thy great power.<a name=142:5></a>" Then shall "the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord.<a name=142:6></a>" All this blessing will be the effect of the government of God.<a name=142:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find in Ephesians 4 and 5, a very seasonable unfolding of the principles of the Christian walk, of the height of the principles which ought to govern it, and of its moral elevation, to which I desire to draw the attention of your readers.<a name=158:1></a> In chapter 4 the apostle, after having developed Christian doctrine as to our relations with the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (relations founded on these two names, and afterwards the relations of the church with Christ), begins his exhortations to Christians with respect to their walk.<a name=158:2></a> They ought not to walk as the rest of the nations in the corruption which was bound up with the state of darkness in which they were found; they had not so learned the Christ, if they really knew what the truth is in Jesus, namely, to have put off the old man and put on the new man, which is created according to God in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=158:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For there is the truth such as it is in Jesus; not that we should strip off, but, inasmuch as we are risen with Him, that we have put off the old man and put on the new man.<a name=158:4></a> There then is the first principle of the Christian walk: we have put on the new man; and here is its character, created according to God; not only the absence of sin, which was realised in the first Adam, but according to God fully revealed to one who has already the knowledge of good and evil, and created according to the thoughts of God Himself as to good and evil, according to the estimate which God by His very nature has of good and evil.<a name=158:5></a> What an immense privilege!<a name=158:6></a> The new man, born of God, is, in his nature, the reflection, and the intelligent reflection, of the nature of God Himself.<a name=158:7></a> Wherefore the apostle John says he cannot sin because he is born of God.<a name=158:8></a> Also we find in the Epistle to the Colossians, which is parallel to this, "renewed into knowledge<a href="#158:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> according to the image of Him who has created him.<a name=158:9></a>" Such is the first principle of the Christian walk, a nature which comes from God, created as an expression and reflection of what He is in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=158:10></a> Here it is a life, a nature, that which we are.<a name=158:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second principle is the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=158:12></a> "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God by whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption.<a name=158:13></a>" It is God Himself who dwells in us by His Spirit.<a name=158:14></a> Nothing unworthy of such a guest, unworthy of God Himself, ought to go on in us.<a name=158:15></a> Also, our walk should be characterised by that which characterises God Himself, for His love is active in us.<a name=158:16></a> Consequently we find here love also, and not only righteousness and holiness.<a name=158:17></a> We forgive one another, even as God in Christ has forgiven us.<a name=158:18></a> Christ being ascended on high, and thus the righteousness of God being established, ourselves perfectly purified by the blood of Jesus, the Holy Spirit is come down, and the bodies of the believers are become the temple of God.<a name=158:19></a> It is the seal of God put upon their persons, the earnest of their entire redemption and of their part in the inheritance of glory.<a name=158:20></a>

		The walk of the Christian ought then to be the manifestation of the divine nature, and of the ways of God in grace towards us.<a name=159:1></a> Such is the instruction which chapter 4 gives us; but chapter 5 furnishes still more light.<a name=159:2></a> Who is it that has been the expression of this nature in man down here below?<a name=159:3></a> Evidently it is the Saviour, the image of the invisible God.<a name=159:4></a> Thus, God Himself becomes the expression of this divine life in man, the model of our conduct.<a name=159:5></a> Let us examine our chapter 5 in this point of view, that we may draw from it the instruction it contains.<a name=159:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Be ye therefore imitators of God.<a name=159:7></a>" Have I not been right in speaking of the moral elevation of the Christian walk?<a name=159:8></a> Be imitators of God!<a name=159:9></a> Partakers of His nature and of the indwelling of His Spirit, we are called to imitate Him in the principles of His conduct.<a name=159:10></a> But then, as we have said, Christ is the perfect example of it; as the Holy Spirit goes on to say, "And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=159:11></a>" This adds a very precious element to the principles of the Christian walk.<a name=159:12></a> Here love has not the character of the divine love which pardons, being above evil, when a wrong is done to us, as God pardons (in virtue of Christ) sin against Him.<a name=159:13></a> Here it is devotedness, an offering made of oneself to God.<a name=159:14></a> It is no more a law which would have one love his neighbour as himself, which would be blessedness without any remains of evil in the world.<a name=159:15></a> It is not loving God with all the heart, which supposes that evil is not there.<a name=159:16></a> It is a devotedness, which supposes evil, a necessity which is the occasion for the exercise of love.<a name=159:17></a> One is given up for others, one is devoted.<a name=159:18></a> But for love in man, there must be a motive, an object.<a name=159:19></a> For this love to be perfect, the object, the motive of the love, must be perfect.<a name=159:20></a> If one is given up to a man, there may be a noble devotedness in it, but the motive is imperfect: love does not and cannot rise above its object.<a name=159:21></a> Just so, that there should be devotedness, there must be needy objects.<a name=159:22></a> These two elements are found in Christ.<a name=159:23></a> He gave Himself for us, for needy beings, objects of compassion on His part; but He gave Himself to God, infinite and perfect object, which could not have been, had He only given Himself to us and for us.<a name=159:24></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thus we ought to walk, ready to sacrifice ourselves for our brethren, always in self-abnegation to serve them, whilst offering ourselves to God Himself, to Christ whose we are.<a name=160:1></a> Thus the measure of our conduct is that of God Himself, Christ being our example in His life here below, in order that we should add love, the bond of perfect action, to brotherly kindness.<a name=160:2></a> It is not said that we are love, which is God's prerogative.<a name=160:3></a> He is love, and He loves, as to us, without any other motive than what He is; which could not be the case with a creature.<a name=160:4></a> We imitate Him in the matter of the wrongs that have been done to us.<a name=160:5></a> But the love which acts from itself towards others is of God alone.<a name=160:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, light is a quality in itself, a purity which also manifests everything.<a name=160:7></a> It is the second name that God gives Himself to express what He is.<a name=160:8></a> God is light.<a name=160:9></a> So Christ, when He was in this world, was the light of the world.<a name=160:10></a> We were in darkness, we are light in the Lord.<a name=160:11></a> Thus in the Epistle to the Philippians we find, respecting Christians, that which might be said in every point of Christ Himself, "blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.<a name=160:12></a>" In this pure nature we share, inasmuch as we have Christ for our life -- purity in motives, in thoughts according to the divine nature; that which, manifested in this world, manifested the true character of all that is around us.<a name=160:13></a> We are light in the Lord.<a name=160:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the two names, the only ones God gives Himself to express what He is, love and light, become the expression of what the Christian ought to be in his walk.<a name=160:15></a> He is even light in the Lord.<a name=160:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There exists another sort of motive and of rule, the relationships in which we are found, as father and children, husband and wife, master and slaves.<a name=161:1></a> We are in these relationships also with God and with His Christ.<a name=161:2></a> But it is another ground on which I do not enter at present.<a name=161:3></a> That of which I speak is the Christian character, as having divine life in Christ and the Holy Spirit: so that one has to imitate the conduct of God, and to take Christ for model on the earth.<a name=161:4></a>

		"CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ephesians 5: 22, 23
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark, beloved brethren, how the grace of God has associated us with Himself and with Christ, though, of course, remaining Himself meanwhile in the supremacy of infinite Godhead, in which none can be associated with Him; but He has made us partakers of the divine nature, and given us His Spirit to dwell in us, so that we realise what He is, and become one with Christ through being united to Him.<a name=162:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find, in the early part of Ephesians 5, that we are called to be "imitators of God, as dear children, and to walk in love.<a name=162:2></a>" Love is His nature; and we see this exemplified in a man, if we take Christ as the pattern of it.<a name=162:3></a> "Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us.<a name=162:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides this we get another word brought before us, which also expresses God's nature: that is light; and it is said: "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.<a name=162:5></a>" And, here too, Christ is given as the perfect expression of what is put before us.<a name=162:6></a> "Awake, thou that sleepest, and rise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.<a name=162:7></a>" As a man in the world, He was the expression and pattern of light.<a name=162:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But after this he adds, "Be filled with the Spirit"; for, though we are made partakers of this divine nature, which is light, and we are called to love after the pattern of God in Christ, yet after all we are but poor human creatures, powerless in ourselves; and the Spirit is the only power we have for everything.<a name=162:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In God's mind it is everything for us to have fellowship with Himself.<a name=162:10></a> He has put us before Himself in love; He has made us His sons and daughters -- the objects of His delight; and He should be the object of our delight.<a name=162:11></a> So much for the first relationship that we find here.<a name=162:12></a> It is with the Father as sons, and in this Christ is the Firstborn among many brethren.<a name=162:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is union with Christ now glorified: "We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=162:14></a>" We are livingly united to Him, as members to a head.<a name=162:15></a> I cannot get closer to him than being a member of His body, and in the same glory with Himself.<a name=162:16></a> This relationship gives us the indissoluble union of Christ and the church.<a name=162:17></a> "Husbands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it .<a name=162:18></a>.<a name=162:19></a>.<a name=162:20></a> and let the wife see that she reverence her husband.<a name=162:21></a>" Though quite true as regards husband and wife, it is a figure of Christ and the church.<a name=162:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=163>[Page 163]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, though we are united to Him, He is ever pre-eminent, and what even gives its value to this relationship is the necessary pre-eminence in it, as in everything, of Christ.<a name=163:1></a> When Moses and Elias were on the mount with the Lord, they were in the same glory as He was, and talking with Him of what was nearest His heart, and nearest His Father's heart too; they were in familiar intercourse with Him.<a name=163:2></a> But, even then, the moment Peter talks about making three tabernacles, one for each, thus putting them on an equality, the Father's voice comes in and owns His Son, and Moses and Elias at once disappear.<a name=163:3></a> I only use this to illustrate what I mean; and so it must always be.<a name=163:4></a> There must always be the eternal blessedness and pre-eminence of His Person, and the nearer we get to Him the more conscious we shall be of this.<a name=163:5></a> If I know a man indeed intimately, I shall surely get to know his foibles.<a name=163:6></a> In Christ, the more I know Him, the more I shall only get to know deeper, and divine, excellence.<a name=163:7></a> There is no fear of near acquaintance diminishing respect towards Him: the more I feel His love, the more I shall feel that He is supreme in it.<a name=163:8></a> Intimacy with His love only shews out its excellence, and produces more adoration and love in me.<a name=163:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is supreme in love.<a name=163:10></a> It is not said in chapter 5 that we are to be love; we cannot be free and supreme in it; we are said to be light, because the new man partakes in the purity of His nature.<a name=163:11></a> And in the love of Christ we find the working of this supreme goodness, and in a man, so that following Him we can walk in it, though we cannot say we are love, as we say we are light.<a name=163:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in the case of the church, at the close of chapter 5, we have a love of special relationship, not simply the goodness and sovereign love of God; yet the spring and source of all is in the unsought love of Christ, in which He acts in the thought of His own grace, when there was nothing to draw it out.<a name=163:13></a> He has to purchase what He loves, and form it for Himself.<a name=163:14></a> He "gave himself for it": and when He gets it, He cleanses it for Himself.<a name=163:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is yet another point of view.<a name=163:16></a> He presents it "to himself.<a name=163:17></a>" When God had made Eve, He presented her to Adam; but here we get the glory of Christ's Person.<a name=163:18></a> Being a divine Person He presents the church to Himself, having formed it and perfected it, so as to be suited to Himself.<a name=163:19></a> He does all for the church.<a name=163:20></a> Let us now see a little of the way in which He does it.<a name=163:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=164>[Page 164]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing of all is His own unmotived love.<a name=164:1></a> "He loved the church," perfectly, divinely, infinitely; we here find the utterness of His love.<a name=164:2></a> "He gave himself.<a name=164:3></a>" He did not only do something for it: "He gave himself!<a name=164:4></a>" And this is constantly repeated in the word; it is even said that "He gave himself for our sins," our sins being that which was in the way between us and God.<a name=164:5></a> As I look at Christ's love, I see that it had no motive but in itself, and it gives itself: nothing is held back.<a name=164:6></a> He is wholly and altogether mine; He has given Himself, and all is lumped up in that.<a name=164:7></a> The self-sacrifice of Christ was absolute: it was Himself, all He is, and all He was in His perfection.<a name=164:8></a> The whole motive of His nature was engaged in it: "He gave himself.<a name=164:9></a>" And this is a wonderful thought, if our hearts could only get hold of it.<a name=164:10></a> It is not that He gave His blood, and gave His life, though that is true, and we may speak of it distinctively, for Scripture does; but the point here is the character of His love; so it says, "He gave himself.<a name=164:11></a>" The motive was self-giving.<a name=164:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark here how, as regards the process of fitting the church for Christ, loving it and giving Himself for it goes first.<a name=164:13></a> It does not say, He cleansed and washed it so that He might have it, and then loved it because it was cleansed and fit to be loved.<a name=164:14></a> No.<a name=164:15></a> He gives Himself for it, and possesses it with a perfect title; Himself given for it, in the absolute completeness of His whole heart, according to which He has taken it to Himself.<a name=164:16></a> He gives Himself for it because He loved it; and now, He says, it must be cleansed and made fit for me.<a name=164:17></a> Not, it must be happy -- happy it is, no doubt -- but not only so; it must be made fit for Himself.<a name=164:18></a> I cannot be satisfied if a person I love is not what I like him to be -- my children or wife, for example.<a name=164:19></a> It is not a feeling of discontent -- I do not mean that -- but a want of full satisfaction.<a name=164:20></a> So Christ sets about making the church what He would like it to be.<a name=164:21></a> He cleanses it by "the washing of water by the word.<a name=164:22></a>" As He said before: "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<a name=164:23></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the word comes from God, it judges all that is contrary to God, by the revelation of what is in God, so that it may make me like what it reveals.<a name=164:24></a> "For their sakes," He says, "I sanctify myself.<a name=164:25></a>" As Man, He set Himself apart as the perfect expression of what is divine in a man, or man according to God.<a name=164:26></a> So it is not that I am what I ought to be, but that I am connected with Christ, who is the expression of what I ought to be, and forms me into His likeness.<a name=164:27></a> "We all, with open face beholding the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.<a name=164:28></a>" That is the way it cleanses: it purifies our motives, thoughts, and apprehensions, thus changing us into the same image from glory to glory.<a name=164:29></a> But He is the doer; He redeems us, cleanses us, sanctifies us, and presents us.<a name=164:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=165>[Page 165]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also a thought here which is full of the deepest interest; and that is, that we cannot separate the cleansing from the glory.<a name=165:1></a> The cleansing is according to the glory, and, when the body is changed, the state of holiness is according to the glory revealed; see 1 Thessalonians 3: 13, where we should have said "unblameable in holiness" in our walk; but we read, in the presence "of God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=165:2></a>" We cannot really get on without looking at Christ in glory.<a name=165:3></a> It is said that "He might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy and without blemish.<a name=165:4></a>" That is the cleansing.<a name=165:5></a> Practical cleansing is by the power of the revelation of the glory of Christ.<a name=165:6></a> But let us always remember that this cleansing is not in order that we may belong to Him, but that it is "Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it, that he might cleanse it.<a name=165:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that we find as regards the church, and this ought to comfort us in these dark days, and in the darker ones which we see coming.<a name=165:8></a> He goes on to say: "No man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church.<a name=165:9></a>" It is not only that He fits it for Himself -- makes it according to His own mind; but the same love that fits it, watches over it in the circumstances of weakness in which it is found, as it passes through the world.<a name=165:10></a> Why, he says, a man's flesh is himself; Christ takes care of Himself in taking care of the church.<a name=165:11></a> As he said to Saul: "Why persecutest thou me?<a name=165:12></a>" You are touching Me in persecuting them.<a name=165:13></a> Christ does not separate the saints down here from Himself.<a name=165:14></a> He is interested in them, cares for them, nourishes and cherishes them as a man does the flesh of his own body.<a name=165:15></a> And in this He can never fail.<a name=165:16></a> The darkness may be great, and the power of evil strong, and growing stronger (not that God is not working, for He is; and when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him, and is doing so, and preparing the coming of the Lord), but no more than a man can hate himself, can Christ fail in doing this -- nourishing and cherishing the church.<a name=165:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=166>[Page 166]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord has long patience with all this growing evil (we may pray that things may go quicker, that He would bring the end on more rapidly, calling in His own; but, if so, it will bring evil out more rapidly too, and the judgments that are coming on the earth, but yet we may desire it); but all through the faith of the saint can reckon on the care and love of Christ.<a name=166:1></a> You cannot put me in any circumstances where the love of Christ cannot suit me.<a name=166:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor even does the working of unbelief hinder.<a name=166:3></a> For, when those who are believers cannot use the power that has been brought in against evil, what is to be done?<a name=166:4></a> We read, that when they brought one possessed of a demon to the disciples, and they could not cast him out, the Lord says: "How long shall I be with you?<a name=166:5></a> how long shall I suffer you?<a name=166:6></a>" If you cannot use the power I have brought in, what is the use of staying with you?<a name=166:7></a> But He adds, "Bring him hither to me.<a name=166:8></a>" Even if the faith of the church fail, and one were alone in the trial, individual faith will always find grace in the Lord Jesus Christ for its want.<a name=166:9></a> Just as the father of the child cried out with tears: "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.<a name=166:10></a>" Christ cannot fail; and we on our side must not be like Elijah, saying, "Lord, they have thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life to take it away" (and mark at the moment he had thrown down their altars and slain their prophets), and then run away.<a name=166:11></a> What we want to say is: Well, Christ never fails, and there cannot be a want in Christ's church without there being an answer to it in Christ's heart.<a name=166:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All we want, beloved friends, is to have the eye fixed on Christ, from whom all grace and love flow, and to be sanctified in heart and spirit thereby, while waiting for Him, who has given Himself for us, so that we might be like Him even now, while walking through this world.<a name=166:13></a>

		The very blessings of the church (as in Ephesians 1: 3) set us into a sort of conflict, which, without such blessings, we should not have.<a name=167:1></a> So the church is subject to more failure than either Jews or Gentiles were, because they were not called to the same blessing.<a name=167:2></a> A Jew might do many things that would be monstrous in a Christian, and yet find no defilement in his conscience.<a name=167:3></a> The veil that was over the knowledge of God being rent, the light shines out; and the consequence is that this light which has come out of the holy place cannot tolerate evil.<a name=167:4></a> Christians are in a more dangerous position, if not walking in the light, than Jews.<a name=167:5></a> Satan may draw and entice me with many things, which would have no power against me if I were not so favoured.<a name=167:6></a> "Be strong in the Lord"; here is the place of strength.<a name=167:7></a> There is no strength but in Christ -- I have none at any time, except as my soul is in secret communion with Him, and through Him with God the Father.<a name=167:8></a> The direct power of Satan is toward this point, to keep our souls from living on Christ.<a name=167:9></a> Put on the whole armour of God; there is no standing against Satan without this.<a name=167:10></a> Strength is always the effect of having to do with God in the spirit of dependence.<a name=167:11></a>

		BRIEF NOTES ON THE EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Philippians presents the development of two distinct subjects.<a name=171:1></a> On the one hand it shews us the ties of affection which exist between the Lord's servant and those to whom he had been blessed; and, on the other, Christian experience.<a name=171:2></a> It is perhaps the only epistle which treats of the experience of the Christian.<a name=171:3></a> We thus see the completeness of God's word; in it every subject has its own proper place.<a name=171:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1: 5-7.<a name=171:5></a> "I have you in my heart" ought rather to be translated, "Ye have me in your hearts.<a name=171:6></a>" The meaning of this verse is this: "It is righteous for me to think thus as to you (that is, that I should have confidence in the completion of the good work begun in you), since ye have me in your hearts.<a name=171:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Ye are all partakers of my grace.<a name=171:8></a>" This signifies that they were all participators in the grace that rested on him.<a name=171:9></a> Everyone has not a gift of ministry; but by grace, whoever loves the Lord participates in the gospel.<a name=171:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 10.<a name=171:11></a> "That ye may approve things that are excellent" -- that is, that differ and so are the best.<a name=171:12></a> There may be a regular walk, which does not perhaps shew enough of that delicacy and regard which the love of Christ teaches, and by which God is glorified.<a name=171:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 11.<a name=171:14></a> "The fruit of righteousness" -- that is, such fruit as would have been found in the life of Christ Himself.<a name=171:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 12.<a name=171:16></a> "The things which happened unto me .<a name=171:17></a>.<a name=171:18></a>.<a name=171:19></a> for the furtherance of the gospel.<a name=171:20></a>" All the difficulties resulting from Paul's absence only turned out for good; Christ was more abundantly preached; the Philippians were taking courage, the gospel was carried before Caesar, etc.<a name=171:21></a> And Paul was rejoicing when he saw that the efforts of Satan were contributing to the progress of the gospel.<a name=171:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 16.<a name=171:23></a> Who are the preachers pointed out in this verse?<a name=171:24></a> All that is said is, that they preached Christ in a bad spirit.<a name=171:25></a> They might be persons who had too little spiritually to dare to act when Paul was present, but availed themselves of his absence to come forward.<a name=171:26></a>

		Does the apostle refer in these words to the hope he had of being delivered from his bonds?<a name=172:1></a> I do not think that he does.<a name=172:2></a> The word "salvation" is used for our complete deliverance, and not merely for passing deliverances which we may experience by the way.<a name=172:3></a> Salvation is an absolute thing; it is the final result of the race.<a name=172:4></a> It is well to maintain the sense of this word; because we have here the key to the whole epistle.<a name=172:5></a> If there be not a salvation at the end of the race, of what avail is the priesthood of Christ?<a name=172:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 20, 21 are the same subject.<a name=172:7></a> Whatever may be Caesar's decision about me -- whatever may await me, be it life or death, it works salvation to me, says the apostle; my race is accomplished through such circumstances.<a name=172:8></a> If life be left me, I will labour for the church; if death be my portion, I will die for Christ, for His name; as to this, Christ will decide.<a name=172:9></a> As regarded himself, Paul wished to die.<a name=172:10></a> Having death before him, he had, so to speak, attained his Gethsemane; and thus he had confidence that the Christ who had been glorified in his life would be also glorified in his death.<a name=172:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 21.<a name=172:12></a> "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.<a name=172:13></a>" Christ was all in Paul's life.<a name=172:14></a> If Paul lived, it was by Christ and for Christ.<a name=172:15></a> Therefore to die would be better; he would be most entirely with Him.<a name=172:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 25, 26.<a name=172:17></a> Paul decides his own case; he decides it in the sense of the good and profit of the church.<a name=172:18></a> Neither Caesar nor his court would decide it, but Christ; and He would do it in the interest of the church.<a name=172:19></a> Paul in this shews the most elevated faith.<a name=172:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 27.<a name=172:21></a> "The faith of the gospel.<a name=172:22></a>" In this expression Paul personifies the gospel.<a name=172:23></a> He sees the gospel carrying on warfare in the world, and the saints carrying on warfare for Christ, associating it with that Person.<a name=172:24></a> The epistles of Paul present several instances in which the gospel is thus personified.<a name=172:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 28.<a name=172:26></a> "Of salvation.<a name=172:27></a>" Here again salvation is looked at as the result of the race.<a name=172:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 29, 30.<a name=172:29></a> Paul on one side, the Philippians on the other, were in the warfare, and they had -- all of them -- salvation before them.<a name=172:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 2.<a name=172:31></a> We see further on that the Philippians had sent help to Paul.<a name=172:32></a> While expressing his satisfaction, he insinuated, but with caution, that they might have done so sooner; chapter 4: 10.<a name=172:33></a> Here, with the same delicacy, he says, "If it be true that there are any bowels and mercies, if it be true (which he did not doubt) that ye have my joy at heart, fulfil ye that joy, by thinking the same thing," etc.<a name=172:34></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 3, 4.<a name=173:1></a> Above all else, the heart of Paul desired that unity might be maintained among the saints; and, as a means of maintaining happy harmony, he recommends humility, which teaches the Christian to esteem himself to be least of all.<a name=173:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 5.<a name=173:3></a> Paul, doubtless, will find an echo in the hearts of the Philippians, but he wished to give them higher motives than those which related only to himself.<a name=173:4></a> To this end he places before their eyes the humiliation of the Lord Jesus, who, being God, yet became man and servant; and was obedient even unto the death of the cross.<a name=173:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 5-11.<a name=173:6></a> In these verses, although the thing is not said in express terms, there is, it seems to me, a contrast between Christ and Adam.<a name=173:7></a> Adam -- man -- in wishing to exalt himself to be like God, was disobedient unto death; Christ -- who was God -- emptied Himself, taking the form of a bondman, and, even when He was in fashion as a man, became obedient and obeyed even unto death.<a name=173:8></a> There are two degrees in Christ's humiliation.<a name=173:9></a> He first strips Himself of His own glory, and becomes a man: then, being man, He goes down even unto the death of the cross.<a name=173:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 10.<a name=173:11></a> "That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.<a name=173:12></a>" The name of Jesus is a personal name -- <i>Jah-Oshua</i><a href="#173:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> (Jehoshua) -- Jehovah -- Saviour.<a name=173:13></a> It is the name of His Person.<a name=173:14></a> The name "Christ" expresses a title -- that of a man who is appointed.<a name=173:15></a> Independently of any title, Jesus possesses His own proper personal claim to supremacy over all things.<a name=173:16></a> He is God.<a name=173:17></a> The deity of Jesus occupies in the New Testament a much greater place than is generally observed.<a name=173:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as man Jesus has also a glory which He receives, the glory which results from His humiliation -- "God also hath highly exalted him.<a name=173:19></a>"

		All things are subjected under the lordship of Christ -- things heavenly, and earthly, and infernal (which are under the earth).<a name=173:20></a> This third class has no part in the reconciliation of "all things," as they are mentioned in Colossians 11: 20.<a name=173:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 12, 13.<a name=173:22></a> The emphasis in verse 12 is on these words: "not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence.<a name=173:23></a>" If, Paul being absent and retained in prison, the Philippians were deprived of him, God would suffice; He is never absent.<a name=173:24></a>

		In the race which the Lord has opened to faith, the Christian finds himself individually engaged, and his responsibility finds its place.<a name=178:1></a> The Christian, it is true, is no longer before God in the condition of a man with his sins.<a name=178:2></a> But, in virtue of the new position which grace has made unto him, he has entered upon a new and different responsibility.<a name=178:3></a> He has practically to answer all the privileges which are vouchsafed to him.<a name=178:4></a> He has to walk in the Spirit, to press towards the goal, to shew himself worthy of his calling, and as a child of God to walk in love, etc.<a name=178:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The day of Christ will shew in what manner that child of God has run.<a name=178:6></a> It is while he runs the race that he has to watch, lest anything should stop him, or turn him aside from his road.<a name=178:7></a> He meets with hindrances, and may perhaps find them even in the unfaithful state of God's people.<a name=178:8></a> It is for him to watch; the delay of others could not justify His own; the race is an individual things.<a name=178:9></a>

		Nevertheless, in the Book of Numbers, which presents the going through the wilderness, do we not see a people on their march?<a name=178:10></a> This is true, but we must observe, that in the heavenly calling, of which we are partakers, God has formed a relationship with each of His saints; and that relationship is infinitely more developed than it could have been with the Israelites in the wilderness.<a name=178:11></a>

		THE BOOK OF EXPERIENCE - PHILIPPIANS 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Epistle to the Ephesians, and even in that to the Colossians, we see our place with Christ; but in Philippians the believer is seen passing through the world -- as a Christian walking in it.<a name=179:1></a> There is no doctrine in the epistle; the believer is seen pressing toward the mark.<a name=179:2></a> And another thing: he looks at this course as run in the power of the Spirit of God: this is what characterises the Christian, that he is entirely running the race in that power.<a name=179:3></a> So there is no sin in this epistle -- not the word sin even -- and no conflict, in the proper sense of the word.<a name=179:4></a> Not that he has attained, but he is never doing anything but one thing -- running in the power of the Spirit of God towards the goal.<a name=179:5></a> He had not attained, but he was doing nothing but running to attain.<a name=179:6></a> He was raised above all in himself, and in the world -- entirely above all circumstances.<a name=179:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the epistle of experience, but according to the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=179:8></a> We learn this lesson, that though we fail, yet there is the possibility of running on in the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=179:9></a> Not that flesh is changed, or the thought of having attained admissible (there is no perfection down here); but the possibility of always acting consistently with the calling to get to Christ in glory.<a name=179:10></a> There is no looking for points of progress in the world; it sets him above every kind of circumstance, or contradiction, or difficulty, for he sees the path of the Christian entirely above them all.<a name=179:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To have a path shews that man had got out of God's place where He had set him.<a name=179:12></a> The moment we have a way it shews that we are not at home.<a name=179:13></a> It is blessed to have a way in the wilderness (of course, Christ is the way).<a name=179:14></a> Adam wanted no way; he would have stayed in the garden in quietness if he had obeyed God.<a name=179:15></a> But we have set out from Egypt, and we are not in Canaan; we go towards the goal.<a name=179:16></a> Numbers of things come out on the way, but all we have got to do is to run.<a name=179:17></a> We get a great deal more of Christ at every step; like a lamp at the end of a passage, we get more and more of it as we go on; we have not got the lamp yet, though we get more of the light of it every step we take.<a name=179:18></a> But there is entire deliverance from self as governing us, and a motive above circumstances, so that, though not insensible to them, they exert no influence over us.<a name=179:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Praying for saints gives a person the power of seeing all the good in them.<a name=180:23></a> We see this in the epistles, with one exception, that to the Galatians, where the apostle does not speak of what he could commend, but goes straight into all the evil, for they were turning away from the foundation.<a name=180:24></a> If we prayed more for the saints we should have more joy in them, and more courage about them.<a name=180:25></a> It is always wrong to lose courage about the saints, though it is possible it might come to be like Jeremiah: "Pray no more for this people.<a name=180:26></a>" The Lord is always there, and love cannot fail; so we can reckon on it with joy, and comfort, and courage.<a name=180:27></a> Even when Paul had said to the Galatians, "I am afraid of you," he adds, soon looking to Christ, "I have confidence in you through the Lord.<a name=180:28></a>" He had the saints under Christ's eye for a blessing.<a name=180:29></a> How much are we looking with Christ's heart at all the saints, with comfort and courage that there is grace enough for them?<a name=180:30></a> "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ"; and, as he says further on, "that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke.<a name=180:31></a>"

		"Both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.<a name=181:1></a>" We are little aware how real the unity of the Spirit is: we have greatly lost the reality of it, though it is owned as a truth.<a name=181:2></a> It is a unity by a living power which is in every saint, so that the thing must be: "if one member suffer," not all ought to, but all do, "suffer with it.<a name=181:3></a>" The body may be in such a mortified state as to have little feeling left; but, supposing there were a work of the Spirit in India, do you think it would not revive the saints here?<a name=181:4></a> So those people who were praying for Paul, when God strengthened him, praise returned to God from them all.<a name=181:5></a> The working of the Spirit of God tells in blessing on all who hear.<a name=181:6></a> But when he had to say, "All have forsaken me" (they had not forsaken Christ, but they had no courage to go into danger), Paul went on alone.<a name=181:7></a> It is plain if I have a pain in my body all my nerves are hurt by it; I cannot read or work so well.<a name=181:8></a> There may be a deadening of the spiritual nerves so that there is very little feeling, but it cannot be destroyed.<a name=181:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At verse 8 we get into the tone of the epistle.<a name=181:10></a> The apostle was no forgetful person; he remembers every little trait of kindness done to him, and he prays that they might have all kinds of knowledge and spiritual judgment, so that they might do things just fit to be done -- that they might know in what one thing differs from another -- that they might be connoisseurs in the Christian path; not only not fall into sin, but have the knowledge of just the right thing to do in the circumstances; for the standard is the satisfying the heart of Christ, not "Where is the harm?<a name=181:11></a>" The apostle desires that they might discern things now as they will be when brought into the light in that day of Christ.<a name=181:12></a> It is as if he said, I want you to think of the Lord Jesus, and know what will please the heart of Christ.<a name=181:13></a> There is the delight of pleasing Christ, and the delighting in the thing that pleases Him as well, by the active energy of the Spirit of God.<a name=181:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.<a name=182:9></a>" We see here that perfection in the flesh is all nonsense, for Paul was looking to be like Christ in glory.<a name=182:10></a> The heart is always upright when it says, "For me to live is Christ.<a name=182:11></a>" He had no object but Christ, and he walked day by day by that -- Christ as source, Christ as object, Christ as character; all the way through, Christ was his life, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that the rage of man and Satan had no power over him.<a name=182:12></a> Self was practically gone.<a name=182:13></a> When he looked at himself he did not know what to choose-whether to go and rest with Christ, or to remain and serve Him.<a name=182:14></a> To be with Him was better, but then he could no longer labour for Him.<a name=182:15></a> Thus self was gone as a motive, and he counts on Christ for the church, and the moment he sees "it is necessary for you that I remain," he says, "I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith.<a name=182:16></a>" He decides his own trial before Nero.<a name=182:17></a> When thinking of himself he did not know which to choose, but when he thinks of those dear to Christ needing his presence he says, "I know I shall abide.<a name=182:18></a>"

		To turn to chapter 2.<a name=184:1></a> It is astonishing the grace which associates us with Christ; we are called to have the same mind as Christ.<a name=184:2></a> Here we get the lowliness of the Christian life, as in the next chapter we have the energy of the Christian life.<a name=184:3></a> Here it is in following the pattern of Christ, a lowliness shewn in esteem of others, and in perfect consideration for others, and in gracious gentleness of demeanour in connection with the things of every-day life.<a name=184:4></a> Thus he tells them he would keep Timotheus, and send him to them as soon as he should know how it would go with him -- reckoning on their true interest in all that regarded him; but he would not keep Epaphroditus, but send him, for he had been ill, and the Philippians had heard it, and were full of anxiety about him; as a child might say, My mother will be in a terrible way when she hears I am so ill.<a name=184:5></a> So Paul would send him that they might see him.<a name=184:6></a> In little things this considerateness is seen in Paul, this thorough thoughtfulness for others.<a name=184:7></a> Even the world can see it is lovely; their very selfishness delights in it.<a name=184:8></a>

		It is remarkable the way in which he treats the subject in this chapter.<a name=194:1></a> It is not the conscience with sin on it, but the worthlessness of all ordinances; so he calls it the "concision.<a name=194:2></a>" Have your hearts circumcised -- that is the true ordinance.<a name=194:3></a> "We are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit"; even as Jeremiah says, "Circumcise your hearts.<a name=194:4></a>" It must be the flesh totally put down.<a name=194:5></a> The flesh has a religion as well as lusts; but the flesh must have a religion that will not kill the flesh.<a name=194:6></a> Satisfying the flesh in mortifying the body -- a voluntary humility, not sparing the body -- that is easy work; but it is not easy work to be done with the flesh.<a name=194:7></a>

		It is striking, the way in which Paul takes it up.<a name=194:16></a> It is not as sin, but as something perfectly worthless -- legal righteousness, and the true religion as man can see it.<a name=194:17></a> "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.<a name=194:18></a>" He was a Hebrew of the Hebrews, and after the strictest sect he lived a Pharisee; that was gain to him.<a name=194:19></a> Then he says, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.<a name=194:20></a>" There was no question of sin; when he speaks of righteousness, it is not as meeting sins, but as contrasted with righteousness according to the law.<a name=194:21></a> We can always detect it; all it does is to accredit self -- that is the mischief and the evil; for who would have filthy rags (that is what our righteousnesses are called) when he could have Christ for his righteousness?<a name=194:22></a> He had such a perception of the excellency of what Christ is in God's sight -- what God delights in -- that he says, I am not going to keep this wretched righteousness, or add it to that which is of God.<a name=194:23></a> The deceitful lusts are bad enough, but this religious flesh is worse.<a name=194:24></a> It was not real righteousness; it was self puffed up, not self judged; it was self eked out, and painted over.<a name=194:25></a> Now he wants to get rid of self, and have Christ instead of it.<a name=194:26></a>

		THOUGHTS ON PHILIPPIANS 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Philippians 3 presents the energy of life and of the Spirit of God in the Christian running toward the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, that he might win Christ.<a name=215:1></a> In chapter 2 we find the display of the gracious affections.<a name=215:2></a> But in order to this, the Spirit of God fixes our minds upon Christ looked at in this humble condition, or rather when He humbled Himself.<a name=215:3></a> It is beautiful, the way in which, toward the end of the chapter, without an effort, we find the apostle's feelings were all drawn out -- the spirit elevated really above the circumstances, but free to unfold itself in gracious affections in the midst of them all.<a name=215:4></a> And that is just what the Christian ought to be, having Christ as his one object, the power of the Holy Ghost raising him above all around him, that there should be the display of Christ towards all around him.<a name=215:5></a> The Christian's life here ought to be the manifestation of Christ in the midst of the world.<a name=215:6></a> For this we must be in constant communion with the source of it.<a name=215:7></a> The Christian's life as such down here is the display of Christ's life.<a name=215:8></a> It is the life of Jesus manifested in his mortal body.<a name=215:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Philippians had sent to the apostle to help him, when in prison, with a supply of what he needed.<a name=215:10></a> His heart had been touched, and he felt the kindness and love.<a name=215:11></a> But while owning it, his heart turns to think of them.<a name=215:12></a> The Spirit of life in Christ is at work in him, and he immediately thinks of their things.<a name=215:13></a> He is comforted of them and can say, "I know how to abound and to suffer need.<a name=215:14></a>" I am rejoicing that I can get the blessing from you: but the consequence is that it turns back towards them.<a name=215:15></a> He says, "If there be, therefore, any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.<a name=215:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the love of Christ is in our hearts, the consequence is that things acquire a character entirely different.<a name=215:17></a> They had sent to the apostle what he wanted, and he says there is consolation in Christ.<a name=215:18></a> It is not merely the things he got, but the comfort of Christ and fellowship of the Spirit.<a name=215:19></a> It was the working of the spirit of grace in Jesus, shewing itself in this fellowship.<a name=215:20></a> He says, If you want me to be perfectly happy, go on well among yourselves.<a name=215:21></a> There were some little jealousies at work, such things as do spring up amongst Christians; but he takes occasion, by owning all the grace that was in them, to say, "Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.<a name=215:22></a>" And one just sees how these gracious affections are drawn out and in exercise, where the heart, in the power of the Spirit of God, is carried beyond the things which act on the flesh.<a name=215:23></a> His heart turns to Christ as the expression of this.<a name=215:24></a> He says, "Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves.<a name=215:25></a>" Now if we are not very near Christ, that is often very difficult.<a name=215:26></a> We may see great vanity or pride in another, and one may be going on really better than this or that person.<a name=215:27></a> I do not mean that the other may be positively sinning; but I may feel that he is not walking spiritually.<a name=215:28></a> Yet, if I am practically close to Christ myself, I see my brother in Christ, and then it is not hard to estimate others better than myself.<a name=215:29></a> Where I am walking in nearness to Christ, if there is anything consciously wrong in myself, this is what I feel about and not my goodness.<a name=215:30></a>

		It is a wonderful thing to see that we are called upon to have the same mind which was in Christ Jesus.<a name=217:1></a> It is from having His nature," who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of no reputation.<a name=217:2></a>" If we look at the first Adam, it was exactly the opposite.<a name=217:3></a> He was in the form of man, in the condition of man, and he did set about, as a robbery, to be equal with God.<a name=217:4></a> He took it in order to get into this place, to exalt himself; and he was abased.<a name=217:5></a> Whereas Christ abased Himself, and He is exalted.<a name=217:6></a> It is not only that He appears, but He abases Himself.<a name=217:7></a> "He made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.<a name=217:8></a>" Then there was a second step in this humiliation.<a name=217:9></a> "And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=217:10></a>" There is nothing so humble as obedience, because we have then no will of our own at all.<a name=217:11></a> Adam, besides setting up to be God, was disobedient unto death; whereas Christ, on the contrary, was obedient unto death, as a matter of sorrow and pain.<a name=217:12></a> He was "obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=217:13></a>"

		THE EFFECT OF CHRIST IN GLORY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Philippians 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which we may look at the Christian: one, according to the counsels and thoughts of God, and the efficacy of the work of the Lord Jesus Christ; "by one offering perfected for ever" -- accepted in Christ Himself before God, everything that stood against us put away, and the believer cleared completely and for ever from his old condition in Adam, taken out of that old condition, and put into the acceptance of Christ Himself; this is the grace wherein we stand.<a name=231:1></a> But evidently there is also another condition in which the Christian is seen, and that is as walking in this world.<a name=231:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This walk of the Christian we get in two ways -- in the Epistle to the Philippians and in Hebrews.<a name=231:3></a> In Hebrews it is looked at in respect to the grace Christ obtains for us as priest on high; not the operation of the Spirit in us, but the work of Christ for us, and grace to help in time of need.<a name=231:4></a> But if in Hebrews you get the Christian down here in weakness, needing help and getting it, in Philippians you get him down here, and the energy and power of the Spirit of God working in him.<a name=231:5></a> We have to pass through the world, and there are difficulties in our path, temptations to draw us aside; but one walking in the power of God's Spirit rises above all the difficulties in the midst of which he is.<a name=231:6></a> In Philippians is brought out the power of God's Spirit acting in our walking in the right path, and the result is a person entirely above it all, one who can "rejoice in the Lord alway.<a name=231:7></a>" We may remember, too, that Paul had been four years in prison at the time, two of them with a soldier chained to him; and, what was still more trying, his work as an apostle put a stop to, his activity all come to an end.<a name=231:8></a> He might have reproached himself as to going up to Jerusalem, and so on, but he does not; he rises above it all.<a name=231:9></a> It is a remarkable fact that in this epistle sin is never spoken of; nor is the flesh, except as having no confidence in it, in a warning to avoid its religiousness; it is simply a walk in the power of the Spirit.<a name=231:10></a> In the previous chapter you get the graciousness, but in this the energy, of the course -- the full energy of the Christian going through this world.<a name=231:11></a> He does not here speak of the cross as that which puts away sin; it has another character here, being looked at practically; it is being "crucified to the world.<a name=231:12></a>" Thus it is the book of experience, according to the spirit of the Christian on earth.<a name=231:13></a>

		Imprisoned, so that he cannot be active, yet Paul says, It will all turn to my salvation; it will all turn to good, and I can rejoice in the Lord always.<a name=232:1></a> This comes with power when we remember where he was when he could write thus.<a name=232:2></a> He looks back and contrasts his own course with that of those who had made profession, but were still going on with the world.<a name=232:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us first look at the character of the energy with which the apostle ran this race.<a name=232:4></a> He says he has not yet attained, is not yet perfect; this is because he is looking at his state.<a name=232:5></a> We must just see what he means by this.<a name=232:6></a> In the first place, he has not a thought of his own righteousness at all.<a name=232:7></a> There was a righteousness which he had had; there was a righteousness which he had boasted in; he had had it, all that which depended on himself: "touching the righteousness which was in the law, blameless.<a name=232:8></a>" But the moment the spiritual character of the law was seen, it was all over; all that flesh could trust in was gone for him.<a name=232:9></a> We all know how when he was in the full flush of his career, the Lord met him, and he discovered that all that had been gain to him, all of which he had boasted, had only served to bring him into open enmity with God.<a name=232:10></a> All this knowledge, all this energy of character, he had only made use of to try to destroy the name of Christ.<a name=232:11></a> It was not a question of his sins; it was that all he had valued as good was gone, his conscience proved to be misdirected, his legal righteousness nothing worth.<a name=232:12></a> There, on his way to Damascus, with authority from the high priest, he found himself in the presence of Christ, and in open enmity with Him; and in that presence all that he was as a religious man, "blameless" -- in the outward sense, of course, for he found himself to be the chief of sinners -- all that Saul could clothe himself with outwardly was smashed, and he himself left to dwell in darkness three days, to go through in his own soul what this terrible revelation had discovered to him.<a name=232:13></a> The practical effect of thus seeing the Christ in glory was to put down in the most powerful way all that was of man.<a name=232:14></a> The first thing we need as sinners, and get through the cross of the Lord Jesus, is "redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins"; but here it was not sins -- it was righteousness put away.<a name=232:15></a> What he had stood in before God was all gone; it was brought out in the strongest way in his own experience what man was in his best estate: the upright, honest, law-keeping Pharisee was only enmity against God.<a name=232:16></a> And it was not only that he had failed -- this was not the thing -- but that the whole structure, the moral structure of man, was brought out in the sight of God and done with.<a name=232:17></a> It was the end of the first man; and this not as a doctrine, but practically, for we must learn everything in our own consciences if it is to be a real thing.<a name=232:18></a> It was total, entire condemnation of man in the flesh in his best form; the best man in the world was the chief of sinners -- best as man goes.<a name=232:19></a> This, evidently, is a truth that we can learn in different ways, either as seeing ourselves open sinners in rebellion against God, or by discovering that what we esteem best is utterly valueless before Him.<a name=232:20></a> Innocence is gone; man fell from paradise, and that is all over.<a name=232:21></a> There is no going back to the tree of life; and from that time forward man must be either an alien from God, an enemy in his mind by wicked works, or else he must have a heavenly place with God.<a name=232:22></a> On the road to Damascus, Saul meets the Man in the glory, and then he is judged in his own conscience, and is found to be an open ceaseless enemy of God.<a name=232:23></a> It is easy for us to see that our sins must be judged by God, but we do not see at first that the mind and affections of the flesh are enmity against Him.<a name=232:24></a> But here you see there is an end of Saul, and of everything that the flesh was in this world -- this world which was not paradise, and certainly was not heaven -- this world in which the good things were worthless in the sight of God, and certainly the sins were not any use.<a name=232:25></a>

		Outwardly, Saul was the best man possible -- as man goes -- conscientious, religious, righteous; and there he was an open enemy against God.<a name=233:1></a> There was nothing to be found here: consequently he looked out of this world and saw Christ in glory; he saw Him there where he stood; and the effect was that the old man was perfectly judged, and there was another Man in heaven.<a name=233:2></a> All that Saul was was gone.<a name=233:3></a> It is not a question of sins, but of righteousness.<a name=233:4></a> In another place he says, "I had not known sin but by the law.<a name=233:5></a>" But supposing there were a righteousness according to the law, no man ever reached it except the blessed Lord Himself; but even if Paul could have reached it, he would not have it now, for he says, I have got another; there was "the righteousness of God" for him now.<a name=233:6></a> The law required righteousness from man to God, but that was now all given up; besides, none had attained it.<a name=233:7></a> It is, "not having mine own righteousness"; he does not say, not having my-own sins.<a name=233:8></a> It goes a great deal farther than that, and I press it on you -- theoretically, a man blameless; yet he says, I will not have it at all.<a name=233:9></a> The whole standing, place, and condition of the first man is a judged thing in his soul, and another Man, Christ in glory, shall be for him, not that which he was.<a name=233:10></a> The condition of the first man has been shewn out by the revelation of the second Man, and Paul follows Him.<a name=233:11></a> Thus we see the whole ground and standing of legal righteousness swept away.<a name=233:12></a> Nobody had it, of course: still that was altogether the ground he was on; but now, he says, I will not have my own at all, for I have got Another.<a name=233:13></a>

		Then he speaks of perfection: "As many as be perfect.<a name=237:1></a>" A perfect Christian is a full-grown man, in one sense; it is the same word as the "perfect man, the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<a name=237:2></a>" And what is that?<a name=237:3></a> It certainly is not being like what Christ was when He was down here, for there was no sin in Him, so the thought of being like Him is a mere delusion.<a name=237:4></a> He that gazes on Him up there walks like Him down here, but to be like Him as He was down here is not possible.<a name=237:5></a> To walk like Him, I repeat, is said; but to be like Him would be to be absolutely sinless.<a name=237:6></a> To be conformed to Him in glory, that we shall be, and therefore the heart desires and runs after it now; and that is what he calls a perfect Christian.<a name=237:7></a> It is not one who knows what it is to have got the sins of the old creation cleared away -- it is not knowing the work of Christ which puts away sin, hardly measured either by the sin, for it is the whole state of the nature; all is settled, and I know that "by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified," that there is no more a question of anything to be settled between me and God, and I have liberty before Him in the sense of His favour; but then I say, Is that all?<a name=237:8></a> All my debts paid, but am I to have nothing to go and buy anything with?<a name=237:9></a> Am I henceforth to starve, without possessing a farthing?<a name=237:10></a> Then it is that the soul comes to see that, having part in this forgiveness, it has also part with the last Adam: he has got hold by grace of this Man in the glory, and knowing this, I say, my whole soul is in that; I have seen the excellency of Christ Jesus, my Lord, and it has set aside everything here.<a name=237:11></a> I have done with it all; I belong to another place, and no longer own this old man.<a name=237:12></a>

		It is then the Christian has got to be what he calls a perfect man; he has this object before him, he has got Christ's place before God, and he grows up into the stature of Christ; not that he has not still much to learn, but he has got into his place; he is of full age, he discerns good and evil, he has got hold of his place in Christ, and he knows it.<a name=238:1></a> This sets aside the flesh altogether, and also that which is a deceptive thing to many, perfection in the flesh, for Christ in glory is my only perfection.<a name=238:2></a> In the world I am running a race, I have not attained yet, but Christ has laid hold of me for it.<a name=238:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then puts in the strongest contrast those who are not thus perfect: "If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.<a name=238:4></a> Nevertheless, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.<a name=238:5></a>" I can walk with one who only knows his redemption in Christ with just the same love, but I look for him to get hold of this also.<a name=238:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he talks of another thing, of those who have the profession of Christianity, but who are "enemies of the cross of Christ"; they are not exactly enemies of Christ, though in the end it comes to the same thing.<a name=238:7></a> In paradise God got rid of man as a sinner; at the cross, as far as his will was concerned, man got rid of God in grace.<a name=238:8></a> The very disciples ran away: they could not stand it; as He said to Peter, "Thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me afterwards.<a name=238:9></a>" Amiable or unamiable, all either ran away or banded themselves together against Him.<a name=238:10></a> Satan was proved to be the prince of this world.<a name=238:11></a> People fancy he is not the prince of it, because the gospel is preached in it; but the gospel never would be preached in it if he were not the prince of it; He brought all the world up against Christ, so the world is judged, and all that is in it.<a name=238:12></a> "The world is crucified to me.<a name=238:13></a>" The cross -- really a gibbet -- put an end to all human glory.<a name=238:14></a> He came down to that to put an end to everything of man.<a name=238:15></a> There is no such infamy as the cross; nothing but a slave or a bad criminal was ever put upon it.<a name=238:16></a> Thus Satan was proved by his influence over the world to be its prince; such is what the world is, and this is the very reason that the Lord says, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee"; and therefore the world is convinced of judgment, and righteousness is proved, how?<a name=238:17></a> "Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool," is God's answer.<a name=238:18></a> And He sits there till the judgment of the world is to be executed; it sees Him no more as the Saviour.<a name=238:19></a> And now, because He glorified God in that place of sin, we carry out the testimony of the grace that seeks sinners.<a name=238:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These were enemies to the cross of Christ.<a name=239:1></a> They carry the name of Christian and go on with the world.<a name=239:2></a> Of course, the true Christian may get into the world and be ensnared; it is not that.<a name=239:3></a> The enemy of the cross of Christ put Christ there, and now if I look for righteousness, it is not to be found in the world that did that; I must look for it in Christ up there, for righteousness has done with the world.<a name=239:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then see the place that he puts the Christian in: "for our conversation is in heaven"; our whole relationships in life -- all that my life is involved in, and develops itself in -- are in heaven; I am to run here having all my relationships up there, because Christ who is my life is up there.<a name=239:5></a> What a definite thing the Christian life is -- not here at all!<a name=239:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"From whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=239:7></a>" Now what is He called "Saviour" for here?<a name=239:8></a> Christians are all saved in a certain sense -- we have eternal life: but in this epistle salvation is the result of redemption, not merely redemption.<a name=239:9></a> Practically, Israel was saved out of Egypt as soon as the Red Sea was crossed, but they had not got the place till they had got through the Jordan too.<a name=239:10></a> We get in the Red Sea Christ's death and resurrection.<a name=239:11></a> The blood upon the lintel gave them safety while God was passing through, destroying the first-born: the question between God and the people as to their sin was settled, still God was in the character of judge there, and He passes them by.<a name=239:12></a> Yet it was not deliverance.<a name=239:13></a> But when they come to the Red Sea He says, "Stand still, and see the salvation of God.<a name=239:14></a>" God had now come in as a Saviour and taken them out of the place they were in, and now they are delivered.<a name=239:15></a> When I get to Jordan, it is yet another thing; the waters open not to bring them out, but to bring them in; not that Christ was dead and risen for them, but that they were dead and risen with Christ.<a name=239:16></a> So you get the Red Sea smitten, so to say, whilst in Jordan the ark stays in the water and we go through with it.<a name=239:17></a> The reproach of Egypt was never rolled away till they got into Canaan; and so with us: I do not get deliverance and full power in heavenly places until I see that I have died and risen with Christ; I do not get into my place until then.<a name=239:18></a>

		And my hope is not to die, blessed though this be, but to look for the Saviour, "who shall change this vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.<a name=240:5></a>" We are running the race towards the place where our standing is.<a name=240:6></a> We are in Christ, but this is not the thing here.<a name=240:7></a> Got it we have; but how far does the cross really tell us the tale of what we are?<a name=240:8></a> Not only that our sins, but that we ourselves are put away.<a name=240:9></a> Can you say with the apostle, "The life which I now live in flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God?<a name=240:10></a>" Is there nothing in the circumstances down here by which we live?<a name=240:11></a> We must go through them, but are we living by them?<a name=240:12></a> Are we living to Him in that sense?<a name=240:13></a> There are many Christians who have no distinct idea that they are to take up their cross and follow Him.<a name=240:14></a> May we learn that the times press!<a name=240:15></a> May our hearts so really look at Christ that we may be in conscious relationship with Him, our affections there with Him, and because they are there, looking for Him to come from heaven to change this vile body because it will not suit that place!<a name=240:16></a> Where are our hearts?<a name=240:17></a> Have we the deep blessed sense that He has associated us with Himself?<a name=240:18></a> "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.<a name=240:19></a>"

		THOUGHTS ON PHILIPPIANS 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to rejoice always.<a name=241:1></a> It is important to consider the apostle's own history in connection with these epistles.<a name=241:2></a> When he was writing this, he was in prison at Rome.<a name=241:3></a> He had been cut short in his ministry, and as he looked on, he had to say, "All they which are in Asia, be turned away from me," and "All seek their own," etc.<a name=241:4></a>; and yet he had something which lifted his heart above it all; not that he was insensible to it, but he knew a superior power.<a name=241:5></a> It was as looking at Christ he could rejoice, not in these circumstances.<a name=241:6></a> In one chapter in Galatians he says, "I stand in doubt of you"; in the next, he says, "I have confidence in you through the Lord.<a name=241:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's own path was the same, meeting with disappointments and distresses, on every hand, and yet He prays that the disciples may have His joy fulfilled in themselves.<a name=241:8></a> It is living in a power superior to evil; and if I am not living in that power, I should be depressed and cast down by the stream of evil within and around me, instead of rejoicing always.<a name=241:9></a> To do this, it requires that the heart should be with Him who has already overcome and sat down.<a name=241:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first mark of power is patience.<a name=241:11></a> Nothing troubled the peace of the apostle's soul, so that he is free enough to think of individuals -- Euodias, etc.<a name=241:12></a> (verse 2) -- or to write about a runaway slave.<a name=241:13></a> He was passing through the valley of Baca, making it a well.<a name=241:14></a> It is a more blessed thing to make trials causes for thanksgiving than our own mercies.<a name=241:15></a> "I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall be continually in my mouth.<a name=241:16></a>" In all his many trying circumstances, he was finding that the Lord was sufficient.<a name=241:17></a> He possessed that eternal happiness which enabled him to say, when before Festus, "I would to God" that you were "altogether such as I am.<a name=241:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Are you so happy in your soul that you can say that?<a name=241:19></a> The young Christian rejoices in what he has got -- his salvation, joy, peace, and so on.<a name=241:20></a> The old Christian rejoices more in Christ.<a name=241:21></a> The young Christian says, I have got this, I have got that; but the old Christian says, Christ is this, and Christ is that.<a name=241:22></a> Not that this is wrong in a young Christian: in that sense a young Christian cannot be an old one; but if they walk with God, they will soon ripen.<a name=241:23></a> So in 1 John 2: 12-14, "I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning"; and while he goes into detail about the young men and babes, he repeats this of the old men.<a name=241:24></a>

		"Let your moderation," etc.<a name=242:8></a> Naturally I like to assert my rights in the world, and if I see injustice done, I like to resent it.<a name=242:9></a> Moderation is putting a check upon our own will, for the present content to be put upon this -- "The Lord is at hand.<a name=242:10></a>" When the Lord set His face like a flint to go to Jerusalem, the Samaritans would not receive Him, and the disciples wanted to draw down fire upon them.<a name=242:11></a> If you set your face like a flint to go to Jerusalem, you will not be received by those who are half-hearted.<a name=242:12></a> "The Lord is at hand.<a name=242:13></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 9.<a name=242:26></a> You walk in the path you have learned of me, and the God of peace Himself shall be with you.<a name=242:27></a> Joy is an up and down thing, but peace is something constant and undisturbed.<a name=242:28></a> God is never called the God of joy, but the God of peace.<a name=242:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		While Christ was with His disciples, during His ministry He never said to them, "Peace be unto you": it was rather, "Fear not.<a name=242:30></a>" But when He arose, He said, "Peace be unto you.<a name=242:31></a>" Christ has made peace by the blood of His cross in such a way, that if God rises up in every attribute He possesses, He sees nothing to disturb His peace.<a name=242:32></a> I am in the light as He is in the light; and if I have conflict with the world, the flesh, and Satan, I have peace with God.<a name=242:33></a>

		Philippians 4: 8
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to have the spirit so free from everything else, as to be able to be thus occupied with "these things.<a name=244:1></a>" It is not a healthy thing to be occupied with evil, though of course we must be sometimes.<a name=244:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Numbers 19, if anyone touched the unclean person, whoever had anything to do with it was unclean till even.<a name=244:3></a> You cannot have to say to evil, without getting, in a certain sense, away from God.<a name=244:4></a> It may not be like the man who had to be cleansed, and wait seven days; but the mind cannot touch sin without a certain removal from direct communion with God.<a name=244:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be necessary to go to a brother or sister who is in evil.<a name=244:6></a> I do not mean now temptation: there you get positive evil; but the man who touches is "unclean till even" -- a kind of warning against having to say to it.<a name=244:7></a> One sees persons who like to pry into evil; but, if in the power of the Spirit, I am occupied with "these things," which are pure, lovely, etc.<a name=244:8></a> I may have to come down, and be occupied for a time, as a duty, with that which God hates.<a name=244:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle of Numbers 19 remains the same.<a name=244:10></a> It was grace, and to restore communion.<a name=244:11></a> There a man was actually defiled.<a name=244:12></a> Sin is sin in God's sight, whatever way I have to do with it; and sin is hateful to God.<a name=244:13></a> Even if a man did not know, still he had to bring an offering.<a name=244:14></a> It was not a question of imputation here; the ashes of the red heifer were there, the testimony that the sin had all been consumed when the heifer was burned; but something had come in to destroy communion.<a name=244:15></a> The ashes put into the water gave the consciousness there was no imputation: that question was not raised; but the man could not go in to God for worship till he were clean.<a name=244:16></a> The very putting the ashes in gave the character that sin was judged for the saint, all done away; but then he may have been doing a thing that Christ had to die for.<a name=244:17></a> It is a question of holiness and my state, just because there is no imputation.<a name=244:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What he looks for here (Philippians 4) is, that their souls should be in the peaceful enjoyment of these things, what God likes and loves; and the God of peace should be with them.<a name=244:19></a> Now, when we meet in intercourse, are these the kind of things that occupy the mind?<a name=244:20></a> It may be mischievous talking -- that will not do you any good; or it may be idleness, vanity -- that is no good either; or it may be talking about people; but how far can God say, I can go there, for they are talking about things I like?<a name=244:21></a> "My heart is inditing a good matter, I will speak of the things I have made touching the king.<a name=244:22></a>" If the heart is inditing a good matter, we get fellowship and communion; the heart is full, and it comes out.<a name=244:23></a>

		Verse 10.<a name=245:2></a> The apostle let slip something here -- "now at the last.<a name=245:3></a>" He thought it rather a long time coming, and then, to correct it, immediately adds, "but ye lacked opportunity.<a name=245:4></a>" He let out that he had really been in need, and it had come at the last.<a name=245:5></a> It is beautiful to see the delicacy of intercourse in that way: we get it amongst ourselves.<a name=245:6></a> Like everything else, he just took it up for Christ.<a name=245:7></a> At Corinth, where they were rich, and fond of money, he would take nothing; but here he is very glad to have it.<a name=245:8></a>

		NOTES ON THE EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two Epistles of the New Testament are occupied with the mystery of the church united to Christ in one body, the Epistle to the Ephesians, and that to the Colossians.<a name=249:1></a> There is consequently identity in a measure between the two epistles; but they show the subject each under a particular aspect, presenting as to the details a sensible difference.<a name=249:2></a> In the first Paul sees the church in Christ, the saints occupying in Him their place in heaven; in the second he sees Christ in the saints (not them in Him) on the earth.<a name=249:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1: 1-3.<a name=249:4></a> Paul addresses himself to the Colossians from our God and Father [and the Lord Jesus Christ],<a href="#249:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> that is to say, on the footing of our relationship with God.<a name=249:5></a> He blesses the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the first source of all our blessings.<a name=249:6></a> This is the manner in which he enters upon his subject.<a name=249:7></a> This opening is the same as that of the Epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=249:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 4-12.<a name=249:9></a> But here is a difference.<a name=249:10></a> In the Epistle to the Ephesians, Paul, before coming to that which concerns the faith of the saints, and their spiritual condition, causes quite a stream of the riches of the grace of God to flow (Ephesians 1: 3-14); whilst in the Epistle to the Colossians he is occupied immediately with their condition.<a name=249:11></a> This would indicate that these latter were found in a lower moral condition than the former.<a name=249:12></a> He could, from the very outset, speak to the Ephesians of the riches of the counsels of God; the Colossians required him to be occupied with them firstly.<a name=249:13></a> In verse 4 Paul records their faith, and in verses 5-12 he recalls the work of God in their favour, expressing his desires and his prayers for their prosperity.<a name=249:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 9-12.<a name=249:15></a> This introduction presents to us a fine summary of all that one can ask of God for Christians.<a name=249:16></a> If we had sufficient confidence in the interest which God takes in His children, we should have greater boldness in asking God, according to the intentions of His grace.<a name=249:17></a> We do not live enough by this grace, and that is why our prayers are so constantly stamped with the sense of want.<a name=249:18></a> We are often the Abraham of Genesis 15, who asks for himself, saying to God: "What wilt thou give me?<a name=249:19></a>" But Paul shews himself here the Abraham of Genesis 18, sitting before God, worshipping Him, and making requests for others.<a name=249:20></a>

		As concerns this, we remark in Christ, as elements of His glory; two headships, one in creation, the other in resurrection (verse 15-18); two reconciliations, that of the creation, and that of the saints forming the church (verse 19-22); and two ministries proceeding from Him, the gospel preached to all creation, and the ministry of the church (verse 23-29).<a name=250:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 23.<a name=252:9></a> "If ye continue in the faith.<a name=252:10></a>" One may gather from these words that there was not much stability among the Colossians.<a name=252:11></a> The words "if ye continue in the faith," indicate a condition.<a name=252:12></a> As concerns this, we may remark, that the presentation of our persons to God, to which this condition would seem to be bound up, is very free for us, since it is God who does all that this condition requires (verse 22).<a name=252:13></a> But then (verse 23), if we abandoned Christianity we should lose our advantage, seeing that we should thereby have rejected the grace by which we were presented to God.<a name=252:14></a> This does not at all touch the election and the perseverance of the saints (one finds this language unceasingly in the epistles); it only proves that God, whose faithfulness guaranteed the accomplishment of His counsel, keeps ourselves, and that He keeps us morally.<a name=252:15></a>

		REMARKS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The comparison between the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians gives rise to the remarks which follow.<a name=260:1></a> They both treat of the church united to Christ, as being His body.<a name=260:2></a> But the Epistle to the Colossians goes rather to unfold the perfection of the Head, than to shew the privileges of the body; while the Epistle to the Ephesians does the reverse.<a name=260:3></a> The Ephesians being well grounded in faith and holding fast the truth of their union with Christ, the Holy Ghost could unfold to them the great privileges derived from that union.<a name=260:4></a> The Colossians, on the contrary, needed to be established in the faith and to be shewn Christ in His fulness, Head of the church.<a name=260:5></a> Thus the two subjects are complete, and present at once to us both the perfection of the Head, and the privileges of the body.<a name=260:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Epistle to the Ephesians the church, being in a good state, is seen on high in its position in Christ, and from there looking down contemplates what God is doing and going to do.<a name=260:7></a> In Colossians Paul shews rather what is on high, directs the Christian's gaze upward, shewing him the perfection of Christ, and the hope which is reserved for him in heaven.<a name=260:8></a> This position of the Christian awaiting the heavenly glory resembles a little that given him in the course where we see him pressing toward the mark.<a name=260:9></a> In this respect the subject of the Colossians approaches that of the Philippians.<a name=260:10></a> These two aspects of the Christian's position explain another difference remarked between Ephesians and Colossians.<a name=260:11></a> In one Paul says, Christ shall appear; in the other he does not speak of His return.<a name=260:12></a> The Ephesians are seen as being already on high.<a name=260:13></a> There is another epistle -- to the Galatians, where Paul keeps silent as to the coming of Jesus, without doubt for the opposite reason: the moral state of the Galatians was too low.<a name=260:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many things connected with the Holy Ghost in Ephesians are connected with the new man in Colossians, on account of the difference between the two on the common subject.<a name=260:15></a> In the Epistle to the Ephesians, where Paul looks principally at the body, he mentions necessarily the Holy Spirit who is in the body, uniting it all in one.<a name=260:16></a> In that to the Colossians, where individuality is more forcibly marked, he sees the new man characterised by the individual.<a name=260:17></a> Again two different effects: the Holy Spirit, the power of God which works in us; and the new man, the communicated divine nature, which renders us responsible.<a name=260:18></a>

		NOTES ON THE BEGINNING OF COLOSSIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to send you a few remarks from time to time, as the Lord may enable me, on the Epistle to the Colossians, chiefly for the help of the young who have recently been brought, in His great mercy, to know and love the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=261:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things in this epistle make it specially precious to such.<a name=261:2></a> The first is the way in which it so fully reveals the glory of Christ's Person, whether as Son of the Father's love, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwells, or as Creator, and Redeemer, and Head of His body, the church.<a name=261:3></a> The second thing is the way in which it unfolds "the mystery" for joy and consolation of the saints -- even Christ in them the hope of glory.<a name=261:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are the two great subjects set before our hearts by the Holy Ghost in this precious epistle; and what can be more strengthening or gladdening than to have the eye and heart filled with the glory of Jesus, and to have the joy and assurance of our intimate union with Him made good in our souls by the Holy Ghost?<a name=261:5></a> To walk in the light of His risen glory, and in the consciousness of our individual interest in His love is the great requirement in these evil days.<a name=261:6></a> Nothing else will give courage to confess Him before men; and this alone will deliver from all the snares of Satan, whether of worldliness on the one hand, or of religion on the other, which is not after Christ.<a name=261:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things will come before us, if the Lord will, by-and-by: meantime, let us follow the course of the epistle from the beginning.<a name=261:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first two verses we have the salutation of the apostle, and in the next three his thanksgiving on their behalf.<a name=261:9></a> He addresses them as Christ's apostle, clothed with the authority of His name, and charged them with the communication of His grace.<a name=261:10></a> Moreover, God had set him apart to this service.<a name=261:11></a> In the end of the chapter the apostle tells of a double ministry entrusted to him as the vessel of the grace of God: first, a ministry for the proclamation of the gospel to sinners; and second, a ministry for the church, to make known to the saints the unsearchable riches of Christ.<a name=261:12></a> It is in the exercise of this latter ministry that he writes this epistle.<a name=261:13></a> It is to bring the hearts of the saints into the assured knowledge and enjoyment of their place and portion in Christ so as to walk in peaceful communion with Him until He shall appear.<a name=261:14></a> This ministry he fulfils in the name, and as the apostle, of Jesus Christ.<a name=261:15></a> Thus the whole epistle flows directly from Christ through His chosen apostle.<a name=261:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we get his thanksgiving.<a name=262:5></a> He thanked God, even the Father of "our Lord Jesus Christ," praying always for them, for the hope laid up for them in heaven.<a name=262:6></a> Here we see how Paul identified himself with the interests of heaven.<a name=262:7></a> He had heard of the faith and love of these Colossians, and his heart at once turned to God in thanksgiving and prayers; thanksgiving that He had linked with heaven this fresh company of believers, and that He had done it.<a name=262:8></a> And note well, that it was not what they were delivered from that here occupies him, though he does not forget that, as we see lower down; nor is it what was wrought in them, blessed as that was; but it is what they were called to -- that bright and blessed portion in heaven -- the hope laid up for them there.<a name=262:9></a> Thus he would evidently fill their minds with what they were going to; and in his own sense of its exceeding excellency and glory he thanks God on their behalf as heirs of such an inheritance.<a name=262:10></a>

		This is a very important point.<a name=262:11></a> For there is a great tendency, in the first joy of faith and fervour of feeling, to be occupied with the joy and with the feeling; and when afterwards trials and exercises of heart and conscience have to be passed through, to be occupied with them, or with what will give present deliverance and help, and to forget the bright and blessed hope laid up for us in heaven -- the place of rest and glory with Himself, which Jesus is gone to prepare.<a name=262:12></a> But how can I journey on to Canaan through the trials and exercises of the wilderness if my heart has lost the sense of the blessedness of the Canaan I am going to?<a name=262:13></a> We are redeemed, not for the wilderness, but for Canaan; we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<a name=262:14></a> And when the glory of God is indeed our joy, we can add, "Not only so, but we glory in tribulations also.<a name=262:15></a>" For then we know and experience that these very tribulations are all made to work for our good, and to further us on our way.<a name=262:16></a> For "tribulation worketh patience.<a name=262:17></a>" It free us from the restlessness of our own will, which would turn aside, and delivers us, besides, from the fear of what man can do to us.<a name=262:18></a> We learn to trust in God.<a name=262:19></a> We learn, moreover, how little we can be the authors of our own blessing, and we count more and more on the constant watchfulness and love, and care of a Father in heaven.<a name=262:20></a> His love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.<a name=262:21></a> We know that we are in these tribulations because the objects of His love, the ransomed ones of His grace from the fire that shall never be quenched.<a name=262:22></a> And then, besides, we are on our way to God.<a name=262:23></a> Thus having the end in view enables us to confess that we are strangers and pilgrims on the earth, and it brightens with hope every step of the way.<a name=262:24></a> Otherwise we get weary, becoming faint in our minds.<a name=262:25></a> But if living in the midst of things that are unseen and eternal, the inward man is renewed day by day, and that, too, at the very time that the outward world is perishing and falling into decay.<a name=262:26></a>

		But we now come to a third point, and that is -- the ground of this thanksgiving on behalf of these Colossians.<a name=263:1></a> How could the apostle give thanks so assuredly on their behalf, having never seen them?<a name=263:2></a> Verse 4 tells us.<a name=263:3></a> It was because he had heard of their faith in the Lord Jesus, and of their love to all the saints.<a name=263:4></a> These were the grand distinguishing features and characteristics of the divine life in man.<a name=263:5></a> And these being of God, he well knew that all who possessed them were bound up for ever in the bundle of life with the Lord Jesus Christ, and that where He was there should they be also.<a name=263:6></a> These were the essentials.<a name=263:7></a> In Christ Jesus nothing avails but "faith which worketh by love.<a name=263:8></a>" First, faith, which came to Jesus with all its load of sin and unworthiness because it had nowhere else to go, and because it saw a love and a holiness in Him which received sinners and made Him their companion and their friend; and then love which, having Him for its object, necessarily had all who were His.<a name=263:9></a> Faith not only thus comes to Jesus at the first, but it binds the soul to Him as risen, and is ever receiving of His fulness.<a name=263:10></a> And love, having seen the saints as the precious ones of His heart, enfolds them for ever in its bosom with a most tender affection.<a name=263:11></a> They are dear to Him.<a name=263:12></a> This is the motive of love, and it never fails.<a name=263:13></a> It clothes with divine comeliness all the objects of His grace.<a name=263:14></a> And what it does to them it does as unto Him; and great is its reward.<a name=263:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the previous verses we had three points brought before us.<a name=263:16></a> First, is the apostle's salutation, in which he regards the saints as the objects of the present favour of the Father, and of the peace which He gives.<a name=263:17></a> Happy position!<a name=263:18></a> secured to us for ever in Christ.<a name=263:19></a> And sweet it is thus to be able to view the saints at all times, whatever their practical condition may be, as dear to God, the excellent of the earth, whose present peace and blessing He seeks, even as He has secured it for us for ever in Christ.<a name=263:20></a> In fellowship with these thoughts of God, the apostle greets them with grace and peace from God their Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=263:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, secondly, we had his thanksgiving for the hope laid up for them in heaven.<a name=264:1></a> Heaven was near to his thoughts.<a name=264:2></a> Jesus was there.<a name=264:3></a> He had entered in, and He was preparing a place for them.<a name=264:4></a> He is to come again to take us to Himself, that we may be for ever with Him.<a name=264:5></a> And when He shall be manifested then shall we also be manifested with Him in glory.<a name=264:6></a> This latter, perhaps, was more especially the hope here before him; Christ in them "the hope of glory.<a name=264:7></a>" What rest of heart the apostle had in contemplating this issue of Christ's travail on their behalf, their being with Him for ever in heaven!<a name=264:8></a> Many an exercise he had on their behalf even as to the very condition they were in at the time he was writing to them; they had lost the sense of their place with their risen Head; at any rate it had become much enfeebled, and with the enfeebling of this all else became enfeebled too.<a name=264:9></a> He had great agony for them; and this was Christ's Spirit yearning in him over them for their deliverance, and for their entrance in living power into the joy and comfort of the mystery.<a name=264:10></a> But when he turned to heaven all was peace; he could give thanks to the Father for the portion He had laid up for them there.<a name=264:11></a> Christ was there.<a name=264:12></a> The Head was there, and with Him everyone of the members should appear in glory.<a name=264:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, thirdly, in verse 4 we had the ground of this thanksgiving as far as they were concerned -- even their faith in the Lord Jesus and love to all the saints.<a name=264:14></a> Grace had wrought in them already, and he at once connects it with glory.<a name=264:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=265>[Page 265]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the close of verse 5, and in the next, a new subject comes before him -- the gospel, "the word of the truth of the gospel.<a name=265:1></a>" In connection with this he makes three statements, each of them weighty and important, as indeed every word of God is.<a name=265:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, he connects the hope laid up for them in heaven with the word of the truth of the gospel.<a name=265:3></a> The gospel, the good tidings of grace, had wrapped up in it also good tidings of glory.<a name=265:4></a> It was in the word of the truth of the gospel that they had heard of the hope laid up for them in heaven.<a name=265:5></a> Such was the range and scope of the gospel, at least which they had heard; it was God's good news not only of the forgiveness of sins through the blood of His Son, but of eternal blessedness with Him in heaven.<a name=265:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How could it be otherwise?<a name=265:7></a> Christ was in heaven, and we are redeemed to be with Him.<a name=265:8></a> The cross put Him in glory, and it puts all there who trust in Him too.<a name=265:9></a> Blessed is it to know what we are delivered from -- the wages of sin -- eternal separation from God, who is love, the fountain of all goodness and joy; and this, too, as the expression of His everlasting displeasure.<a name=265:10></a> But how much more blessed to know that His perfect love did not spare His own Son, not only that I might not perish, but that I might know Him and be with Himself for ever!<a name=265:11></a> Jesus was forsaken for us, that we might be for ever brought nigh.<a name=265:12></a> This gives the heart an object as well as perfect peace to the conscience.<a name=265:13></a> It delivers also from this present evil world; the brightness and blessedness of that One discovering the true condition of this world -- far from God and in bondage of Satan, and under wrath because of having rejected Jesus.<a name=265:14></a> The word of the truth of the gospel reveals all this -- the true condition of man and his world; and the perfect grace of God which has wrought in the cross for us, and which has wrought in them by the gospel, giving them a place even now with Him who bore it for them, and the hope of being with Him for ever in heaven.<a name=265:15></a> It was the word of the truth of the gospel, and on it they might rely with confidence.<a name=265:16></a> Man and his glory was passing away, but the word of the Lord should endure for ever.<a name=265:17></a> And this was the word which by the gospel was preached unto them.<a name=265:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What firmness of step, and what buoyancy of spirit this heavenly hope gives to him who has it in passing through this world!<a name=265:19></a> Then we realise that we are not of it, and that we are on our way to God.<a name=265:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=266>[Page 266]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A second characteristic of the gospel was its universality.<a name=266:1></a> It had reached them, and was among them, as indeed it was in the world.<a name=266:2></a> It was no mere Jewish tidings; it was for man.<a name=266:3></a> Offences abounded among the Jews; but where "sin" abounded, a far wider thing, there grace did much more abound.<a name=266:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, thirdly, it was bringing forth fruit in all the world and amongst them too.<a name=266:5></a> It was gathering souls to God through Christ wherever it went, but besides, it was bringing forth fruit in those who were gathered.<a name=266:6></a> This last point is plainly implied in the clause which follows: "Since the day ye heard it, and knew the grace of God in truth.<a name=266:7></a>" Ever since it was the power of fruit-bearing, as at the first it was the seed of eternal life.<a name=266:8></a> This is a very important point, and one we are apt often to forget.<a name=266:9></a> The seed that fell into the good ground brought forth fruit; some thirty, some sixty, and some an hundredfold.<a name=266:10></a> We have become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that we should be married to another, even to Him who is raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.<a name=266:11></a> This is the simple natural result of union with Jesus risen.<a name=266:12></a> And the grace of God, when known in truth, sets us thus before God in Christ, the fruits of which union we are to manifest down here upon the earth.<a name=266:13></a> We are to walk in newness of life, that is, of response Godward.<a name=266:14></a> In order to do this, we must abide in Him.<a name=266:15></a> But when simply holding the Head, everything is fruit, fruit unto God.<a name=266:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a place of honour and glory this is -- of being here in this world the living channels of the affections and virtues of Christ hid in God.<a name=266:17></a> Oh!<a name=266:18></a> that we esteemed it more.<a name=266:19></a> Thus it is we adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, by manifesting in this world of sin and in the trying circumstances of daily life, not what flesh is, but what Christ is; our hearts feeding upon His love, whilst we lean upon His arm and are guided by His eye.<a name=266:20></a> What interest He takes in our being fruitful, that His Father may be glorified!<a name=266:21></a> Will He fail us in the hour of need?<a name=266:22></a> He lets us come into it just that we may prove how abundant are His resources to make us victors over all the power of the enemy.<a name=266:23></a>

		RECONCILIATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Colossians 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a certain aspect, the Epistle to the Colossians does not take us up so far as the Ephesians does.<a name=267:1></a> The latter takes up very distinctly the purpose and counsels of God and the new creation.<a name=267:2></a> Hence the contrast of it with man in the old is presented in a very remarkable way.<a name=267:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians we read that God has made us "sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus," and the Holy Ghost as the seal of our state; whilst in Colossians we are "risen with Christ," and that life and its place are largely developed, but yet we are upon earth ourselves, and are to "seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=267:4></a>" Hence in Ephesians man is not looked at as a responsible person, to see what can be got out of him, and his responsibility met in grace as in the Romans; it begins with him as dead in sins.<a name=267:5></a> It is an entirely new thing.<a name=267:6></a> We are created in Christ Jesus.<a name=267:7></a> Even as to Christ Himself, it begins with Him as dead -- as a man that is raised from the dead -- and with man as "dead in trespasses and sins.<a name=267:8></a>" It is not that man is a living sinner, as we have it in Romans, where the whole question of responsibility is looked at; but the man is dead in trespasses and sins, Christ has come down into the death that he is in.<a name=267:9></a> Christ is quickened out of it, and we are quickened together with Him, and raised up together, and seated together in heavenly places.<a name=267:10></a> Now Colossians does not go so far as this.<a name=267:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Epistle to the Romans man is always looked upon as living in the world; he is alive in his sins; and it takes him up in his responsibility, and brings fully home to Jew and Gentile their state.<a name=267:12></a> It does not speak of man being dead in sins, but he is to die because of being alive in sins.<a name=267:13></a> And when he is a Christian, he is still a living man in this world, Christ his life, and justified, and in Christ, but alive here though dead to sin, and exhorted to present his body a living sacrifice.<a name=267:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Colossians you get man dead to sin through the cross of Christ, and then, though in this world, risen with Christ, as in Ephesians (which you do not get in Romans), but not, as there, carried on to sit in heavenly places.<a name=267:15></a> Here man is a risen man -- not physically so, of course; his hope is laid up for him in heaven; he is not sitting there, but walking in this world as a risen man -- risen in Christ; thus, being alive, he is connected with Christ; he is "quickened together with him," and therefore it is "having forgiven you all trespasses.<a name=267:16></a>" Christ has come down to where we were lying dead in our sins, has borne and put them away by His death, and then we were quickened and raised up along with Him, all sins forgiven.<a name=267:17></a> Thus, when we were raised up with Him, we came clean out of the whole thing in which we were.<a name=267:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=268>[Page 268]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still in Colossians we get far more of what Christ is in us, than of what we are in Christ.<a name=268:1></a> It is "Christ in you," not you in Christ; it is Christ in us down here.<a name=268:2></a> And this is what makes the epistle exceedingly precious; you have in it the fullest development of life here, in the Christian in his tried condition on the earth.<a name=268:3></a> It is "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=268:4></a> Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<a name=268:5></a> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=268:6></a>" And then it is, "When Christ, who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<a name=268:7></a>" He first puts the man as risen with Christ, and then his heart and affections all go up after Him to where He is at the right hand of God.<a name=268:8></a> There is no mention of the Holy Ghost in Colossians.<a name=268:9></a> It is the fullest bringing out of the life of a person in Christ still walking in this world.<a name=268:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 we see the condition and standing of the Christian, and the bearing of this on his walk.<a name=268:11></a> How blessedly he puts the Christian in his place through grace!<a name=268:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place I read verse 14: "In whom we have redemption [through his blood], even the forgiveness of sins.<a name=268:13></a>" I take this as the very starting-point -- the forgiveness of sins.<a name=268:14></a> We get the blessed truth -- this first truth, if you please -- of grace, and joy, and peace; complete forgiveness through Christ.<a name=268:15></a> He has come down to us and redeemed us out of the condition we were in.<a name=268:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure, the more we go on from day to day, the more important we see it is to get hold of this, though it be an elementary truth, now that there is so much seeking for an unfinished forgiveness.<a name=268:17></a> When I am brought into God's presence, that which I have upon my conscience is the sins I have committed; of course I cannot have those I have not.<a name=268:18></a> And therefore when persons are brought to the knowledge of saving forgiveness, the sins of which they have a sense of forgiveness are those that they have committed.<a name=268:19></a> But when it comes to those they have not, then comes the question, "What about the future?<a name=268:20></a>" And then arise in men's minds various ways of getting rid of them, from the gross form of absolution to the more subtle form of the Eucharist.<a name=268:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=269>[Page 269]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you take a person who is upon Calvin's ground, he tells you to look back to your baptism; while the ordinary evangelical teaches you to look to a perpetual sprinkling again with the blood of Christ, a thing unknown to Scripture, and you will find he is never settled.<a name=269:1></a> But it is settled, and so completely that, if all my sins are not now set aside to all eternity, they never can be.<a name=269:2></a> Christ must otherwise take the cross and have the sins laid upon Him now, which is impossible, for He is in glory.<a name=269:3></a> "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=269:4></a>" That word "for ever" there means not only eternally, but uninterruptedly; there is permanency in it before God, no discontinuance.<a name=269:5></a> It is not the word that speaks of eternity, though, of course, it is that too; but it is permanently perfect before God.<a name=269:6></a> As Christ is always ("for ever" here is the same word) sitting at the right hand of God, our conscience is for ever perfect; it is used in Hebrews 10: 12, to shew He has nothing more to do.<a name=269:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these days it is really important to get clear on the point of our sins being put away -- I mean as to justification before God, and to see that I am before God always upon that ground, because Christ has borne all my sins.<a name=269:8></a> That is the first thing given here -- the first elementary thing, though not the first thing named.<a name=269:9></a> It is an eternal redemption; it is never discontinued or interrupted, for God can never overlook that which has so perfectly glorified Himself.<a name=269:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we see another point which the apostle here speaks of.<a name=269:11></a> The whole state of things in heaven and in earth -- they will all be reconciled -- all things made new.<a name=269:12></a> And then he adds, "And you, who were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.<a name=269:13></a>" The creation has got ruined, corrupted, defiled by sin, though, of course, it could not be guilty as active in it; and it will all be reconciled.<a name=269:14></a> But he begins now with those who were active in this ruin -- who were "enemies in their minds.<a name=269:15></a>" I am reconciled to God, brought back to Him in a divine righteousness that has been worked out for me; there is not a question between me and God.<a name=269:16></a> Here is infinite divine love.<a name=269:17></a> We are brought to God -- reconciled to God; and it is a great point to be consciously before God, to enjoy His love, knowing that He has nothing against us, and so our hearts in entire confidence, able to think of Him and His favour, not of ourselves.<a name=269:18></a>

		This epistle especially insists on life -- the divine nature which is born of God, and is capable of delighting in Him, and of understanding His righteousness.<a name=270:7></a> Having this life I know, through the gift of Christ, and by the power of the Holy Ghost, the divine favour resting upon me: and I can rest there, and that is a great thing.<a name=270:8></a> It is not merely that I am forgiven -- that my sins are all blotted out, but that God has wrought -- even for His own glory -- wrought a work in which He Himself is perfectly glorified.<a name=270:9></a> By Him I believe in God.<a name=270:10></a> And what do I believe?<a name=270:11></a> Why, that He has brought me, associated with Christ, into His own presence; sin is gone, and I am made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=270:12></a> I get to the very secret and spring of God's nature; I get the very source of what He is in Himself, and am able to enjoy it.<a name=270:13></a> I have not a word to say for myself; I was totally lost, and now I am totally saved, not according to what man ought to be, but according to what God is.<a name=270:14></a> If it were according to what man ought to be, there would be no salvation needed; but that is not it.<a name=270:15></a>

It can be occupied much in good works, be without reproach as to conduct, have much of self-denial, much of piety, plenty of humility, be much occupied with the love of God, but while pretending, perhaps, to found it upon His love (which is infinite), it will be that love which is in the heart -- our love to Him. One may ask, But, if all these things can exist in a person and be nothing but the flesh, how can we discern the true circumcision? It rejoices in Christ Jesus. Nothing is easier than to judge these things, if Christ is our all. The fact that He is so makes us feel, without hesitancy, that all this is flesh, and yields its help to that which destroys Christianity from its foundations. The flesh is very pious when it acts the pious, for it always rejoices in itself.

		DEAD WITH CHRIST, RISEN WITH CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Colossians 2: 20; 3: 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian's risen life is exhibited in two things -- death unto that which is here, and heavenly-mindedness.<a name=290:1></a> "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ," writes the apostle, "from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances?<a name=290:2></a>" The expression "rudiments of the world," goes a vast way.<a name=290:3></a> I am to be dead, not only to sin, but to all the religiousness of human nature.<a name=290:4></a> A Jew has this religiousness, and it was cultivated of God; but it brought not forth good fruit, it produced nothing but "wild grapes.<a name=290:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if we do not see that we are risen, we shall be cultivating human nature, for God.<a name=290:6></a> He Himself has tried this already; and He says, that not anything could have been done more than He has done; Isaiah 5.<a name=290:7></a> But man would still, still be striving to cultivate the religiousness of human nature, and introduce sinners into heaven, otherwise than by death.<a name=290:8></a> We are dead and risen again, and it is simply heavenly.<a name=290:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this, is the real power of our living above sin.<a name=290:10></a> It assumes death, it goes upon the principle that we are "dead to sin," Romans 6.<a name=290:11></a> We get a blessed liberty in seeing and accounting ourselves dead.<a name=290:12></a> We have a new life.<a name=290:13></a> Christ has taken His place where death and resurrection have put Him.<a name=290:14></a> And there I am, where Christ is.<a name=290:15></a> It is altogether another life, and this life has its own world, and its own sphere of affections.<a name=290:16></a> "They that are after the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit," Romans 8: 5.<a name=290:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Resurrection life is manifested in walking through this world as abstracted, withdrawn from, unactuated by, the motives of the world.<a name=290:18></a> A Christian has new motives.<a name=290:19></a> -- If I see a man walking through the world without things here affecting him; I say, "He is either mad -- or risen with Christ.<a name=290:20></a>" Alas!<a name=290:21></a> we are not as consistent as madmen.<a name=290:22></a> All the motives in the world never touch the new nature.<a name=290:23></a> Do you think it could be thinking about friendship with the world?<a name=290:24></a> could be seeking riches, or honour, or power?<a name=290:25></a> The motives which actuate men have no influence upon it.<a name=290:26></a> Perplexity comes in by our having a motive which is not drawn from heaven; whenever I see myself, or another, in difficulty, I may be quite sure some other motive is at work.<a name=290:27></a> There is always a tendency to decline from this singleness of eye.<a name=290:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When we first receive the knowledge of life in Christ, we are absorbed, we readily admit all else to be "dung and dross," Philippians 3 But when decline comes in, we get old motives into action again.<a name=291:1></a> Little by little, we are not absorbed, and then a hundred things begin to be motives -- things of which I took no notice, which did not act before.<a name=291:2></a> People say, "What harm is there in it?<a name=291:3></a>" When I begin to inquire, "What harm is there in this, or in that?<a name=291:4></a>" there is the tendency to decline.<a name=291:5></a> There may be no harm in the thing, but the thought about it shews that I am not absorbed with that which is heavenly.<a name=291:6></a> "Thou hast left thy first love.<a name=291:7></a>" It is not in great sins, but here, that decline in the saints is manifested.<a name=291:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the sense of grace is diminished, we decline in practice.<a name=291:9></a> Our motives must be in God.<a name=291:10></a> Sometimes, effort is made to press conduct, works, and practice; because (it is said) full grace was preached before; now, that there is decline in practice, you must preach practice.<a name=291:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which is the rather to be pressed, is grace -- the first grace.<a name=291:12></a> It is grace, not legalism, will restore the soul.<a name=291:13></a> Where the sense of grace is diminished, the conscience may be, at the same time, uncommonly active, and then it condemns the pressing of grace, and legalism is the result.<a name=291:14></a> When conscience has been put in action through the claims of grace, that is not legalism; and there will be holy practice in detail.<a name=291:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may fall into either of two faults -- that of (because fruits have not been produced) preaching fruits; or, that of getting at ease, when certain things come to have influence over us again, through thinking that what we approved of before, was legalism.<a name=291:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall not get back by dwelling on detail.<a name=291:17></a> Christ is the great motive for everything; and we must get up into the knowledge of resurrection in Christ, to remedy detail.<a name=291:18></a> Here, there is a wonderful truth, and wonderful liberty.<a name=291:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another very important point is, the tone and spirit of our walk.<a name=291:20></a> Confidence in God, and gentleness of spirit, is that which becomes the saint.<a name=291:21></a> For this we must be at home with God.<a name=291:22></a> The effect of thus walking in Christ, setting the Lord ever before us, is always to make us walk with reverence -- lowliness, adoration, quietness, ease, and happiness.<a name=291:23></a> If I go where I am unaccustomed to be -- if I get, for instance, into a great house, I may have much kindness shewn me there, but when I get out again, I feel at ease; I am glad to be out.<a name=291:24></a> Had I been brought up in that house, I should feel otherwise.<a name=291:25></a> The soul is not only happy in God for itself, but it will bring the tone of that house out with it; because of its joy in God, anxieties disappear, and it will move through the ten thousand things, that would trouble and prove anxieties to another, without being a bit troubled.<a name=291:26></a> No matter what it may be, we bring quietness of spirit into all circumstances, whilst abiding in God.<a name=291:27></a>

		NOTES ON THE EPISTLES TO THE THESSALONIANS - THE FIRST EPISTLE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Thessalonians received Paul's first epistle, they had not long been converted to the Lord.<a name=293:1></a> They then were in all the freshness of Christian life, waiting for the Son of God from heaven, and suffering persecution for His sake.<a name=293:2></a> But their faith was mixed with a measure of obscurity.<a name=293:3></a> They thought that those from among them who had died would not see the Lord at His coming.<a name=293:4></a> To meet their need, the Holy Spirit addresses this epistle to them, in order to establish their faith, to give them light as to the coming of Jesus, and to comfort them in the midst of the persecutions they were going through.<a name=293:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1: 1.<a name=293:6></a> "The church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father.<a name=293:7></a>" The Epistles to the Thessalonians present the only instance where we find the expression, "in God the Father," used to indicate the position of a church.<a name=293:8></a> In the other epistles, in general, Paul says, "the church of God which is at Corinth," or "the saints which are at Ephesus," etc.<a name=293:9></a> It is probably because the Thessalonians were recently brought to the faith that Paul speaks of them in this way.<a name=293:10></a> Taking, so to speak, this church at its birth, he only sees it in its relationship to God.<a name=293:11></a> "One God and Father" -- such is the first notion that springs from faith.<a name=293:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Grace be unto you and peace": that is to say, May all the energy and riches of that grace in which you stand be displayed in you.<a name=293:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 3.<a name=293:14></a> The great christian principles shewed themselves in all their force among the Thessalonians; hence it is that we remark so much freshness in their spiritual condition.<a name=293:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Your work of faith.<a name=293:16></a>" See the acts which belong to faith -- acts like those which are presented in Hebrews 11 and in James 2; the act of Abraham delivering up his son, and that of Rahab preferring Israel to her own country, etc.<a name=293:17></a>

		NOTES ON THE EPISTLES TO THE THESSALONIANS - THE SECOND EPISTLE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The summary of the second Epistle to the Thessalonians is this.<a name=300:19></a> False teachers had come, taking advantage of the little light which the Thessalonians (as yet young in the faith) possessed on the Lord's return; and seizing the occasion of their tribulation, they had thrown them into trouble of mind by telling them, "The day is present.<a name=300:20></a>" In opposition to this work of the enemy, Paul reassures them by writing to them this epistle, the object of which is to shew them that the day of the Lord was not yet present.<a name=300:21></a> These data are the key to the book.<a name=300:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#300:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The doctrine of perfect sanctification, preached by Wesley, does not admit of the communication of life which is made to the believer; it only requires the action of the Spirit on man such as he is. "The Holy Spirit," it says, "sanctifies the body, the soul, and the spirit." At bottom, this is to set aside regeneration; and it is perhaps for that very reason that the same doctrine will see something good in man, and gives this definition of sin, "a wilful transgression of the law." If sin is merely a wilful transgression of the law, Paul was wrong to express such grief about sin where it was not wilful; Romans 7.

		Chapter 1.<a name=301:1></a> In this epistle, as in the preceding one, Paul, in saluting the church of the Thessalonians, sees it "in God our Father," verse 1, 2.<a name=301:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, before entering upon the special subject, the apostle considers the circumstances of the Thessalonians; and, on the occasion of their sufferings for the gospel, he recognises their good estate in Christ, and finds in their tribulations an evidence that they were really in the Christian position.<a name=301:3></a> "Your faith," he says, "increases exceedingly and your love abounds, so that we ourselves make our boast in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions .<a name=301:4></a>.<a name=301:5></a>.<a name=301:6></a> .<a name=301:7></a> For these tribulations are the portion of those who inherit the kingdom of God," verse 3-5.<a name=301:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he shews in what an end these tribulations would issue and the change of position they were preparing between the persecuted and the persecutors at the appearing of the Lord Jesus.<a name=301:9></a> In that day we shall be at rest while the wicked will find themselves in tribulation.<a name=301:10></a> The Lord will manifest against them His retributive justice.<a name=301:11></a> This change of condition is not mentioned, as though it were only to be accomplished at the Lord's appearing; but the words by which it is expressed shew what will be the respective condition of saints and unbelievers at that moment.<a name=301:12></a> It is already a first intimation, shewing that the Lord will not put the saints into sorrow and trouble when He comes; verse 5-10.<a name=301:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 5.<a name=301:14></a> "A manifest token of the righteous judgment of God.<a name=301:15></a>" The persecutions which the Thessalonians endured proved they were "counted worthy of the kingdom of God.<a name=301:16></a>" The judgment of God would bring this into evidence, as it would also manifest what had been the conduct of the persecutors.<a name=301:17></a>

		Having the declaration that the Lord should come and gather them together to Himself before that day, and being themselves still on earth, the Thessalonians had, by this very fact, a proof that the day was not yet present.<a name=302:16></a>

		Verses 3, 4.<a name=302:17></a> Here is another proof.<a name=302:18></a> The one who will be the object of the Lord's judgment in that day was not yet on the scene.<a name=302:19></a> As long as, on the one hand, those who are to be on the seat of judgment are not gathered together (the saints above), and while, on the other hand the criminal is not brought to the bar, there can be no judgment.<a name=302:20></a>

		"That which restrains;" the Greek means a thing.<a name=302:26></a> What is it?<a name=302:27></a> God has not told us what it is, and this, doubtless, because the thing which restrained then is not that which restrains now.<a name=302:28></a> Then it was, in one sense, the Roman empire, as the fathers thought; who saw in the power of the Roman empire a hindrance to the revelation of the man of sin, and thus prayed for the prosperity of that empire.<a name=302:29></a> At present the hindrance is still the existence of the governments established by God in the world; and God will maintain them as long as there is here below the gathering of His church.<a name=302:30></a> Viewed in this light, the hindrance is, at the bottom, the presence of the church and of the Holy Spirit on the earth.<a name=302:31></a>

		Two things are needed thus to meet the Lord.<a name=307:1></a> First, the conscience must be right: I may have the kindest father, yet if my conscience is not right, I cannot be glad to meet him; and, secondly, affections must be there -- the Lord must be my portion.<a name=307:2></a> If my heart is on literature, or on anything else here, I shall not like to be where Jesus is.<a name=307:3></a> I shall rather be here for a time.<a name=307:4></a> If you like the world, you are fit for the world.<a name=307:5></a> Heaven is just the contrary, and you know it; and therefore you do not want to go there, because it would take you from being here in the world.<a name=307:6></a> There is the comfort of the gospel.<a name=307:7></a> It did bring down to men's consciences all that would attract God.<a name=307:8></a> But alas!<a name=307:9></a> men no more desired the Lord's company here, than they do there.<a name=307:10></a> The coming and rejection of Christ here is the plain proof that the world is not fit for Him, and He is not fit for them.<a name=307:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now to turn to John 14.<a name=307:12></a> We find persons here the opposite of all that is in the world.<a name=307:13></a> "Let not your heart be troubled.<a name=307:14></a>" About what?<a name=307:15></a> His leaving them.<a name=307:16></a> Their happiness, comfort, and joy was in having Christ with them.<a name=307:17></a> But now, he says, I am going, but I am not going to be happy without you.<a name=307:18></a> There is plenty of room for you.<a name=307:19></a> The thing with which He at once comforts their hearts is this, "I will come again.<a name=307:20></a>" I cannot stay down here in this vile place, I am going to prepare a place for you, but I will come again and receive you unto Myself, that where I am there ye may be also.<a name=307:21></a> The Lord reckons on this satisfying their hearts; and their consciences did not hinder.<a name=307:22></a> "The Father's house!<a name=307:23></a>" Oh!<a name=307:24></a> they could go there.<a name=307:25></a> "I will receive you unto myself.<a name=307:26></a>" He knew the chord that rung in their hearts: to be with Himself, the source of all blessing.<a name=307:27></a> Thus we get the character of these disciples: they were persons whom the absence of Jesus distressed, and whom the presence of Jesus would comfort, not here, but with Himself.<a name=307:28></a>

		There we find what begot this character.<a name=308:1></a> It was all founded on His own word.<a name=308:2></a> We do not care for what does not concern us.<a name=308:3></a> But as soon as we see a thing that concerns us, it becomes important; and then we want certainty.<a name=308:4></a> Now it is very blessed to have God's own word for the basis of our certainty.<a name=308:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For instance, I am a sinner -- how then can I get into the Father's house?<a name=308:6></a> Because God has said "Their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.<a name=308:7></a>" Well, God is true, and He will not remember them.<a name=308:8></a> Do you say I am presumptuous to say so?<a name=308:9></a> I do not say so; God says so; and again in John 5: 24, "He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation"; and John 3: 33, "He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.<a name=308:10></a>" Thus when the power of the Spirit brings home the word, I have certainty.<a name=308:11></a> Faith is in the word, but it is about something.<a name=308:12></a> Christ is presented, and man is brought to the test.<a name=308:13></a> People always judge by their inclination, and not by their reasoning.<a name=308:14></a> Now the effect of the testimony of the Spirit of God when Christ is revealed is that men are not fit for Him, and their hearts do not like to be with Him.<a name=308:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These disciples had loved the Lord.<a name=308:16></a> Christ had attraction for their hearts.<a name=308:17></a> There at once we see the object of their hearts' affections.<a name=308:18></a> Christ had fixed their hearts.<a name=308:19></a> Take Mary Magdalene, for instance.<a name=308:20></a> She was all wrong in her intelligence, yet Christ had attraction for her heart.<a name=308:21></a> So with the rest of the disciples.<a name=308:22></a> They all ran away for fear; but it was love to Christ that brought them into the place of fear.<a name=308:23></a> Thus we see that Christ Himself was the object of their hearts.<a name=308:24></a> They were the companions of Christ -- all fear being gone -- according to His love and grace.<a name=308:25></a> "Ye are they," He said, "who have continued with me in my temptations.<a name=308:26></a>" Why?<a name=308:27></a> He had continued with them; but He speaks as if indebted to them for this fellowship.<a name=308:28></a> And being in companionship with Christ in heart, He brings them into all joy into which He is going -- nothing less than the Father's house.<a name=308:29></a> What attracts me is found in Christ, and then I get from Him the certain assurance that He is coming -- and coming for me.<a name=308:30></a> Now when the heart is on Christ, what a thing it is to know that He is coming!<a name=308:31></a> Am I afraid?<a name=308:32></a> No, I am looking for Him.<a name=308:33></a> And it is to His Father's house He is to bring me.<a name=308:34></a> All that makes heaven a home to Christ will make it a home to me.<a name=308:35></a> O come, Lord Jesus.<a name=308:36></a> If I have learnt to love Christ, I have learnt to love holiness, to love God.<a name=308:37></a> God, in Christ, has brought down to my soul all that God is.<a name=308:38></a> What shall I get in heaven?<a name=308:39></a> Another Christ?<a name=308:40></a> Another God?<a name=308:41></a> No.<a name=308:42></a> It is the one we have seen and known.<a name=308:43></a> "Whither I go ye know.<a name=308:44></a>" I am going to the Father, and you have seen the Father in me.<a name=308:45></a>

		The fact of flesh (that is, of the flesh being in us) does not make a bad conscience.<a name=311:1></a> It requires flesh in action, so as to produce outwardly what is bad, to do so.<a name=311:2></a>
	</div>

		"Holding faith and a good conscience" -- in this we have the doctrine of the epistle.<a name=311:3></a> I may see what is beautiful in creation, and delight in it; but the moment I rest in it, I make it an object, and then sink down into it.<a name=311:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"We know" is a technical expression for Christian knowledge.<a name=311:5></a> It is not merely knowing objectively, but rather such and such is made a subject of revelation, and we have got it and know it.<a name=311:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Using the law lawfully" is convicting sinners by it.<a name=311:7></a> The legalist takes the ground that the law proves he cannot take.<a name=311:8></a> The law never goes beyond the brazen altar, that is, man's responsibility as man.<a name=311:9></a> The law condemns all that flesh produces, but not flesh itself.<a name=311:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sabbath -- rest -- is an integral part of man's relationship with God; God did rest in creation, but not now since man has fallen.<a name=311:11></a> The sabbath is annexed to everything (or order) that is set up (with responsible man as man); but in the New Testament, it is always set aside as is man, the child of Adam fallen.<a name=311:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul calls himself the chief of sinners; that is, he was a rejecter of the Lord after He was crucified and glorified; the Jew (properly speaking, is characterised as being) a rejecter before He was crucified.<a name=311:13></a> Stephen's martyrdom was the closing scene of the dispensation for the Jew.<a name=311:14></a> The chief of sinners is an end of self, and we are in the same boat with Paul when we take that place.<a name=311:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gospel of the glory (of Christ) is the highest point of grace as it reveals the glory to the person who is trying to destroy it: in preaching, however, you must go back to where the want is in the soul.<a name=311:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Make shipwreck of faith" is running into heresy, backsliding, giving up a good conscience.<a name=311:17></a>

		Not only man has fallen -- there are fallen angels, and the heavens are defiled; all things had and are to be reconciled.<a name=311:18></a> Those that are reconciled do need a mediator for intercession-a mediator came in with a broken relationship, an advocate with a retained one.<a name=311:19></a>

		An unmarried man might be a ruler, but he could not be an elder.<a name=312:1></a> A ruler is a gift, an elder an office; gifts are for the body; office is local.<a name=312:2></a> We have an example in Timothy of a young man who ruled elders.<a name=312:3></a> A ruler is a person who gets an ascendency over others morally, and keeps their wills from working by the power of the word in the Spirit.<a name=312:4></a>

		There are two characters of forgiveness of sins -- the one as in Romans, justification, in which man has no power, the other, the sins or failure of a justified person.<a name=312:18></a> The church can forgive these.<a name=312:19></a> It is administrative forgiveness.<a name=312:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Wherever the Spirit of God reveals truth, it is the revelation of Christ to the soul.<a name=314:1></a> It is essentially practical.<a name=314:2></a> It fills the soul, the affections, with Christ.<a name=314:3></a> The Lord said, "For their sakes I sanctify myself.<a name=314:4></a>" The foundation once laid, God forms and fashions the soul by the revelation of Christ, at the same time delivering us from present things, and associating us with Himself.<a name=314:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What characterises the Christian is that which takes him out of the world altogether (he has his relationships to fulfil in this life), makes him an epistle of Christ, manifesting the life of Christ, and leading him to long for the time when he shall find himself in the Father's home, like Christ, with Christ for ever, nothing more to jar.<a name=314:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has associated him with Himself and with that place; and our part is, as Christ's was here, to manifest that our place even now is there.<a name=314:7></a> Aye, our place is in the last Adam, not in the first.<a name=314:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This "charge," the "end of the commandment," was Timothy's commission.<a name=314:9></a> His mandate, as it were, was to make manifest this place which saints had in association with the life of Christ.<a name=314:10></a> He speaks of "the glorious gospel of the blessed God.<a name=314:11></a>" We are called to inherit blessing, to inherit it from one who dwells in blessing.<a name=314:12></a> "The glorious gospel" tells me how man is brought back to God, and thus shews the triumph of God and blessing over evil.<a name=314:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first beginning of the history of man gives us the triumph of evil over natural blessing.<a name=314:14></a> Consequent on this came judgment.<a name=314:15></a> Next comes the law, a requisition from man who had pretensions to good.<a name=314:16></a> A rule was given of righteousness (if man could make it out).<a name=314:17></a> There was no triumph of good here, but a requirement from man of what man ought to be.<a name=314:18></a> The law was not given to Adam, the law was given to sinners -- to fallen man.<a name=314:19></a> The law would have been of no use to Adam before the fall; he would not have understood, "Thou shalt not steal," etc.<a name=314:20></a> The law brings out evil to our consciences.<a name=314:21></a> Who has loved God today as he should have done?<a name=314:22></a> Who has loved his neighbour as himself?<a name=314:23></a> It is not the blessed truth of the triumph of good over evil; but it is most useful to bring to the conscience these two things -- first, not only that we have sinned, but why you and I have sinned.<a name=314:24></a> Shall I tell you why?<a name=314:25></a> Because we liked it.<a name=314:26></a> "In me, in my flesh, there dwelleth no good thing"; and, what is more, when I desire to do good, evil is present with me.<a name=314:27></a>

		A good conscience is only conscious of what the pure heart should be in the presence of God, having an entire unclouded confidence (faith unfeigned) in God -- "That your faith and hope might be IN God.<a name=315:5></a>" If I fail, I fly back to God; if I am weak, I fly back to God with faith unfeigned in Him, as the One who has delivered me; counting upon God, as the One that is for me, to bring me back to my place.<a name=315:6></a>

		PROPITIATION AND SUBSTITUTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Timothy 2: 6
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My intercourse with saints, and especially with those who preach, has led me to discover that a good deal of obscurity in their manner of putting the gospel, and I may add a good deal of Arminian and Calvinistic controversy, arises from not distinguishing propitiation and substitution.<a name=318:1></a> I am not anxious about the words, but about the practical distinction, which is very simple and I think of moment.<a name=318:2></a> I say the words, because in propitiation, in a certain sense, Christ stood in our stead.<a name=318:3></a> Still there is a very real difference in Scripture.<a name=318:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This difference is clearly marked in the offerings of the great day of atonement.<a name=318:5></a> Aaron slew the bullock, and the goat which was called the Lord's lot, and sprinkled the blood on and before the mercy-seat and on the altar.<a name=318:6></a> The blood was presented to God, whose holy presence had been dishonoured and offended by sin.<a name=318:7></a> So Christ has perfectly glorified God in the place of sin, by His perfect obedience and love to His Father in His being made sin who knew no sin.<a name=318:8></a> God's majesty, righteousness, love, truth, all that He is, was glorified in the work wrought by Christ, and of this the blood was witness in the holy place itself.<a name=318:9></a> Our sins gave occasion to it, but God Himself was glorified in it.<a name=318:10></a> Hence the testimony can go out to all the world that God is more than satisfied, glorified, and whoever comes by that blood is freely, fully received of God and to God.<a name=318:11></a> But there was no confession of sins on the head of this goat; it was about sin by reason of Israel's sinfulness, but it was simply blood offered to God: sin had been dealt with in judgment according to God's glory, yea, to the full glorifying of God, for never was His majesty, love, and hatred of sin so seen.<a name=318:12></a> God could shine out in favour to the returning sinner according to what He was; yea, in the infiniteness of His love beseech men to return.<a name=318:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But besides this there was personal guilt, positive personal sins for which Israel was responsible, and men are responsible, according to what is righteously required from each.<a name=318:14></a> On the great day of atonement, the high priest confessed the people's sins on the scape-goat, laying both his hands on its head: the personal sins were transferred to the goat by one who represented all the people, and they were gone for ever, never found again.<a name=318:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=319>[Page 319]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is another thing.<a name=319:1></a> Christ is both high priest and victim, and has confessed all the sins of His people as His own, borne our sins in His own body on the tree.<a name=319:2></a> The two goats are but one Christ, but there is the double aspect of His sacrifice, Godward, and bearing our sins.<a name=319:3></a> The blood is the witness of the accomplishment of all, and He is entered in not without blood.<a name=319:4></a> He is the propitiation for our sins.<a name=319:5></a> But in this aspect the world comes in too.<a name=319:6></a> He is a propitiation for the whole world.<a name=319:7></a> All has been done that is needed.<a name=319:8></a> His blood is available for the vilest whoever he may be.<a name=319:9></a> Hence the gospel to the world says, "Whosoever will, let him come.<a name=319:10></a>" In this aspect we may say Christ died for all, gave Himself a ransom for all, an adequate and available sacrifice for sin, for whoever would come -- tasted death for every man.<a name=319:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when I come to bearing sins the language is uniformly different.<a name=319:12></a> He bore our sins, He bore the sins of many.<a name=319:13></a> "All" is carefully abstained from.<a name=319:14></a> I say carefully, because in Romans 5: 18, 19, the difference is carefully made.<a name=319:15></a> The first, our sins, is the language of faith, left open indeed to anyone who can use it, but used and to be used only by faith.<a name=319:16></a> The believing remnant of Israel may use it, including the blessing of the nations, for He died for that nation; Christians use it in faith, for all that have faith use it.<a name=319:17></a> The second "many" restricts it from all, but generally has the force of <i>the many</i> as contrasted with a head or leaders, the mass in connection with them.<a name=319:18></a> Adam's <i>the many</i> were in result all, but all is in connection with him.<a name=319:19></a> Christ's <i>the many</i> those connected with Him.<a name=319:20></a> But it will never be found in Scripture that Christ bore the sins of all.<a name=319:21></a> Had He done so they never could be mentioned again, nor men judged according to their works That Christ died for all is, as we have seen, clearly said.<a name=319:22></a> Hence I go to the world with His death as their ground and only ground of approach, with the love shewn in it.<a name=319:23></a> When a man believes, I can say, Now I have more to tell you, Christ has borne every one of your sins, they never can be mentioned again.<a name=319:24></a> If we look at the difference of Arminian and Calvinistic preaching we shall see the bearing of this at once; the Arminians take up Christ's dying for all, and generally they connect the bearing of sins with it, and all is confusion as to the efficacy and effectualness of Christ's bearing our sins, and they deny any special work for His people.<a name=319:25></a> They say if God loved all He cannot love some particularly; and an uncertain salvation is the result, and man often exalted.<a name=319:26></a> Thus the scape-goat is practically set aside.<a name=319:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=320>[Page 320]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Calvinist holds Christ's bearing the sins of His people so that they are effectually saved, but he sees nothing else.<a name=320:1></a> He will say, if Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it, there can be no real love for anything else, and denies Christ's dying for all, and the distinctive character of propitiation, and the blood on the mercy-seat.<a name=320:2></a> He sees nothing but substitution.<a name=320:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is, Christ is said to love the church, never the world, that is a love of special relationship.<a name=320:4></a> God is never said to love the church, but the world.<a name=320:5></a> That is divine goodness, what is in the nature of God (not His purpose), and His glory is the real end of all.<a name=320:6></a> But I do not dwell on this, I only point out the confusion of propitiation and substitution as necessarily making confusion in the gospel, enfeebling the address to the world or weakening the security of the believer, and in every respect giving uncertainty to the announcement of the truth.<a name=320:7></a> I believe earnestness after souls, and preaching Christ with love to Him will be blessed where there is little clearness, and is more important that great exactitude of statement.<a name=320:8></a> Still it is a comfort to the preacher to have it clear, even if not thinking about it at the moment; and when building up afterwards, the solidness of the foundation is of the greatest moment.<a name=320:9></a>

		ON RULE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Timothy 5: 17
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I agree that, as a rule, gatherings get on where there is one who cares for souls.<a name=321:1></a> I have long noticed it; and, while in a small gathering, care one for another may be easy and simple, I have always held it to be a bad sign if time and increase of numbers did not develop the care of souls in persons whom love led to devote themselves more or less to it.<a name=321:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be in one aspect mutual or general, as Hebrews 12: 12-15; or more direct and positive, as 1 Thessalonians 5: 12-14, where, indeed, we have both.<a name=321:3></a> Hebrews 13: 17 (verse 7, they are deceased).<a name=321:4></a> In none of these cases are they viewed as official.<a name=321:5></a> It is, moreover, the contrary to official in 1 Corinthians 16: 15.<a name=321:6></a> They are <i>those who "take the lead</i>" (1 Thessalonians 5: 12) and "<i>leading men</i>" a word used of Judas and Silas in Acts 15: 22.<a name=321:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1 Corinthians 16 they have "addicted themselves," as indeed we have no trace of elders at Corinth; the Lord, doubtless, allowing it that we might have the internal state, and care, and duty, of an assembly in Scripture itself.<a name=321:8></a> These care-takers were not, as is truly said, the gift of teachers.<a name=321:9></a> This case is distinguished in 1 Timothy 5: 17.<a name=321:10></a> But it was desirable, not that they should be teachers as a gift (pastor and teacher are united under one head in Ephesians 4), but that they should be "<i>apt to teach</i>," 1 Timothy 3: 2; able to carry the word with them in their episcopal ministrations, and use it -- shepherd and feed, not merely superintend; though they might usefully do the latter alone according to 1 Timothy 5: 17.<a name=321:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These have been the passages which have guided students of Scripture as to that by which God meets the need of saints when public order and official authority are lost to the church, with general warnings in Old and New Testament as to the care of the beloved sheep of Christ.<a name=321:12></a> Still the promise remains, that where two or three are gathered together to Christ's name, He is there in the midst of them.<a name=321:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I would draw your attention to one of these passages -- and this is my object in these lines -- a leading one on the point.<a name=321:14></a> The household of Stephanas had "addicted themselves to the <i>ministry</i> of the saints.<a name=321:15></a>" In the heart of him who so labours, when rightly done and efficient, it is done in the spirit of service, not of rule.<a name=321:16></a> Love works: they addict themselves; as Paul, free from all, became the servant of all for Christ's sake.<a name=321:17></a> There is a gift of rule, but love delights to serve.<a name=321:18></a> In this verse, which is a specially guiding one, service <i>(diakonia)</i> is that to which they addict themselves.<a name=321:19></a> He who thus addicts himself in love, will assuredly find himself blessed in it, though patience may be exercised, and must have its perfect work.<a name=321:20></a>

		FRAGMENTARY REMARKS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2 Timothy 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that the churches have been merged in the mass of ecclesiastical popular hierarchism, and lost; but I believe also that the visible church, as it is called, has been merged there too.<a name=323:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still there is a difference, because churches were the administrative form, while the church, as a body, on the earth, was the vital unity.<a name=323:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I felt from the beginning, and began with, was this: the Holy Ghost remains, and therefore the essential principle of unity with His presence; for (the fact is all we are now concerned in) wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.<a name=323:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When this is really sought, there will certainly be blessing by His presence; we have found it so, most sweetly and graciously, who have met separately.<a name=323:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When there is an attempt at displaying the position and the unity, there will always be a mess and a failure: God will not take such a place with us.<a name=323:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must get into the place of His mind, to get His strength.<a name=323:6></a> That is now the failure of the church.<a name=323:7></a> But there He will be with us.<a name=323:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have always said this.<a name=323:9></a> I know it has troubled some, even those I specially love; but I am sure it is the Lord's mind.<a name=323:10></a> I have said, We are the witnesses of the weakness and low estate of the church.<a name=323:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not stronger nor better than others (Dissenters, etc.<a name=323:12></a>), but we only own our bad and lost state, and therefore can find blessing.<a name=323:13></a> I do not limit what the blessed Spirit can do for us in this low estate, but I take the place where He can do it.<a name=323:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, government of bodies, in an authorised way, I believe there is none; where this is assumed, there will be confusion.<a name=323:15></a> It was here [Plymouth], and it was constantly and openly said, that this was to be a model, so that all in distant places might refer to it.<a name=323:16></a> My thorough conviction is, that conscience was utterly gone, save in those who were utterly miserable.<a name=323:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only, therefore, so far seek the original standing of the church, as to believe that wherever two or three are gathered in His name, Christ will be, and that the Spirit of God is necessarily the only source of power, and that which He does will be blessing through the lordship of Christ.<a name=323:18></a> These [the Spirit present and the lordship of Christ] provide for all times.<a name=323:19></a> If more be attempted, now, it will be only confusion.<a name=323:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=324>[Page 324]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The original condition is owned as a sinner, or as mutilated man owns integrity and a whole body.<a name=324:1></a> But there a most important point comes in.<a name=324:2></a> I cannot supply the lack by human arrangement or wisdom.<a name=324:3></a> I must be dependent.<a name=324:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should disown whatever was not of the Spirit, and in this sense disown whatever was -- not short of the original standing; for that, in the complete sense, I am -- but what man has done to fill it up; because this does not own the coming short, nor the Spirit of God.<a name=324:5></a> I would always own what is of God's Spirit in any.<a name=324:6></a> The rule seems to me here very simple.<a name=324:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt that dispensed power is disorganised; but the Holy Ghost is always competent to act in the circumstances God's people are in.<a name=324:8></a> The secret is, not to pretend to get beyond it.<a name=324:9></a> Life and divine power is always there; and I use the members I have, with full confession that I am in an imperfect state.<a name=324:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must remember that the body must exist, though not in a united state, and so even locally.<a name=324:11></a> I can then, therefore, own their gifts and the like, and get my warrant in two or three united for the blessing promised to that.<a name=324:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, if gifts exist, they cannot be exercised but as members of the body, because they are such, not by outward union, but by the vital power of the Head, through the Holy Ghost.<a name=324:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Visible body," I suspect, misleads us a little.<a name=324:14></a> Clearly the corporate operation is in the actual living body down here on earth, but there it is the members must act, so that I do not think it makes a difficulty.<a name=324:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe, if we were to act on 1 Corinthians 12: 14 further than power exists to verify it, we should make a mess.<a name=324:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the existence of the body, whatever its scattered condition, necessarily continues, because it depends on the existence of the Head, and its union with it.<a name=324:17></a> In this the Holy Ghost is necessarily supreme.<a name=324:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The body exists in virtue of there being one Holy Ghost.<a name=324:19></a> There is one body and one Spirit, even as we are called in one hope of our calling; indeed this is the very point which is denied here.<a name=324:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=325>[Page 325]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Christ necessarily nourishes and cherishes us as His own flesh, as members of His body; and thus goes on "till we all come," etc.<a name=325:1></a> (Ephesians 4).<a name=325:2></a> Hence, I apprehend we cannot deny the body and its unity (whatever its unfaithfulness and condition), and (so far as the Holy Ghost is owned) His operation in it, without denying the divine title of the Holy Ghost, and the care and headship of Christ over the church.<a name=325:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here I get, not a question of the church's conduct, but of Christ's; and the truth of the Holy Ghost being on earth, and His title when there; and yet the owning of Christ's lordship.<a name=325:4></a> And this is how far I own others.<a name=325:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If a minister has gifts in the Establishment, I own it, as through the Spirit, Christ begetting the members of, or nourishing, His body.<a name=325:6></a> But I cannot go along with what it is mixed up with, because it is not of the body, nor of the Spirit.<a name=325:7></a> I cannot touch the unclean, I am to separate the precious from the vile.<a name=325:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I cannot give up Ephesians 4, while I own the faithfulness of Christ.<a name=325:9></a> Now if we meet, yea, and when we do meet, all I look for is that this principle should be owned, because it is owning the Holy Ghost Himself, and that to me is everything.<a name=325:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We meet and worship; and at this time we who have separated meet in different rooms, that we may, in the truest and simplest way, in our weakness, worship.<a name=325:11></a> Then whatever the Holy Ghost may give to anyone, He is supreme to feed us with, perhaps nothing in the way of speaking; and it must be in the unity of the body.<a name=325:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you were here, you could be in the unity of the body, as one of ourselves.<a name=325:13></a> This Satan cannot destroy, because it is connected with Christ's title and power.<a name=325:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If men set up to imitate the administration of the body, it will be popery or dissent at once.<a name=325:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is what I see of the visibility of the body; it connects itself with this infinitely important principle, the presence and action of the Holy Ghost on earth.<a name=325:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not merely a saved thing in the counsels of God, but a living thing animated down here by its union with the Head, and the presence of the Holy Ghost in it.<a name=325:17></a> It is a real, actual thing, the Holy Ghost acting down here.<a name=325:18></a> If two are faithful in this they will be blessed in it.<a name=325:19></a>

		All the rest is a ministry to form, sustain, etc.<a name=326:16></a> Amongst other things, government may have its place; but it is well to remember that, in general, government regards evil, and therefore is outside the positive blessing, and has the lowest object in the church.<a name=326:17></a>

		Moreover, though there be a gift of government, in general government is of a different order from gift.<a name=326:18></a> Gift serves ministry, hardly government.<a name=326:19></a> These may be united as in apostolic energy; elders were rather the government, but they were not gifts.<a name=326:20></a>

		I believe the great buildings and great bodies have been a mistake; indeed I always did.<a name=327:1></a> Further, I believe now (although it were always true in practice), the needed dealing with evil must be by the conscience in grace.<a name=327:2></a> So Paul ever dealt, though he had the resource of a positive commission.<a name=327:3></a> And I believe that two or three together, or a larger number, with some having the gift of wisdom in grace, can, in finding the mind of the Lord, act in discipline; and this, with pastoral care, is the main-spring of holding the saints together in Matthew 18.<a name=327:4></a> This agreeing together is referred to as the sign of the Spirit's power.<a name=327:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So that I see not the smallest need of submission to popery; that is, carnal unity by authority in the flesh, nor of standing alone, because God has provided for a gathering of saints together, founded on grace, and held by the operation of the Spirit, which no doubt may fail for want of grace, but which in every remaining gift has its scope; in which Christ's presence and the operation of the Spirit is manifested, but must be maintained on the ground of the condition the church really is in, or it would issue in a sect arranged by man, with a few new ideas.<a name=327:9></a>

		NOTES OF LECTURE ON TITUS 2: 11-14
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very striking to notice the connections in which the summary of divine truth, contained in these verses, is introduced.<a name=329:1></a> The chapter is occupied with teaching what sort of conduct Christianity demands from those who profess it, according to the relative position in life in which they may be found.<a name=329:2></a> It teaches what is becoming in aged men and in aged women.<a name=329:3></a> It tells us, also, how young women should behave; and what should be characteristic of young men.<a name=329:4></a> It then takes up the common every-day conduct which is due from servants to their masters; and (while teaching them to be obedient, and to seek to please them in everything -- guarding against insolence and dishonesty -- "that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things") it adds, "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.<a name=329:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is a reason for the introduction of this passage here; which is simply this: that while men are satisfied -- and must be satisfied, for they can go no farther -- with the expression of the mere outward behaviour, the word of God occupies itself with the correction of the motives and springs from whence all conduct flows.<a name=329:6></a> More than this -- no conduct can ever be acceptable in the sight of God that does not flow from a heart subjected to His grace, which brings salvation; and that is not swayed by its daily powers.<a name=329:7></a> Rules of conduct are not given, cannot be given, to those whose hearts have not been subjected to "the obedience of faith.<a name=329:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But even here, amongst Christians, there is a very frequent mistake.<a name=329:9></a> While the world values Christianity merely for its collateral results, such as the reformation of manners and its conservative effect on society, etc.<a name=329:10></a>, Christians too often are occupied with the working and effect of God's grace, in the subjects of it -- whether themselves or others -- to the exclusion of the contemplation of that grace in its divine and absolute character, and in its first and grand effect.<a name=329:11></a> I mean this: ordinarily the Christian's mind is more occupied, as expressed in the passage before us, with what the grace of God teaches, than with what it brings.<a name=329:12></a> It teaches us to deny ungodliness, etc.<a name=329:13></a>; but before it teaches, it brings salvation.<a name=329:14></a> How many may be found most anxious to discover, what men now call the subjective power of this grace, who at the same time are utterly at sea as to what is meant, in corresponding phrase, by its objective power!<a name=329:15></a> Surely it is well, and necessary, in its place, to see to it that we yield ourselves to the teaching of God's grace, when its lesson is, "that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.<a name=329:16></a>" But it is not well to overlook, or underestimate, the absolute power of that grace in what it brings.<a name=329:17></a> The grace of God brings salvation, or is salvation-bringing, to the lost and ruined, before it teaches in those whom it saves.<a name=329:18></a>

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		"The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared," is but the succinct description of God's intervention in infinite love, by the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, for the accomplishment of redemption.<a name=330:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Apart from all the effects and fruits of grace in those who are the subjects of it, there is God's intervention in perfect absolute goodness, in the scene of ruin and death, which sin has introduced, for the perfect and entire deliverance out of it.<a name=330:2></a> The grace of God brings salvation into this world, where sin and death and Satan's power mark the condition of man's existence; and that apart from all effects of that grace, in peace of conscience, or holiness and happiness, on the part of those that believe.<a name=330:3></a> There is the grace itself, as well as the blessed fruits which it produces.<a name=330:4></a> The salvation which it brings has its own proper character, as the intervention of God in divine love and power, as well as its own blessed results in the position Godward, to which it brings its objects.<a name=330:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two termini of a Christian's course are here marked as the results of this interposition of God in grace, namely, salvation and glory.<a name=330:6></a> The Christian's path, I repeat it, is here shewn to lie between the starting-point, which is salvation, and the goal, which is glory.<a name=330:7></a> Grace and glory are inseparable.<a name=330:8></a> Conduct, exercise of heart, trial, conflict, service, lie between these two points, and in God's estimate take their character from them; but the salvation was accomplished alone by Christ's appearing in grace -- for "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<a name=330:9></a>" And the glory will be accomplished, alone, by Christ's appearing in glory.<a name=330:10></a> This is what the passage states.<a name=330:11></a> "The grace of God which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.<a name=330:12></a>" It then adds, "looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name=330:13></a>" Intermediately it tells us that the grace, which brings salvation, teaches us, "that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world"; while in verse 14, we have the constraining motive to holiness in the end for which Christ gave Himself for us.<a name=330:14></a> "Who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.<a name=330:15></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is plainly practical as the end, in us in this world, of Christ's infinite love.<a name=331:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look, then, first, at the character of the deliverance, or salvation, which this wondrous intervention of God in grace brings.<a name=331:2></a> This cannot be learnt by going over the points of systematic divinity [i.<a name=331:3></a>e.<a name=331:4></a> the creeds of religious systems], but by a reference to the character of man's condition through sin, as unfolded in the word of God, and manifested by the suffering and death of Christ.<a name=331:5></a> Whatever there is of moral distance from God, through sin, this salvation, which "the grace of God" brings, meets, and sets aside.<a name=331:6></a> "For Christ hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.<a name=331:7></a>" Sin in its very nature separates from God; for light cannot have fellowship with darkness; but then it is said, "Ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.<a name=331:8></a>" Sin, and death, and Satan's power, and the judgment of God -- all marked man's condition of ruin, and all must be met before salvation, full and adequate, can be proclaimed.<a name=331:9></a> It is not enough to raise man from his degradation and moral pollution, if such a thing could be, and set him on his pathway to happiness.<a name=331:10></a> The conscience must be set at rest on the ground of every claim of God in His righteous holiness having been met, and every possible consequence of sin set aside.<a name=331:11></a> And this is the salvation which the grace of God brings.<a name=331:12></a> It brings eternal life into this region of death; for "God hath given to us eternal life: and this life is in his Son.<a name=331:13></a>" It brings in divine righteousness into the midst of condemnation.<a name=331:14></a> For "he who knew no sin was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<a name=331:15></a>" It brings deliverance from Satan's power; for "through death [Christ] destroyed him who had the power of death, that is, the devil.<a name=331:16></a>" Nay more, the salvation which the grace of God brings puts us in the very place, and position, and acceptance before God, and makes us partakers of the very life and glory of Him by whom the salvation has been wrought.<a name=331:17></a> It has no other measure, and has no lower character.<a name=331:18></a> Was ever love like this!<a name=331:19></a>

		<a name=332>[Page 332]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is, indeed, the teaching of this grace, which is all-important in its place; but what the heart must know first (as it is its first action, on the part of a God of goodness) is its salvation-bringing power; for without the knowledge of the salvation, its teaching will be misapprehended and in vain.<a name=332:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The grace of God, then, first brings a perfect absolute deliverance of the soul from the whole consequences of sin, and brings into God's presence in acceptance, according to the acceptance of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=332:2></a> For the salvation lies in His obedience and sufferings for sin, in the acceptableness of His sacrifice, and in the power of His resurrection; and "as he is, so are we in this world.<a name=332:3></a>" This is all absolute; it is God's part in the grace which brings salvation.<a name=332:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And as it is absolute in its character, so is it universal in its aspect and bearing.<a name=332:5></a> "The grace of God which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.<a name=332:6></a>" It is unrestricted in its character; as the sun shines for all, though some hide themselves even from its light.<a name=332:7></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him might not perish but have everlasting life.<a name=332:8></a>" "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.<a name=332:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the grace received becomes teaching in those who are the subjects of the salvation which it brings.<a name=332:10></a> It teaches us "that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.<a name=332:11></a>" And here, I observe, it is "the grace" that teaches, and not something else.<a name=332:12></a> It is not man's wisdom, or man's morality, mixing itself with that which is divine in his salvation, and, I may add, divine in the nature which it imparts.<a name=332:13></a> It is the grace which brought the salvation still acting -- but acting now in the subjects of it, and on the divine nature which it imparts.<a name=332:14></a> They are not human motives, which form and fashion and produce the morality of a Christian, any more than it is human power that accomplishes his salvation.<a name=332:15></a> It is "the grace of God" that teaches him as well as saves him.<a name=332:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is very remarkably shewn in a passage in Timothy (1 Timothy 3: 16), the force of which is very frequently overlooked.<a name=332:17></a> The apostle would teach Timothy how he ought to behave himself "in the house of God"; and he then presents the formative power of all true godliness in the words, "Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.<a name=332:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=333>[Page 333]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is often quoted and interpreted as if it spoke of the mystery of the Godhead, or the mystery of Christ's Person.<a name=333:1></a> But it is the mystery of godliness, or the secret by which all real godliness is produced -- the divine spring of all that can be called piety in man.<a name=333:2></a> "God manifest in the flesh," is the example and the power of godliness, its measure and its spring.<a name=333:3></a> Godliness is not now produced, as under the law, by divine enactments; nor is it the result in the spirit of bondage in those (however godly) who only know God as worshipped behind a veil.<a name=333:4></a> Godliness now springs from the knowledge of the incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=333:5></a> It takes its spring and character from the knowledge of His Person as "God manifest in the flesh"; the perfectness of His obedience, "as justified in the Spirit"; the object of angelic contemplation, and the subject of testimony and faith in the world; and His present position as "received up into glory.<a name=333:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is how God is known; and from abiding in this flows godliness.<a name=333:7></a> And as in the passage before us, between the salvation, which is the result of the appearing of the grace and the crowning of "that blessed hope" which the believer looks for in the appearing of the glory, is the teaching of the grace that has brought salvation.<a name=333:8></a> It teaches the denial of ungodliness and worldly desires, as at war with the ends of redemption, and contrary to the character and position in which salvation places us as "delivered from this present evil world.<a name=333:9></a>" Certainly the cross and the glory alike forbid the allowance of ungodliness and the pursuit of worldly desires.<a name=333:10></a> It was the world that crucified Christ; and in the appearing of the glory worldly desires can have no place.<a name=333:11></a> "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.<a name=333:12></a> And the world passeth away and the lusts thereof.<a name=333:13></a>" It will be all withered by the appearing of the glory.<a name=333:14></a> But sobriety, righteousness, and godliness are due from the believer towards the world as a witness; and due towards God as a witness of the conforming power of His most precious grace.<a name=333:15></a>

		Already I have noticed that this passage presents the believer's path as lying between the salvation, which was accomplished by Christ's appearing in grace, and the glory, which will be accomplished by Christ's appearing in glory.<a name=334:1></a> "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing [or epiphany of the glory; as there was the epiphany of grace] of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name=334:2></a>" The salvation which the grace of God brings settles every question between God and the soul as to sin and condemnation; and the appearing of the glory will bring those who are Christ's into the enjoyment of the presence of God and Christ, into the perfected victory of Christ, and into the possession of all that can fit us for His presence in glory.<a name=334:3></a> "Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself," Philippians 3: 20, 21.<a name=334:4></a> "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation," Hebrews 9: 28.<a name=334:5></a> "We are saved by hope"; and nothing so moulds the affections for heaven as "waiting for God's Son from heaven, .<a name=334:6></a>.<a name=334:7></a>.<a name=334:8></a> even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.<a name=334:9></a>" In possession, and in the enjoyment, as to the soul, of this divine and perfected salvation, the believer has that which is far brighter in hope.<a name=334:10></a> He who, in sorrow and suffering and in infinite love, wrought the salvation, is coming to receive us unto Himself; that where He is, there we may be also.<a name=334:11></a> We shall see Him as He is, and then we shall be made like Him.<a name=334:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All is divine and precious, infinite in love and goodness, in the way our God takes to act upon the soul.<a name=334:13></a> How touching is the motive to holiness which is presented in the closing verse of our passage!<a name=334:14></a> "Who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works," verse 14.<a name=334:15></a> Here we have the end of redemption in the practical walk of the believer in this world.<a name=334:16></a> But what can equal the motive that is presented in the declaration, "Who gave himself for us"?<a name=334:17></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God in this epistle distinguishes between the way in which God spoke, or dealt, in time past and now.<a name=335:1></a> So in Romans 3 the apostle speaks of Christ, "whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past.<a name=335:2></a>" There he applies the death of Christ to the sins committed before He came.<a name=335:3></a> The day of atonement in Israel was for the putting away of past sins.<a name=335:4></a> He had been bearing with them all the year, and then when the sacrifice came on that day, the sin was all put away and all bright in the presence of God.<a name=335:5></a> There is the day of atonement yet to come for Israel as a nation, when in their land.<a name=335:6></a> Then the other part was "to declare at this time his righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of him," etc.<a name=335:7></a> This is for the present time.<a name=335:8></a> By ascending before God on high, He establishes a present righteousness -- all sins forgiven and we made the righteousness of God in Christ.<a name=335:9></a> Romans 3: 25 gives it historically, for the sins of all who were saved in the Old Testament times are put away by this sacrifice; but we may apply it immediately, and see that not only our past sins are put away, but we stand in righteousness for the present.<a name=335:10></a>

		The first four verses of this chapter are an exhortation founded on the preceding one.<a name=340:12></a> Observe, this epistle does not begin with an apostolic address, as the others do; but Paul puts himself entirely among these Jewish believers, and speaks of Christ as their Apostle, not himself; and throughout he is unfolding all the riches of Christ, to keep them from sliding back into Judaism.<a name=340:13></a> Though the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to Paul, as that of the circumcision was to Peter, yet is Paul the one used to these Hebrew believers.<a name=340:14></a> In chapter 1: 1, 2, God hath "spoken to us"; that is, Paul puts himself among them.<a name=340:15></a> In the Hebrews the church is not addressed as such, but the saints individually -- not in their aspect of oneness with Christ.<a name=340:16></a> Even in the Epistle to the Romans it is said, "Whom he justified, them he also glorified"; but here we get Him only "crowned with glory and honour.<a name=340:17></a>" Further, I would remark, as it is not of union with Christ of which the apostle speaks here, responsibility is pressed; continual "ifs" and warnings flow from this.<a name=340:18></a> These warnings do not one whit touch the final perseverance of the saints, as the doctrine is called; though I would rather say, the perseverance of God, His faithfulness, for He it is who keeps us to the end.<a name=340:19></a> "If you continue" does not throw a doubt on your continuance.<a name=340:20></a> The quickening work of the Spirit of God is scarcely referred to in this epistle, save in one or two cases.<a name=340:21></a> In chapter 2: 2, "The word spoken by angels" means the law given at Sinai.<a name=340:22></a> In these verses the whole Jewish nation is addressed, while those only who had faith would receive the warning.<a name=340:23></a> And I would notice that the warnings of God are not merely against sin, but not to let slip truth, etc.<a name=340:24></a> Christ came into the world, not imputing their trespasses unto them, but they added to their rebellion of heart by rejecting Him who came to warn them.<a name=340:25></a> Neglecting salvation is despising it.<a name=340:26></a> By the rejection of Christ the Jews bound their sins upon them.<a name=340:27></a> To have broken the law was bad enough, but to reject grace was worse; and these first four verses press this upon them.<a name=340:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first title of our Lord in this chapter is connected with the first part of the epistle; the second, namely, the priesthood, refers to what follows afterwards.<a name=344:6></a> In chapter I also we have His qualification for being the Apostle; in chapter 2, His qualification for the Priesthood.<a name=344:7></a> He was the Divine Messenger for the testimony He was to bring to earth; and He is gone up on high to exercise His Priesthood on behalf of a needy people down here where He has been.<a name=344:8></a> "God manifest in flesh justified in the Spirit .<a name=344:9></a>.<a name=344:10></a>.<a name=344:11></a> received up in glory," referring to His having come down here and become man.<a name=344:12></a> He must be in the holy place in order to carry on His work as Priest; but He must be a man.<a name=344:13></a> Therefore what He was on earth fitted Him, as it were, for this work.<a name=344:14></a> There is a third character connected with Christ brought out in this third chapter; Christ set "over his own house.<a name=344:15></a>"

		In this epistle we do not get the unity of the body at all; we get a Mediator speaking to God for us and speaking from God to us: "Let us hold fast the profession," etc.<a name=344:16></a> If He spoke of the unity of the body, that is inseparable; there is one Holy Ghost uniting the members to the Head -- "ye in me, and I in you.<a name=344:17></a>" It is not so here.<a name=344:18></a> Therefore profession is spoken of, and the possibility of that being not true profession; yet assuming it might be sincere, "we are persuaded better things of you," etc.<a name=344:19></a> (chapter 6).<a name=344:20></a> There might be all these privileges, and no fruit, but falling away.<a name=344:21></a> These Hebrews had made a public profession of having embraced Christ, and received a heavenly calling.<a name=344:22></a> In speaking of the body of Christ, we know it is perfect -- no possibility of a false member getting in; but in a living congregation I may address them as hoping they are all saints, but the end proves.<a name=344:23></a> No man can tell the end, whether they will all persevere; but if there is life, we know they will.<a name=344:24></a>

		The character of this epistle not being understood is the reason many souls are tried and exercised by passages they find in it.<a name=345:4></a> They are addressed with the possibility of their not having life, and so not continuing to the end.<a name=345:5></a> The church supposes a body in heaven.<a name=345:6></a> "Heavenly calling" does not necessarily imply that, because they are called to heaven, they are part of the body of Christ.<a name=345:7></a> The kingdom and the body are different.<a name=345:8></a> "Head over all things to the church" is wider, too, than the kingdom.<a name=345:9></a> Kingdom implies a king; a body implies a head.<a name=345:10></a> The church is precious to God.<a name=345:11></a> Everything that Christ has, I have; the same life, the same righteousness, the same glory.<a name=345:12></a> If my hand is hurt, I say it is I who am hurt.<a name=345:13></a> Paul was converted by this truth, "Why persecutest thou me?<a name=345:14></a>" It shews what grace has done for us -- taken us out of ourselves.<a name=345:15></a> The body of Christ shews out the fulness of redemption, and the purpose of God respecting it.<a name=345:16></a> But another aspect of the people of God is that they are down here in infirmity, but having this heavenly calling.<a name=345:17></a> In this condition I need One in heaven; and there is not an infirmity, a need, a sorrow, an ache, an anxiety, but it draws out sympathy and help from Christ.<a name=345:18></a> This draws out my affections to Him.<a name=345:19></a> But before the priesthood is taken up, Moses is spoken of as a type: "Christ Jesus, faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.<a name=345:20></a>" The house is the place where God dwells; and there is another thing here -- the Head of the house administering it.<a name=345:21></a>

		God has met His people according to the need in which they were.<a name=345:22></a> In Egypt they need redemption, and He comes to redeem.<a name=345:23></a> In the wilderness they were dwelling in tents, and He would have a tent too.<a name=345:24></a> In getting into the land they wanted One to bring them in, and there is the captain of the Lord's host.<a name=345:25></a> Then, when they are in the land, He builds His palace, His temple.<a name=345:26></a> There is rest.<a name=345:27></a> We are not come to the temple yet -- we have not rest: we get the tabernacle now, and "there remaineth a rest.<a name=345:28></a>" There was a temple existing when these Hebrews were addressed, but that was not for us.<a name=345:29></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#378:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There was then on earth, while the Spirit was unfolding the heavenly priesthood to the Hebrews, another priesthood, no longer recognised of God, but going on. Its movement was one of transition; the object was not only to shew the actual heavenly privileges of the saints, but to invite them to go forth without the camp. Afterwards came the fall of Jerusalem, when the events themselves spoke to the same effect. Only we can see that the Hebrew believers are treated with great address in this epistle; for the sole conclusion which yet appears is that the promise of a new covenant declares the first antiquated and ready to be done away. We know, from elsewhere, that the cross had, in principle, abolished the old covenant, and that the blood of Jesus laid the basis of the new covenant.

		We have already seen in this epistle that the Hebrews, instead of walking by faith, were in danger of turning back to the things they could see -- things suited to them as men in the flesh, such as ordinances and objects of outward importance, of which the Jewish system was full.<a name=400:19></a> But Christians were called out of these; God was leading away from them.<a name=400:20></a> The constant tendency of all our hearts is to go back.<a name=400:21></a> It is a shame for Gentiles to take up with those shadows; in a measure it was natural for the Jews, because they had had the beggarly elements appointed for them to observe.<a name=400:22></a> Now there was something better.<a name=400:23></a> They were waiting for Christ to come again, and it is said to them, "He that shall come, will come, and will not tarry.<a name=400:24></a>" In this epistle we do not have the place of the church, the body of Christ, brought out at all; in that connection the Lord comes and takes her to Himself.<a name=400:25></a> "I go to prepare a place for you," etc.<a name=400:26></a> Here, as pilgrims, there is responsibility before us, and we look for His appearing.<a name=400:27></a> In church character the hope is to be with Him.<a name=400:28></a> Here it is the heavenly calling and priesthood between us and God.<a name=400:29></a>

		In this chapter we have faith in its active character -- the working of faith when it is there.<a name=401:11></a> The thing that produces faith is the Spirit of God bringing home the word with power; and when the soul sees anything of Christ, it cannot rest satisfied without more.<a name=401:12></a> "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth," is the reception of truth in the soul.<a name=401:13></a> Then there follows the practical effect in the walk of the believer.<a name=401:14></a> There is a great deal of method in this chapter, more than appears at first sight; for it is not man's method, but God's.<a name=401:15></a> The divine mind is always at work according to the measure of divine love.<a name=401:16></a> Directly you get the clue to the divine mind, you get beauty and order.<a name=401:17></a> Thus, in Exodus, we have the account of the things for the tabernacle, and then the priests, and then again the utensils.<a name=401:18></a> The human mind sees nothing but disorder in all this; but when the object of the shadow is known, the most perfect order comes out.<a name=401:19></a>

		In the next exemplar of faith we see the ground on which man could be in relationship with God: in Abel, the faith that brought a sacrifice; in Enoch, that which led to walking with God, and the power of life in his translation.<a name=402:1></a> In verse 7, it is faith connected with God in government, and the consequent judgment of the world; in the next example we have that kind of faith that reckons on promise.<a name=402:2></a> It takes the promise of God, is satisfied with it, gives up everything, and gets nothing.<a name=402:3></a> All that flesh clings to is to be given up.<a name=402:4></a> These Jews had to do that.<a name=402:5></a> If I have nothing to do with earth I am a heavenly man.<a name=402:6></a> If I have nothing on earth, I am not an earthly man.<a name=402:7></a> God is not ashamed to be called the God of one whose heart and portion are in heaven; but He would be of one whose heart is on earth.<a name=402:8></a> This is the faith that gives character, heavenly character, verse 8-22.<a name=402:9></a>

		From verse 8 to 16 we have, not the great principles of human relationship with God from first to last, as in the preceding verses, but the faith which goes and keeps out as a pilgrim, with all the strength given for fulfilling the promises.<a name=406:24></a> And as these realised strangership on earth through faith, lived and died in faith, not in the possession of what was promised, so God regarded them with special favour, is not ashamed to be called their God, and will exceed their hopes of heavenly things.<a name=406:25></a> Further, we come (verse 17-22) to the faith that sacrifices the thing which apparently accomplishes the promise, to receive it from God alone, or confides, spite of all that tends to destroy confidence.<a name=406:26></a>
