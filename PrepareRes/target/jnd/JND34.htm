		AN INTRODUCTION TO THE BIBLE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(<i>Translated from the French</i>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To write an introduction to the Bible seems to me a deeply serious and difficult matter.<a name=1:1></a> To take up a Book which is the harmonious whole of all God's thoughts, of all His ways with regard to man, and of His determinate purpose as to the Christ, and as to man in Him; wherein also is set forth the revelation of what God is, of man's responsibility, and of what God Himself has done for man, as well as of the new relationships with God into which man enters through Christ; -- a Book which reveals what God is in His nature morally, and the dispensations in which He glorifies Himself in the sight of the heavens and their inhabitants; which lays bare the secrets and the state of the human heart, and at the same time unveils before it things invisible; which begins where the past touches eternity, and leads us on through a development and a solution of all moral questions to the final point where the future merges in eternity, according to God; -- which fathoms moral questions in the perfect light of God revealed, and makes known to us the groundwork of new relationships with Him, according to what He is, and what He is in infinite love .<a name=1:2></a>.<a name=1:3></a>.<a name=1:4></a> to undertake, I say, to open up the path (in as far as it may be given to man to be the instrument for it, for God alone can do it effectually) so that the mind of man may understand the ways of God as He has revealed them, is a task that may well make one recoil before its difficulty and seriousness, when we reflect that we have to do with God's thoughts as revealed by Himself.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How marvellous indeed is this divine parenthesis in the midst of eternity, in which the febrile activity of the fallen creature displays itself in thoughts which all perish, urged on by him who wields his power as a liar and a murderer; but in which also the nature and the thoughts of God, His moral being and His determinate purpose, until then eternally hidden in Himself, are, while testing man and manifesting what he is, revealed and fulfilled through the Son, that they may in their final result appear in an eternity of glory to come, in which God, surrounded by blissful creatures who know Him and understand Him, will manifest Himself as Light and Love in the full results of His own eternal and imperishable thoughts; but where also all that has been wrought by His grace and wisdom throughout the things that are seen here below, will be displayed in its glorious and eternal fruits; where God -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost -- known of Himself before time was, will be known by innumerable blessed beings -- known by them in their own happiness when time shall be no more.<a name=1:6></a> And this world is the wonderful sphere where everything is made to work to that end; and the heart of man the scene wherein all takes place and is morally wrought out, if so be that God, in whom and by whom and for whom are all these things, dwell in him by His Spirit to give him intelligence; and if Christ, who is the Object of all that is done, be his sole Object.<a name=1:7></a> The Bible, then, is the revelation which God has given to us of all this wondrous system, and of all the facts which relate to it.<a name=1:8></a> Is it surprising that one shrinks from the task of opening up such things?<a name=1:9></a> But we have to do with a God of goodness, who delights to help us in everything that may conduce to an intelligent apprehension of the revelation which He has been pleased to give us of His thoughts.<a name=1:10></a> There are certain great principles that mark this revelation, which we would notice before going into the details.<a name=1:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great idea that stamps its character on the revelation of God, is that of <i>the two Adams:</i> -- the first man and the Second; the responsible man, and the Man of God's counsels, in whom God, whilst confirming the principle of responsibility, reveals Himself, as well as His sovereign counsels and the grace which reigns through righteousness.<a name=2:1></a> These two principles predominate throughout the contents of the Bible.<a name=2:2></a> But although, in the ways of God, His goodness shewed itself continually until His Son came, yet grace, in the full force of the term, was only prophetically revealed, and withal veiled so as not to interfere with the then subsisting relations of man with God, and often in forms which can only be understood when the New Testament has furnished us with the key to them.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings me to two other principles which are found revealed and developed in the Scriptures.<a name=2:4></a> The one is <i>God's government</i> in the scene of this world, a government sure and certain, though long hidden, unless indeed on a small scale in Israel, and even then obscured in the eyes of men, because iniquity prevailed (Psalm 73), and because God had ways of deeper moment as well as greater blessings in store for His own in the midst of this government, -- ways, in which, for the spiritual good of His people, He made use of the evils He permitted to arise.<a name=2:5></a> The history contained in the Bible unfolds to the spiritual man the course of these ways; the Psalms give reflections upon them by the Spirit of Christ in His own, rising betimes in their expressions up to the experience of Christ Himself, and thus becoming directly prophetic.<a name=2:6></a> But I am anticipating a little.<a name=2:7></a> The other divine principle is <i>sovereign grace</i>, which takes up poor sinners, blots out their sins, and places them in the same glory as the Son (become man for this), "conformed to the image of his Son," effecting this according to the righteousness of God, by means of Christ's sacrifice, by which He has fully glorified God in respect of sin.<a name=2:8></a> Some features of this sovereign grace are found in God's government, and are displayed when the result of His government is brought out; but it is fully disclosed in the heavenly glory.<a name=2:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Intimately connected with this government of God is <i>the Law</i>; it establishes the rule of good and evil according to God, and founds it upon His authority.<a name=3:1></a> The Lord furnishes us with the expression of it, in drawing from various parts of the Pentateuch principles, which, were they established and operative in the heart, would lead to obedience, and to the accomplishment of God's will, and would be productive of human righteousness.<a name=3:2></a> The Ten commandments do not create duty, the existence of which is founded on the relationships in which God has set man.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is this difference between the principles of the law as laid down by Jesus, and the Ten commandments, that the principles drawn by Him from the books of Moses comprehend absolute good in all its extent without question of sin, whilst the Ten commandments suppose sin to be there, and, with one exception, are prohibitory of all unfaithfulness to the relationships of which they treat.<a name=3:4></a> It is important to notice that the last of these commandments forbids the first motion of the heart towards the sins previously condemned: "the sting is in the tail.<a name=3:5></a>" Moreover, the various relationships were the basis of duty, the commandments forbidding men to fail in them.<a name=3:6></a> But the principle of law, of any law, is this: that the approbation of Him to whom I am responsible, my reception in favour by Him who has the right to judge of my faithfulness to my responsibility, or of my shortcomings -- in a word, my happiness -- depends upon what I am in this respect, upon what I am towards Him.<a name=3:7></a> For the relationships are established by the Creator's will and authority, and when I fail in them, I sin against Him who established them.<a name=3:8></a> Although the sin may be directly against the person I am in relation with, yet as the obligation was imposed by the will of God and is the expression of His will, I in fact despise His authority and disobey Him.<a name=3:9></a> The principle of law is that the acceptance of the person depends upon his conduct; grace does what it pleases in goodness, in conformity to the nature and the character of Him who acts in grace.<a name=3:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was another important element in the ways of God, contrasting with the law, and that is <i>the promises</i>.<a name=4:1></a> These began with the Fall itself, but as a principle in the ways of God, with Abraham, when the world was already fallen, not only into sin, but into idolatry, Satan and demons having taken possession of the place of God in man's mind.<a name=4:2></a> Now Abram's <i>election</i>, his <i>call</i>, and <i>the gift of the promises</i> made to him, were all connected with grace.<a name=4:3></a> Thus Abram followed God<a href="#4:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> towards the country that God pointed out to him, but in it he possessed not whereon to set his foot.<a name=4:4></a> This introduces another vital principle, that of living <i>by faith</i>, receiving God's word as such, and counting upon His faithful goodness.<a name=4:5></a> The promise evidently depended upon grace; it was not the thing given, though this was assured by the word of God; and faith counted upon the promise, and more or less clearly introduced the thought of blessing outside the world; otherwise, he who had faith obtained nothing by his faith.<a name=4:6></a> The consciousness of God's favour was doubtless so far something, but it depended upon faith in His fidelity as to what He had promised.<a name=4:7></a> But in connection with promises there is an important point to notice: there are unconditional, and there are conditional promises.<a name=4:8></a> The promises made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, were unconditional; whereas those made at Sinai were conditional.<a name=4:9></a> God's word never confounds them.<a name=4:10></a> Moses calls to remembrance the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Israel (Exodus 32: 13); Solomon, what came in under Moses (1 Kings 8: 51-53); Nehemiah 1, refers to Moses; Nehemiah 9, first to Abraham as the source of all, then to Moses, when it becomes a question of God's ways.<a name=4:11></a> It is of this difference that the apostle speaks in Galatians 3: 16-20.<a name=4:12></a> Under the law, when there was a Mediator, the enjoyment of the effect of the promise depended upon the faithfulness of Israel, as much as upon the fidelity of God; but then all was lost from the outset.<a name=4:13></a> The fulfilment of the simple promise of God depended upon His fidelity; in this case, all was sure.<a name=4:14></a> We learn further, by the passage alluded to in the Epistle to the Galatians, that it is to Christ, the Second Man, that the promises made to Abraham were confirmed, and they will be fulfilled surely -- all of them Yea, and all Amen -- when His day, which the prophets had ever in view, shall come.<a name=4:15></a> But here the difference, already pointed out, between the government of this world and sovereign grace, again finds its application.<a name=4:16></a> The grace that sets us in heaven is not prophesied of at all; prophecy belongs to what is earthly, and so far as relates to the Lord Jesus, contains the revelation of what He was to be upon the earth at His first coming; and then continues with what He will be upon the earth when He comes again, without alluding to that which should take place in the interval between those two events.<a name=4:17></a> Still, the facts as to the Person of the Lord are announced in those Psalms which reveal to us more of His personal history; His resurrection (Psalm 16), His ascension (Psalm 68), His session at the right hand of God (Psalm 110); and as to the Holy Spirit, they teach us that Christ would receive it as man -- that the gifts are not only gifts of God, but that Christ would receive them "in Man," that is, as Man in connection with mankind.<a name=4:18></a> On the other hand, except the desires of David in Psalm 72 and 145, where the subject treated of is what concerns the Lord's Person, the Psalms do not take up the state of things that shall follow His return: whilst in the prophets, this future state is amply described in the fulfilment of the promises made to the Jews, and its consequences for the Gentiles.<a name=4:19></a> There is another point that may be noticed: when the prophets on God's part give encouragements to faith for the time then present, and to meet trying circumstances, the Spirit of God uses this to penetrate into the future, when God will interpose in favour of His people.<a name=4:20></a><a href="#4:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> But I am going, perhaps, too much into detail.<a name=4:21></a>

		Finally, when sin had already come in, when the law had been broken, and when too the prophets sent by God had in vain recalled the children of Israel to their duty and claimed fruit for God from His vine, -- the promised Messiah came with proofs of His mission so evident that human intelligence could, and in fact did, recognise them (John 2: 23; chapter 3: 2).<a name=5:1></a> God spoke in the Person of the Son (Hebrews 1), the great promised Prophet.<a name=5:2></a> But at the same time the Father was revealed in the Son, and man would not have God.<a name=5:3></a> The Son of God was delivering man from all the outward evils sin had brought into the world, and from Satan's power in this respect; but this manifestation of God in goodness did but bring out the hatred of man's heart against Him; the Jews also lost all right to the promises, and man rejected God manifested in goodness here below.<a name=5:4></a> The history of responsible man was closed; for we are not here speaking of grace, except so far as God's presence in grace tested man's responsibility: not only had sin come in, and the law been broken, but men could not endure God's presence when He was in their midst in goodness, not imputing to them their sins.<a name=5:5></a> All relation of man with God was impossible on the ground of what man is in himself, notwithstanding the miracles accomplished by Jesus, which were all goodness,<a href="#5:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and not merely power; it was as He Himself said (John 15: 22-25): "They have no cloke for their sin .<a name=5:6></a>.<a name=5:7></a>.<a name=5:8></a> they have both seen and hated both me and my Father" (the expression always used by John when he speaks of God acting in grace).<a name=5:9></a> Yea, and this is a solemn statement, man's history morally is ended.<a name=5:10></a> But, blessed be God, it is in order to open the door of infinite grace to Him who reveals Himself as the God of grace in the Son (John 12: 31-33).<a name=5:11></a> The cross of Christ said, Man will not have God, not even when come in grace (2 Corinthians 5: 17-19); but it said also, God is infinite in grace, not sparing His own Son, in order to reconcile man to Himself.<a name=5:12></a><a href="#5:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

		I turn back now to trace the ways of God briefly, and historically, in connection with man's responsibility.<a name=6:1></a> It is striking to observe in man's history, that whatever good thing God set up, the first thing that man ever did was to ruin it.<a name=6:2></a> Man's first act was an act of disobedience; he fell into sin, and broke all relation between himself and God; he was afraid of Him who had filled his cup with blessings.<a name=6:3></a> Noah, escaped from the deluge which had swallowed up a whole world except his own family, becomes drunken, and authority is dishonoured and lost in him.<a name=6:4></a> Whilst the law was being given, before Moses came down from the mount, Israel made for themselves a golden calf.<a name=6:5></a> Nadab and Abihu offer strange fire on the first day of their service, and Aaron is forbidden to enter into the most holy place in his robes of glory and beauty, and indeed in any robe at all, except on the great day of atonement (Leviticus 16).<a name=6:6></a> In the same way Solomon, David's son, falls into idolatry, and the kingdom becomes divided.<a name=6:7></a> The first head of the Gentiles, if we go on to speak of him on whom God conferred the ruling power, made a great image, and persecuted those who were faithful to Jehovah.<a name=6:8></a> Nor has the external or professing church escaped the common law of disobedience and ruin any more than the rest.<a name=6:9></a>

		If we now consider God's ways as to man in the interval of time between Adam and the Christ, we find first of all, man in a state of innocence placed in the enjoyment of earthly blessings, without trouble of any kind; evil having no existence.<a name=7:1></a> Responsibility was set forth in the prohibition to eat of a certain tree.<a name=7:2></a> This prohibition or law did not suppose evil: Adam might have eaten of the tree, as of any other tree, if it had not been forbidden; it was purely a matter of obedience.<a name=7:3></a> Man yielded to the temptation; he lost God, hiding himself from His face, before he was driven out; then he was judicially driven out of the garden where he could enjoy God's presence, who in fact came to seek him there in the cool of the day: and he acquired a conscience; he learned, and that in spite of himself, not by an imposed law, but inwardly, to make the distinction between good and evil.<a name=7:4></a> No doubt, conscience may be dreadfully hardened or misguided, but still it is there, in man; when a man does what is wrong, his conscience condemns him.<a name=7:5></a> God's law is the rule of the conscience, but it is not itself the conscience which makes use of this rule, But from that time forth man was fallen, he had disobeyed, and renounced his allegiance to God, dreading Him, hiding from Him if that had been possible; and then was driven out of the garden, deprived of all those blessings through which he had enjoyed God's goodness and was able to own Him and even to enjoy His presence, for God came to walk in the garden.<a name=7:6></a> Self-will and lust had entered into his nature, guilt and the dread of God into his position; and then, too, he was judicially driven out from a place which was no longer suited to his condition, and, morally, out of God's own presence.<a name=7:7></a> What a horrible thing, if he had been able to eat of the tree of life, and fill the world with immortal sinners, having no more fear of death than of God!<a name=7:8></a> God allowed it not.<a name=7:9></a>

		But there are some very interesting circumstances to note in connection with the judgment under which man had fallen.<a name=8:1></a> We have seen that Adam fled from the presence of God.<a name=8:2></a> The judgment pronounced upon him, upon Adam and Eve (Genesis 3: 14-19) is an earthly judgment, not a judgment of the soul.<a name=8:3></a> Adam, and Eve also, are placed in a state of misery, and under the yoke of suffering and death.<a name=8:4></a> Before being driven out, Adam, by faith, as it seems, recognises life in the place wherein death had entered (Genesis 3: 20); but there is more; there is the promise made to the woman, of the seed which should bruise the serpent's head: the Christ, seed of the woman by whom evil entered into the world, was to destroy all the power of the Enemy.<a name=8:5></a> Then as sin had destroyed innocence, and given, through the shame of nakedness, a conscious sense of its loss, God Himself, by causing death to intervene, clothed Adam and his wife, and covered their nakedness (Genesis 3: 21).<a name=8:6></a> Before this, there was unconsciousness of evil; now evil is known, but is covered by God's own act.<a name=8:7></a> Man had sought to hide his sin from himself; but when he hears God's voice, his fig-leaves are nothing worth; they are of no avail to an awakened conscience in the presence of God: "I hid myself," he said, "for I was naked.<a name=8:8></a>" So also before driving him out, God did not restore his innocence, which indeed was impossible; He did better: He clothed Adam and his wife, so that He might see His own work, that is, what was suited to Him in the state in which they were, accomplished by Him in His grace, besides the crushing of him who had led them into evil.<a name=8:9></a> Still man was driven out of the garden, where he had enjoyed all God's blessings without faith, to till the ground, to die, and until death to be separated from the God who before had walked in the cool of the day in the garden where he had dwelt.<a name=8:10></a> Man, thenceforth, knew God only <i>by faith</i>, if faith was in his heart -- a new, all-important principle: he had lost God, had acquired a conscience, and, if he could, must live in painful toil to gain a temporal subsistence; he must find God, if he could; but he was from thenceforth outside the precincts which God frequented, and where His abundant blessings were dispensed without suffering or labour.<a name=8:11></a> Man had fled from God's presence, and God had driven him out.<a name=8:12></a> Adam was no longer in the relation in which God had formed him to be with Himself, either as to the state of his soul, or judicially: he was in sin.<a name=8:13></a> I repeat, man had fled from the presence of God, and God had driven him from the position in which He had placed him when He created him; he was estranged from God with a bad conscience, knowing God just enough to be afraid of Him, having learned however that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, and being clothed by the grace and the work of God in a garment that bore witness to death, but which, as coming from God, covered, and that perfectly, the nakedness, the consciousness of which was the expression of man's fall and of his state of sin.<a name=8:14></a> Man was now outside -- could he enter, anywhere, into God's presence to adore Him, to be morally with Him whom he had forsaken?<a name=8:15></a>

		This fresh question now arises in Adam's history.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abel offered a <i>sacrifice</i>, which cost him nothing, so to speak; but he offered it by faith, owning that he was a sinner, outside the garden, at a distance from God, and that death had come in; but recognising in God the grace that had covered his parents' nakedness, and drawing nigh to Him by a propitiatory sacrifice, which alone could take away sin, and through which alone a sinner could draw nigh to God in virtue of the death of another.<a name=9:2></a> God's character in love and righteousness, and on the other hand, the state of Abel, were recognised in his offering: he offered it by faith, and God accepted it, as He accepted Abel himself with it, bearing witness to his gifts (Hebrews 11: 4).<a name=9:3></a> Abel was accepted of God according to the value of his gifts, that is, of Christ.<a name=9:4></a> God Himself covered Adam's nakedness, Abel comes acknowledging his position, and the expiatory sacrifice by which alone he could enter into God's presence.<a name=9:5></a> Cain, on the contrary, presents himself with the fruit of his hard labour.<a name=9:6></a> Man, since he was out of God's presence, must draw near to Him to worship Him: all who are not openly apostates, not only from Christ but from God, acknowledge this.<a name=9:7></a> Cain acknowledges it, but how?<a name=9:8></a> He thinks he can come just as he is.<a name=9:9></a> And why not?<a name=9:10></a> As to sin, he thinks not of it.<a name=9:11></a> The fact that God had driven man out of paradise made no change in his thoughts; he presents himself as though nothing had happened; and, morally blind and insensible, he offers the fruit of his own work, it is true, but which was in itself the sign of the curse that was then lying upon the earth.<a name=9:12></a> He neither recognised what he was himself, nor what God was; neither sin, nor the curse that was lying on his work, as the fruit of sin.<a name=9:13></a> Once outside paradise, man had to approach God; and God Himself tells us for all ages, in this treasury of great principles laid up in Genesis, how this can be done.<a name=9:14></a> All these histories contain the groundwork of our relations with God, while shewing at the same time the state of man.<a name=9:15></a>

		Sin becomes complete: we have already had sin against God; sin against a brother follows.<a name=10:1></a> Cain was irritated because God had refused him, and murder comes in: Cain kills his brother.<a name=10:2></a> God puts the question to him, not now saying as before to Adam: "Where art thou?<a name=10:3></a>" for Adam ought to have been in the presence of his God full of joy, and "Where art thou?<a name=10:4></a>" involved his actual position; but God says: "What hast thou done?<a name=10:5></a>" First of all, however, God addresses Cain on the subject of his relations with Himself.<a name=10:6></a> "If thou doest well," He said, "shalt thou not be accepted?<a name=10:7></a>" and: "unto thee shall be his desire,<a href="#10:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and thou shalt rule over him" -- "if thou doest not well, sin, or a sacrifice for sin (the Hebrew word has both meanings) is ready to hand" (literally, "is lying at the door") -- that is, there is a remedy.<a name=10:8></a> It is parenthetical, but these are the general principles of our relations with God.<a name=10:9></a> If a man does what is good, he is accepted of God, and if he does what is evil, there is a sacrifice for sin which the grace of God has set at the door.<a name=10:10></a> Notice here that Abel's sacrifice was not a sacrifice for sin: neither Cain nor Abel came before God with the conscience oppressed by a known transgression.<a name=10:11></a> It is the state of each of them that is in view, the state of man before God: the one, the man who owns himself driven out from God's presence, and who draws nigh to God according to grace; the other, the natural man, insensible to sin.<a name=10:12></a> In God's answer to Cain, the subject is positive transgression, and this confirms the idea that in the passage (verse 7) a sacrifice for sin is meant, and not sin itself.<a name=10:13></a> But Cain, as I said, becomes guilty of sin against his brother; he fills up the measure of sin in its second character, which for Adam was impossible.<a name=10:14></a> God pronounces sentence upon Cain, who, cursed in his labour, fugitive and vagabond, abandoned himself to despair; then, leaving altogether the presence of God, who spoke with him, he proceeds to establish himself in the land where God had made him a vagabond ("Nod") and <i>the world</i> begins.<a name=10:15></a> Cain builds a city, and calls it after his son; his children grow rich, they invent working in metals, and the refinements of the arts are introduced; they make themselves as happy as they can without God.<a name=10:16></a> I have no doubt, that besides the general truth, we have in Cain a type of the Jews as having slain the Lord: they carry their mark on their forehead.<a name=10:17></a> Lamech follows the bent of his own will, and takes two wives, but he is, I think, a type of Israel in the last days; Seth is the man after God's counsels -- Christ.<a name=10:18></a> The two families are established upon the earth; but already the hatred of the one against the other shews itself in Cain and Abel.<a name=10:19></a> (Compare 1 John 3: 11, 12.<a name=10:20></a>) In the meantime we have God's testimony: Enoch, who announces the coming of the Christ in judgment, and Noah, who passes through the judgment of the earth, and, as it were, comes to life again for a new world.<a name=10:21></a>

		I have enlarged somewhat on this part of the history, because it gives us the state of fallen man, and the principles according to which he is in relation with God, without religious institutions, though not without testimony on God's part.<a name=11:1></a> Eternal life is also shewn figuratively in Enoch, as in Abel the sacrifice by which fallen man can approach God, and in Adam and Eve (in the state of judgment in which man is), sovereign grace, which clothed them before driving them out; then, in Noah, the end of the age is announced, and the judgment is gone through.<a name=11:2></a> We find all this in its main principles in grace, recalled in Hebrews 11: 1-7.<a name=11:3></a> But fallen man grew worse and worse; Noah alone remained, whom God saved when He destroyed the world.<a name=11:4></a>

		We should note carefully as to the facts thus far recorded, that although far deeper principles, eternal in their nature and their effect, are contained in them, the history of this epoch of judgment upon Adam and of the judgment of the world, is a history of this world, and that the judgments are governmental, and belong to the course of things here below.<a name=11:5></a>

		A new world begins with Noah.<a name=12:1></a> It begins with sacrifice; and here "burnt-offerings" are expressly named; they were acceptable to God.<a name=12:2></a> God would no more curse the earth, nor again smite every living soul, but the seasons should follow in their course, according to God's established order, as long as the earth lasted.<a name=12:3></a> But man is no longer, as he was before in paradise, the authority that in sovereign right gave names to the animals in peace: the fear of man was to keep them in awe; man might eat them, but blood, the sign of life, he was not to touch.<a name=12:4></a> Then magisterial authority was established to restrain the violence that had broken loose.<a name=12:5></a> He that should take man's life must lose his own.<a name=12:6></a> God would require blood at the hands of him who shed it; and man was invested with the authority necessary to enforce this law.<a name=12:7></a> And God gave the bow in the cloud as a sign of His covenant with the whole creation, in witness that there should no more be a deluge.<a name=12:8></a>

		Another important element now stands out in the history: the introduction of <i>idolatry</i>.<a name=12:14></a> Not only does Satan, as tempter, make man wicked, but he makes himself into a god for man, in order to help him to satisfy his passions.<a name=12:15></a> Having lost God, with whom, nevertheless, he had been in relation, and had made a fresh beginning in Noah, man made a god of everything in which the power of nature shewed itself, making of it a plaything for his imagination, and using it to satisfy his lusts.<a name=12:16></a> It was all he had.<a name=12:17></a> Even that part of the race that was in relationship with Jehovah (Genesis 9: 26) is specially noticed as having fallen to that depth (Joshua 24: 2).<a name=12:18></a> Terrible fall!<a name=12:19></a> Although man could not free himself from the consciousness that there was a God, a Being who was above him, and though he feared Him, he created for himself a multitude of inferior gods, in whose presence he would seek to drive away this dread, and obtain an answer to his desires, hiding that which always, in reality, continued to be an "unknown God.<a name=12:20></a>" Everything took the form of 'God' in man's eyes; the stars, his ancestors, the sons of Noah, and members of the human race still more ancient and less known, the power of nature, all that was not man but acted and operated without him -- the reproduction of nature after its death, the generation of living creatures.<a name=12:21></a> The true God he had not; yet needed a God, and in a state of dependence and wretchedness, he made gods for himself according to his passions and imagination, and Satan took advantage of it.<a name=12:22></a> Poor mankind without God!<a name=12:23></a> Then God interposed sovereignly, reducing also, as we may note in passing, the length of man's life by half after the flood, and by as much again in Peleg's time, when the earth was methodically divided.<a name=12:24></a>

		But, as I have just said, the universal influence of idolatry led to an intervention on God's part which stamped its character on His most important ways: He <i>called</i> Abraham, and caused him to come out from the surrounding corruption, in order to have him as the stock of a people that should belong to Him.<a name=13:1></a> In him, the father of the faithful, are shewn forth three or even four great principles: God's sovereign will, otherwise called <i>election</i>, then God's <i>call, the promises</i>, and <i>continual worship by a man who was a stranger on the earth</i>.<a name=13:2></a> This last circumstance, the possession of the promises with the non-possession of the things promised, drew out the affections and hope to that which was outside this world, though still indeed in a vague way; but other revelations were added.<a name=13:3></a> These principles have characterised the people of God from that day forth.<a name=13:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, then, is the sum of these new ways of God: the world having given itself up to idolatry, God called out a man to belong to Him, outside the world, making him the depositary of His promises.<a name=13:5></a> There had been faithful men before, but not the stock of a race (as Adam was of the fallen race); but Abraham is the head of a race, for even we ourselves, as being Christ's, are the seed of Abraham.<a name=13:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more instructive than the life of Abraham; but here we can only notice that which characterises the ways of God.<a name=13:7></a> Abraham declared that he was a pilgrim and a stranger, he erected an altar to God when he came into the land which God had given him, but in which he possessed no place whereon to set his foot; he had nothing but his tent and his altar.<a name=13:8></a> He pitched his tent, and built his altar, wherever he dwelt.<a name=13:9></a> He failed, and without consulting God, went down into Egypt.<a name=13:10></a> God preserved him, but Abraham had no altar from the time of his leaving the land of Canaan, until his return to it.<a name=13:11></a> A numerous posterity (Israel) to whom the land was to be given in possession, was promised to him; besides that, all the nations of the earth were to be blessed in him.<a name=13:12></a> After the son, in whom were the promises, had been offered to God, and he had received him again as risen, the promise of blessing to the Gentiles was confirmed to the seed -- that is, to Christ.<a name=13:13></a> (Compare Galatians 3: 16.<a name=13:14></a>) The promises are without condition, that is, they belong to God's determinate purpose.<a name=13:15></a> Israel will be blessed through them in the last days; Christians, not to speak of other revelations and things fulfilled that are of infinite importance, enjoy them already.<a name=13:16></a> Sarah desired "the seed," according to the flesh, before the time.<a name=13:17></a> But all had to be on the ground of promise: it is grace, faith and hope; for at that time nothing was fulfilled (and this still remains true as to the glory, except in regard to the Person of the Christ), only God was the God of Abraham, as also of Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.<a name=13:18></a> In Isaac, we have the type of the relations of Christ to the church; in Jacob, we descend into the sphere of the earthly people.<a name=13:19></a>

		Afterwards, when Jacob had come into Egypt, the Israelites were subjected to the yoke of slavery, to the hard bondage of the Egyptians, as we are to sin in the flesh.<a name=14:1></a> This introduces another deeply important principle, that of <i>redemption</i>, and in connection with it yet another, the existence of a people of God upon earth, in the midst of whom God dwelt (Exodus 3: 7, 8; chapter 6: 1-8; chapter 29: 45, 46).<a name=14:2></a> It is sovereign grace that considers the affliction of the people, and hears their cry; but the Israelites were in sin as well as the Egyptians: how could God deliver them?<a name=14:3></a> He found a <i>ransom</i>; the blood of the Paschal lamb, figure of Christ, was sprinkled in faith on the lintel and two sideposts of the door, and God, who was smiting in judgment, "passed over" the people sheltered by the blood.<a name=14:4></a> Israel ate the lamb that had been sacrificed, and had secured them from judgment; they ate it with bitter herbs and unleavened bread -- with the bitterness of humiliation and truth in the heart, their loins girded, their staff in their hands, their sandals on their feet; they left Egypt in haste.<a name=14:5></a> Then follows the deliverance of the people when they were come to the sea: "Stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah.<a name=14:6></a>" Egypt's power falls under executed judgment; Israel is out of Egypt, delivered and brought to God: redemption is complete, and the people shall no more see the Egyptians for ever (Exodus 14 and 15).<a name=14:7></a>

		There was also a life that God cherished: Israel had to drink of the bitter waters of death (Marah), which Christ underwent in its reality for us.<a name=15:1></a> They were fed with the manna (Christ), were made to drink of the water from the rock (the Spirit of God), and were sustained from on high in conflict.<a name=15:2></a> But all is grace; God acts in grace and is glorified where man fails; man too is with God, for redemption brings us to God (Exodus 19: 4); only the journey under grace, in order to attain this, is added in its great principles.<a name=15:3></a> The Sabbath is established: the redeemed people had their part in God's rest; this is connected with the manna, Christ, as is conflict with the water from the rock.<a name=15:4></a>

		Some verses of chapter 15 of this Book of Exodus here claim our attention.<a name=15:5></a> We find on the one hand: "Thou by thy mercy hast led forth the people that thou hast redeemed; thou hast guided them by thy strength unto the abode of thy holiness" (verse 13); but on the other hand, we read in verse 17: "Thou wilt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, the place that thou, Jehovah, hast made thy dwelling .<a name=15:6></a>.<a name=15:7></a>.<a name=15:8></a> .<a name=15:9></a>" That is, they are brought to God Himself; their redemption is absolute and complete; but they were also to be introduced into the promised inheritance.<a name=15:10></a> The reader will notice, that it is no question of the wilderness, either in Exodus 3 or Exodus 6, or here, Exodus 15: 1-21: the work of redemption being perfect, the wilderness is not necessary: the thief was fit to be with Christ in paradise, and so are we (Colossians 1: 12).<a name=15:11></a> The wilderness forms no part of God's <i>counsels</i>, which, so far as we are concerned, refer to redemption, and the inheritance; but it does form part of God's <i>ways</i>.<a name=15:12></a> See Deuteronomy 8: <i>2</i>, 3, etc.<a name=15:13></a>; God proves us, that we may know ourselves, and know Him.<a name=15:14></a> Those who make a profession are put to the test on the ground of an accomplished redemption: if they have not life, they fall on the way, whilst true believers persevere to the end.<a name=15:15></a> Then again, the state of the people is tested, and they are chastened (Deuteronomy 8: 5, 15, 16).<a name=15:16></a> In this position we are, in principle, under the law; it is what we are before God in respect of His government; but it is under the rod of the priesthood we are led.<a name=15:17></a> (The death of Aaron ends this part of the type; and the "red heifer" is a special provision for the defilements which are contracted in the wilderness.<a name=15:18></a>) It is otherwise when justification is the subject: then, at the end of the wilderness journey -- our life of probation here below -- it is said: "According to this time (that is, at the end of the wilderness) it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath GOD wrought?<a name=15:19></a>" All through the wilderness, the question was, What had Israel <i>done</i>?<a name=15:20></a>

		As the Red Sea, in type, was the death of Christ for us, so the Jordan represents our death with Him; then comes our warfare, as God's host, with spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.<a name=16:1></a> But before this, there is Gilgal, the application of our death with Christ to our state of soul, in practical detail.<a name=16:2></a> The camp was always at Gilgal: the remembrance, by faith, of our identification with Christ in death (in the Jordan), is at Gilgal; then, the manna, the provision of a Christ come down here below, for the wilderness, is replaced by the old corn of the land, a heavenly Christ; and the Captain of Jehovah's host comes forward.<a name=16:3></a>

		Success in warfare, and blessing in the wilderness, depended upon the state of those who were in close connection with God Himself: He blessed them, but He ruled in the midst of His people.<a name=16:4></a> These two things, the wilderness and warfare -- the warfare waged by Israel as Jehovah's host -- are found not indeed at the same moment, but during the same course of human life.<a name=16:5></a> But salvation, that is, redemption, is at the Red Sea; deliverance, as a thing experienced, is at the Jordan.<a name=16:6></a> The rod smote the sea; and the sea was no more, unless indeed as a safeguard for the people: the ark remained in the Jordan until all had passed over.<a name=16:7></a> It is well to notice that conditions and "<i>ifs</i>" do not refer to salvation, but to the wilderness journey; then, for those who have faith and life, there is, together with the "<i>if</i>," the promise of being kept until the end, so that there is no uncertainty for faith; but here it is a matter of relations with a living God known experimentally, and not an accomplished work.<a name=16:8></a>

		As to Israel historically, they had accepted the promises at Sinai, on condition of their own obedience.<a name=16:9></a> That is the first covenant established by means of a Mediator, which supposes two parties; the enjoyment of the effect of the promise, depending as it did upon the faithfulness of man quite as much as upon the fidelity of God, was not more sure than the weaker of the two parties; and in fact the golden calf had been made even before Moses came down from the mountain.<a name=16:10></a> The new covenant will be established with Israel and Judah as the old one was.<a name=16:11></a> It will be when the Lord shall return and forgive their sins, not remembering them any more, and accomplishing His work in writing His law in their hearts, and not upon tables of stone.<a name=16:12></a> But the fact is of all importance that the people, at Sinai, consented to receive blessing on the condition of precedent obedience: this changed and aggravated the character of the sin, inasmuch as not only were the things themselves evil, but they amounted to a breach of the law, which formally connected God's authority with the obligation of the relationships which it forbade to violate.<a name=16:13></a> The relationships and obligations existed already, but the law made the breach of the latter a positive transgression against God's express will: under it, not only was human righteousness at stake, but also God's authority.<a name=16:14></a> The last commandment, "Thou shalt not covet," etc.<a name=16:15></a>, as we have said, did not deal with actual sin, even in the flesh, but with its first motions, and, for a soul born of God, led to the discovery of the root of sin in the flesh.<a name=16:16></a> But if all were fulfilled, it was never anything more than human righteousness.<a name=16:17></a>

		Another great truth already noticed now found its realisation: God dwells on earth in the midst of His people.<a name=17:1></a> God had set up His throne in the midst of Israel: two things were in connection with it -- first, the direct government of God, known by faith as the God of all the earth, and next, it was there that God was approached.<a name=17:2></a> God did not reveal Himself, He was hidden behind the veil; but there the sacrifices were presented: all the relations of religion (or at least of worship) of the people with God were carried into effect and centred there.<a name=17:3></a> There God's dwelling was purified yearly; there Israel's sins were blotted out by sacrifices that were figures of the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=17:4></a> At the same time the tabernacle was the expression of heavenly things; only the veil which closed the entrance into the most holy place was not yet rent, and man could not enter the most holy place, save only the high priest once a year.<a name=17:5></a> Such was the state of the people.<a name=17:6></a> They had accepted the law, as the condition, from that time forth, of the fulfilment of the promises; God's presence was in the midst of the people, but inaccessible, behind the veil, and God's government was carried on in the midst of the people, and for their good.<a name=17:7></a> But the tabernacle and all its ordinances were only a shadow, and not the "very image" of the things: and this is the reason why we have more of contrast than of comparison in the Epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=17:8></a>

		GENESIS lays the foundation and all the great principles of the relations of man with God; there we find creation, Satan, the fall, sacrifice, the separation of the saints from the world, the judgment of the world, government to put a check upon evil, the call of God when idolatry set in, the promises, the seed of God; those that were His, pilgrims and strangers, but with a regular worship -- otherwise no religious institutions; then the resurrection, in Isaac; the Jews, the earthly people, in Jacob.<a name=18:12></a> In EXODUS we have redemption, the law, the tabernacle, a people of God, the presence of God on His throne on earth, the old covenant, the priesthood.<a name=18:13></a> In LEVITICUS, the detail of the sacrifices, ceremonial purity, and particularly that which concerns leprosy, the great day of atonement, the feasts, the Sabbatical year, and the jubilee, when every one returned into his inheritance; and prophetical denunciations in case of disobedience.<a name=18:14></a> In NUMBERS, the numbering of the people, the separation of the Levites, the law of jealousy, Nazariteship, the history of the journey through the wilderness under the leading of the Cloud and under the priesthood, and, together with the history of the conduct of the children of Israel during this journey -- the red heifer; the people, except two men and the little children, perish in the wilderness: the judgment of God is pronounced, according to His sovereign grace, by Balaam.<a name=18:15></a> We find also in this book the details of the sacrifices for feast days and especially for the feast of tabernacles, vows, the taking possession of the land on the eastern side of Jordan, the brazen serpent, the Levites' inheritance, and the cities of refuge.<a name=18:16></a> Though there be history in all these books, the history itself, not only the rites and ceremonies, is typical of spiritual things: "All these things happened to them as types," says Paul, "and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come," 1 Corinthians 10: 1-13.<a name=18:17></a> We have no proof that, with the exception of Leviticus 8 and 9, one single sacrifice was offered in the wilderness, unless to Moloch and Remphan.<a name=18:18></a> The Book of DEUTERONOMY occupies a place by itself: it supposes that the people are in the land; it reminds them of their disobedience, and insists upon obedience: its object is to keep the people in close connection with Jehovah.<a name=18:19></a> A place was to be appointed in the land, where the ark and worship should be set up, where all the feasts were to be celebrated, and all offerings and tithes brought, except that which was given in the third year, to the Levite, in the place where he dwelt;<a href="#18:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> the priests are scarcely mentioned; it is the people in direct relationship with Jehovah: blessing would rest upon obedience, and judgment upon disobedience.<a name=18:20></a> The book concludes with a prophetical song, announcing the apostasy of the people and the judgment of God, a judgment which would fall upon the nations that should oppress Israel.<a name=18:21></a> In Exodus and Leviticus, the point is approach to God; here, in Deuteronomy, the enjoyment of Jehovah's blessings (and that, too, in a spirit of grace toward those who should be in need), both as directly under the hand of Jehovah, and in faithfully keeping the law given by Him.<a name=18:22></a> Several ordinances, relating to feasts and to the cities of refuge, are repeated; but the distinguishing character of the Book is a people without king or prophet (although the priests are named, they hardly ever appear) put in possession of the land to serve Jehovah, who had given it to them.<a name=18:23></a> God, however, raised up, when necessary, at the time to which this book refers, extraordinary men to re-establish the affairs of the people, when they were fallen into decline through their sins; but it was, essentially, Jehovah and the people.<a name=18:24></a>

		Some remarks should be made as to royalty itself.<a name=21:1></a> Royalty is properly effective power in action, and, in the kingdom of God, it is God's power, the king who reigns for God in Israel, the intervention of God in power.<a name=21:2></a> We have had the walk of responsible man under the priesthood, and side by side with that, the prophet who acted on God's behalf, by the word; this in itself was grace: but now the power is joined to grace to accomplish God's designs.<a name=21:3></a> God knew well how to deliver and avenge Himself of false gods, without man; but He was minded to reign in Man: this is the third character of Christ.<a name=21:4></a> As Prince of peace, it is indeed Solomon who is the type of the Lord; but the exercise of His power is shewn characteristically in David as a sufferer and deliverer: this will be the means of the re-establishment of Israel in the last days.<a name=21:5></a> In Psalm 72 we have the king, and the king's son.<a name=21:6></a> It is David who brings back the ark from Kirjath-Jearim, but he does not place it again in the tabernacle where the outward form of worship existed, but upon Mount Zion, which God had chosen to be the seat of royalty.<a name=21:7></a> (See Psalm 132; 2 Samuel 7; 1 Chronicles 16: 34.<a name=21:8></a>) Then, for the first time (for here it was grace, and grace exercised in power), David institutes the singing of the hymn: "For his mercy endureth for ever.<a name=21:9></a>" This hymn was again sung under Nehemiah, a striking occasion for it, and we hear it already, as prepared for the last days, in Psalms 106, 107, 108, 136.<a name=21:10></a> Although royalty was historically placed on the footing of responsibility, the great and unfailing principle of grace acting in power was now established -- the sure goodness of God toward Israel, in the Person of the Christ: "For his mercy endureth for ever.<a name=21:11></a>" An unfailing posterity and house were promised to David.<a name=21:12></a> (2 Samuel 7: 12-16; 1 Chronicles 17: 11-14.<a name=21:13></a>) The Christ, the true Son of David, had a place clearly defined and determined by God, although for the time being, the house of David was set under responsibility, and failed forthwith (2 Samuel 23: 5; compare Hebrews 12: 18-22).<a name=21:14></a> The temple built upon Mount Moriah, although surely the habitation of God, had not this promise of enduring for ever.<a name=21:15></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#22:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There is a great difference between the David of Chronicles and that of Samuel. The king in 1 Chronicles is the David of grace and blessing according to the counsels of God. The king in Samuel is the historical David exercised in responsibility. In Chronicles we do not find the matter of Uriah nor that of Solomon. It is a question of God's mind: no evil is reported, save that which is necessary to make us understand the history. Even Joab with all his crimes, who is not cited in 2 Samuel 5 and 23, is here mentioned because he took the stronghold of Zion. This shews what value Zion has in the eyes of God, and in what way the Chronicles regard the history. In the Book of Kings, it is the history of Israel and the conduct of the kings under responsibility.

Elijah places again, so to speak, the violated law in Jehovah's hands, in Horeb; then he follows each step of Israel: Gilgal, where they were set apart for God; Bethel, the place of the earthly promise made to Jacob; Jericho, the place of the curse; then the Jordan, or death; and Elijah goes up to heaven. From thence Elisha passed through death again, and enters upon his career of service. But Elijah's miracles are miracles of judgment; Elisha's, except the second, are miracles of goodness and grace.

		The PSALMS exhibit this state of things more completely than any other book whatever.<a name=31:6></a> Two principles lay the foundation of the entire Book (Psalm 1, 2): the first, that there is in the midst of the wicked a God-fearing remnant; the second, that Jehovah and His Anointed meet with opposition from the people and the Gentiles.<a name=31:7></a> Then we have the counsels of God in the Anointed, Son of God, and King in Zion, and then Ruler over all the earth: if He is rejected, His people must suffer, take up their cross (Psalms 3-7).<a name=31:8></a> In Psalm 8 He is the Son of man set over all the works of God's hand.<a name=31:9></a> With Psalm 9 the history in the midst of Israel begins.<a name=31:10></a> Some principles may here be useful, as a clue to facilitate the reading of the Book.<a name=31:11></a> It is well known that the Psalms are divided into five Books, as follows: Psalm 1-41; 42-72; 73-89; 90-106; 107-150.<a name=31:12></a> The form of the Book <i>in general</i> lays down a basis of thought, then provides expressions for the experience of the remnant in the circumstances given as the basis.<a name=31:13></a> Thus Psalms 9 and 10 lay the basis; the Psalms following, until the end of Psalm 18, are the expression of the sentiments that are in connection with them: only the last three more directly present Christ.<a name=31:14></a> Psalm 18 is remarkable in that it connects all the history of Israel, from Egypt until the end, with the sufferings of Christ.<a name=31:15></a> Psalms 19, 20 and 21 are the testimonies of God; the Creation, the Law, and Christ, Psalm 21 introducing Christ in glory.<a name=31:16></a> Psalm 22 presents Him, not in connection with the Jews, but made sin before God.<a name=31:17></a> Prior to Psalm 25, we do not find confession of sins.<a name=31:18></a> It is more a question of the Christ personally in this first Book; the remnant, too, is at Jerusalem, but in presence of the power of the wicked.<a name=31:19></a> In the second Book the remnant is outside Jerusalem.<a name=31:20></a> In Psalm 45 the Messiah is introduced, and thenceforward the name of Jehovah.<a name=31:21></a> When we meet with the name of Jehovah, faith recognises the relationship.<a name=31:22></a> (Compare Psalms 14 and 53.<a name=31:23></a>) I may here remark that the first verse or verses of a Psalm habitually give the thesis, and the following verses describe the path by which this point is reached.<a name=31:24></a> In this second Book the afflictions of Christ are fully described, and then the desires of David for the establishment of his Son in His millennial kingdom.<a name=31:25></a> The third Book, whilst mentioning Judah and Zion, takes in the whole of Israel, and thus goes back and reviews the people's history, following it up to the sure covenant made with Abraham and with his seed.<a name=31:26></a> The fourth Book, after recalling Moses, and how Jehovah had been the God of Israel in all times, and after speaking of the Messiah and of the Sabbath, introduces the reign of Jehovah, and describes its progress from above until He shall be seated between the cherubim and the nations called to worship before Him.<a name=31:27></a> We have there the principles of the reign of Christ, His rejection, His divinity, and the duration of His days as the risen Man, the blessing of the people and of the world by His presence: God remembers His promise to Abraham.<a name=31:28></a> Israel has been unfaithful, but God, in grace, remembers them.<a name=31:29></a> The fifth Book goes on to the end; it sets forth the principles and ways of Jehovah, the return of the people to their land (the Psalms of Degrees), Christ in the meantime having sat down at God's right hand, Lord, as Son of David.<a name=31:30></a> The goodness of Jehovah endureth for ever, the law is written in the heart of Israel which had been astray.<a name=31:31></a> Then, after the Psalms of Degrees, and the judgment of Babylon, comes the great "Hallel" or Hallelujah, a series of hymns of praise.<a name=31:32></a> The only Psalms which describe, even prophetically, the kingdom itself are 72 and 145.<a name=31:33></a> The Book begins by a rejected Christ; then, introducing His return to set up the kingdom, it speaks of the ways of the people, and their return to their land.<a name=31:34></a> Note also that you never find the Father in the Psalms, nor the feelings that belong to adoption.<a name=31:35></a> Confidence, obedience, faith in the midst of difficulties, devotedness (as in Psalm 63), faith in the promises, fidelity, all these things we find, but never the relation of son with a father.<a name=31:36></a> Through not paying attention to this point, the character of the piety of many sincere souls has been lowered by the very reading of this precious Book.<a name=31:37></a>

		The responsibility of man, as man, as being answerable for his own conduct, had been fully put to the test without law, and under the law; but the goodness of God from the time of the fall, before man had been driven out of the garden of Eden, had given the promise of a Saviour, who was to crush the serpent's head.<a name=34:13></a> Except that which was necessary to replenish the new world, the flood made an end of the fallen race plunged in corruption and violence.<a name=34:14></a> In this new world all soon fell into idolatry.<a name=34:15></a> Then grace called Abraham, and the formal promises of the Seed were given to him.<a name=34:16></a> Four hundred and thirty years later, the race, separated for God, was put under the law, a perfect rule of what man ought to be, if we take into account the prohibition of lust.<a name=34:17></a> The prophets recalled the law to the people's conscience, but at the same time they sustained the faith of those who remained true in the midst of general unfaithfulness, recalling, confirming, and developing the promise of the Seed, and of the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah.<a name=34:18></a> See, as an instance, the last words of Malachi's prophecy (chapter 4).<a name=34:19></a> The promise of the Seed was repeated by the prophets constantly, and the appeal to conscience, until there was no longer any remedy.<a name=34:20></a> Yet God fulfilled the promise in sending the Christ, the seed of David.<a name=34:21></a> This was grace -- faithfulness to His promise, without doubt, on God's part, and in this sense righteousness in God (this is the force of 2 Peter 1: 1), but it was not a question of man's responsibility to keep a rule that had been imposed upon him, but of receiving the Christ.<a name=34:22></a> There was more: Christ was the Word made flesh.<a name=34:23></a> God Himself was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their sins to them.<a name=34:24></a> But He came to His own, and His own received Him not; the world would not have Him, it knew Him not; His own did not receive Him; yet the Father was manifested in the Son, in His words and in His works, and the world knew Him not: "They have both seen and hated," said the Saviour, "both me and my Father.<a name=34:25></a>" Thus the Jews lost all right to the promises in rejecting Him in whom they were being fulfilled.<a name=34:26></a> But what is much more, not only was man disobedient, he was that already, but whilst thus disobedient he shewed his hatred against God manifested in grace.<a name=34:27></a> On the side of man's responsibility, all relationship with God was impossible.<a name=34:28></a> The cross was the public manifestation of this rejection, of this enmity against God; but it was at the same time the manifestation of the love of God for man such as he was.<a name=34:29></a> But more than this, it was the accomplishment of a perfect work of propitiation -- a sacrifice to take away sin, an entirely new basis of relationship between man and God, depending, not upon man's responsibility -- on this ground man was lost -- but on the infinite grace of God that spared not His own Son, who, by the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God, so that grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=34:30></a> The promises will be fulfilled; and the believer possess eternal life, and will possess it in glory, made like unto the Son of God, re-entered as man into the glory, in order that the heart of God may be satisfied in love, and His holy righteousness manifested and honoured, and that His Son who left the glory for us and humbled Himself in obedience unto death, may be fully glorified, according to the glory that is His due.<a name=34:31></a> Thus we have entered upon the ground of the gospel.<a name=34:32></a>

		The NEW TESTAMENT, as we readily perceive, has a very different character from the Old, in that, if the latter gives us the revelation of the thoughts which God communicated to those who were the instruments of this revelation, and makes us adore the wisdom that is there developed, yet God Himself in the Old Testament remains always hidden behind the veil.<a name=36:1></a> In the New Testament God manifests Himself; there we find Himself, gentle, meek, human: in the Gospels, God upon earth, -- and then God enlightening by a divine light in the subsequent communications of the Spirit.<a name=36:2></a> Formerly God had made promises, as He had executed judgments; He had governed a people upon earth, and had acted towards the nations in view of this people; He had given them His law, and had bestowed on them, through the medium of the prophets, a growing light which announced as nearer and nearer the coming of Him who should tell them all things from God.<a name=36:3></a> But the presence of God Himself as Man in the midst of men had the effect of changing everything, where man ought to have received Him in the Person of the Christ, as the crown of blessing and glory -- Him, whose presence was to banish all evil, and develop and bring to perfection every element of good, furnishing at the same time an object and a centre for all the affections rendered perfectly happy by the enjoyment of this Object.<a name=36:4></a> Or else, in rejecting this Christ, our poor nature must manifest itself as it is, enmity against God, and must prove the necessity for a completely new order of things, in which the happiness of man and the glory of God should be based upon a new creation.<a name=36:5></a> We know what happened.<a name=36:6></a> He who was the image of the invisible God, had to say, after the exercise of a perfect patience: "Righteous Father, the world hath not known thee"; and alas!<a name=36:7></a> yet more than that: "they have seen and hated both me and my Father," John 17: 25; chapter 15: 24.<a name=36:8></a>

		This condition of man, however, has in no wise prevented God from accomplishing His counsels; on the contrary, this wretched state gave Him the opportunity of glorifying Himself in fulfilling them.<a name=37:1></a> God would not reject man until man had rejected Him; as in the garden of Eden, man, conscious of sin, unable to bear God's presence, withdrew from Him before God had driven Him out of the garden.<a name=37:2></a> But now that man, on his side, had entirely rejected God come in goodness into the midst of his misery, God was free -- if one may venture to speak thus, and the expression is morally correct -- God was free to carry out His eternal purposes.<a name=37:3></a> But here God does not execute judgment, as in Eden, when man was already alienated from Him: it is sovereign grace, which, when man is evidently lost and has declared himself the enemy of God, carries on its work for the shewing forth of His glory before the whole universe in the salvation of poor sinners who had rejected Him.<a name=37:4></a> But in order that God's perfect wisdom should be manifested even in the details, this work of sovereign grace, in which God revealed Himself, must be seen as having its due connection with all His previous dealings revealed in the Old Testament, and also as leaving its full place to His government of the world.<a name=37:5></a>

		From all this it results that, apart from the main idea which predominates throughout, there are in the New Testament four subjects which unfold themselves to the eye of faith.<a name=37:6></a> The grand subject, the fact above all others, is that the perfect light is manifested: God reveals Himself.<a name=37:7></a> But this light is revealed in love, the other essential name of God.<a name=37:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ, who is the manifestation of this light and love, and who if He had been received, would have been the fulfilment of all the promises, is then presented to man, and particularly to Israel looked at in their responsibility, with every proof, personal, moral, and of power, -- proofs which left this people without excuse.<a name=37:9></a>

		Thirdly, the connection between the old order of things and the new one upon earth, with respect to the law, the promises, the prophecies, or the divine institutions on earth, is set forth.<a name=37:11></a> This is done, whether in exhibiting the new order as the fulfilment and setting aside of that which had grown old, or in making evident the contrast that exists between the two, or in demonstrating the perfect wisdom of God in all the details of His ways.<a name=37:12></a>

		A multitude of testimonies had announced that the Son of David should sit, on the part of God, upon His Father's throne; and the fulfilment of God's counsels as to Israel is connected, in the Old Testament, with Him who should thus come, and who on earth should stand in the relation of <i>Son of God</i> with <i>Jehovah God</i>.<a name=39:1></a> The Christ, the Messiah, or, as is but the translation of this name, the Anointed, was to come and present Himself to Israel, according to the revelation and the counsels of God.<a name=39:2></a> And this promised seed was to be Immanuel, God with the people.<a name=39:3></a> The expectation of the Jews scarcely went beyond this character of Christ, Messiah, and Son of David; and they looked even at that in their own way, merely as the exaltation of their own nation, having no sense of their sins, nor of the consequences of their sins.<a name=39:4></a>

		To expound even summarily the contents of the Epistles would lead us too far: we will confine ourselves to a few words on their chronological order, merely noticing that they develop the efficacy of Christ's work, and the Father's love revealed in Him.<a name=41:4></a>

		We must place in the first rank those whose date is sure: 1 and 2 THESSALONIANS; 1 and 2 CORINTHIANS; the Epistle to the ROMANS, those to the EPHESIANS, COLOSSIANS, PHILIPPIANS, PHILEMON, the last four written during Paul's captivity.<a name=41:5></a> The Epistle to the GALATIANS was written between fourteen and twenty years after the call of the apostle, and after he had laboured for some time in Asia Minor, perhaps when he was staying at Ephesus, although it was not long after the founding of the assemblies of Galatia.<a name=41:6></a> 1 TIMOTHY was written on the occasion of the apostle leaving Ephesus, at what time exactly is not clear; 2 TIMOTHY must be placed at the close of the apostle's life, when he was about to suffer martyrdom.<a name=41:7></a> The Epistle to TITUS is connected with a journey of Paul to Crete, though we do not know when this journey took place (it has been thought that it was perhaps at the time of the apostle's sojourn at Ephesus); it is morally synchronous with 1 TIMOTHY, for it was not God's purpose to give us chronological dates: divine wisdom was not pleased to give this, but the moral order is quite clear, as we already see in the way in which the second epistle to Timothy is connected with the ruin of that the order of which was established by the first.<a name=41:8></a>

		The Epistle to the HEBREWS was written at a relatively late period, in view of the judgment that was going to fall upon Jerusalem: it called the Jews who had become Christians to separate themselves from that which God was about to judge.<a name=42:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle of JAMES belongs to a time when this separation had in nowise taken place; Jewish Christians are there looked upon as still forming a part of that Israel which was not yet finally rejected, only owning Jesus to be the Lord of glory.<a name=42:2></a> Like all the Catholic Epistles, that of James was written in the last days of the apostolic history, when Christianity had gained a wide entrance into the midst of the tribes of Israel, and judgment was about to close the history of the Jews.<a name=42:3></a>

		NOTES ON THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The occasion of the Epistle to the Galatians was the evil effect of the activity of certain Christians, who contended for the permanency of the Jewish law, asserting that true faith in Christ was not sufficient for salvation.<a name=44:1></a> Thus they taught, that, after having abandoned paganism and idolatry, and after being baptised -- thus linking themselves with the Christian assembly -- those who believed must be circumcised, and must observe all the precepts of the law of Moses, otherwise they could not be saved.<a name=44:2></a> (See Acts 15: 1.<a name=44:3></a>) To this false and evil teaching was added the rejection of the ministry and the apostleship of Paul, who, said they, had not been sent by Peter and the other apostles.<a name=44:4></a> They insisted upon apostolic succession, as is so much done in these days.<a name=44:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Paul did not retreat before this attack, an attack, moreover, which he encountered everywhere.<a name=44:6></a> But in this case all the Galatians were led away by the evil, and Paul presents the point of the sword to the enemy -- for it was indeed the work of the enemy of souls -- in order that the truth of the gospel might remain with these poor deceived ones.<a name=44:7></a> He insists that it is impossible to combine the law and the gospel, although the latter fully confirms the authority of the former, as given of God.<a name=44:8></a> He who is under the law must needs fulfil it, and do all that it requires, but then it follows that Christ is dead in vain.<a name=44:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, he declared apostolic succession to be a fable, that ministry has not its source in a mission of men, nor by men, but, is, on the contrary, derived immediately from Christ Himself, and from God, by the power and operation of the Holy Ghost.<a name=44:10></a> Paul boasts in his independence of Peter and the other apostles, with which they reproached him, as though he lacked something, refusing his apostolic authority, which Paul drew immediately from the Lord.<a name=44:11></a> It is thus he begins his epistle.<a name=44:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable that Paul was more troubled when considering the state of the Galatians, who were putting themselves under law, than he was as to the Corinthians, who were walking very badly.<a name=44:13></a> He would not go to Corinth, but he said all the good he could of them, in order to recall them to a walk becoming Christianity.<a name=44:14></a> But here he at once sets himself against the evil into which the Galatians had fallen, without one gracious word (if we except the blessing with which he began all his epistles), without salutations at the close, without one word of affection, which nevertheless filled his heart: all is dry and severe.<a name=44:15></a> Was it because the apostle's love had grown cold?<a name=44:16></a> On the contrary, it was because he was full of love: he clearly shews it, for he was ready to travail in birth again with them, and he does it.<a name=44:17></a> Moses had not been able to bear the burden of the people, and had refused the thought of having begotten them even once.<a name=44:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Galatians were abandoning the foundations of the Christian faith, with respect, at least, to the means of applying its efficacy to the soul.<a name=45:1></a> They had not forsaken the truth as to the Person of Christ, nor the faith which owns Him; but, as regards the justification of the soul, they had totally abandoned the ground of faith.<a name=45:2></a> They did not believe in the sufficiency of the work of Christ, without adding to it the observance of the law of Moses -- source of all the corruption that has been introduced into the church, not perhaps, under the same form, and openly, but the same in its governing principle.<a name=45:3></a> According to this principle, works are necessary for justification, and blessing is obtained through ordinances.<a name=45:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And the difference is a fundamental one.<a name=45:5></a> The one system makes life flow from the operation of the Spirit of God by means of the word, the other from ordinances and works of man.<a name=45:6></a> The one presents man as a sinner who needs to be born again, which is effected by the Spirit of God and by the word; it shews that, having been called by the grace of God, the believer finds himself perfectly and for ever justified through the blood of Christ, that is to say, through the work that He has accomplished on the cross, and is accepted in Him before God -- a new man, created in Christ unto good works, which manifest the life he has received.<a name=45:7></a> The other system teaches that sinful man is born again in the ordinance of baptism, and is forgiven when as yet he has committed no sins: then he receives grace through various ordinances, is from time to time pardoned afresh through the sacrament of penance for some small venial sins, and also when he receives the host, and finally, goes into purgatory to be punished, so that God may be satisfied by the amount of suffering, according to the sins committed.<a name=45:8></a><a href="#45:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> In this system life is obtained by one's own works, with the help of sacraments.<a name=45:9></a> The other teaches that the believer has a perfect justification before God, through the work of Christ, in whom he believes, and partaking of the divine life, and being sealed by the Holy Ghost, he has peace with God, and he awaits the coming of Christ to take him to be in heaven with Himself, where He has gone to prepare a place for us.<a name=45:10></a> The apostle insists upon this truth of justification by faith, and that there is in us a new creation, a new life, asserting that if anything is added to Christ, salvation being sought by one's own obedience, Christ is dead in vain.<a name=45:11></a> It is another gospel, which cannot be gospel.<a name=45:12></a> But let us attentively examine what he says.<a name=45:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#45:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The common thought, that the flames of purgatory purify the soul, is opposed to true catholic doctrine: those who are not justified are not consigned to it; such go to hell.

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He begins, as I have said, with the history of his call to the ministry -- the way in which he had been made an apostle.<a name=46:1></a> He announces himself at once, and boldly to be an apostle (which they denied), but an apostle not of men, neither by man -- not by Peter, nor by any other, whoever it might be, but -- which was far better -- by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who had raised Him from the dead, the true source of all blessing and all authority.<a name=46:2></a> It is always the way of those who do not love the truth to ask by what authority it is proclaimed.<a name=46:3></a> The Lord Himself was asked this; so were the apostles, and the same thing is done in these days.<a name=46:4></a> Ecclesiastical authority, as such, as established by means of ordinances, is always the enemy of the truth.<a name=46:5></a> When its ministers lean upon authority, they are accredited as of God, but they do not allow God Himself to work outside those ordinances which give them their importance.<a name=46:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul would own no other source of his ministry but God Himself and the Lord Jesus Christ, who had chosen and also prepared him for this service, who had called him, and had afterwards formally sent him by the Holy Ghost, giving him the proofs of his apostleship in its success, as also in the miracles which he had performed.<a name=46:7></a> Now the faith of believers ought to rest upon the power of the Holy Ghost, which had been manifested in him, and had been efficacious in their own hearts by the power of God.<a name=46:8></a> God was free to send His gospel to the Gentiles, causing it to reach them by whatever means seemed good to Him.<a name=46:9></a> He chose Paul, proving this by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=46:10></a> The fruit manifested the tree.<a name=46:11></a> This is the only true ministry, though all are not apostles.<a name=46:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 2.<a name=47:1></a> Paul linked with himself all the brethren who were with him.<a name=47:2></a> In accepting Judaism, the Galatians were placing themselves in opposition to all Christians who had been enlightened by heavenly truth, and who, through grace, enjoyed true Christian liberty.<a name=47:3></a> The Jews might indeed seek to subject souls to a system which had been abolished by the death of Christ, in order thereby to maintain their own glory; but the time was passed.<a name=47:4></a> It was a question of the freedom of the word of God, that is, of God Himself, who certainly was free to send His gospel, His salvation, wherever He would, and by the means He Himself chose.<a name=47:5></a> What is His will He always performs; and the Porter (the Holy Spirit and the providence of God) opens the doors, as was the case with the Lord, the sole Head of all true ministry.<a name=47:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now miracles are not wrought to prove ministry, even as no miracles were wrought by John the Baptist or the prophets amongst the Jews.<a name=47:7></a> The word, and the fruit which it bears, are the evidence of the reality of the ministry: the word by the truth itself, and the fruits by their character and power.<a name=47:8></a> There may be opposition and persecution, but that is nothing new; the Lord and the apostles encountered it, in spite of the mightiest miracles.<a name=47:9></a> God will accomplish His own purposes, and His word will not return to Him without prospering in that whereunto He sent it.<a name=47:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law applies to man in this world: it supposes that man belongs to this world, and it furnishes him with a rule, by which he ought, as a child of fallen Adam, to direct his steps.<a name=47:11></a> It is the duty of man, in all the relationships in which he finds himself, both with God and with his neighbour; and to this is added the prohibition of lust, a prohibition which judges not only the outward conduct, but also the inward movements of the heart.<a name=47:12></a> A man might possibly keep all the external commandments, and think himself righteous, but the flesh being evil and sinful, he cannot fail to detect lust in his heart.<a name=47:13></a> An outwardly righteous walk may produce self-righteousness: but before God who searches hearts, the presence of lust, which is always sinful in His holy eyes, constitutes us sinners, and makes us unfit to enter heaven.<a name=47:14></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=48>[Page 48]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have not only committed sins, we are sinners; and therefore false Christianity does not allow that lust in the baptised is sin: it has no true remedy for the evil tree, the law does not furnish one.<a name=48:1></a> It judges sins: where God is working it can discover sin; but it does not take it away; it cannot justify the soul if it finds sinful acts or sin.<a name=48:2></a> It cannot give a new life; that is not the work assigned to it.<a name=48:3></a> It is the rule of God, invested with His authority over the children of Adam, as responsible in this world; consequently they are lost, for no child of Adam is without lust, or even without actual sins.<a name=48:4></a> Now the law pronounces a curse upon those who have sinned, and it likewise forbids lust; it must needs do so, as the perfect law of God.<a name=48:5></a> Grace, on the contrary, Christ, the Son of God, comes to redeem us, and to set us free from the condition in which, both through Adam's sin and our own sins we are found.<a name=48:6></a> Christ gave Himself that He might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father (verse 4): and if we profess to be Christians, we profess to be dead with Christ, and no longer of the world, which has rejected Him, no longer in the flesh, which was crucified with Him.<a name=48:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 6.<a name=48:8></a> But the apostle begins abruptly, as has been said, rebuking the unfaithfulness and inconstancy of the Galatians.<a name=48:9></a> They had abandoned the truth of the gospel which they had received from the apostle -- that is, grace revealed in Christ -- in order to give themselves to another gospel, which in reality was not another, or different one, but was the corruption of the gospel of Christ.<a name=48:10></a> Moreover, it was the giving up of the only true gospel, to put themselves under law -- they who had been called by grace -- for there were some who troubled them, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.<a name=48:11></a> There is, and there can be, but one gospel; God has given one gospel alone for the salvation of sinners.<a name=48:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Through His infinite grace, and His grace alone, He gave His only-begotten Son, to become a man and to die for us.<a name=48:13></a> The only source of all was His love: no one suggested it to Him, or persuaded Him thus to have compassion upon sinners.<a name=48:14></a> None could feel it divinely but God Himself, none but a divine Person could accomplish what was needful.<a name=48:15></a> The Father prepared a body for Him, and He, the Son, came to fulfil His will, to save.<a name=48:16></a> Thanks be to God, the Son has fulfilled the work that was entrusted to Him, and the Holy Ghost has announced this gospel -- that the love of God has been manifested in the gift of His Son, and that He, having finished His work, sits as Man, at the right hand of God -- and with this gospel He leads souls to repentance.<a name=48:17></a>

		God Himself has not, and cannot, have another gospel.<a name=49:1></a> He cannot forget the work of His Son, in which He has found complete satisfaction, in which He has been fully glorified.<a name=49:2></a> He cannot set forth another gospel, or add something on man's part, as though the work of Christ were imperfect, and lacked something to complete it.<a name=49:3></a> Christ, as Man, sits at God's right hand, because He has accomplished the work of salvation for all believers, having by Himself purged their sins.<a name=49:4></a> And when He had sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens, the work which saves us was announced to be finished.<a name=49:5></a> And then all teaching that requires anything else, that assumes to add something of man to complete it, denies the perfection of the work of Christ -- that is to say, denies that He has completed the work of redemption.<a name=49:6></a> That the Spirit of God works in the heart to produce in us the sense of our guilt before Him, and our need of the sacrifice of Christ -- that we need to be born of God in order to enter into His kingdom, and further, that the Holy Spirit, who dwells in the Christian, brings forth the fruits which suit the new life in which we participate through grace -- all that is true; but for the work of redemption, for the putting away of sin, and cleansing us from it, for making us divine righteousness in Christ, God will have nothing else but the death of Christ.<a name=49:7></a> God has shewn that He has accepted His death, in that He has raised up Christ from among the dead, and has set Him as Man at His right hand in the glory which He had before the world was.<a name=49:8></a> He will not allow man to add anything to that work; whatever it might be, it would deny, in so far, the sufficiency of the work of Christ.<a name=49:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These heretics do not say that Christ has not finished the work; nor did the false judaizing teachers among the Galatians say it.<a name=49:10></a> But they insisted that man must on his part add his works, the law, circumcision.<a name=49:11></a> They said God had done His part, and now it remained for man to do his.<a name=49:12></a> This is always the way of a man who does not know himself, does not own that in himself he is but a miserable lost sinner who ought to have kept the law, who was responsible to do it, but that he has failed, that his flesh is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=49:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Zealous and ardent (if you believe them) for the glory of God, and for the authority of His commandments, they take possession of that authority through the rules they impose upon others, wielding it at pleasure over the conscience, and thus over the man himself; as the Lord Jesus said, "they annul the commandments of God by their traditions.<a name=50:10></a>" Thus did the Pharisees, who were so strongly condemned by the Lord.<a name=50:11></a> Thus also do those who in this day follow not the word of God, who will not allow Christians to be taught by the word, the scriptures, <i>which are addressed to them by God Himself</i>, and which therefore, they are bound to obey; they would not, I say, that others humbly learning by the help of the Spirit of God, which belongs to all believers, should follow the precepts of that word, and enjoy the blessing which is found in the pure faith, there presented to us.<a name=50:12></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#50:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>We have indeed two Christian ordinances -- baptism and the Lord's supper; but both of them refer to the death of Christ, so that instead of linking us with the world they are witnesses that by the death of Christ we are totally separated from it, that it is a dead Christ who is the object of faith, and that it is as dead that we enjoy Christian privileges.

		They always place souls under the law, to which they add traditions, which, together with the interpretation of the word of God, they hold in their own hands, and thus they can teach what they like.<a name=51:1></a> Let believers remember, that if a master -- and God is master over every conscience -- had given commandments and directions to his servants, or a father to his children, and another prevents those commandments or directions from reaching the servants or children directly, and as they were given, he would hinder the exercise of the master's or father's authority, and moreover would deprive the servants or children of their rights.<a name=51:2></a>

		Now the whole Scriptures are in fact addressed either to the Jewish people, or (if we except three short epistles) to believers who are now sons of God by faith; and no one has the right to prevent those to whom they are written, from knowing what revelations have been made to them, and what precepts have been addressed to them.<a name=51:3></a> He who does so opposes himself to the authority of God, who has made these revelations, and has placed all His own under obligation to obey the precepts contained in them.<a name=51:4></a>

		God can give gifts for the purpose of helping believers to follow His precepts.<a name=51:5></a> Paul was thus helping them in this very epistle; but the true servants of God have never sought to take from His children's hands, His word which He has given them, which is their blessing and their light, and by which He Himself speaks to their souls, shewing that in His infinite grace He has desired to speak to them, and to communicate to them amid the darkness of this world, the knowledge of His love and of His will, to shew them the path in which they may walk in simplicity, in spite of the enemy of their souls, and enjoy -- immense happiness!<a name=51:6></a> the love of God and the light of His countenance.<a name=51:7></a> What unbounded grace, that God should deign in such a world to communicate to us His own thoughts, divine light in the darkness; and how terrible to take away these divine communications, and bide them from the eye's of His own.<a name=51:8></a> Alas!<a name=51:9></a> man is but too readily disposed to neglect them; yet to take them from souls who desire to have them, is iniquity, it is open opposition to the sovereign grace of God which has given them.<a name=51:10></a> Those who seek to rule over souls in God's stead, take from them the revelation He has made to them.<a name=51:11></a> They are then free to preach and teach what is not according to the word of God, and to impose the yoke of the law and traditions, as well as their own authority upon the necks of man.<a name=51:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a revolution!<a name=59:11></a> Saul himself, instead of having an externally pure conscience, found himself to be the chief of sinners, the enemy of the Lord, the apostle of that hatred against God, which had rejected from the world the Lord of glory, the Son of God, and which was still rejecting the testimony rendered by the Spirit after He had been glorified.<a name=59:12></a> The old dispensation, the law, the promises made to Israel, had disappeared; and instead of these, the Lord of glory, alive in heaven, is revealed by sovereign grace to him who sought to abolish the memory of His name.<a name=59:13></a> Eternal life is communicated to him, eternal salvation through the work of Christ is presented to his heart, in the glorified Man who had borne his sins, and was now making the work effectual by the operation of the Spirit of God.<a name=59:14></a> The Son of God is revealed in him.<a name=59:15></a>

		Thus, Saul was taken from among the Jews (it is the real force of the words), separated from his nation, to belong to Christ; but he did not therefore become a Gentile.<a name=60:7></a> The starting-point of his new life was a glorified Christ, for the announcing of that which he had seen, and by the power of grace had received in his heart, besides other revelations which were afterwards made to him: always, however, of a Christ rejected by the world and glorified by God.<a name=60:8></a> Knowing by the experience of Christ revealed to him and in him, that the mind of the flesh was enmity against God, as was also his religion, and his past life, Christ glorified was thenceforth his all: a Christ who had wrought redemption for him, and who had cleansed him from his sins: a Man in heaven for whom he waited, as the Fulfiller of the glorious hope of His own who were already united to Him, and were esteemed by Him as Himself.<a name=60:9></a>

		Called by such a revelation of the Person of the Lord and by the words of His mouth, it was not the moment to go and consult others, whoever they might be; but he does not go.<a name=60:10></a> His mission was from the Lord Himself, from a Lord who had not been thus revealed to others.<a name=60:11></a> He was the Lord, it was the same salvation; but it was a special revelation which stamped its character upon the whole ministry of a servant, who knew Christ Himself no more after the flesh; that is, no more as the Messiah of the Jews upon the earth.<a name=60:12></a>

		But it was needful that all should be wrought as experience in his soul; he was therefore made blind, in order that he might be separated from every external thing which could distract him, and that he might be entirely occupied with the change that had taken place in him, and that this revelation of the Lord, this total revolution in the state and relations of his own soul, might without interruption be felt, and might work within.<a name=61:1></a> It was needful that the condemnation of the law, the sin of having persecuted the Lord of glory in the persons of His people, the glory of His Person, the perfect grace which had called him, should be realities for his soul; that the new man should be formed by this means.<a name=61:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus he is left to himself.<a name=61:3></a> He does not think of seeking the rest of the apostles at Jerusalem; the Lord Himself had called him to Damascus, and Saul had received his mission from Him.<a name=61:4></a> He had not to consult the apostles, for the Lord had taken him for Himself.<a name=61:5></a> He was the servant of Christ immediately dependent upon Himself.<a name=61:6></a> He goes into Arabia and returns again to Damascus.<a name=61:7></a> After three years he goes up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stays with him fifteen days.<a name=61:8></a> He did not see the other apostles.<a name=61:9></a> He also visited James, the Lord's brother.<a name=61:10></a> He is careful to recount all these details, that the Galatians might understand that his apostolic relation was directly with the Lord Himself, that he owed nothing to the other apostles.<a name=61:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus he, who but a little time before, had been a persecutor, advanced in Judaism beyond many his equals in his own nation, is now laid hold of by sovereign grace, in the midst of his greatest activity against the name of the Lord -- an apostle sent directly by the Lord to the Gentiles, sent by a glorified Jesus.<a name=61:12></a>

		Paul was not known by face to the churches of Judea; when he afterwards visited Syria and Cilicia, they had heard only, that he who persecuted them in times past, now preached the faith which once he destroyed, and they glorified God in him.<a name=62:6></a> This was the truth, as in the presence of the Lord.<a name=62:7></a> Later, he was sent to the Gentiles, not from Jerusalem, but from Antioch, by the Holy Spirit, as we read in Acts 13.<a name=62:8></a> Neither Peter, nor the apostles, nor the church at Jerusalem, had anything to do with it; it was a wholly independent mission: they knew not even what was being done.<a name=62:9></a> He carried on the preaching of the gospel among the Gentiles (always, however, evangelising the Jews where he found any) taking with him various brothers, whom grace had prepared for the work, as we find it stated in Acts.<a name=62:10></a> But this is not the place to speak of such details.<a name=62:11></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After fourteen years he went up again to Jerusalem, precisely on account of the Judaising Christians; false brethren, unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out the liberty, which the Gentiles had in Christ Jesus, that they might bring them into bondage.<a name=62:12></a> It is probably this to which Acts 15 refers.<a name=62:13></a> Barnabas accompanied him and he also took Titus with him.<a name=62:14></a> Paul and Barnabas had greatly withstood these false brethren, who had come down from Jerusalem; but God had not allowed them to succeed, in order no doubt, that it might be Jerusalem and the apostles as linked with the assembly at Jerusalem, who should recognise the liberty of the Gentiles.<a name=62:15></a> There would otherwise have been two churches; a church bound by the law at Jerusalem, and a church free from the law at Antioch.<a name=62:16></a> Thus, by the wisdom of God, it was Jerusalem itself who declared Christians from among the nations, to be not subject to the law, and thus all remained united.<a name=62:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But we find here other important points relating to the subject treated of by the apostle, important for us also.<a name=63:1></a> First, we see that Paul (such had now become his name) went up by revelation.<a name=63:2></a> In Acts, nothing is spoken of, but the decision to which the Christians at Antioch had come.<a name=63:3></a> We may often accept and follow the advice of others, though if we are keeping near enough to the Lord and learning of Him, our decision may depend upon the communications that are made to us by Him.<a name=63:4></a> In this case, it was a direct revelation; but the principle is the same for us.<a name=63:5></a> I do the thing because I know the will of God, although I may do that which is the fruit of the counsels of others.<a name=63:6></a> Paul went as sent of God, and this inspires confidence, and gives firmness in the path.<a name=63:7></a> We feel that we are doing the will of God.<a name=63:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, Paul speaks of it here, to shew that he went up only because it was the will of God, not because it depended upon the authority of those at Jerusalem.<a name=63:9></a> As however, the gospel itself was in question, he was content to communicate to the others what he himself had preached; but privately to those who were pillars, lest in any way he should have run in vain.<a name=63:10></a> But neither was Titus who was with him, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised: he would not yield to them, not even for a single moment, as though he were subject to them, whether at Antioch or Jerusalem, in order that the truth of the gospel might continue with the Gentiles.<a name=63:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides he had received nothing from those who seemed to be pillars in the assembly at Jerusalem: "whatsoever they were," says Paul, "it maketh no matter to me; God accepteth no man's person.<a name=63:12></a>" And again, those who were in the greatest esteem among them, had added nothing to him.<a name=63:13></a> For him, God was all; Christ had sent him, he had learned the truth by revelation; all the rest, for him, were but men -- beloved brethren indeed, each one of whom he owned in his special place, but he drew his authority from Christ alone: independent of all men in order to obey Jesus, yet necessarily through love to Him, at the service of all men.<a name=63:14></a> But we find yet more.<a name=63:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These brethren of Jerusalem, pillars of the assembly, James, Peter, and John, saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision, that is of the Gentiles, had been committed to Paul, as the gospel of the circumcision, that is of the Jews, was to Peter.<a name=63:16></a> For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in Paul toward the Gentiles; they gave therefore to Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that they should go to the heathen, while they themselves went to the circumcision.<a name=63:17></a> We find here facts and principles of the highest importance.<a name=63:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He puts James first among the pillars, as we see in Acts 15.<a name=64:1></a> He held the first place at Jerusalem; when he speaks of gifts and the apostleship he only names Peter.<a name=64:2></a> Apostleship in the work of the gospel depended upon the gift of God.<a name=64:3></a> Now as God had wrought among the Gentiles by means of Paul and Barnabas, He had likewise wrought among the Jews by means of Peter.<a name=64:4></a> He had wrought powerfully in the one toward the Jew, and in both, though chiefly in Paul, toward the Gentiles; and owning the grace of God in the work, they agreed that each should labour according to their gifts, in the spheres entrusted to them of God.<a name=64:5></a> Paul thus became the apostle to the Gentiles, to whom Christ had sent him: Peter, to the Jews only, among whom God had blessed him.<a name=64:6></a> Peter had however, begun the work with the twelve, and God had used him at the first, to open the door to the Gentiles; but he did not continue to labour among them, and renouncing the commission given to him in Matthew 28, he left the apostleship of the Gentiles wholly to Paul and Barnabas, who had been sent to that work, and blessed in it by the Lord.<a name=64:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This latter -- Barnabas -- soon disappeared; he was too much linked with Mark, his kinsman according to the flesh, and Paul remained as apostle of the Gentiles throughout the whole world, and of the assembly of God which united both Jews and Gentiles in one -- a subject of which he alone spoke -- the assembly composed of true Christians, united to Christ by the Holy Spirit, the body of Christ, in which there is neither Jew nor Greek; for the two have become one assembly, one body, united to Christ the head of the body, and members one of another.<a name=64:8></a> Such is the apostle to the Gentiles: with them Peter had nothing to do.<a name=64:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that these facts are of great importance in the history of the church of God.<a name=64:10></a> How often have we not heard Peter spoken of as head of the church.<a name=64:11></a> That Peter, ardent and full of zeal, began the work at Jerusalem, the Lord working mightily by his means, is certain; we see it plainly in Scripture.<a name=64:12></a> But he had nothing to do with the work carried on among the Gentiles.<a name=64:13></a> That work was done by Paul, who was sent by the Lord Himself, and Paul entirely rejected the authority of Peter.<a name=64:14></a> For him, Peter was but a man; and he, sent by Christ, was independent of men.<a name=64:15></a> The church among the Gentiles, is the fruit of Paul's, not of Peter's work: it owed its origin to Paul and to his labours, and in no way to Peter, whom Paul had to resist with all his strength, in order to keep the assemblies among the Gentiles free from the influence of that Spirit which ruled Christians, who were the fruit of Peter's work.<a name=64:16></a> God maintained unity by His grace; had He not kept the church, it would have been divided into two parts, even in the days of the apostles themselves.<a name=64:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is marvellous that so many should hold as head of the church among the Gentiles, Peter, who was the apostle of the circumcision, and who openly left the work amongst the heathen to Paul -- who had already laboured in it independently for more than fourteen years, sent and blessed by the Lord and by the Holy Ghost, without any reference to Peter, and who had, moreover, expressly rejected Peter's authority, which the false brethren sought to impose upon the Gentile churches.<a name=65:1></a> Peter, though greatly blessed by the Lord, is the apostle of the circumcision and of the circumcision only: Paul, of the uncircumcision, that is, of the Gentiles.<a name=65:2></a> Paul alone among the apostles, speaks of the church, the body of Christ: this truth was confided only to him as its administrator.<a name=65:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 11.<a name=65:4></a> Paul recalls another case: one in which he had been compelled to reprove and withstand Peter, who had come to Antioch, where the church had been founded among the Gentiles, though there were Jews among them also.<a name=65:5></a> Poor Peter!<a name=65:6></a> he shewed himself at the beginning, quite ready to eat with the Gentiles, he was free from the prejudices of his countrymen: but alas!<a name=65:7></a> when certain came down from Jerusalem, from James, who was the leader of the work and of the assembly in the civil and religious capital of the Jews, where the law was still observed by the Christians -- then Peter, full of ardour but sensitive to the opinion of others, and timid in the presence of reproach, withdraws, and no longer eats with the Gentiles.<a name=65:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was to destroy the divine work, which had already been wrought at Jerusalem -- an evident act of unfaithfulness.<a name=65:9></a> The more a man is honoured -- and in this case, there was true ground for respect -- the greater the stumbling-block to others, if he fail, and thus it happened here.<a name=65:10></a> All the Jews and even Barnabas also, dissembled with Peter, and no longer dared to walk with the Gentiles.<a name=65:11></a> The unity of the Spirit was lost, as also the truth of the gospel.<a name=65:12></a> Paul could not let this pass; and when he saw that Peter walked not uprightly, he reproved him before all.<a name=65:13></a> Authority cannot make evil good nor good evil.<a name=65:14></a> We see moreover, that Peter had not the very smallest authority over Paul; and this is why the latter recalls the fact.<a name=65:15></a> Peter deserved to be rebuked, and Paul rebuked him in the presence of all, saying: "If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?<a name=65:16></a>"

		This leads us away from the history and from the question of owning Peter's authority, to that of the truth of the gospel, which he was imperilling.<a name=66:1></a> Not only did Peter shew a false and deceitful spirit -- boasting of his liberty one moment, and the next, concealing what his previous walk had been -- but he was establishing error; and there was danger; for inasmuch as in him lay, and as far as it depended upon his authority he was destroying the truth of the gospel: "we" continues Paul, "who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.<a name=66:2></a> But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin?<a name=66:3></a> God forbid.<a name=66:4></a> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.<a name=66:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul begins here to treat of doctrine, not merely of Peter's authority, leaving aside the question of the work committed to him among the circumcision.<a name=66:6></a> He reasons thus.<a name=66:7></a> Peter, being a Jew like the rest, was building again the system of the law, when he refused to eat with the Gentiles; he was seeking to be justified by works and by the exact observance of legal ordinances.<a name=66:8></a> But he had abandoned this means of justification, in order to believe on Christ, that he might be justified by the faith of Christ; and in building again the system of the law, he made himself a transgressor in having left it.<a name=66:9></a> But it was Christ who had led him to do it.<a name=66:10></a> Christ then was the minister of sin!<a name=66:11></a> this could not be.<a name=66:12></a> If he built again the things he had destroyed, he became a sinner in having destroyed them -- and Christ had led him to do it!<a name=66:13></a> The apostle then gives an admirable compendium of individual truth, in respect of his Christian position.<a name=66:14></a>

		The law requires righteousness in man: it could not do otherwise, for it was the perfect rule of such righteousness.<a name=67:1></a> But neither Paul nor any other had fulfilled it; therefore it pronounced the sentence of death and condemnation, not death only, but also condemnation.<a name=67:2></a> He now sets forth how this sentence had been carried into effect, how he had escaped the condemnation and had died to sin: yet he was not dead; Christ had taken the condemnation upon Himself: thus his death was but the death of the old man, and this was an immense gain.<a name=67:3></a> The law had slain him, but Christ had died in his stead: once dead, the law could do no more, it had dominion over a man as long as he lived.<a name=67:4></a> If a criminal dies in the hands of the officers of justice, or in his prison, the law cannot punish or take action against a dead man: all behind him is closed, he lives no longer in the life he had previously possessed.<a name=67:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Christ, all this is accomplished for us, but there is yet more.<a name=67:6></a> He took the condemnation and passed through death: we are associated with Him, and thus dead to sin without there being any condemnation for us; moreover, He is become our life.<a name=67:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we are dead to the law that we might live to God.<a name=67:8></a> I, said Paul, have been crucified with Christ, who has taken the curse of the law; nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=67:9></a> This is death, both to the flesh and to the law.<a name=67:10></a> Thus, there is no condemnation for me, since Christ has taken it, inasmuch as He charged Himself with my sins, and bore them upon the cross, abolishing them by His death.<a name=67:11></a> Sin in my flesh is condemned, and in the cross of Christ I was crucified with Him.<a name=67:12></a> (Compare Romans 8: 1-3.<a name=67:13></a>) Thus, are we set free, not only from the guilt of our sins, but from the power of sin in the flesh, the old man is for the believer, crucified with Christ (Romans 6: 6), that the body of sin might be destroyed.<a name=67:14></a> Having been redeemed, we are not subjected afresh to the law, to which we have died as if our salvation were still uncertain; for the flesh is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; but through faith, we hold ourselves to be dead, crucified with Christ, who risen from among the dead, has really become our life.<a name=67:15></a> Christ lives in us, and we can thus reckon ourselves to be dead to sin (Romans 6: 10, 11) and alive unto God in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=67:16></a>

		We are no longer debtors to the flesh, which for faith is dead: but since Christ who has died is our life, we, living by this life, reckon ourselves dead; for Christ who is our life has died, and the power of the Spirit which acts in this new life, sets us free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8: 2).<a name=68:1></a> Thus, Christ being in us, the body is dead; for if it lives of its own proper life, it only brings forth sin; and the Spirit is life, the source of practical righteousness in us.<a name=68:2></a> Thus the wisdom of God, instead of placing the flesh under the law, to which it was not and could not be subject, gives in sovereign grace a new life in the risen Christ, who died for us.<a name=68:3></a> There is therefore no more condemnation to them that believe, and we reckon ourselves to be dead, since Christ who is our life has died.<a name=68:4></a> We are by the law dead to the law, crucified with Christ, nevertheless we live, yet not we, but Christ liveth in us.<a name=68:5></a> The bond of the law is broken; not that its authority is despised, but that I am dead; it can no longer touch me, for I am dead.<a name=68:6></a> Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but it is Christ who lives in me, a life which is holy, just, and good.<a name=68:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But another truth is found in this passage.<a name=68:8></a> It is not merely a holy life (being that of Christ Himself), but this life has its object, its manner of living.<a name=68:9></a> All life in the creature has an object, we cannot walk without one.<a name=68:10></a> If the Lord Jesus is our life, He is also personally the object of the life, and we live by faith in Him.<a name=68:11></a> The heart sees Him, looks to Him, feeds upon Him, is assured of His love, for He gave Himself for us.<a name=68:12></a> The life that we live in the flesh, we live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved us and gave Himself for us.<a name=68:13></a> Happy certainty, blessed assurance!<a name=68:14></a> This is not a subject of hope: the glory, though it belongs to us, is a hope; but in this we know the love in which He has given His life for us.<a name=68:15></a> It is a new life, the old man is crucified, and Christ whose perfect love we know, is the object of faith and of the heart.<a name=68:16></a> One cannot give more than oneself.<a name=68:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The conclusion drawn by Paul is of the utmost importance.<a name=68:18></a> "We do not frustrate the grace of God, for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.<a name=68:19></a>" Let us suppose that a righteous man could knock at the door of heaven, and claim to enter by right on the ground of his own works.<a name=68:20></a> Such an one would never know God; love would not have introduced him there, and God is Love.<a name=68:21></a> It would have been the wages of his own work, he would have deserved to enter.<a name=68:22></a> But it is not love when a workman is paid the wages he has earned; it may be done with courtesy, but it is always a debt -- there can be no love in it.<a name=68:23></a> It is love that has saved me.<a name=68:24></a> It is the operation of love in God's gift of His Son, and in the blessed Saviour's own sufferings for us, when He drank the cup which the Father gave to Him, the cup of death and of the curse which our sins had filled.<a name=68:25></a> By this we understand through grace the love of God.<a name=68:26></a>

		But if righteousness can be obtained by observing the law, the death which Christ in His infinite grace suffered for us, is not needed: I am righteous by my own deeds: I frustrate the grace of God.<a name=69:1></a> "If righteousness is by the law, Christ is dead in vain"; a principle of the utmost importance.<a name=69:2></a> Legal righteousness (that is righteousness by works) and Christianity cannot go together, the one annuls the other.<a name=69:3></a> It is not that the law is bad or imperfect: it is the perfect rule of human righteousness, the righteousness which becomes the children of Adam; but no righteousness is found in them, they are sinners.<a name=69:4></a> There is none righteous, no, not one.<a name=69:5></a> The law being perfect condemns us, but we have died in Christ who bare our sins in His own body on the tree, and the law can no longer slay or condemn us.<a name=69:6></a> The Saviour has borne all for us who through grace believe on Him.<a name=69:7></a> Moreover He has given us, or rather He is in us, a new life, which is holy and obedient.<a name=69:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, we are dead to the law, that we might live to God; righteousness is obtained, for we have become the righteousness of God in Christ, sins are put away by His death.<a name=69:9></a> But if I had obtained righteousness by keeping the law, there would have been no need that the Son of God should die for me.<a name=69:10></a> If Christ has put away my sins and become my righteousness before God, I am not justified by works of law but by faith in Him.<a name=69:11></a> If my righteousness is by works of law He is dead in vain.<a name=69:12></a>

		CHAPTER 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle now looks at the position of the Christian, from another point of view.<a name=69:13></a> True Christians are possessors of the Holy Ghost; their bodies are the temples of the Spirit which they have received of God (1 Corinthians 6: 19).<a name=69:14></a> "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his," Romans 8: 9.<a name=69:15></a> By the Spirit we cry, Abba Father (Romans 8; Galatians 4: 6).<a name=69:16></a> It is by the Comforter that we are in Christ and Christ in us (John 14: 20).<a name=69:17></a> The apostle therefore asks, How did you receive the Holy Ghost?<a name=69:18></a> Was it by the works of the law or by faith in Christ?<a name=69:19></a> It was not questioned that they had received Him nor how they had received Him.<a name=69:20></a> The Galatians had never been under law, they were heathen.<a name=69:21></a> It was not by the works of law they had received the Holy Ghost.<a name=69:22></a> Moreover, some among them possessed His gifts, a fact which rendered the presence of the Spirit not more important, since He is the seal and proof of our salvation, and of our life in Christ (by whom ye are sealed until the day of redemption), but more evident.<a name=69:23></a> "Who then," says Paul, "has bewitched you, O foolish Galatians, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you?<a name=69:24></a> This only would I learn of you; Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?<a name=69:25></a>" They well knew it was not by law, but by faith, and all now who have received the Holy Ghost know well that it is by Jesus Christ they have received Him.<a name=69:26></a> Christians in this day believe so little in the presence of the Holy Ghost, that there is less force for them in this argument of the apostle; but to the Galatians it was conclusive.<a name=69:27></a> They had received Him by faith.<a name=69:28></a>

		If a man, convinced of sin, and believing in the Lord Jesus as the alone and perfect Saviour, who has finished the work committed to Him by the Father, can, from the bottom of his heart, say, "Abba, Father," such an one possesses the Holy Ghost (Romans 8: 15; Galatians 4: 6).<a name=70:9></a> Not only does he see the truth in the word, and accept it, but in the presence of God he enjoys liberty, and possesses the consciousness of His relationship with God.<a name=70:10></a> He will have much to learn, much, perhaps, to correct, much to forget, much to alter in his spiritual condition, but he possesses the consciousness of his relationship with God.<a name=70:11></a> This is not simply conversion; a sinner, as a sinner, cannot be sealed.<a name=70:12></a> God cannot put His seal upon sin; but when a man has been cleansed by the blood of Christ, then the Holy Spirit comes and dwells in him.<a name=70:13></a>

		The prophets likewise taught that life is through faith, that the law does not justify saying: "The just shall live by faith.<a name=74:8></a>" Now the law is not of faith, but of works; moreover, the man himself must do them, for the law requires that he should work out his own righteousness: it says, "the man that doeth these things shall live in them.<a name=74:9></a>" Does it then follow that the authority of the law must be despised, since those who have been under it, have not kept it, or that all must be condemned?<a name=74:10></a> Not so.<a name=74:11></a> Christ has redeemed us (we who believe on Him) from the curse of the law, being made in His infinite grace, His immense love, a curse for us, as it is written: "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree; that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<a name=74:12></a>"

		But this is not all.<a name=75:1></a> We find in the Old Testament the promise of the Holy Spirit, a promise renewed still more clearly in the words of the Lord Himself.<a name=75:2></a> It was written that the Spirit should be poured out upon all flesh, that is, the Gentiles should have their part in it.<a name=75:3></a> This was Peter's authority for receiving Cornelius among the Christians.<a name=75:4></a> The believing Gentiles were sealed as much as were the Jews.<a name=75:5></a> God had put His seal upon them as His children, and they were united in one body with the Jews and with Christ Himself.<a name=75:6></a> The blessing of the Gentiles was the same as the blessing of the Jews.<a name=75:7></a> The Jews had not received the Spirit under the law, when the Gentiles were excluded; and now that all were manifested together as sinners, grace which had cleansed both the one and the other, admitted one and the other to the same privileges.<a name=75:8></a> Thus the promise already made to Abraham and to the nations in him was fulfilled in the gift of the Spirit, given through Christ, to those who believe from among the Gentiles.<a name=75:9></a>

		But this made the apostle long to be with them.<a name=87:1></a> He was perplexed as to them, for the gospel had in reality been abandoned by them; yet when looking to the Lord, he always hoped that Christ was truly in their hearts, and that only in their heads they had accepted a doctrine, which totally perverted the gospel of Christ.<a name=87:2></a> He needed, so to speak, to travail in birth afresh with them till Christ should be formed in them.<a name=87:3></a> Nevertheless, he calls them his children: his love inspired him with confidence, and yet filled his heart with uneasiness.<a name=87:4></a> He would have desired to be with them that he might change his voice, suiting it to their state; not only teaching them the truth, but doing whatever their need required.<a name=87:5></a> Mark here, the deep love of the apostle.<a name=87:6></a> Moses, faithful as he was, grew weary of the burden of the people and said: "Have I conceived all this people?<a name=87:7></a> have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?<a name=87:8></a>" (Numbers 11, 12) but the apostle is willing to travail in birth with them as his children a second time, in order that their souls might be saved.<a name=87:9></a>

		Such was the application of the history of Abraham and Sarah, and her servant Hagar.<a name=88:1></a> But the apostle also quotes from the prophet Isaiah another passage, to shew that it is when Jerusalem is forsaken of God, that she brings forth more children than when she had a husband.<a name=88:2></a> These children are ourselves, Christians, during the time of the church (Isaiah 54: 1).<a name=88:3></a> The passage is addressed to Jerusalem, restored in the kingdom to come, but it owns that the forsaken one has more children than she which had a husband.<a name=88:4></a> The children born according to promise, are more numerous in the present time, than those born when Jerusalem was owned.<a name=88:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free woman.<a name=88:14></a> We cannot possibly be the children of both, otherwise, as says the apostle, grace is no more grace.<a name=88:15></a> We are freed from the law, from its ceremonies, from its service, from the elements of the world, to belong to a risen Christ, who has cancelled our sins, and also all the ordinances of the law; who has borne its curse for us, and who has communicated to us a life which is in liberty and holiness before God.<a name=88:16></a> Christ Himself is this life in us: in it we rejoice in holiness, as well as in forgiveness, and in God Himself instead of living in fear.<a name=88:17></a> We are children of the free woman and of her only.<a name=88:18></a> The apostle now begins to exhort them to be faithful to this principle.<a name=88:19></a>

		Paul then returns (verse 11) to speak of himself.<a name=91:7></a> If I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?<a name=91:8></a> For it was the Jew who everywhere raised up persecution against him.<a name=91:9></a> If he preached circumcision, the offence of the cross would have ceased.<a name=91:10></a> We see, moreover, the trouble of his spirit; this characterises the epistle: "I would that they were even cut off that trouble you.<a name=91:11></a> For, brethren, ye have been called to liberty"; a principle, which in connection with what follows, is of the utmost importance.<a name=91:12></a> The Christian was called to liberty, the holy liberty of the new nature, but yet liberty.<a name=91:13></a> It is no longer a law which constrains, or rather vainly seeks to constrain a nature whose will is contrary to it, to satisfy the obligations which accompany the relationships, in which by the will of God we find ourselves -- a law imposed, forbidding evil to a nature that loves evil, and commanding the love of God and of one's neighbour, to a nature whose spring is selfishness.<a name=91:14></a>

		Had it been possible to take away Christ's moral liberty -- which was not possible -- it would have been by preventing Him from obeying the will of the Father.<a name=91:15></a> This was the food He ate (John 4).<a name=91:16></a> As a perfect Man, He lived by every word which came forth out of the mouth of God.<a name=91:17></a> He chose to die, to drink the bitter cup which the Father had given Him, rather than not obey Him, and glorify Him in drinking it.<a name=91:18></a> Christianity is the liberty of a new nature that loves to obey, and to do the will of God.<a name=91:19></a> It is true that the flesh, if not kept in subjection, can use this liberty to satisfy its own desires, just as it used the law, which had been given to convict of sin, to work out righteousness.<a name=91:20></a> But the true liberty of the new man -- Christ our life -- is the liberty of a holy will, acquired through the deliverance of the heart from the power of sin, liberty to serve others in love.<a name=91:21></a> All the law is fulfilled in one word -- "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<a name=91:22></a>" The Christian can do still more, he can give himself for others; or, at the least, following the direction of the Spirit, he fulfils the law in love.<a name=91:23></a> But if they devoured one another in selfishness, contending about circumcision and the law, "take heed," says the apostle, "that ye be not consumed one of another.<a name=91:24></a>"

		The apostle here establishes the principles of holiness, of the Christian walk, and brings in the Holy Ghost in place of the law.<a name=92:1></a> In the preceding part of the Epistle he had set forth Christian justification by faith, in contrast with works of law.<a name=92:2></a> He here shews that God produces holiness.<a name=92:3></a> Instead of exacting it, as did the law with regard to human righteousness, from the nature which loves sin, He produces it in the human heart, as wrought by the Spirit.<a name=92:4></a> When Christ had ascended up on high, and was set down on the right hand of God, having accomplished a perfect redemption for those who should believe on Him, He sent down the Holy Spirit to dwell in all such.<a name=92:5></a> They were already children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and, because they were such, God gave them the Spirit of His Son.<a name=92:6></a> Born of God, cleansed by the blood of Christ, accepted in the Beloved, God seals them as His own, by the gift of the Spirit, until the day of redemption, that is, of glory.<a name=92:7></a> Having the new life, Christ as their life, they are bound to walk as Christ walked, and to manifest the life of Christ down here in their mortal flesh.<a name=92:8></a>

		This life, produced in us by the operation of the Holy Ghost through the word, is led by the Spirit which is given to believers; its rule is also in the word.<a name=92:9></a> Its fruits are the fruits of the Spirit.<a name=92:10></a> The Christian walk is the manifestation of this new life, of Christ our life, in the midst of the world.<a name=92:11></a> If we follow this path -- Christ Himself -- if we walk in His steps, we shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.<a name=92:12></a> It is thus sin is avoided, not by taking the law to compel man to do what he does not like; the law has no power to compel the flesh to obey, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=92:13></a> The new life loves to obey, loves holiness, and Christ is its strength and wisdom by the Holy Ghost.<a name=92:14></a> The flesh is indeed there; it lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit lusts against the flesh, to prevent man from walking as he would.<a name=92:15></a> But if we walk in the Spirit, we are not under the law; we are not as the man in Romans 7, where, impelled by the new nature, the will desires to do good, but, a captive to sin, he finds no way of doing what he desires; for the law gives neither strength nor life.<a name=92:16></a> Under law, even if life is there, there is no strength: man is the captive of sin.<a name=92:17></a>

		But sealed by the Holy Spirit, the believer is free, he can perform the good he loves.<a name=93:1></a> If Christ is thus in him, the body is dead, the old man is crucified with Christ.<a name=93:2></a> The Spirit is life, and that Spirit, as a divine and mighty Person, works in him to bring forth good fruits.<a name=93:3></a> The flesh and the Spirit are in their nature opposed the one to the other; but if we are faithful in seeking grace, the power of the Spirit -- Christ, by His Spirit in us -- enables us to hold the flesh for dead, and to walk in the footsteps of Christ, bringing forth the fruits that suit Him.<a name=93:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is not really any difficulty in distinguishing the fruits of the Spirit and the fruits of the flesh: the apostle names them, those, at least, which are characteristic of their respective actions.<a name=93:5></a> Of the sad fruits of the flesh, he positively declares that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God: but the fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, etc.<a name=93:6></a>; against such there is no law; God cannot condemn the fruit of His own Spirit.<a name=93:7></a> Remark, that the first of these fruits are love, joy, peace.<a name=93:8></a> The Spirit will surely produce those practical fruits which manifest the life of Christ in the sight of men, but the inward fruits, the fruits Godward, come first, the condition of soul needful for producing the others.<a name=93:9></a> Many converted persons seek for the practical fruits in order to assure themselves that they are born of the Spirit and accepted of God.<a name=93:10></a> But peace, love, joy are the firstfruits of the presence of the Spirit; the others follow.<a name=93:11></a> In order to know what is in the heart of God, we need to see the fruit of His heart, the gift of Jesus.<a name=93:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I believe in Him, and through Him in the love of God, sealed of God by the Spirit, I have the sense of His love: love shewn in the death of Jesus is shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit, which is given to those who are washed from their sins through faith in His blood.<a name=93:13></a> By that Spirit we have the consciousness of our position before God, and love, joy, peace are in the soul.<a name=93:14></a> The fruits which follow are, moreover, the proof to others that my certainty and assurance are not false, that I am not deceived.<a name=93:15></a> But for myself, it is what God has done which is the proof of what is in the heart of God, and through faith I set to my seal that God is true.<a name=93:16></a> Then, sealed by the gift of the Spirit, I rejoice in His goodness, and the fruits of the new life manifest to others that this life is there.<a name=93:17></a>

		Moreover, "they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts.<a name=94:1></a>" They have not got to die: Christ died for us, and He who died being our life, we hold ourselves for dead, crucified with Him, as though we ourselves had died upon the cross, since it was for us He suffered.<a name=94:2></a> Possessing another life, I do not own the flesh as "I," but as sin which dwelleth in me, which I hold to be crucified.<a name=94:3></a> The faithful Christian realises this continually.<a name=94:4></a> God.<a name=94:5></a> declares us to be dead with Christ: He looks upon us thus (Col 3 .<a name=94:6></a> 3).<a name=94:7></a> Faith, accepting God's declaration with thankfulness; holds the flesh, the old man, to be dead (Romans 6), and through the Spirit, if he is faithful, he applies the cross in a practical way to the flesh, so that it may not act (2 Corinthians 4); besides this, God in His government sends that which is needful to test the Christian, and to effect this.<a name=94:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle adds the exhortation, "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<a name=94:9></a> Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.<a name=94:10></a>" The law nourishes rather than destroys vain glory, for the law makes us think of self.<a name=94:11></a> When rightly employed, it is most useful for convincing of sin, not for producing righteousness.<a name=94:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the operation of the law with regard to justification and holiness has been fully examined, and set in a clear light.<a name=94:13></a> It does not produce righteousness, it exacts it.<a name=94:14></a> It cannot be linked with Christ as a means of justification: "if righteousness is by the law, Christ is dead in vain.<a name=94:15></a>" Man ought surely to have kept the commandments of God, but that is not the real question.<a name=94:16></a> He has not kept them, therefore, upon that ground he is lost.<a name=94:17></a> Christ, on the other hand, brings salvation because we are guilty.<a name=94:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as to holiness: it is not God's way to seek to produce holiness in the flesh through the law, for the flesh is not subject to the law, neither indeed can be.<a name=94:19></a> God gives a new life in Christ, and the Holy Spirit, to produce fruits which are acceptable to Him, and against these fruits there is certainly no divine law.<a name=94:20></a> God cannot condemn the fruits of His own Spirit.<a name=94:21></a> It is the new creature, the new life, with its fruits by the Spirit, which are acceptable to God; it is this new creature which seeks to please Him.<a name=94:22></a>

		CHAPTER 6
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle now adds some special exhortations.<a name=95:2></a> First, as to the grace which we ought to shew one towards another, coupled with the sense of responsibility in oneself.<a name=95:3></a> The spirit of the law naturally leads to righteousness, and then to hardness towards another, if he is overtaken in a fault: it makes us forget our own weakness.<a name=95:4></a> This was seen plainly in the Pharisees, and is found among Christians also; therefore the apostle exhorts them, saying, "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.<a name=95:5></a>" The sense of one's own weakness makes us meek towards others.<a name=95:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then (verse 2) we get a law; he calls it this because they wanted a law: the true law, if they must have one, is to act as Christ did -- that is, to bear the burdens of others, and thus fulfil the most excellent law, the law of love.<a name=95:7></a> He would not have them to be indifferent to sin, or to fail in needful discipline when sin had been manifested.<a name=95:8></a> But when a brother had been overtaken in a fault, he would have them seek his restoration with love, with the faithfulness of holy love.<a name=95:9></a> The danger, and even the effect, of a legal spirit is to make us think ourselves something when we are nothing; we deceive ourselves.<a name=95:10></a> Simple words, but full of power!<a name=95:11></a> We need to prove ourselves and our work, that we may have to boast as to ourselves alone, and not as to others; a principle which is always true, and such was then the case with the Galatians.<a name=95:12></a> Whose had the work among them been?<a name=95:13></a> Paul's.<a name=95:14></a> Others desired to appropriate that work; but when they had been heathen Paul had worked among them, and had been the means of their conversion.<a name=95:15></a> Through his instrumentality they had received Christ into their hearts.<a name=95:16></a> But each should bear his own burden.<a name=95:17></a> Grace may bear the burdens of others, but, as to responsibility, when the Lord shall judge, each shall bear his own burden.<a name=95:18></a>

		Here ends the exhortation which treats of the relations of brethren in their responsibility one towards another, as also of that which regards each one.<a name=96:1></a> He adds the desire, that those who learn through the labours of others should think in love of the needs of those who teach.<a name=96:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then returns to the fundamental principle of the Christian walk.<a name=96:3></a> It is not a law given to a nature which always, by its very nature, resists the law: it is a power which works in a new life, the Spirit given to those who believe on the Lord Jesus.<a name=96:4></a> The government of God ensures the consequences which flow from the walk.<a name=96:5></a> God does not allow Himself to be mocked; "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.<a name=96:6></a>" "He that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.<a name=96:7></a>" The path of sin and the path of the Spirit, in which the true Christian walks, both infallibly lead to the ends which suit each -- the path of the flesh to corruption, even in this life; the way of the Spirit to life eternal.<a name=96:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 9.<a name=96:9></a> But we must not weary in the right path, for God is faithful, and if we persevere, we shall reap in His own time.<a name=96:10></a> We often want to see the fruit of our labours at once, like one who turns up the earth to see if the seed is springing.<a name=96:11></a> But the work, if real, is the work of God, and we must wait till His work is accomplished; then we shall see the fruit matured according to the perfection of His workmanship.<a name=96:12></a> Let us, then, not weary in well doing, but whilst we have opportunity let us do good unto all men, especially to those who are of the household of faith.<a name=96:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 11.<a name=96:14></a> The apostle returns to his chief subject, shewing the preoccupation of his spirit, which is also expressed in the fact he mentions.<a name=96:15></a> He was greatly troubled because the Galatians were abandoning the principles of grace in which they had been instructed, and through which they had been converted.<a name=96:16></a> He had written this letter with his own hand, though habitually he employed another to write (Romans 16: 22; 2 Thessalonians 3: 17).<a name=96:17></a> Those who constrain you to be circumcised, says the apostle, desire to make a fair show in the flesh.<a name=96:18></a> They themselves did not keep the law, but in order to bring honour to themselves, they sought to put others under the law -- the religion in which they had boasted in the days of their ancestors, and thus to glory in the flesh, in the proselytes from among the nations.<a name=96:19></a> The apostle desired to glory only in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world was crucified to him and he to the world.<a name=96:20></a> To seek a good or even a religious appearance before the world, is to seek the honour of a world which has dishonoured, rejected, and crucified Him who has loved us and given Himself for us.<a name=96:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=97>[Page 97]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cross, for us, is salvation, the proof of the infinite love of God; but it was the shame of the Lord of glory to which He submitted for us.<a name=97:1></a> There, the world finally condemned itself, and God was glorified in love.<a name=97:2></a> Paul did not want the honour of a world, which at the cross dishonoured Him who had so loved him; he would glory only in the cross -- the proof of the Lord's love and of his own salvation.<a name=97:3></a> He identified himself with Christ, he was crucified to the world which had crucified Him, and the world was likewise crucified to him.<a name=97:4></a> A world that has crucified the Lord is not the place where a Christian can seek honour; it has, by the cross, manifested what it is.<a name=97:5></a> Shall we go with the world to crucify Christ, or shall we own Him who gave Himself for us upon that cross, and love Him there, where He shewed His love to us?<a name=97:6></a> In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision -- that is all past with the cross, with death to the world and its elements -- but a new creation.<a name=97:7></a> This is the Christian's rule, not the law which is adapted to man born of Adam, after the flesh and living in the world, though the flesh is not and cannot be subject to it.<a name=97:8></a> As many, says the apostle, as walk according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God -- not upon man according to the flesh.<a name=97:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul, conscious of what he had been in his service, with a patient heart and elevated spirit exclaims, "Henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.<a name=97:10></a>" It is sad to see that the apostle, himself in affliction, was obliged to appeal to such a proof of his divine calling.<a name=97:11></a> There is no salutation, no word of love or confidence.<a name=97:12></a> "Let no man trouble me" is all he can say to those who formerly would have plucked out their own eyes in love to him.<a name=97:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this shews plainly to what an extent the error of the Galatians weighed upon the apostle's spirit.<a name=97:14></a> How serious is this perversity of the human heart, which really unconscious of its state of sin and weakness, instead of finding in the law the proof of that state, uses it to produce its own righteousness, human righteousness, after the gospel has revealed the righteousness of God for us in Christ, just because we had none for God.<a name=97:15></a> But from that day, this error everywhere abounds, and it even characterises actual Christianity.<a name=97:16></a> It is the doctrine of all the branches of Christianity.<a name=97:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a most interesting epistle, but a sad one; it brings us back to the basis of Christianity, the foundations of our relationships, rather than to the development of the privileges which belong to the Christian and to his standing in Christ.<a name=98:1></a> But it is all the more needful for the soul that desires to grow in grace.<a name=98:2></a> For if we are not well grounded in grace, and in the efficacy of the work of Christ, it is impossible really to grow in the development of life, and in fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=98:3></a> It is ever needful to lay afresh the basis of our relations with God.<a name=98:4></a>

		THE TRUE PATH OF A CHRISTIAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to present to you a brief outline of what has struck me as to the true path of a Christian, or rather the principle and measure of his walk, as taught in Ephesians 4 and 5.<a name=99:1></a> I purpose merely to draw attention to the great principles.<a name=99:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should gladly see some application or exhortation added by yourself.<a name=99:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get the principle and the measure of this walk; its double principle in chapter 4.<a name=99:4></a> If we have learned the truth as it is in Jesus, it is that we "have put off" (not to "put off") "as concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and that we have put on the new man.<a name=99:5></a>" And here we at once get the true character of this new man.<a name=99:6></a> It is "created after God in righteousness and true holiness" -- not yet love, though this will never be separated, but its intrinsic moral nature in respect of good and evil.<a name=99:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has been perfectly revealed through the work of Christ, and revealed in respect of evil and sin.<a name=99:8></a> He has been revealed in His dealing with others, with evil and with good where it is, with what glorifies Him, that is Christ.<a name=99:9></a> He is righteous.<a name=99:10></a> He has been revealed in His own nature too, as regards good and evil: abhorrent of evil and having His delight in what is pure and good, He is holy.<a name=99:11></a> Adam was innocent; he did not know good and evil till after he had eaten the forbidden fruit.<a name=99:12></a> Now we know good and evil, and if we are to be "after God" it must be more, far more, in nature than Adam's estate.<a name=99:13></a> It must be in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=99:14></a> The power of the divine word revealing God, as Christ as now sitting at the right hand of the majesty in the heavens has brought Him to light, and quickening us, gives the true character of holiness in which we are created after God.<a name=99:15></a> (Compare John 17: 17, 19.<a name=99:16></a>) God is known now not merely as a Creator who saw all as very good which had come out of His hands, but as one whose whole nature is revealed in the dealings and work of redemption, when evil and good are fully manifested, when evil is there and rife.<a name=99:17></a> But redemption, the <i>new</i> creation in which we are quickened out of our state of death in sin and raised as Christ out of His grave, has taken us completely out of that condition, and has made us, as so quickened, the living expression of the divine nature thus fully revealed.<a name=99:18></a> We are created again <i>after God</i>, in righteousness and true holiness.<a name=99:19></a> (Compare Colossians 3: 9-11.<a name=99:20></a>) What God is, in respect of good and evil, we are in nature as having put on the new man created again in Christ Jesus; and this, as we see in Colossians, connected with a true full knowledge of God as so revealed.<a name=99:21></a> We are partakers by a new creation of the divine nature as fully revealed in Christ.<a name=99:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such are the two great principles of the Christian's walk.<a name=100:11></a> He has put off the old man, the first Adam, with all its lusts and will, and put on the new man which, with the knowledge of God's estimate of righteousness and holiness, is created after God according to this righteousness and holiness; and the Holy Ghost is present with him and in him, and he is not to grieve Him.<a name=100:12></a> No word or temper unsuited to that holy guest who sheds abroad God's love in our hearts, and seals us for the day when all will be holy and blessed, is to find a place in our mouth or in our heart.<a name=100:13></a> In a word, the divine nature with its moral effect, and the presence of God in love, and the power of holy hope, form the Christian.<a name=100:14></a> We now get the measure of this.<a name=100:15></a> In the latter we already get the walking of love.<a name=100:16></a> Chapter 5 gives us the measure, if measure indeed we can call it.<a name=100:17></a>

		But there is another element in divine love in man, which has a very deep stamp of perfectness on it.<a name=101:7></a> I have said Christ is given as the model of the display of God's character in man, as naturally it must have been.<a name=101:8></a> It is said here, "And walk in love as Christ has loved us and given himself for us, a sacrifice and an offering to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=101:9></a>" Perfect love was here shewn in giving up Himself.<a name=101:10></a> So we are called to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, our intelligent service.<a name=101:11></a> Two principles characterise this perfectness.<a name=101:12></a> First, offering up himself.<a name=101:13></a> It is not loving my neighbour as myself -- a true and perfect principle where evil is not, a state which the law as such would produce if efficacious to do so -- but where evil, moral or external, or sorrow requires it, wholly giving up offering up oneself.<a name=101:14></a> This Christ did.<a name=101:15></a> He offered up Himself, perfect in love.<a name=101:16></a> Our path is to follow Him in this.<a name=101:17></a> As in 1 John 3, "Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=101:18></a>" The second seal of perfectness is that it was an offering to <i>God</i>.<a name=101:19></a> The object and motive were perfect.<a name=101:20></a> If He had only given Himself for us, there might have been touching generosity, nobleness of character; but the object which formed the motive was inadequate to give perfection to the act, take men as good, or simply evil; for it was love in a man and had a motive, though divine love; and it is in that He is a model to us.<a name=101:21></a> But He offers Himself to God, though for us.<a name=101:22></a> Here our worthlessness only adds to the proof of the perfectness.<a name=101:23></a> But the offering being to God the motive was adequate -- the act of love perfect.<a name=101:24></a> Hence, too, we are called to add to brotherly kindness charity or love, which, we are told, is the bond of perfectness.<a name=101:25></a> Absolute, sovereign love is where there is no motive in the object.<a name=101:26></a> This we have seen in the last verse of chapter 4 and in Colossians.<a name=101:27></a> And this we are called to imitate as concerns our matters, that is, when any wrong is done to us.<a name=101:28></a> But when it is love with an object or motive in a man, when the motive gives its true character, then to be morally perfect, self must be given up to God.<a name=101:29></a> In us it may have been an evil self.<a name=101:30></a> But whatever it may be, it is given up, and, in our own case, the body presented a living sacrifice.<a name=101:31></a>

		ACTS 20: 28
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the translation of the Greek in Acts 20: 28 ("with his own blood," A.<a name=105:1></a>V.<a name=105:2></a>), I have not much to say.<a name=105:3></a> As to the fear of its touching the divinity of Christ, a person must be very ill-grounded in that fundamental truth to have any such feeling; the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Christ, His being truly God, Jehovah, I AM, is too inseparably a part of the whole texture of Scripture, too plainly stated in Scripture, and still more strongly proved, if possible, by the way it is supposed or assumed and implied in passages where it is no direct subject of revelation.<a name=105:4></a> Nothing could be more mischievous than the resting the divinity of the Lord Christ on this passage -- a passage tortured by critics, no two of whom hardly can agree upon it.<a name=105:5></a> With the exception of Scholz, hardly any noted critic has simply 'God' in the passage at all.<a name=105:6></a> Indeed, as far as I know Mill is the only one; the principal ones have not 'God' at all, reading 'Lord' instead.<a name=105:7></a> Griesbach, Lachmann, Tischendorf, all read 'the Church of the Lord' -- Matthaei, 'Lord and God,' which Middleton approves, and Alford and others of more weight than he reject as perfectly untenable.<a name=105:8></a> Alford read 'Lord' in his first edition; and saying?<a name=105:9></a> that as B in the Vatican has it by the first hand, the evidence of manuscripts is balanced; but on internal evidence he reads '<i>God</i>' in the second.<a name=105:10></a> To me it remains uncertain if it be by the first hand, for the transcript of the MS is not to be trusted.<a name=105:11></a> Wetstein prefers '<i>Lord</i>.<a name=105:12></a>' The new Codex Sinaiticus reads '<i>God</i>' But A C D E and many others read '<i>Lord</i>.<a name=105:13></a>' Many more, but modern read '<i>Lord and God</i>.<a name=105:14></a>' It would be monstrous to rest a vital doctrine on a text evidently tampered with.<a name=105:15></a> Even in Athanasius to Seraphion (1: 522), the printed text has 'God,' but other MSS '<i>Lord</i>' or '<i>Christ</i>.<a name=105:16></a>' I suppose we may account Athanasius as a sufficient champion of the true divinity of the blessed Lord.<a name=105:17></a> Of all ancient writers he is known to be the undaunted and suffering defender of this truth against the whole body of Arians, the Emperor and all, and died an exile for this truth.<a name=105:18></a> Now, not only in the passage quoted by critics he declares that the blood of God is never used by itself, and that it is Arianism; but the argument of his two books against the Apollinarians, particularly the second book, is based on this.<a name=105:19></a> It forms, I may say, the whole point and subject of the second.<a name=105:20></a> He denounces as Arian such language as saying, 'God suffered,' or speaking of His blood flowing.<a name=105:21></a> He treats it as the madness of the Arians.<a name=105:22></a> He says that 'if it be said that God suffered, "in flesh" even, then the Father and the Comforter have suffered, for they are all one'; and concludes, 'The Word is God, if you look at His immortality <i>(athanasia)</i> and incorruptibility and immutability; but man, in His nailing to the cross, and the flowing of His blood, and the burial of His body, and descent into Hades and resurrection from the dead.<a name=105:23></a> Thus the Christ is raised from the dead, and being God raises the dead.<a name=105:24></a>' He says we are to be content to say, 'Christ has suffered for us in the flesh.<a name=105:25></a>' I cannot quote more here: it is, as I have said, the argument of the whole second book.<a name=105:26></a> The reader may find a multitude of the Fathers also object to the expression too.<a name=105:27></a> They may be found in notes to critical editions.<a name=105:28></a> Wetstein gives many of them.<a name=105:29></a> At any rate, speaking of the sufferings of God or His blood-shedding is denounced as being Arianism by him, who best knew what Arianism was, and the greatest champion for the blessed truth of Christ's divinity who ever lived.<a name=105:30></a> The Arians and Apollinarians did so speak; because the Arians did not hold that Christ was of one nature with the Father, and the Apollinarians held that Christ had no human, intellectual soul, but that the divinity took its place in the Christ.<a name=105:31></a> Hence, the former had no difficulty that what was a creature, however elevated, suffered; and the latter must have made God suffer as the mind in Christ, or else He must have ceased to be.<a name=105:32></a> Hence, Athanasius opposed them so energetically, and said it was running into Arianism; and hence we can easily see how he rejected an expression such as the one we are considering.<a name=105:33></a> Now I admit it was reasoning, not criticism.<a name=105:34></a> If I found it in Scripture, I should certainly not mind Athanasius, but take it as what is called <i>koinonia idiomaton</i>, dangerous and slippery as that ground is, if it ever be justified as to the natures of the Lord.<a name=105:35></a> I read, "the Son of man who is in heaven"; but that by His Person passes into His divine nature.<a name=105:36></a> But I do not believe the natures are so spoken of.<a name=105:37></a> They are not to be confounded any more than the Person divided.<a name=105:38></a> I do not want to speculate on such subjects.<a name=105:39></a> I only say this to express my subjection to scripture language, if such there be.<a name=105:40></a> But it is ridiculous to make a matter of orthodoxy, as a fundamental proof of Christ's divinity, what Athanasius denounces as denying that divinity, and being Arianism.<a name=105:41></a>

		Now for my own part I believe -- have always thought -- the reading 'the church of God' to be right.<a name=107:1></a> If <i>dia tou idiou haimatos</i> was the reading in this place, then "the church of God which He hath purchased with His own blood" would be the only right translation; and so the English translators read it.<a name=107:2></a> But I confess I agree with Athanasius that such language is not according to Scripture analogy and its expression of the truth.<a name=107:3></a> It is not a question of the divinity of the Lord, one way or the other, but of the fitness of speaking of the blood of God.<a name=107:4></a> I do not think such an expression scriptural.<a name=107:5></a> I do not accept the title even of the Mother of God.<a name=107:6></a> I believe it revolts just and divinely-given thoughts in the mind, and turns away from the true, eternal divinity of the blessed Lord.<a name=107:7></a> He who was God had a mother, and He who was God shed His blood; but I do not think Scripture speaks of God's shedding His blood.<a name=107:8></a> I think it revolts the mind as wrong, unseemly -- I will say, profane.<a name=107:9></a> I know what a person means and I bear with it, because I delight in his holding the true, essential deity of the Lord.<a name=107:10></a> But I agreed with Athanasius, when I had never read him, when I examined the passage in this view, in thinking such expressions contrary to the analogy of the faith.<a name=107:11></a> As regards the translation of '<i>dia tou haimatos tou idiou' "by</i> the blood of His own," that it is Greek is I judge beyond controversy, in spite of the confident pretensions of some, and the slighting remarks of others.<a name=107:12></a> In John 15: 19, we have this usage, which anyone may find in a dictionary.<a name=107:13></a> "If ye were of the world, the world would love its own" -- '<i>to idion ephilei</i>.<a name=107:14></a>' It is an unquestionable Greek usage.<a name=107:15></a> Of course, it can be translated, "by His own blood.<a name=107:16></a>" The question is, which is right.<a name=107:17></a> 'To <i>idion</i>' is that which is specially near and identified with any one, as our word, "own.<a name=107:18></a>" Hence it is said, "He spared not his own Son.<a name=107:19></a>" God has purchased the church with that which was His own, nearest and dearest to Himself: a thought as apt and beautiful as possible here.<a name=107:20></a> Of that there can be no question.<a name=107:21></a> The singular seems to me more intimate than the plural, but I could not here give any proof that I am right.<a name=107:22></a> At all events, no expression would be more appropriate, hardly any, it seems to me, so strong.<a name=107:23></a> God purchased the Church with that which was most near to Himself and most dear to Himself.<a name=107:24></a> This seems to me a most forcible expression, peculiarly expressive in the circumstances -- more so, it seems to me, than that which would have expressed the relationship of the blessed Lord to His Father, whatever the essential importance of that may be in its place.<a name=107:25></a> The force of the sentence is in the word '<i>idion</i>' (English <i>own</i>), which is to me a deeply touching expression.<a name=107:26></a>

		Since I translated the passage, I have found the first biblical scholars, dead and living, discussing this translation without the smallest idea of its not being sound Greek.<a name=108:1></a> Doederlein proposed it.<a name=108:2></a> Michaelis suggests this rendering.<a name=108:3></a> Meyer says the text was changed from '<i>tou haimatos tou idiou</i>' to '<i>tou idiou haimatos</i>' because the latter, which is admitted not to be the true reading, obliged men to translate it, 'the blood of God': allowing this, that with the true reading it is not necessary to do so.<a name=108:4></a> The only other translation is the one I have given.<a name=108:5></a> I am thoroughly satisfied that all the tampering with the text, which for so short a passage is almost unexampled, arose from not simply taking it as I have done.<a name=108:6></a> For my own part I think that '<i>tou haimatos tou idiou</i>' applied to God, is unnatural and objectionable.<a name=108:7></a> This use of 'idios' after a substantive is rare in the New Testament, just because it has a contrasting and emphatic force.<a name=108:8></a> When it is used with 'haima' elsewhere, it is put before.<a name=108:9></a> Hebrews 9: 12; chapter 13: 12.<a name=108:10></a> When 'idios' <i>is</i> put after, it is contrast or special emphasis.<a name=108:11></a> Of Christ it is said (Mark 15: 20), they took the purple off Him, and put on Him His own clothes ('<i>ta himatia ta idia')</i>.<a name=108:12></a> Judas went '<i>eis ton topon ton idion' -- "to</i> his own place," not meaning that which was naturally his, but as could be said really of no other man, one appropriate to himself.<a name=108:13></a> Any man may go <i>to his place (eis ton idion topon)</i> but 'eis <i>ton topon ton idion</i>' raises the question, why is it so peculiarly his own?<a name=108:14></a> It is to that place which was peculiarly his own.<a name=108:15></a> So He spared not His own Son '<i>tou idiou huiou</i>,' not '<i>tou huiou tou idiou</i>,' 2 Timothy 4: 3: their own lusts '<i>tas epithumias tas idias</i>,' their own proper lusts in contrast with God's will, which they ought to have done.<a name=108:16></a> When it is simply the fact, it is (James 1: 14) "his own lust" <i>(tes idias epithumias).<a name=108:17></a> I</i> have given all the cases, I believe, in the New Testament of this emphatic use.<a name=108:18></a> It is the general force of an adjective so placed after with an article.<a name=108:19></a> Now I confess this seems to me to make it singularly inapposite to be applied to the blood of God, that blood which was peculiarly God's own in contrast with all other.<a name=108:20></a> I would not fail in reverence in speaking on such things, but it does seem to me that such a contrasted use of God's blood as distinguished from all other is irreverent and somewhat shocking.<a name=108:21></a> The question is not on the divinity of the Lord, I repeat.<a name=108:22></a> Athanasius even charges such kind of language with being Arian.<a name=108:23></a> It is whether we are authorised (again I dread irreverence, but it is not mine but theirs who would insist on it) to speak of God's own blood as God, for that would be the proper force of it.<a name=108:24></a>

		After the character of those who were suited to the kingdom had been unfolded, the divinity of His Person and character of His ministry are brought before us.<a name=122:3></a> His disciples are then sent out with the ministry of the kingdom to the Jews, at least the poor of His flock, in His lifetime, and then till He came as Son of man.<a name=122:4></a> Then we have the record of the rejection of John the Baptist's ministry, and that of His own, as come in grace: and standing on the edge, so to speak, of the world, He is witness that no dealings of God could reach where His grace found, like Noah's dove, no place there for the sole of her foot; and declares that the world has been tried, and He could find no entrance for divine goodness, and they must come to Him if they would know the Father, and have rest (for the Son revealed Him in grace), and learn of Him as the man meek and lowly of heart, and find rest to their souls in a world where evil ruled, and no rest could be found, as He knew.<a name=122:5></a>

		THE "IFS" OF SCRIPTURE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of God always maintains the responsibility of man; indeed it must, for no morally intelligent creature can be other than responsible.<a name=126:1></a> Grace and redemption may introduce principles and facts which modify the operation of the principle, but the principle remains true.<a name=126:2></a> But I think that the word casts a more definite light on the place responsibility holds in connection with the grace that is revealed in Christ, than many are aware of.<a name=126:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would lay down a principle evident to every one, and incontestable in human relationships, but forgotten in divine ones (and with one only exception not based on relationship, which I will state in its place), that as a general principle, responsibility is based on, and measured by, the relationships in which we are.<a name=126:4></a> Parent and child, husband and wife, master and servant -- evidently in all these the responsibility is based on, and measured by, the relationship.<a name=126:5></a> The one exception is where God, or one having competent authority in the case, claims the recognition of another in any given position or authority.<a name=126:6></a> Thus, if Christ, Moses, or a prophet be sent, adequate testimony being given, we are bound to receive them.<a name=126:7></a> The mission is, in fact, an instituted relationship.<a name=126:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now our original responsibility is no longer a question for those who know the truth.<a name=126:9></a> It is no longer, "if thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?<a name=126:10></a>" -- always abtractedly true; we have sinned, and on that ground are guilty and lost.<a name=126:11></a> But the great truth of Christ and redemption has come in.<a name=126:12></a> If I call myself a Christian, I place myself on this ground -- the ground of redemption.<a name=126:13></a> The question is, to put responsibility in its place, where this is owned.<a name=126:14></a> Now redemption is a work of God, and not responsibility on our part.<a name=126:15></a> Yet they are constantly mixed up together, and uncertainty introduced where all is perfect, and confusion where all is clear.<a name=126:16></a> But there are two things generally in the position of the Christian -- redemption wrought by grace for him, and his actual attainment of glory.<a name=126:17></a> Now "if" -- that is a <i>condition, is</i> never connected with redemption.<a name=126:18></a> It is always connected with our course towards the glory, and here it is of continual occurrence.<a name=126:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the purpose of God there is no variation or uncertainty.<a name=126:20></a> In His government He may set conditions, and in fact does so: it is connected with our conduct, but in purpose -- not so; and in redemption even, taken in its application to us there is no uncertainty.<a name=126:21></a> In Ephesians you have no "if": "We have redemption through his blood.<a name=126:22></a>" In Titus, it is "Not according to works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us.<a name=126:23></a>" "By grace ye are saved.<a name=126:24></a>" The value of Christ's work admits of no "if," nor its application even to every believer.<a name=126:25></a> "He hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, according to his own purpose and grace, given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began.<a name=126:26></a>"

		So in type Israel stands still, and sees the salvation of Jehovah, who led forth the people He had redeemed, and guided them by His strength to His holy habitation.<a name=127:1></a> And again, "Ye have seen .<a name=127:2></a>.<a name=127:3></a>.<a name=127:4></a> how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.<a name=127:5></a>" The whole was absolute and complete redemption.<a name=127:6></a> So we have no more conscience of sins, but are accepted in the Beloved.<a name=127:7></a> He hath by one offering perfected for ever those that are sanctified.<a name=127:8></a> Here it is the application to conscience.<a name=127:9></a> But not only is a full title made in righteousness, not only are the sins blotted out, and we are justified from all things, accepted in the Beloved, and our consciences purged, but we are made meet [fit] to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name=127:10></a> Nothing lacks in completeness.<a name=127:11></a> Hence the thief could go straight to paradise, fit, through the travail of His soul, to be Christ's companion there.<a name=127:12></a> Yet ordinarily we are left to tread longer or shorter time our pilgrimage here.<a name=127:13></a>

		Now this, as in Deuteronomy 8, is to humble us, and prove us, and know what is in our hearts.<a name=127:14></a> We enter on it on the ground of redemption.<a name=127:15></a> All Christendom stands on this ground, may little realise its value, but it is Christendom because redemption is accomplished.<a name=127:16></a> The first thing tested is -- is it realised?<a name=127:17></a> Are we really so?<a name=127:18></a> If not, we perish in the wilderness in unbelief.<a name=127:19></a> On this point I do not enter.<a name=127:20></a> But the question remains then -- Shall I arrive safe in Canaan?<a name=127:21></a> for we are not yet there.<a name=127:22></a> And here come in all the "ifs": if I hold fast the beginning of my confidence firm to the end: if ye continue in the faith, and the like.<a name=127:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe there is a full answer given to what is in question, practically realised, in Philippians 2 and 3; in others it is doctrinally set forth.<a name=127:24></a> But the answer is not redemption -- a finished work.<a name=127:25></a> This is the basis of all, and if one imbued with the mind of God had seen one drop of blood sprinkled on a door-post, he might have been certain on to Solomon's, and yet far better, Christ's millennial glory, but it was not accomplished, and God teaches us by what is revealed, whether historically as to His ways, or prophetically in His word, as to things to come, and all His counsels given us in the New Testament.<a name=127:26></a>

		But the wilderness was not redemption, and God would have us to look at redemption as complete.<a name=128:1></a> He suffered, the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God.<a name=128:2></a> We are complete in Him (Christ).<a name=128:3></a> But, as I said, whatever exercise of conscience we may have had before knowing the value of the blood of Christ, or what the lingerings of unbelief cradled by self to make out our own righteousness, it is usual in God's ways to have a practical wilderness course after redemption, when the knowledge of ourselves, and of God and His ways in grace and government, are developed, to humble us, and to prove us, and to do us good in our latter end.<a name=128:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to see what we have to lean on at the end, we are brought back to the beginning, though one who has walked faithfully with Christ will surely have a sweeter and deeper knowledge of Him who began and finished all.<a name=128:5></a> All Balaam can say is, when the question was, Could Israel enter into Canaan, I can do nothing.<a name=128:6></a> There is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel, as at this time it shall be said of Israel and Jacob, <i>What hath God wrought</i>?<a name=128:7></a> But meanwhile, between the two we are in weakness, and in temptation, and real perils.<a name=128:8></a> The flesh is in us, and what pleases it is there.<a name=128:9></a> Shall I arrive safe in Canaan?<a name=128:10></a> is <i>the</i> question.<a name=128:11></a> If I mix up this with redemption, all is confusion, all is uncertainty; for while it was said to be finished, and all our sins remembered no more, here all is in question again, and, imputed or not imputed, I lose heaven by sins which have been borne: if they have not been borne, then redemption is unfinished and incomplete.<a name=128:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the government of God, though in perfect love and grace -- "whom the Lord loves he chastens" -- yet has always a legal principle in it; that is, the ways of God depend on what we are, not in the perfectness of His love, but in His ways with us.<a name=128:13></a> Besides, the heart craves holiness, and knows God can bear with nothing else.<a name=128:14></a> We would not that He should.<a name=128:15></a> He makes us partakers -- blessed truth!<a name=128:16></a> -- of His holiness.<a name=128:17></a> Now the mass of Christendom are really unbelievers, and, like Israel, perish in the wilderness, never do get into Canaan.<a name=128:18></a> Those fear who are true of heart, and, if there is no distrust of grace, it is a salutary fear, lest any of them should seem to come short.<a name=128:19></a>

		There will be found in Numbers two great principles (found again in Hebrews) which characterise the position; the red heifer, practically answering to John 13, 1 John 2: 1, 2, but here known to believers for restoring communion after they have practically failed; and the priesthood: the former meeting a failure in the wilderness, the latter the sustaining power for weakness -- "grace to help in time of need.<a name=129:1></a>" In Numbers 19 we have the red heifer out of its place, say the wise rationalists, whereas the essence of its meaning depends on where it is.<a name=129:2></a> Then (chapter 20) Aaron dies, and after Sihon (Balaam, as we have seen), comes God's <i>judicial</i> estimate of His people.<a name=129:3></a> In Deuteronomy 9 we find His moral estimate -- <i>this</i>, What has Israel done?<a name=129:4></a> <i>that, "What</i> hath God wrought?<a name=129:5></a>" and the comparison is full of instruction.<a name=129:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The statement, "What hath God wrought?<a name=129:7></a>" is an accomplished thing -- it is wrought.<a name=129:8></a> Now in the wilderness, though redemption was the basis of all, an accomplished work was not what was wanting for the wilderness itself, but living care, guidance, ministry and constant need to be met; and this was what was found, and what we find in that of which this was only the type.<a name=129:9></a> They had to reach Canaan, as we have glory, and that where there are spiritual wickednesses on the way, in a wilderness where there is no way, nor bread, nor wine, and we ourselves without strength.<a name=129:10></a> And the dangers are real and present.<a name=129:11></a> It is not a full and finished salvation -- which, thank God, there is -- but daily dependence, and a living One who can sustain, guide, and protect us.<a name=129:12></a> God, that we may know ourselves and Him, puts us in this place of danger, real danger and difficulty, where by ourselves we could not get through, and gives us to find it out, but with the testing and trial, with the question, "If we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end": all these are most real, and forgiveness itself leaves all vague, but there is the infallible promise for faith to lean on, and divine support: "We are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto the salvation ready to be revealed.<a name=129:13></a>"

		The well-known passage (John 10) assures everything: "They shall never perish, neither shall any one pluck them out of my hand.<a name=129:14></a>" No perishing either; Christ is our life (no greater power to pluck us out), and that according to the divine power of the Father and the Son.<a name=129:15></a> So in 1 Corinthians 1: 8: "who shall confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus"; so "God is faithful by whom ye were called.<a name=129:16></a>" There is no uncertainty or doubt, then, in the wilderness; but the kind of certainty is different, and the difference practically important.<a name=129:17></a> Redemption is accomplished, and Christ our righteousness, according to all the value of what He has wrought for the glory of God.<a name=129:18></a> It is finished, perfect, and accepted of God.<a name=129:19></a> But in general the race is to be run, that we may win Christ, be found in Him; we have to hold fast to the end, that He may present us blameless, as in Jude.<a name=129:20></a>

		If we take the history of the garden of Eden as a whole, we shall see it is such a whole, and, in brief, a complete picture of the ways of God.<a name=131:1></a> Man placed under responsibility (and even under law failed and broke it) was sinful, and an actual sinner, and was driven out from the place of sojourn, where God visited him for fellowship.<a name=131:2></a> But God did not send him out to begin a new world away from Himself, without giving the fullest testimony to the sovereign grace that has met the evil.<a name=131:3></a> Man's nakedness was the expression of innocence being gone.<a name=131:4></a> Shame and guilt, and a guilty fear of God's presence, was now man's estate.<a name=131:5></a> God, in sovereign grace, met this.<a name=131:6></a> He clothed Adam with robes which came from death, and His eye had His own work before Him.<a name=131:7></a> That did not say man was not naked in himself, but that God Himself, having taken knowledge of it in grace, had covered his nakedness.<a name=131:8></a> The present state was perfectly provided for in full, and the power of evil judged in the future.<a name=131:9></a> Hereafter the power of the serpent's seed would be destroyed.<a name=131:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But man thus driven out from God, and innocence gone, began a new world, and the question necessarily arose, Can man have to say to God, and how?<a name=131:11></a> Now it is clear that if God wrought in man, He could not for a moment be indifferent to what had happened, and still clearer that God could not be indifferent to the state of evil which had brought man where he now was, and was expressed by what he was -- in sin and away from God.<a name=131:12></a> That which was the sad effect for man, God saw as the evil state <i>in</i> him.<a name=131:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The driving him out of paradise had placed man in a judicial way in this place, though not irrecoverably.<a name=131:14></a> He was in it morally, and the question arose: Could he approach God -- go to God?<a name=131:15></a> Now he could not really, while insensible to the state he had got into; he would be still as far from God as ever; and, in the public government and testimony of God, God could not give a testimony to His so receiving him: and this is the new platform of Cain and Abel -- approaching God when in a state which was the result of being driven out from His presence.<a name=131:16></a> Do we approach God as if nothing had happened, in connection with the everyday circumstances and duties of the place we have got into, or in the sense of the sinfulness of this state, the sense of our fall, and looking up to God in our consciences, as those who have got there by sin?<a name=131:17></a> Every Christian knows.<a name=131:18></a> And here note, it is not committed sin, but the consciousness of our true standing before God.<a name=131:19></a> Cain goes with the fruit of his toil (man had been sent forth to be a tiller of the ground) -- the actual practical state of man driven out.<a name=131:20></a> In Abel faith had its perceptions.<a name=131:21></a> Sin had come in and death by sin: faith recognised it.<a name=131:22></a> "So Christ appeared once in the consummation of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<a name=131:23></a>" This was not the clearing the individual's sins actually committed: they are spoken of immediately after as a distinct subject, adding judgment -- but, a judgment past for those who look for Him seeing He has borne their sins Himself, who becomes Himself the Judge; Hebrews 9: 26-28.<a name=131:24></a>

		We have four worlds, so to speak, in this aspect: the garden of Eden; a world no longer innocent, but departed from God and driven out, where sin reigns and Satan; a world in which Christ reigns and in righteousness; and the new heavens and the new earth, wherein <i>dwelleth</i> righteousness.<a name=132:1></a> We have an innocent world (now gone), tested without evil being it, by simple obedience.<a name=132:2></a> The final world as based in righteousness, which in its nature never changes, cannot change in its moral stability.<a name=132:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the moment sin had come in, and characterised the world and the state of man, the terms on which man could be with God must be altered, must be changed, because God could not change.<a name=132:4></a> That a holy God and a sinful creature should be on the same terms as an innocent one, could not be.<a name=132:5></a> Free and happy communion would be impossible: cry for mercy there might be -- challenge on what ground he was there; but no free intercourse.<a name=132:6></a> That God is love does not alter this.<a name=132:7></a> His love is a holy love and He is light, but "men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil," John 3: 19.<a name=132:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I admit and believe, that the free, sovereign self-originated love of God is the source of all our joys and hopes and blessings, eternal and infinite as they are.<a name=132:9></a> But God exercises that love by bringing in a Mediator in death: not here by blood-shedding to meet guilt, but in perfect self-surrender to God in that which was death, as such, and the fruit of sin.<a name=132:10></a> Fat (Genesis 4: 4) was forbidden as much as blood, but not offered as such for forgiveness, but for acceptance in another, who gave Himself wholly to God in death which had come in.<a name=132:11></a> And remark, this was that souls might approach to God: each came with his offering.<a name=132:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Cain came, as I have said, as if nothing had happened, so much so that he brought to God, as offering, what was the sign of the ruined state into which he had got, but which did not reckon it as ruin.<a name=133:1></a> There was no faith in it.<a name=133:2></a> In Abel's there was; he offered by faith, which recognised that death had come in, come in by sin, but that another had given Himself for him "an offering made by fire of a sweet savour": for there are two things -- "unto him that loveth us and washed us from our sins"; "Christ also hath loved us and hath given Himself for us to God" as an offering made by fire, "and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour" -- one to clear foregone sins; the other, the value and preciousness of the One in whom we are accepted -- "Accepted in the beloved.<a name=133:3></a>" Now this was a question of acceptance in coming.<a name=133:4></a> God did not accept Cain.<a name=133:5></a> He did accept Abel, but the witness was borne to his gifts.<a name=133:6></a> He was accepted, but God's testimony was to that which he brought -- the life of another in all its energies and perfectness given up to God in death.<a name=133:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing we have to remark here, it was not God setting forth anything to the sinner.<a name=133:8></a> That was "a mercy-seat through faith in His blood.<a name=133:9></a>" It was Abel presenting himself to God, but coming by the acceptance and perfectness of another, who had given his life for him.<a name=133:10></a> And this is propitiation.<a name=133:11></a> Now to say that God could receive a sinner as He received an innocent person is to say that God is indifferent to good and evil.<a name=133:12></a> And note here, it was not by the eye of God resting on an inward change that a difference was made: there was such a change, for faith was working in Abel's heart; but it was a judicial estimate on the part of God of the gifts he brought -- Christ, Christ offered in sacrifice -- and for this we have the express authority of the Hebrews.<a name=133:13></a> It was a propitiatory sacrifice -- a ground of acceptance, or the whole basis of the standing of a fallen world is gone -- the whole moral basis of the preference of Abel to Cain is gone.<a name=133:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That love may have been there, nay, if you please, electing love, I admit, but the ground of acceptance, as stated in scripture (see Hebrews 11), is gone if propitiatory sacrifice be not accepted: and to win secure righteousness before God, and for the believer's acceptance, according to the value that is in Christ, He offered Himself absolutely without spot for God's glory.<a name=133:15></a> "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=133:16></a> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.<a name=133:17></a>" Faith <i>believed in it</i> then and found its fruit.<a name=133:18></a> Abel was accepted, and distinctively on the ground of what he brought -- his gifts: Cain brought no such offerings, he had to be accepted in himself only, and he was not.<a name=133:19></a> Faith looks to this sacrifice, and comes by it now, and finds acceptance and blessing according to the value of Christ in the eyes of God.<a name=133:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=134>[Page 134]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only add, now, that God gave Christ to us to this end.<a name=134:1></a> He "sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<a name=134:2></a>" The self-originating work of love is in it, but the effectual work of suffering is to make good in righteousness that love.<a name=134:3></a> God forbid that I should weaken the feeblest confidence in the Father's love.<a name=134:4></a> "He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him," "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.<a name=134:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is certain, then, that Abel, man being fallen, sought God's face and acceptance, by a sacrifice, to the value of which God bore testimony: "By which he obtained witness that he was righteous"; a sacrifice which recognised death as come in, but which, as so presented, bore the character of perfect self-offering to God's glory.<a name=134:6></a> It was not actual sins which were in question, but the state of man and his acceptance upon the ground of mediatorial death, in which God's own glory alone was sought on man's part in obedience, and in which the highest gift of grace shone out on God's part in love.<a name=134:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I add, here, as it immediately connects itself with our subject, there is another point, less abstract, narrower possibly in effect, but dealing more immediately with conscience, and hence of present necessity.<a name=134:8></a> If a man believes in heart, that is as convinced of guilt, in the Lord Jesus Christ, he will not come into judgment, he knows he is justified, forgiven, has peace with God, and so rejoices in the hope of the glory, and trusts God for the road on to the end.<a name=134:9></a> "Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity" -- not that he has not done any, but it has been dealt with, borne by another.<a name=134:10></a> Another has been substituted in his place by grace, who has taken charge of it in Himself -- "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name=134:11></a>" It is not here the basis on which the race is before God, as in Abel's case, and which, as a general principle, recognises the whole truth, but actual sins committed, which are dealt with and put away out of God's sight by One "who was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed," Isaiah 53: 5.<a name=134:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=135>[Page 135]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this, call it by any word you please, was one person put in the place of another, and then in such sort taking the sins and their consequences on Himself as that they should not come at all upon the person who was himself guilty, in judgment or penal consequences.<a name=135:1></a> Upon all who are not under this substitutionary benefit they do come, and God enters into judgment with them concerning them.<a name=135:2></a> For the believer it is said, "according to this time," not, what have men wrought, but "what hath God wrought," Numbers 23: 21-23.<a name=135:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, substitution is as certain a truth as scripture can afford, that is, one person standing in another's place, bearing his sins in His own body on the tree, bruised for them instead of the guilty, who is healed by the other taking the stripes, for "All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all," Isaiah 53: 6.<a name=135:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The ways in which the gospel may be preached and reach the heart are so many, that one has to look to the Lord to direct one, that it may be brought so as to comfort the saint and awaken the sinner.<a name=136:1></a> The moment the word is revealed to the soul in grace, the point is gained.<a name=136:2></a> There may be a thousand thoughts on men's minds, but there is enough in this blessed word to meet these thoughts, and to bring every one of them into captivity to the obedience of Christ.<a name=136:3></a> He is the Lord of all; and in His Person all truth centres.<a name=136:4></a> He is the substance of all truth -- the ground and centre of truth to the soul.<a name=136:5></a> As we know Him, we get comfort, peace, and joy; as we walk with Him we have power to overcome.<a name=136:6></a> In verse 5 we have Christ presented in a threefold character.<a name=136:7></a> He is the one most drawn out by the Spirit of God.<a name=136:8></a> Alas!<a name=136:9></a> it is not always so drawn out in our heart.<a name=136:10></a> The answering character to that in the spirit of grace is, "To him that loveth us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.<a name=136:11></a>" In verse 7 is an application to the world -- it will be a day of mourning to them.<a name=136:12></a> The Jews behold Him whom they have pierced, and the nations wail because of Him.<a name=136:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us especially consider the way in which Christ is presented to the soul.<a name=136:14></a> First, we have grace and peace in a peculiar form from God, that is, Jehovah; and the seven spirits, His spiritual perfectness, not the Father speaking to His children, buy the Eternal, and the seven spirits, the Holy Ghost exercising the varied power of the throne.<a name=136:15></a> Christ is brought near as connected with the earth; the faithful Witness when He was here below.<a name=136:16></a> This is what our souls need to remember -- faithful testimony to what God is; for without this we have no certainty, whether as saints or sinners.<a name=136:17></a> A holy man cannot know God without the witness, nor whether the witness would suffice to meet a holy God.<a name=136:18></a> When I know God, I get sure ground to go upon, I shall know where I am -- a terrible thing if I am walking in sin; but there is only uncertainty out of Christ, for He is the light.<a name=136:19></a>

		There are sufficient traces of power in creation to serve as a witness of the eternal power and Godhead -- enough of misery around us to see ruin -- enough in conscience to learn that we have sinned; but we cannot learn God in providence, for we know not why He does this, or refrains from doing that.<a name=137:1></a> Providence is a depth out of our reach; we are not able to find out and judge the ways of God, nor indeed of the thoughts of a man's mind very often.<a name=137:2></a> There is another, the law, which appears to be a clear witness for God against sin.<a name=137:3></a> It is true that this is a witness of God's claim on man.<a name=137:4></a> We ought to love God with all our hearts, mind, and strength, and our neighbour as ourselves, but it reveals nothing of God's thoughts to us, and if this were the only witness, we should be ruined for ever.<a name=137:5></a> The object of the law is not love, but righteousness -- God's everlasting claim of righteousness.<a name=137:6></a> But the law cannot meet what we want, for it says, "Thou shalt not covet," and there was never a man since the days of Adam that did not covet.<a name=137:7></a> If you do not satisfy God's claims, there is a curse upon you.<a name=137:8></a> Thus the law is man's letter of death.<a name=137:9></a> We turn to Christ, the faithful Witness, "the same yesterday, today and for ever" -- the Witness down here amid the same circumstances in which we are placed, and dealing with men in all the feelings of life.<a name=137:10></a>

		We are by nature under Satan's power the end of which is death; but the Lord Jesus overcame through death him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and through this I have not only victory over Satan in Christ, but I may say all things are mine, whether life or death, etc.<a name=140:1></a> Satan could not deal with the heirs of salvation, unless he had foiled the Captain, and Jesus submitted Himself to the power of Satan, but in the resurrection that power was broken for ever.<a name=140:2></a> Liberty and joy are ours; not freedom from conflict, but deliverance from Satan.<a name=140:3></a> Now the way that Satan gets power over us is by his wiles, persuading us to receive him as a friend, instead of treating him as a fiend -- "Resist the devil, and he shall flee from you.<a name=140:4></a>" It is not said, Overcome him, for this Jesus did before.<a name=140:5></a>

		CHAPTER 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two points I desire to notice in this chapter in connection with the perfect peace of the soul which belongs to the redeemed, and the consequent spirit and character of their worship.<a name=166:26></a> The subject matter of this book consists of judgment, for, with the exception of the church in bliss, the character of all is judgment.<a name=166:27></a> God is sitting on a throne, and His throne is not in the character of grace, but in that of Sinai.<a name=166:28></a> Not that the throne will be on the earth, but that the judgments, the lightnings and thunderings, which are coming on the earth, will issue from this throne.<a name=166:29></a> In this introductory chapter (which it is as to the earth) we have God in the character of Lord God Almighty, and not in the character of Father; but the names given in the Old Testament -- Jehovah, Lord God Almighty -- are in connection with His power which will be put forth in the coming judgments.<a name=166:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what shews out the perfect peace to which we as believers are brought, is seeing the twenty-four elders sitting on thrones round about the throne, whence those judgments are issuing, in perfect peace.<a name=167:1></a> They are close to the throne, round about the throne from whence all flow, and yet they are not at all alarmed -- no disturbance, no trembling -- because associated with the very throne from which all the judgments come.<a name=167:2></a> Then mark another thing.<a name=167:3></a> They are sitting, not even here seen standing, but sitting in perfect peace, like David, who went in and sat before the Lord.<a name=167:4></a> They worship, it is true, and fall down, which is a much higher thing than sitting.<a name=167:5></a> But how thoroughly this scene shews into what a place of perfect peace we are brought, that, when the judgments break forth, there is nothing in them to alarm us.<a name=167:6></a> They were seen sitting in perfect peace, and this is our place; so that however we may be tried down here in the world, when we come before God we can and ought to sit in peace, and rest there.<a name=167:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing.<a name=167:8></a> When the character of God is opened out in the threefold ascriptions of "Holy, holy, holy," does this disturb them?<a name=167:9></a> No.<a name=167:10></a> So with us, when the full character of God's holiness is seen in His justice, making good His holiness.<a name=167:11></a> If in the presence of this holiness I thought there was a spot on me, I could not be at peace before Him.<a name=167:12></a> What a blessing to have our home and place of rest where the thrice holy God is!<a name=167:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When they hear, "Holy, holy; holy, Lord God Almighty," their affections move them, and they fall down immediately in worship.<a name=167:14></a> While the judgments move them not the least, their affections take them off their thrones in their falling down to worship.<a name=167:15></a> It is the effect of being in perfect undisturbed peace that their affections find utterance in praise.<a name=167:16></a> They lay their crowns at His feet, attributing all to Him.<a name=167:17></a> They fall on their faces; this is a deeper thing than even sitting in peace before Him.<a name=167:18></a> "Thou art worthy .<a name=167:19></a>.<a name=167:20></a>.<a name=167:21></a> <i>for</i> thou hast created all things," etc.<a name=167:22></a> This is intelligent worship; they know why He is worthy -- they know it for themselves (as in chapter <i>5)</i>, for He bought them to God by His blood.<a name=167:23></a>

		There was no terror awakened in them when the thunderings and lightnings were going on; no, nor when the character of a thrice holy God is opened out: but when the glory is spoken of they worship.<a name=168:1></a> If there is fear, there can be no worship.<a name=168:2></a> "Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness.<a name=168:3></a>" But grace has set us in the place of worship by the power of the Holy Ghost: being made kings and priests unto God and His Father, we can worship Him.<a name=168:4></a> We are not in the glory yet, but may we grow in the sense of what He is, and worship Him who is worthy to be glorified.<a name=168:5></a>

		This is God's claim as Creator; chapter 5 is the Lamb's title in redemption, leading to worship.<a name=168:6></a> The kings and priests in chapter 5 include more than the church.<a name=168:7></a> They have a royal, a priestly character, being more than the bride.<a name=168:8></a> The bride restrictively, does not come in until chapter 19.<a name=168:9></a> The subject of the whole book of Revelation is the throne preparing the world for the kingdom; but the kingdom is not ready without the bride, and therefore she is mentioned before the close of the book.<a name=168:10></a>

		CHAPTER 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fourth and fifth chapters of this book help us to understand the present heavenly character and position of the saints, being descriptive of their actual position during the time of the judgments being poured out.<a name=169:1></a> The church is not actually seen as such, until she appears as the bride at the close of the book.<a name=169:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The proper subject of this book is not grace, but judgment; though, no doubt, the patience of God in executing judgment is grace.<a name=169:3></a> But the book is one of judgment, even as regards the churches; for the Son of man is seen walking among them, taking notice of their conduct.<a name=169:4></a> Having gone through the professing body, judging its ways and its works (while those who overcome have their portion in blessing) He spues its last state out of His mouth; and then He enters on the judgments which befall the world.<a name=169:5></a> Before entering on the detail of these judgments, He gives a preliminary view of the position of the saints, as we have it in this and the next chapters.<a name=169:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three subjects distinctly marked in the first chapter as comprised in this book.<a name=169:7></a> First, the glory and the manifestation of Christ Himself, the things seen; second, the churches, "The things which are"; third, the things hereafter, or "after these," that is, the things which do not belong to the position of the church in its testimony down here as a corporate body, but after it is as such spued out of Christ's mouth.<a name=169:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, then, what is seen is the glory of Christ; secondly, "The things which are.<a name=169:9></a>" The only question that can arise is as to the force and bearing of the expression "things which are.<a name=169:10></a>" They are looked at as the condition of the church as a whole (not merely local churches).<a name=169:11></a> Thyatira was told to "hold fast till I come"; and to Philadelphia He says, "I will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world"; clearly shewing it was not any mere local body that was addressed.<a name=169:12></a> We get in these instances the clearest intimation of its being the general aspect of the whole church looked at in the character of judgment, from the time of its leaving its first love, until it is entirely given up.<a name=169:13></a> The thing Christ is dealing with is the church, until an entirely new dispensation commences.<a name=169:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another characteristic there is, as connected with "the things which are," the church is a witness for God.<a name=169:15></a> In the first church we see this ceased to be the case; and at the close of all, when it has entirely lost its character as such, Christ Himself, in the fullest and completest sense, presents Himself to take the inheritance, and takes up the character which <i>it</i> should have maintained, namely, the "Amen, the faithful and true witness.<a name=169:16></a>" Then, as having taken up this character, He assumes the government of this world again; and that is quite a different thing from His walking amongst the churches in His judicial character upon earth, passing judgment upon those things that should have been a faithful witness of Him.<a name=169:17></a> Then the prophet sees Him in heaven, having done with the church upon the earth.<a name=169:18></a> He is not seen there as the Head of the body, but as the "Lamb that has been slain": the One rejected upon earth is upon the throne in heaven, from whence the judgments are to proceed.<a name=169:19></a> This is a most solemn moment.<a name=169:20></a> We see how the world is all going on under God's eye, and with what patience He has been bearing with it.<a name=169:21></a>

		In regard to God's dealings with man, as man, after his fall, there have been, to speak generally, three great epochs: first, the period before Christ came; secondly, the present interval; thirdly, after He comes again.<a name=170:1></a> In one sense there were many epochs during the time He was trying man with constant and unwearied patience, to see if good could be got from him, before Christ was rejected.<a name=170:2></a> He knew full well what would be the result, but He was putting man to the test.<a name=170:3></a> He planted a vineyard: it brought forth wild grapes, the hedge was broken down, and a wild boar out of the forest devoured it; and at last He said, "I have yet one Son, they will reverence Him; but they said, This is the heir, come let us kill him.<a name=170:4></a>" Then the world was in a certain sense judged -- not the judgment executed, but probation was ended.<a name=170:5></a> Satan, the prince of this world, is cast out.<a name=170:6></a> This took place when the true and rightful Prince, the Son of Him who owned the vineyard, was rejected.<a name=170:7></a> The world was then judged as to its character and ways.<a name=170:8></a> It is under condemnation, and therefore we are exhorted not to be conformed to this world.<a name=170:9></a> The plainest testimony is thus given against it morally.<a name=170:10></a> "The fashion of this world passeth away.<a name=170:11></a>" "If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<a name=170:12></a>" "The friendship of this world is enmity with God.<a name=170:13></a>" Having rejected His Son, the sentence of rejection is passed on it by God.<a name=170:14></a> The Son leaves it, and it would see Him no more.<a name=170:15></a> Satan is proved to be the prince of it.<a name=170:16></a> The Holy Ghost comes to convict it of sin, because of unbelief; of righteousness, because Christ had left it to go to the Father; of judgment, because the testimony of judgment on the prince of this world is passed.<a name=170:17></a> The world is convicted of righteousness by these two things -- the Son of God being rejected and ascended to the right hand of the Father, and the world seeing Him no more.<a name=170:18></a> And the Holy Ghost is given to the church, the vessel to contain the witness of the glorified Man till His coming again.<a name=170:19></a> The saints are gathered by the Holy Ghost, out of the world, to go forth to meet the Bridegroom.<a name=170:20></a>

		What peace there is to our souls in seeing Christ's power over all creation, in connection with Satan's power being all broken!<a name=171:1></a> In the new age this will be fully manifested; and the working of miracles by the disciples was a sign of that energy and power of the Son of man which will be known in the world yet to come.<a name=171:2></a> "Behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice that your names are written in heaven.<a name=171:3></a>"

		The earth then was set aside when the rejected Man took His place in heaven.<a name=171:4></a> The Jews were the immediate instruments of His rejection; but man, the first Adam, was utterly set aside through this act; and the Jew was to be brought to see that in the flesh dwelleth no good thing, and that heavenly grace was entirely in connection with the new Man.<a name=171:5></a> He is gone into heaven, that "He might fill all things.<a name=171:6></a>" He came down in grace as the last Adam, that He might bring in glory; and thus when the church is being formed, we get this double character: the heavenly Man taking His proper place in heaven, the earthly man judged.<a name=171:7></a> It is henceforth all new.<a name=171:8></a> "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.<a name=171:9></a>" We know not Christ any more "after the flesh.<a name=171:10></a>" It is as Head of the new creation that we are united to Him.<a name=171:11></a> "The first man was of the earth, earthy; the second man, the Lord from heaven.<a name=171:12></a>" The second Man has ascended; "but in that he ascended, he descended first into the lower parts of the earth.<a name=171:13></a>" He has ascended as the second Man to take His glory with the Father.<a name=171:14></a> As the result of all this, the church is looked upon as dead and risen with Christ -- "sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=171:15></a>" The new character for those who thus belong to Him is to manifest this heavenly Man by the power of the Holy Ghost down here; and thus the church becomes the living witness of Christ's rejection on earth and acceptance in heaven.<a name=171:16></a>

		Having disposed of "things that are," we now see that in order to be associated with God's thoughts and God's ways, the prophet has to be taken up to heaven.<a name=172:2></a> "A door was opened in heaven," and he sees the Lamb upon the throne, and those who had been faithful upon earth are with Him there.<a name=172:3></a> See the character of the throne itself: it is a throne that is going to vindicate the rejected Lamb, and the judgment to be executed.<a name=172:4></a> "A voice said unto me, Come up hither .<a name=172:5></a>.<a name=172:6></a>.<a name=172:7></a> and immediately I was in the Spirit"; but being in the Spirit, it was not to look round on things on earth, but go up into heaven.<a name=172:8></a>

		CHAPTER 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We saw, in the fourth chapter, the throne of God set in heaven, the great purpose of which was to bring into the world the Heir of all things -- as is expressed in Hebrews 1, "when he bringeth in again the First-begotten into the world.<a name=179:1></a>" This purpose, for which the throne was set, is not as yet accomplished; for the First-begotten is not actually brought in till chapter 19.<a name=179:2></a> At the end of the third chapter we have the Lord's own testimony as to the failure of the church on earth, in that it is spued out of His mouth.<a name=179:3></a> Then Christ takes the place the church was unable to maintain, that of the "Amen, the faithful and true witness.<a name=179:4></a>" And thus, the Lord's judicial power having ceased among the candlesticks on earth, we find in the fourth chapter a throne, not of grace, but of judgment, set in heaven, round which the glorified saints are sitting on their thrones, perfectly undisturbed at the thunderings and lightnings that are issuing forth from the throne; but when the majesty of God is celebrated, they cast their crowns before Him and fall down and worship Him as Creator.<a name=179:5></a> In this fifth chapter we get the things between the spueing out of the church from the mouth of Christ, and the judgments preliminary to His taking His rightful throne on the earth.<a name=179:6></a>

		But now we will turn to our proper subject, for in chapter 5 we pass into fresh ground again.<a name=181:1></a> When God begins to unfold His purposes, Christ must come in, for not only does all belong to Him by divine title, but He is also Heir of all things by divine appointment.<a name=181:2></a> Therefore, when we have the redemption of the purchased possession, the taking the inheritance out of the hands of the usurper by judgments, we find the book of God's counsels, as the conveyance of the inheritance of the rightful heir who won His title to it by His work.<a name=181:3></a> Consequently when the book of God's purposes concerning the inheritance comes on the scene, we also get the Son whom "He hath appointed heir of all things.<a name=181:4></a>" It was customary among the Jews (Jeremiah 32: 11), on conveyance of property, to have two books, an open one in which were title deeds, etc.<a name=181:5></a>, and a sealed one laid by, in order that no mistake might be made; and this book which God put into the hands of the Lamb, was a sealed one, sealed with seven seals.<a name=181:6></a>" "And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look therein.<a name=181:7></a>" Of course, there could not be any thought of looking therein as to how God would accomplish His purposes; for I would here remark that where the heart is brought near to God, it is not that there is a disposition to pry into these things, for that would he sin; but when we find God has purposes to reveal to us, it would be sorrow not to know them But some might say, surely salvation is the all-important thing; but I ask, Is not that settled?<a name=181:8></a> That ought to be the question, most surely, if it be not yet settled; but if I am a child, I have the interest of the family at heart, and, therefore, when that which concerns the First-born is brought out, I am interested in it, because my affections are drawn out by it.<a name=181:9></a> For there are affections which flow from this relationship itself, as well as those resulting from the fact of being saved.<a name=181:10></a> Of course, it is nothing but idle curiosity to be looking into prophecy before the great question of salvation is settled between the soul and God.<a name=181:11></a> When the conscience is set at rest before God, there will then be liberty for the exercise of those affections which flow out from such relationships.<a name=181:12></a> But still there are affections flowing from the relationship itself, and felt in measure, it may be, as soon as that relationship is effected in the soul, and before the soul itself is conscious of its portion.<a name=181:13></a> That is, we often meet with those whose hearts are towards God, without having settled peace in their souls.<a name=181:14></a> Take Job, for instance: he said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.<a name=181:15></a>" God was breaking him down, and breaking him up, just to shew Job what he was all the while.<a name=181:16></a> Job had full confidence in God, although his soul did not know real peace.<a name=181:17></a> Affection was there, and when the soul got peace, then the pent-up affections flowed out.<a name=181:18></a> For I do not mean to say that there is no affection until the soul has got peace; but when the question of salvation is settled, then there is unhindered liberty for the affections to flow out.<a name=181:19></a> And when the soul has got peace, then it is ready to learn in quiet communion with God, all that He is about to do.<a name=181:20></a>

		John sees no one in heaven, or on earth, or under the earth that was able to open the book, neither to look thereon, and then, naturally enough, he "wept much.<a name=183:1></a>" But what is the result of the elders sitting round the throne?<a name=183:2></a> Do they weep?<a name=183:3></a> Are they disturbed by it?<a name=183:4></a> No, not any more than they were by the thunderings; for with the utmost calmness and composure they at once say, "weep not.<a name=183:5></a>" Could they doubt Christ as being the appointed Heir of all things?<a name=183:6></a> Certainly not.<a name=183:7></a> That was a settled thing, and more than this, they knew Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah: the lion, denoting power -- the having full power to take the inheritance.<a name=183:8></a> But the elders knew what redemption was, and therefore to them it was a peaceful, settled thing that this "Lion" had all power to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof, to unfold and fulfil the counsels of God, and to bear the glory.<a name=183:9></a> The two things that most peculiarly belong to Christ, are power and wisdom -- "Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God"; and He makes the church to participate in His wisdom, for "He is made unto us wisdom," etc.<a name=183:10></a>, and He will give her to share His power.<a name=183:11></a> We see this order beautifully maintained in the history of Joseph: when in the prison, God gave him wisdom to interpret dreams; and afterwards we find him at the right hand of the throne of the king, exercising all power.<a name=183:12></a> So, likewise, the church will share the power with Christ, for she will reign with Him, and will be the sharer with Him in everything, the essential glory of the Godhead excepted.<a name=183:13></a> Our proper portion now is not power (I am not here speaking of spiritual power to overcome evil), but now is the time for the church to manifest wisdom in the understanding of the ways of God; having the Holy Ghost, who, as the Lord said, shall guide into all truth; but this must be through the written word, as the written word of God is the only depository of the truth of God.<a name=183:14></a> Therefore, it is the great instrument in the hand of God for communicating this knowledge through the teaching of the Holy Ghost, although at the same time He may be pleased to make use of various channels to accomplish it.<a name=183:15></a> Thus we see that where there is the desire in the heart according to God's mind, He cannot fail to satisfy that desire.<a name=183:16></a> If the desire is expressed, even to weeping, it is infallibly answered with a "weep not"; for this reason, that Christ has done that which will enable the mind of God to be communicated to every seeking soul.<a name=183:17></a> But this could not be before Christ came, as the Lord Himself says, "Blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear, for many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them.<a name=183:18></a>" But the moment the work of redemption was accomplished, and Jesus sat down at the right hand of God, the Holy Ghost was sent down in testimony of the acceptance of the work and Person of the risen Man, now in glory.<a name=183:19></a> And, therefore, now, whenever there is a desire in the heart according to God, it is always met and answered in the power of the Holy Ghost; for if Christ is revealed, then it is God's mind that we "should grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.<a name=183:20></a>" But then there must be a lowly mind to receive it: "The meek will he guide in judgment, the meek will he teach his way.<a name=183:21></a>"

		When John gets into this church-understanding (as we may call it), he sees a "Lamb as it had been slain"; and he sees power given to the Lamb, for in seven horns and seven eyes we have the perfection of power and all-seeing wisdom which is given to the Lamb, before a single seal is opened.<a name=187:1></a> And before we get the unfolding of God's purposes, we have the presentation of the Person of His Son.<a name=187:2></a> It is just this in God's dealings with a soul: the eye of the soul being fixed on the Person of Christ is the way in which it gets peace; as before you can get peace of soul through the work of Christ, your eye must have rested on the Person of Christ.<a name=187:3></a> It was so with the thief on the cross, with the poor woman of the city who was a sinner, who stood at His feet weeping.<a name=187:4></a> The soul must first be fixed upon the Person of Him who has made the peace, before there is the knowledge of the work which has wrought the peace.<a name=187:5></a> Before it all and after it all, it is Himself that is presented.<a name=187:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter we have the history of the two beasts, and they are something distinct from Babylon.<a name=205:6></a> One point must be remembered, that beasts are great temporal powers or empires; instead of being in subjection to God's authority, they are ravenous and exacting.<a name=205:7></a> Nebuchadnezzar was the first and Babylonish power; and all the four great empires have taken the same character.<a name=205:8></a> They rose out of the sea (unformed peoples) and became great corporate powers, ruling the world.<a name=205:9></a> Notice that it is not only the ravenous character of the beast, but here the <i>dragon</i> gives it its power.<a name=205:10></a>

		You get the whole circle of right affections in this verse: first, that arising from the consciousness of being the bride; secondly, desire for all the saints.<a name=238:31></a> Why are you lingering outside Christ?<a name=238:32></a> Are you waiting for judgments on the earth?<a name=238:33></a> There is a desire that the saints should have no hindrance to the single eye, and readiness to say, "Come," knowing the heart is not right if not saying, "Come.<a name=238:34></a>" Then is that all?<a name=238:35></a> No; there is a third thing -- the gracious perception, that there are thirsty souls wanting to be refreshed.<a name=238:36></a> She says to them, 'I have the Spirit, I have been refreshed.<a name=238:37></a>' The church does not say, 'Come to me' -- the false church says that -- but says, "Come.<a name=238:38></a>" I have not got the pure flowing of the river yet (Revelation 22), but you come.<a name=238:39></a> The next thing to the supply of our own need is the discernment of the wants of these thirsty ones.<a name=238:40></a> We can say, I have part in the Bridegroom -- I have rivers of living water.<a name=238:41></a> We ought to be able to say, I have got the river.<a name=238:42></a> Anyone can say, There are rivers; but we ought to be able to say, We have them.<a name=238:43></a> If our hearts are in the circle of these affections, we shall say to others, Come, and have them too.<a name=238:44></a> Is that all?<a name=238:45></a> No; there are yet others invited: "Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely.<a name=238:46></a>" Thus the church is seen, first, in its full bridal place and desire for Christ's coming without a question of judgment; and so in the individual that hears His voice; then follow the invitations of grace.<a name=238:47></a>

		THE BURNT-OFFERING -- LEVITICUS 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a very definite distinction between the first two sacrifices we have here, to which the third is an appendix, and the others.<a name=240:1></a> The burnt-offering and the meat-offering stand alone; dependent on these you get the peace-offering, and then those of another character, the sin and trespass offerings.<a name=240:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Wherever we meet the actual use and presentation of the offerings, it is in the opposite order to the revelation of them here.<a name=240:3></a> In the revelation we get them as God presents them, as He sees Christ: but in the use of them, my need comes first.<a name=240:4></a> Here, it is God's side, a sacrifice by fire of a sweet savour to the Lord: that expression is never used of the sin-offering, except in one single verse.<a name=240:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It gives a very definite character to these two first, that it is their aspect towards God, <i>His</i> character and nature.<a name=240:6></a> When we come as sinners, we come in respect of what our sins are, but our apprehension of what the meaning and value of Christ's death is, is greatly enhanced by seeing God's part in it.<a name=240:7></a> I must confess my sins -- it is the only true way of coming; and I find there is propitiation through faith in His blood, and then I find all that is essential in these sacrifices as regards God.<a name=240:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no particular sin here: it was for sin of course, but it was not an individual confessing some particular sin.<a name=240:9></a> It is striking enough, that until you come to the institution of the law, you never get sin-offerings, except in the case of Cain, of which I do not doubt myself (though I know it is a question of interpretation), that it is, "a sin-offering lieth at the door.<a name=240:10></a>" Sin and sin-offering is the same word; that word is never used again in that way, till the law -- we get burnt-offerings and peace-offerings often.<a name=240:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The burnt-offering is the great basis, because it is God's glory in what has been done for sin.<a name=240:12></a> We must come, as I said, by the sin-offering.<a name=240:13></a> "He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins"; but it is another thing, beloved friends, when I look at Christ's offering and sacrifice, as glorifying God perfectly in all that He is, and that in respect of sin.<a name=240:14></a> He said, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life," a very remarkable word, for none could give a "therefore" to God for His love; Christ could.<a name=240:15></a> The difference between divine love and human love is, that God commendeth His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<a name=240:16></a> If man gets sufficient motive, he will sacrifice his life; but without any motive, Christ gave Himself, God gave His Son: it <i>characterises</i> the love.<a name=240:17></a> In John 10: 11, He lays down His life "for the sheep"; but in verse 17, He does not say it is for the sheep.<a name=240:18></a> He has glorified God in death, in the place of sin, and He is glorified as man at the right hand of God.<a name=240:19></a> He goes up into that place where we get morally what the sacrifice was in God's sight.<a name=240:20></a>

		There is nothing about sins in this chapter, though sin was there, blood-shedding, death, shewing sin was the thing in question; and yet the sacrifice was absolutely a sweet savour, that blessed character of the sacrifice of Christ, which settles every question of good and evil in God's sight.<a name=241:1></a> There was this terrible thing, that sin had come in, in the creature of God's predilection.<a name=241:2></a> People say that Adam learned to know evil, whereas he had only known good before; but that is not at all the point.<a name=241:3></a> "The man is become as <i>one of us</i>, knowing good and evil.<a name=241:4></a>" It is knowing the difference between right and wrong.<a name=241:5></a>

		Another thing, beloved friends; God tried man in <i>every</i> way.<a name=242:1></a> The question was raised, was there any remedy for this?<a name=242:2></a> In the first place He destroyed them with judgment -- then He called Abraham -- then came the test of the law; all the things required by the law were duties already -- the law did not make them duties, but it was God's statement of the obligation of those duties and God's claim upon man to fulfil them.<a name=242:3></a> The sacrifices were introduced consequent upon that.<a name=242:4></a> As to the state of man's <i>heart</i>, nothing could have been more decided, than when he cast God off, for the one thing he was told not to do.<a name=242:5></a> Then came a totally distinct thing.<a name=242:6></a> Man being not only a sinner but a transgressor, God comes in goodness reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing trespasses.<a name=242:7></a> He came in perfect goodness close to man, <i>touched</i> man, so to speak -- holiness in all His walk, but divine love in everything He did -- made flesh and dwelt among us; not visiting merely as with Abraham; but He was down here as a man, manifesting what He was towards men.<a name=242:8></a> That was the last trial to which God put man, to see whether there was anything He could awaken in man towards God.<a name=242:9></a> Come in goodness from His Father, walking amongst men in grace, so that there was no sorrow He did not meet -- and we know how it ended for the time; He was totally rejected, and that closed man's history, his moral history.<a name=242:10></a> Not only had he sinned so that he had to be turned out of an innocent paradise, because he was not innocent, but he had rejected God's Son, come in love.<a name=242:11></a>

		But now came the accomplishment of the divine work of redemption; <i>there was a sacrifice</i>!<a name=242:12></a> I get the blessed Son of God giving Himself, made sin in God's sight, totally alone, and, as to the suffering of His soul, forsaken of God.<a name=242:13></a> I get the sin dealt with.<a name=242:14></a> I must come by my guilt, but this presents it from God's end.<a name=242:15></a> I get absolute evil in man, and He met man with the perfect revelation of good.<a name=242:16></a> But it drew out hatred -- that was the effect; the carnal mind, enmity against God -- hatred against God manifested in goodness.<a name=242:17></a> I get Satan's power complete over man; Christ's own disciples forsaking Him, the rest wagging their heads at Him, glad to get rid of God and good.<a name=242:18></a> He had gone so low for our guilt and God's glory, that even the thief hung with Him could insult Him!<a name=242:19></a>

		With the blessed Lord Himself I find just the opposite: Man in perfect goodness, love to the Father and obedience at all cost: "that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do": perfect in the place of sin, where this question had been brought to an issue, made sin in God's sight in perfect love to His Father and perfect obedience.<a name=243:1></a> But further, in the cross, I see God in absolute righteousness against sin, in perfect love to the sinner; man in absolute badness; Satan's complete power; man in absolute obedience.<a name=243:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That laid the basis of it all; it brought angels desiring to look into it, to see the Just suffering for the unjust!<a name=243:3></a> It was not weak mercy giving up holiness and righteousness, but the absolute expression of majesty and righteousness.<a name=243:4></a> "It became him," that if God's Son were made sin, He must be dealt with as such, there was no escape!<a name=243:5></a> He gave Himself for it, "a body hast thou prepared me.<a name=243:6></a>" Totally alone there, none to comfort Him, strong bulls of Bashan around; He says, "Be not thou far from me, O Lord," and He had to be forsaken of God.<a name=243:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The condition man was in was that it was his delight to get rid of God, and God, too, not come to judge him, but to reconcile him to Himself!<a name=243:8></a> But God's eternal counsels were in it, and Christ gave Himself.<a name=243:9></a> All that God is, was brought out and made good there, when man under Satan's power had succeeded in getting rid of Christ, He giving up Himself.<a name=243:10></a> God was glorified in Him.<a name=243:11></a> There was the secret work of God, God using the very thing by which Satan sought to frustrate it, to accomplish it.<a name=243:12></a> Satan's power seemed to have its way when he got rid of Christ from the world, but all was then brought to an issue before God; and that gives the immutability of the blessing.<a name=243:13></a> All was finished on which everlasting righteousness is founded.<a name=243:14></a> It was not a state of innocence whose preservation hung on yet unsatisfied responsibility: the unchanging blessing of the new heavens and the new earth, depends on that -- the worth of which cannot change.<a name=243:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Morally speaking, the cross maintains it all.<a name=243:16></a> The question of good and evil, raised in the garden of Eden, was settled in the cross.<a name=243:17></a> I get the blessed Son of God, never using His divine power to screen Himself from suffering, not using it to hinder the suffering, but to sustain Him in it, to enable Him to bear what none could have gone through without it.<a name=243:18></a> When I come to God in this way, I apprehend what sin is, not merely my actual sins, but that in me dwelleth no good thing.<a name=243:19></a> I get One, hanging upon the cross, made sin before God at the very moment when the full character of sin was manifested in the rejection of Christ.<a name=243:20></a> And there, where man was wholly a sinner, and Christ stood in that place for him, all that God is, was brought out.<a name=243:21></a> Where could you find full righteousness against sin?<a name=243:22></a> In no place but the cross, which gives <i>perfect</i> righteousness against sin and love to the sinner in that same blessed work, and that in a man, and when sin was brought out in its worst character.<a name=243:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The burnt-offering was not for particular sins, but it was atonement: Christ made sin for us (the difference may be clearly seen in Hebrews 9: compare John 1) but offering Himself entirely to God, so that in the fact of being made sin, the highest perfection of love and obedience was found: all the perfectness of Christ Himself towards God, and surely of love to us; but more -- all that God is, perfectly glorified.<a name=254:4></a>

		In the burnt-offering, there was nothing of positive acts of sin, but we get the notion of sin being in the world, and approach to God referring to its presence there, and Christ glorifying God, as a victim for it, doing such a service that He could say, "therefore doth my Father love me"; but the work in itself was a perfect glorifying of God, as He could not have been glorified otherwise.<a name=254:11></a> "That the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given me commandment even so I do.<a name=254:12></a>" There was perfect love to the Father, besides the question of our sins, and perfect obedience: perfect love when He was forsaken, and the obedience was perfected when it cost Him that forsaking.<a name=254:13></a> His motives too were perfect: love to us surely, but love to His Father, obedient when God was forsaking Him.<a name=254:14></a> The more terrible the suffering, the more dreadful the cup, the greater the sacrifice.<a name=254:15></a> It is such a comfort for us that that question of sin before God has been perfectly gone into and settled.<a name=254:16></a> That solemn question, Christ takes up and puts Himself forward in grace to glorify God in it and by it: where man was against Him, the devil against Him, all the world against Him, the disciples ran away, comfort He had none, and in death, God Himself forsook Him.<a name=254:17></a> When everything outward, human and devilish was against Him, and He cried to God, then He was forsaken of God: it was the righteous judgment of God against Him, because He was made sin for us: then He goes as man to sit down on the right hand of God.<a name=254:18></a> That is all settled; and I can look at Christ as the sweet savour, in the absolute perfectness in which He offered Himself to God and was tested in His obedience.<a name=254:19></a> Then in chapter 2 all the blessed perfectness of Christ in His life, tested, tried, broken to pieces, comes out.<a name=254:20></a>

		There can be no true love to Christ while there is the sense of wrong done; for I cannot love a person I have wronged.<a name=271:5></a> What is needed then is the consciousness of the wrong done.<a name=271:6></a> "I have sinned, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<a name=271:7></a>" When the conscience is aroused, and the heart is brought into play, we rest in the presence of God.<a name=271:8></a> The Spirit of God may humble us on account of what <i>we have done</i>, but when conscience is in play it brings out our <i>whole condition</i> before God.<a name=271:9></a> It is not the law coming in again, but God presenting <i>Himself</i>; thus there will be right affections, and the conscience will be in exercise.<a name=271:10></a> Self-confidence and self-exaltation in every form are always the effects of an unexercised conscience.<a name=271:11></a> Only put a man in the Lord's presence, and that will keep him lowly, and in a spiritual state of discernment; but there is nothing out of which we so easily get as the consciousness of the presence of God.<a name=271:12></a> So also in our prayers.<a name=271:13></a> You may often be sensible that you go on praying after you have lost the consciousness that you are speaking to God, still the soul goes on expressing itself; even when led by the Spirit the consequence will be that the manner will be all wrong, though the words may be right.<a name=271:14></a> Well, though all this be true, whenever the Lord recalls a soul He recalls it to His own presence.<a name=271:15></a> He will act on the conscience; He will speak plainly to us.<a name=271:16></a> Why?<a name=271:17></a> Because He is conscious of the relationship which ought to have produced the conduct befitting the relationship which we have forgotten.<a name=271:18></a> "Is Ephraim my dear son?<a name=271:19></a> is he a pleasant child?<a name=271:20></a> for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him.<a name=271:21></a>" When the Lord recalls a soul to Himself He may reproach it with having forgotten the relationship in which it stood to God, and God to it; but He cannot reproach it as <i>not having known</i> that relationship.<a name=271:22></a> The power of every rebuke is founded on the relationship, and God remembering the relationship acts on the ground of it with all the affections belonging thereto.<a name=271:23></a> Thus every rebuke comes to us as the expression of the most wonderful tenderness; and the more deeply we learn that there is no failure in God's affection, the more deeply we lament our short-coming and failure in that relationship which never fails.<a name=271:24></a>

		Now let us look at the other side of the picture, and see the desperately bad state which the heart of Israel had got into, remembering they are but types of us.<a name=273:12></a> They were dissatisfied, and cried, "Would to God we had died in Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and ate bread to the full.<a name=273:13></a>" And again, "Wherefore have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us into this evil place?<a name=273:14></a> it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.<a name=273:15></a>" In the wilderness there is nothing to see, nothing to look at; and this is what Israel wanted.<a name=273:16></a> God says, "I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof, and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.<a name=273:17></a>" They felt their own importance, and forgot the Lord; they had the blessing, and did not want the Lord of the blessing (verse 6-8).<a name=273:18></a> And is not this true of the church of God?<a name=273:19></a> We bring in self, which is but a broken cistern, and depart from Him, who is the living fountain and power of blessing, forgetting that "a Syrian ready to perish was my father.<a name=273:20></a>" Consequently there is moral weakness, and Satan gets power.<a name=273:21></a> A believer cannot get back into the world: a mere professor may, and enjoy it; but a Christian cannot.<a name=273:22></a> An Israelite could not get back through the Red Sea again.<a name=273:23></a> You cannot think of yourselves and the Lord together with satisfaction to your own souls.<a name=273:24></a> The Lord's presence in the soul will bring <i>self</i> into utter ruin and nothingness.<a name=273:25></a> We have only to let the Lord have His place in our souls, and that will put us into our place.<a name=273:26></a> If I am walking through the world, shall I find it a wilderness?<a name=273:27></a> To be sure I shall; but then I shall not be thinking about the wilderness if the Lord is my joy and my strength.<a name=273:28></a> Are your hearts saying, This is a land we cannot see?<a name=273:29></a> If so, what does that prove?<a name=273:30></a> Why, that you are looking for something to see; and this is the thought you will find in your hearts, "It <i>is a land not sown</i>," although you may be ashamed to own it.<a name=273:31></a> But God remembered Israel when they thought it worth while to follow God for His own sake.<a name=273:32></a> We feel bound to say it is a happy thing to be a Christian; but when we are alone do not our hearts say, "It is a land not sown"?<a name=273:33></a> If it be so with you, do not rest until the Lord Himself alone satisfies your soul; for you should delight yourself in Him.<a name=273:34></a> Lot <i>saw</i> a well-watered plain and a city, and then dwelt in it on the earth, and consequently was in the midst of judgment; while Abraham sought a city <i>out of sight</i>, and he enjoyed the blessing and comfort of God being with him, go where he might.<a name=273:35></a> When the soul is down, like a ship when the tide is low, it is in danger of shoals and sandbanks; but when the tide is up there are no sandbanks, because the ship is lifted up above them all.<a name=273:36></a> Thus when the soul is happy in Christ it will go on peacefully, independently of all the trials we may be called to meet with in our fellowsaints.<a name=273:37></a> We are called to walk together through the world, and a mere natural fitness will not do for that.<a name=273:38></a> No, we can only go on so far as Christ fills the soul; and thus going on in the tide of divine goodness, forgetting everything else, we can walk together happily, being occupied with Christ, and not with each other.<a name=273:39></a>

		In these parables we have the character and importance of the word shewn, and its effects.<a name=277:1></a> The object of revealing truth in this manner is made known to us by the Lord in His answer to the disciples, saying, "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.<a name=277:2></a>" Parables, then, we find, unfold the word to those who already know Jesus; and they are spoken consequent upon the unbelief of the Jewish people, amongst whom the Lord had previously ministered, and cast out devils, and healed the sick, and who then, in the very principle of apostasy, had asked a sign.<a name=277:3></a> The character of this evil and adulterous generation is spoken of as having corrupted themselves; their spot is not the spot of God's children; they are a froward generation, children in whom is no faith; and here it is as though He were just declaring, "I will hide my face from them, and see what their end will be.<a name=277:4></a>" And this is the reason why He speaks in parables.<a name=277:5></a> The spirit of unbelief was clearly developed in the Jews after His taking the utmost possible pains with them, and then He hides His face from them, telling them their condition is this, "When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<a name=277:6></a> Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.<a name=277:7></a> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.<a name=277:8></a> Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation," Matthew 13: 43-45.<a name=277:9></a> Having seen this then, we see that the parables are the unfolding of mysteries to those believe.<a name=277:10></a>

		First we have the seed sown in the field; and parallel to this is the field bought for the sake of the prize which He knew to be in it.<a name=278:2></a> The grain of mustard-seed becoming a tree in which the birds of the air lodge, is the indiscriminate place of shelter afforded by the organisation of professed doctrine: on the other hand, we have the pearl of great price, and understood in its value by a merchantman; here we find the spiritual understanding of Christ, and what every Christian has in his measure.<a name=278:3></a> The leaven, which is a corrupt and a hidden thing, leavens the whole three measures of meal; that is, a given part is filled with it.<a name=278:4></a> The whole from the field is gathered, and the whole of the net is drawn to shore, and then comes the separation.<a name=278:5></a>

		These interpretations carry out the child of God into the next dispensation.<a name=278:12></a> In the parable of the tares, the servants ask if they shall gather them out; that is now, at the present time: but the interpretation shews us what takes place consequent upon the time which the parable describes.<a name=278:13></a> Christ came into the world and sowed wheat, the devil sowed tares; this is not simply unconverted men, but the operation of Satan to injure and mar the work of God.<a name=278:14></a> There were unconverted men before Christ came, and Satan presented adequate temptation to man's pride, covetousness, and self-esteem to guide them to his principles; and this is the wise man of the world.<a name=278:15></a> But there is another thing now.<a name=278:16></a> Satan comes to introduce mischief where God had introduced good.<a name=278:17></a> The world is not now in its natural state.<a name=278:18></a> Jesus as the Apostle of our profession has come and sown good seed; but while men slept, the enemy has come in upon this, and sown tares to injure and corrupt the profession of the church.<a name=278:19></a> It may be great and flourishing in appearance as the tree; it may fill the three measures of meal as the leaven; but it is a corrupt thing.<a name=278:20></a>

		But to confine myself to the parable of the tares; it is not only the weeds of the field, that is natural evil, but the subtle evil of the tares growing up to a harvest of judgments; that is the church nominally: but where were they to be let grow together with the wheat?<a name=279:1></a> In the world.<a name=279:2></a> There is not to be the judicial process of excision here.<a name=279:3></a> The Son of man sows; the Son of man, as king, gathers out of His kingdom all things that offend and do iniquity; but what is this but the condemnation of a judicial process of excision in the world now by the saints?<a name=279:4></a> This is not to be executed until He comes.<a name=279:5></a>

		The parable of the net cast into the sea comes within the class which is the subject of the spiritual apprehension of disciples only, and is addressed only to them, its very subject being within the scope of their understanding only; while on the other side it presents the gathering of a company out of the world, in which good and bad are alike found, the process on which is the subject of their occupation and apprehension, and which the fishermen who draw the net carry on and not the angels.<a name=279:7></a>

		In this parable of the tares we find Satan was waking, and men were sleeping, and the effect produced is the mixture of the evil and the good; and this is now the work of the devil, mixing evil with good in this world; and we can still say "an enemy hath done this.<a name=280:1></a>" Competence to remedy it is another thing.<a name=280:2></a> But let us settle this as a first principle: that if we see evil and good mixed in the profession of Christianity, this is the work of Satan; and, remember, the tares are not simply unconverted men -- there were plenty before the Lord came -- but the tares are the work of Satan consequent upon His coming.<a name=280:3></a>

		In the practical application of this, it is of great importance to see that the mixing anything with God's wheat is sanctioning the iniquity of the world.<a name=281:1></a> If I see anything with the spirit of the world, or the power of it stamped upon it, I see a plant which is not of the Lord's planting; and if I see this mixed with Christianity, that which is of Christ, and that which is not of Christ, I say, "an enemy hath done this.<a name=281:2></a>" We have been slumbering, but the enemy was awake.<a name=281:3></a> The spirit of a believer necessarily involves total separation from the world, for where there is a spirit to join the world, there is not the Spirit of God, but the spirit of the world.<a name=281:4></a> But this state of things will not go on for ever.<a name=281:5></a> I would ask you, dear friends, whether there be in you this recognition of the total separation in spirit which these things mark out to us?<a name=281:6></a> If this is not the case, we are either the natural weeds of the field, or what Satan has sown to do mischief.<a name=281:7></a> You may be those God will convert, but you are one of these, or you have the principle in your hearts, and the love of the world is enmity against God.<a name=281:8></a>

		Matthew 25: 1-29
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these two parables we see evidently the Lord dealing with the responsibility of those who have been called out for Him; some of them not only called, but called upon to act, whether in thoughts, or feelings, or outward actions, in reference to His return to them.<a name=282:1></a>

		The coming of the Lord is not merely some special doctrine, but is what ought to, and at first did characterise the Christian; not merely the <i>fact</i> that He will come again (every person that calls himself a Christian believes that): the present expectation of the Lord characterises the Christian.<a name=282:2></a> Here they went out to meet the bridegroom.<a name=282:3></a> Again the apostle says of the Thessalonians that they were converted to wait for God's Son from heaven -- they were <i>converted</i> to wait.<a name=282:4></a> So in Matthew 24, it was not that they denied His coming.<a name=282:5></a> "But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord <i>delayeth</i> his coming": it ceased to be a present expectation.<a name=282:6></a> So with the virgins, "they all slumbered and slept": it was not given up as a truth (though in fact it has been given up in a great measure), but it ceased to be a present expectation.<a name=282:7></a> Therefore when the Lord is exhorting His disciples He says (Luke 12: 35), "Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning, and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord.<a name=282:8></a>" Then He adds, "Verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and come forth and serve them.<a name=282:9></a>" He ministers to their blessedness.<a name=282:10></a> What I press, then, is, that the more you look at the scriptures, the more you see that it was constantly as a first principle before the hearts of the saints.<a name=282:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Thessalonians were not converted above a month.<a name=282:12></a> The apostle was only a few weeks with them; a persecution arose, and he was sent away, yet there he had fully brought it before them.<a name=282:13></a> There is no epistle so full of the Lord's coming as the two to the Thessalonians, the first as to the joy of the saints (the Lord taking them to Himself), the second the solemnity of His coming in judgment.<a name=282:14></a> They were quite recently converted to God, yet they had learned all this.<a name=282:15></a> It was the thing brought before their souls: "Ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven.<a name=282:16></a>" Two things characterised them: they went out to meet the bridegroom, and they served Him meanwhile.<a name=282:17></a> They were like unto men that wait for their Lord.<a name=282:18></a> As we all know, even unconverted men know perfectly well, if saints were waiting for Christ their whole lives would be changed.<a name=282:19></a> There is not a man does not know it.<a name=282:20></a> Do you think people would be heaping up money, or dressing themselves in finery, to meet the Lord?<a name=282:21></a> If this was acted upon, it would change everything in our lives; that is what the Lord gave it for.<a name=282:22></a> "Let your loins be girded about" -- a figure for all the heart in order, the state you are always to be in -- like a porter at the door, "that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.<a name=282:23></a>" That is what the Lord looks for in the saints.<a name=282:24></a>

		This truth is everywhere strikingly presented all through 1 Thessalonians.<a name=283:1></a> This characterised them there.<a name=283:2></a> Their faith to God-ward was spread abroad: the world was saying, What an extraordinary set of people!<a name=283:3></a> They have given up all their idols (and you can have idols without being heathen), and have got one true God, and expect His Son from heaven to take them up there.<a name=283:4></a> The world was in one sense preaching the gospel, declaring what these things were.<a name=283:5></a> Because they were waiting for His Son from heaven, their walk and ways in respect of that became a testimony that all the world talked about.<a name=283:6></a> They were persecuted for it, but that is another thing.<a name=283:7></a> In the second chapter he speaks of the coming in connection with joy in service, Ye are my crown and joy -- I shall have it when the Lord comes, "for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing?<a name=283:8></a> Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?<a name=283:9></a>" In the third chapter it is connected with holiness -- "To the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.<a name=283:10></a>" He is looking for the practical effect in conduct.<a name=283:11></a> Then in the fourth chapter he explains how they will go up.<a name=283:12></a> "Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=283:13></a>" As He was coming to execute judgment (I mean on the living), so when Christ comes to judge this world, we come with Him: a blessed part of it -- our thorough association with Christ.<a name=283:14></a> He still speaks in the same way in the fifth chapter, where it is more judgment and the day of the Lord, with some remarkable signs.<a name=283:15></a> "For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night; for when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.<a name=283:16></a>" The elements of the thing are seen now, the full time is not yet come, but it is a solemn thing.<a name=283:17></a> It seems a contradiction: people are saying, Peace, peace; yet their hearts are failing them for fear, and for looking after those things that are coming on the earth.<a name=283:18></a> It is just what is going on now.<a name=283:19></a> Progress, progress, everybody says, and yet all in confusion, and they do not know what is coming.<a name=283:20></a>

		But my desire now is to look at it as to the saints.<a name=284:1></a> All the Epistles (except Galatians and Ephesians) take up this; and the Gospels.<a name=284:2></a> When the Lord was comforting His disciples, how does He begin?<a name=284:3></a> "Let not your hearts be troubled .<a name=284:4></a>.<a name=284:5></a>.<a name=284:6></a> .<a name=284:7></a> I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again" -- the thing He first of all holds up.<a name=284:8></a> My object is to shew the way the word of God kept it before the hearts of the saints, that they might live in that expectation.<a name=284:9></a> When the Lord was ascending to heaven, the angels say, "Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?<a name=284:10></a> This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner.<a name=284:11></a>" If the Lord was leaving comfort in the hearts of His disciples when going away, He says, "I will come again and receive you unto myself.<a name=284:12></a>" If angels are comforting them, they say, "He shall so come in like manner.<a name=284:13></a>" It is thus practically pressed on the disciples.<a name=284:14></a> The last word in scripture is, "Amen.<a name=284:15></a> Even so come, Lord Jesus.<a name=284:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Accordingly, the more you look into scripture, the more you will see not merely that it is a truth taught, but a truth held up before the hearts and minds of the disciples, that they should habitually be looking for the Lord.<a name=284:17></a> It would change everything; it is no use saying it would not: every unconverted person knows it would.<a name=284:18></a> They would do their ordinary duties, of course, and be the more diligent in them.<a name=284:19></a> This is the special blessing in Luke 12: "Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching.<a name=284:20></a>" He ministers to them heavenly blessing.<a name=284:21></a> Then when He goes on to service, "Who then is that faithful and wise servant whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?<a name=284:22></a> Blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.<a name=284:23></a>" When I get the state of the heart watching for Christ, it is heavenly blessedness with Him: when I get service, it is the kingdom.<a name=284:24></a>

		Thus we see here or elsewhere, in the word of God, the coming of the Lord is kept as a present thing before the heart.<a name=285:1></a> If I take the unconverted person, there cannot be a more solemn thing than to be kept in constant expectation; he cannot say the Lord will not be here tonight.<a name=285:2></a> The Lord alone knows when He is coming.<a name=285:3></a> They were to wait for Him.<a name=285:4></a> If the saints were waiting, there would be the testimony; and do you not think the unconverted would find it out?<a name=285:5></a> They might hate and persecute them; but they would know that the saints had something that they had not, something which characterised them in their walk and affections.<a name=285:6></a> Two things are needed for this.<a name=285:7></a> There are two characters in which the Lord comes: He takes them to be with Himself; and then comes the question of judgment.<a name=285:8></a> First, then, the judgment must have no kind of fear or terror for me; but, on the other hand, to really expect Him, the coming One must be the object of my affections and my delight.<a name=285:9></a> If you told me some Prussian was coming, I would not care about that; but if it was my wife or my mother, how different!<a name=285:10></a> To have it really as our desire, then, all questions as to judgment must be settled, and we must have our affections on the Lord.<a name=285:11></a> We get this by the first coming of the Lord.<a name=285:12></a> We wait for His Son from heaven -- even Jesus, which delivereth us from the wrath to come.<a name=285:13></a> There is wrath coming; but we know the Lord's coming is before the scene of judgment, and it is the coming of the One who has wrought salvation: we wait for the One who has delivered us.<a name=285:14></a> Judgment to me is not a subject of fear.<a name=285:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A word on this: what God has done in the coming of the Lord Jesus (I speak of His first coming) is this -- all that would have to be dealt with in judgment at His second coming has been, for the believer, so dealt with on the cross: He who is to come as judge, <i>has</i> come as the Saviour.<a name=285:16></a> That is what I get in the gospel.<a name=285:17></a> He who is to come as judge, has come in an entirely different way and character: He has come as a Saviour.<a name=285:18></a> "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself"; "He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin.<a name=285:19></a>" Suppose I believe the testimony that the Lord is coming and am not ready for it, I fear judgment; then I turn to the first coming and see He has delivered me from the wrath to come.<a name=285:20></a> God has dealt with the world as to its sins in grace before He deals with it in judgment.<a name=285:21></a> He deals with them as sinners, as responsible and lost, but not in judgment -- He came "to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=285:22></a>"

		I get this truth, then, that the Saviour has thus given Himself for me, and God has been occupied with my sins before Christ comes as judge.<a name=286:27></a> The apostle speaks of it as the "terror of the Lord," 2 Corinthians 5: 10, 11.<a name=286:28></a> But when the believer comes before the judgment-seat, he finds there the Person who has put away all his sins, and has the peaceful settled consciousness that his sins are all gone.<a name=286:29></a> "Having made peace through the blood of his cross," God has attested the value of it by raising Him from the dead and setting Him at His own right hand: and has given you the peace, that you might believe and know the love that God has to you.<a name=286:30></a> "When I see the blood I will pass over you.<a name=286:31></a>" He has set forth Christ to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, and instead of fearing His coming I rejoice.<a name=286:32></a> I could not desire His coming if a stranger: but we see the way Christ has interested and brought back our hearts.<a name=286:33></a> "The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.<a name=286:34></a>" Out and out Christ has given Himself for us, not only His life -- His precious blood -- but <i>Himself</i>.<a name=286:35></a> Thus I find One who loved me, and purged my conscience; Hebrews 9: 14.<a name=286:36></a> And not only is my conscience perfectly purged, but my heart is free to be on Him, because I have learned the perfect love of Him who gave Himself for me.<a name=286:37></a>

		Now, the other thing is service.<a name=289:22></a> The twelfth chapter of Luke gives us not only watching but serving.<a name=289:23></a> So here (Matthew 25: 14-30) it is the servant.<a name=289:24></a> You get more of the sovereignty of God here, than in the analogous parable in Luke, where it is more the responsibility of man.<a name=289:25></a> Here the Lord gives to every man according to his several ability: to one five talents, to another two, etc.<a name=289:26></a> Every one will be responsible for his wealth, but this is not a talent.<a name=289:27></a> The talents are what Christ gave when He was going away.<a name=289:28></a> He gave gifts -- apostles, prophets, and so on.<a name=289:29></a> He did not give money!<a name=289:30></a> I quite admit the responsibility of it, but it is not the point here.<a name=289:31></a>

		Thus, then, when Christ went away, He called His own servants and gave them according to their ability.<a name=290:1></a> When He comes back, He reckons with them.<a name=290:2></a> He that had received five talents made them other five; he that had received two had also gained two.<a name=290:3></a> But their lord was dealing in grace and wisdom, and says to both alike, "Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<a name=290:4></a>" Then comes the third: what characterised him was want of trust in the character of his master.<a name=290:5></a> It was not a question of not having oil in his lamp, but he says, "I knew thee that thou art an hard man," etc.<a name=290:6></a> He did not know the blessedness of the grace that is in Christ's heart.<a name=290:7></a> The others had the mind of Christ; they trusted His heart, and were therefore good and faithful servants.<a name=290:8></a> Thus I find the responsibility of service resting upon the knowledge of the heart of Christ.<a name=290:9></a> One said, "I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth"; he judged by his own selfish heart; the others trusted the heart of their master and acted on it.<a name=290:10></a> He trusts us if it is only a cup of cold water, or the gift of an apostle; He trusts His servant and expects him to act.<a name=290:11></a> If you have five talents, trade with them; if a cup of cold water, trade with it.<a name=290:12></a> I get this blessed principle that, perfect grace having been exercised, and you see how it is so, the heart in cheerful readiness trusts the grace -- trusts the Lord Himself.<a name=290:13></a>

		Now, take the case of Peter, and you will see how it is connected with the conscience.<a name=290:14></a> Peter had to learn himself; he had confidence in himself, and it all broke down; he little knew Christ.<a name=290:15></a> And now just see how the Lord deals with him.<a name=290:16></a> He says, "Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not," and it did not fail.<a name=290:17></a> He needed to be sifted: it was good for him, as it is often for us, to be sifted and humbled.<a name=290:18></a> If he had been left to himself, it would have been all over with him.<a name=290:19></a> But here was the Lord just going to be crucified, answering for Himself against His bitter enemies: but you never find Him in any place or circumstances where, if one wanted Him, His heart was not free to go out to the need.<a name=290:20></a> He looks at Peter, whose heart is broken down: he caught the Lord's eye just at the right moment, and weeps bitterly for his sin.<a name=290:21></a> Now, when He comes back to Peter, there is another lesson.<a name=290:22></a> He says, Well, Peter, "lovest thou me more than these?<a name=290:23></a>" That is what he boasted of doing.<a name=290:24></a> He does not say, Why did you deny Me?<a name=290:25></a> but "Lovest thou me?<a name=290:26></a>" etc.<a name=290:27></a> He tests Peter's heart to get it right with Him.<a name=290:28></a> "Thou knowest all things," says Peter, "Thou knowest what is at the bottom of my heart.<a name=290:29></a>" And then, when thoroughly humbled in the dust about the sin, Peter is given to take care of the things dearest to Him.<a name=290:30></a> As soon as He had entirely broken Peter down, and taught him not to trust in himself, then He says, If you love Me, feed My sheep.<a name=290:31></a> In the exercise of perfect grace He trusts Peter because He had taught Peter not to trust himself.<a name=290:32></a> Look now how Peter stands up and says to the Jews, "Ye have denied the Holy One and the Just.<a name=290:33></a>" Did he blush?<a name=290:34></a> He can bring the very things he had done himself on their conscience.<a name=290:35></a> Why?<a name=290:36></a> Because his conscience is as white as snow.<a name=290:37></a> He had learned to trust His love.<a name=290:38></a> He can charge them with the sins he had done himself; his conscience is purged.<a name=290:39></a> He has been thoroughly probed, but he can through the work of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost stand up and speak of his own terrible sin.<a name=290:40></a> Just as I can say to a sinner, You are lost in your sins: that is what I was myself.<a name=290:41></a>

		It is this confidence in Christ that is the spring of all true service; that entire blessed confidence in the grace of Christ, in His heart for us, who are unworthy of anything.<a name=291:1></a> He has trusted us, and the heart trusts Him, and the servant goes on to serve Him and trade with his talents; with the consequent effect, that we enter into the joy of our Lord, with Him and like Him, in the sense of His love because He is love.<a name=291:2></a> And there will not be a soul that it will not be my delight to see there.<a name=291:3></a> I am sure that, after the glory of Christ Himself, it is the next best thing to see the saints with Him and like Him.<a name=291:4></a> What is the great desire of the heart now but to see them as like Christ as possible?<a name=291:5></a> Then it will be perfectly.<a name=291:6></a> He comes and takes us there, and brings us into His joys -- "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.<a name=291:7></a>"

		If you want to go on well and brightly, then, it is resting on the perfect work of Christ at His first coming (the Holy Ghost dwelling in us), and looking for that blessed hope, with true liberty of service, and the confidence that, when He comes, it is to enter into that blessed place of joy with Him.<a name=291:8></a> It is His own joy that He gives.<a name=291:9></a> The joy of our hearts is to think that He is coming, and soon, to receive us to Himself.<a name=291:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Familiar as we are with the thought, it is after all a wonderful thing that the Son of God should come into this world of sinners, and still more wonderful that He should die for them.<a name=293:1></a> Into this world the Son of God came, fully bringing out what we are, by the way in which He was received; but at the same time His coming was full of joy and blessing for us.<a name=293:2></a> He was the immediate object of the express delight of the Father; then He died and rose again, and so brought us into the same place -- into light and blessing with Himself.<a name=293:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful thing, in the first place, to have God come into the world, grace and truth in the world; and that we have in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=293:4></a> It is not a question of our duties, or of future judgment; but it is into the midst of this world of defilement, violence, corruption, evil, and enmity against God -- into the midst of it He came.<a name=293:5></a> What makes it so especially wonderful is, that He came as a babe (though miraculously born) as one of ourselves, a real true man in this world of woe.<a name=293:6></a> Still there was more: for it is a totally different thing for God to deal with men as children of Adam, as to what they are, and what they can bring to God, and what their righteousness is -- there is a great difference between looking at a man as responsible to God -- and God dealing with Him according to His own thoughts.<a name=293:7></a> This is the truth, when grace is rejected.<a name=293:8></a> It is not that God overlooks our responsibility; but it is a totally distinct thing for God to reveal and fulfil the thoughts of His own heart, and for Him to investigate those of ours.<a name=293:9></a> Dealing with man on the ground of what he is, and what he has done, goes on to judgment.<a name=293:10></a> In Christ he is revealing the thoughts of His heart.<a name=293:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we get His own intentions before ever the world was; the purposes and counsels of God, which were not in the first Adam at all, but in the last.<a name=293:12></a> That runs through the whole of scripture from the very beginning.<a name=293:13></a> As soon as ever man had sinned, grace opens the door to reveal it: there was the seed of the woman that was to bruise the serpent's head.<a name=293:14></a> Adam was not the seed of the woman.<a name=293:15></a> The promise did not refer to the first man at all, nor was it a promise to him; but it was a revelation that there was one coming, the seed of the woman, who should bruise the serpent's head and destroy his power.<a name=293:16></a> Therefore there was ground for faith to lay hold upon.<a name=293:17></a> Promises and prophets were always referring to the same thing.<a name=293:18></a> "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed": "To him give all the prophets witness.<a name=293:19></a>" Prophets had to deal with men, and bring the law to their consciences; but here is one in whom all the thoughts and counsels of God rest, and in grace to poor sinners -- "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of God by us.<a name=293:20></a>" "All things are for your sakes," though all surely for God's glory.<a name=293:21></a>

		Another thing in connection with it is, that it is only when we come to Christ, that we can reconcile the purposes of God in the full blessing of life, and man's responsibility.<a name=294:1></a> Heathens and Christians have disputed over it.<a name=294:2></a> In the garden of Eden there was the tree of life, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil: life on the one side, responsibility on the other.<a name=294:3></a> Man failed, ate of the tree of knowledge, and could not get to the tree of life.<a name=294:4></a> Now the law took up the same principle -- here again you have responsibility and life -- and said, "Do this and live.<a name=294:5></a>" The Lord Jesus Christ, the second Man comes, does His Father's will in everything, and sovereign grace takes up our responsibilities; He takes the consequences of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and He is the life.<a name=294:6></a> He bears the consequences of responsibility in His own body on the tree.<a name=294:7></a> It perfectly meets all our need, and a great deal more -- God is perfectly glorified; and we get eternal life in Him, and the joy and blessing of it all in the full result of all these counsels of God, to be conformed to the image of His Son: nothing short of this.<a name=294:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Though the responsibility is proved, yet to be like the Son of God in glory has nothing to do with my responsibility.<a name=294:9></a> No man could have dared to think of such a thing; but it was the mind and counsel of God in Christ.<a name=294:10></a> It did not come out till after the cross, for we could not have had any part in it but by the cross.<a name=294:11></a> Before ever the world was, it was the thought of God to have a saved and redeemed people brought into the same place as, and associated with, Christ.<a name=294:12></a> Of course the preeminence is His.<a name=294:13></a> "Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness <i>above</i> thy fellows.<a name=294:14></a>" Who could pretend to be the "fellow" of the Son of God, if it were not the fruit of the work of the Son of God?<a name=294:15></a> The mind of God rested on Him in connection with man.<a name=294:16></a>

		The first Adam is totally set aside, having been tested, tried, and proved, up to the cross; then the Second Man is brought in.<a name=295:1></a> God never would set up the last Adam along with the first: the first Adam was a fallen man, the last was the man of God's counsels, and He sets Him up instead, when we had failed in our responsibility.<a name=295:2></a> Titus lays down (Titus 1: 1, 2, 3) the other principle.<a name=295:3></a> "In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised <i>before the world began</i>.<a name=295:4></a>" Then it was the hope of eternal life.<a name=295:5></a> 2 Timothy 1: 9 gives the same truth: "Who hath saved us .<a name=295:6></a>.<a name=295:7></a>.<a name=295:8></a> not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus <i>before the world began</i>.<a name=295:9></a>" These thoughts and purposes of God were given us in Christ Jesus before ever the world was.<a name=295:10></a> Now if you look for a moment at Proverbs 8, you find a remarkable passage connected with this.<a name=295:11></a> There I see that before the world was created, Christ was there as wisdom, daily the Father's delight, and having His delights in the sons of men ("delight" is the same thought as "good pleasure").<a name=295:12></a>

		Luke 7: 29-50
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is one of the passages, found here and there in Scripture, which brings out in strong relief the grace of God, and what is in man's heart too.<a name=304:1></a>
	</div>

		Here we get the Pharisee, this poor sinner, and the Lord Himself.<a name=304:2></a> We see these three characters, these three hearts all together: the man righteous in his own eyes; a person outwardly in wickedness; and then the heart of God, and the way in which He looks at and judges these two cases.<a name=304:3></a>

		What precedes in the history is this: John the Baptist sends two of his disciples to ask, "Art thou he that should come; or look we for another?<a name=304:4></a>" (verse 19), and this gives occasion to the Lord to speak of God's ways and dealings, the principles of which are of all importance to us.<a name=304:5></a> John had come with his solemn testimony, but the conscience did not bow to it.<a name=304:6></a> Then came the gracious testimony of Christ, but the heart was not moved by it.<a name=304:7></a> "But wisdom is justified of all her children.<a name=304:8></a>" God's ways, whether in the testimony of John the Baptist, or in that of the Lord Jesus, are justified by the children of wisdom.<a name=304:9></a> The Pharisee is here, and the poor sinner: then comes the question, which is the child of wisdom?<a name=304:10></a>

		In this chapter we have the blessed ways of God's grace in dealing with a sinner.<a name=333:1></a> Jesus is here in a world where sin is, and here to bring in grace which is above all the sin.<a name=333:2></a> But it is more: it is the soul brought to worship the Father in the blessed relationship in which the Son of God was here to reveal Him; and not only so, but to worship Him as <i>God</i>, who in His nature is revealed.<a name=333:3></a> "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.<a name=333:4></a>" It is thus a soul brought to the personal knowledge of God, in the relationship of grace as the Father, revealed by the Son.<a name=333:5></a> It is, consequently, the same knowledge as we shall have in heaven.<a name=333:6></a> It is not one kind of knowledge here, and another in heaven.<a name=333:7></a> No doubt there is growth in intelligence, I admit all that; but as to what is revealed, and the One who is revealed, there is no difference between what is known now and what will be known in heaven, because it is the same God and Father we shall know for ever.<a name=333:8></a>

		When we turn to the woman's thoughts of worship, all was confused.<a name=333:9></a> She speaks of the Samaritan's worship, and the Jew's worship, and she knew not what she worshipped.<a name=333:10></a> In fact, she only speaks of worship to turn the conversation when the Lord began to probe her heart.<a name=333:11></a> There must be salvation known before there can be any true worship.<a name=333:12></a> You cannot worship a God you do not know, and whose presence would cause you to fly from Him as Adam did in the garden.<a name=333:13></a> It is not questioning the fact that God is to be worshipped by His creatures -- of course He is.<a name=333:14></a> It is due to Him -- your duty to Him.<a name=333:15></a> Quite right to own and feel the obligation; but the thing is, you are unable to do it because you are a sinner.<a name=333:16></a> The only worship that man can offer is Cain's worship, which originated in hardness of heart.<a name=333:17></a> He was so indifferent to his condition as one banished from Paradise, and the ground cursed for his sake, that he brings the very fruit of that curse as an offering to God.<a name=333:18></a>

		Mark, it is quite right to worship, but you must be in a state to do so.<a name=333:19></a> But you find some men acting in ignorance of this.<a name=333:20></a> They own the duty to worship God, without any sense of their state as sinners before God.<a name=333:21></a> It is quite the same with the law.<a name=333:22></a> Of course it is a duty to obey the law of God.<a name=333:23></a> But if a man takes the ground of keeping it, he has denied his condition as a sinner.<a name=333:24></a> He owns the duty, but does not own what God's word declares: "There is none righteous, no, not one.<a name=333:25></a> There is none that seeketh after God.<a name=333:26></a>" "In me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth <i>no good</i> thing.<a name=333:27></a>" It is like a child whose place is to be in his father's arms; but he has been very naughty.<a name=333:28></a> Of course he ought to be in his father's arms, but what he ought not to do is to think that he can be there as if nothing had happened.<a name=333:29></a> It is hardness of heart if he does not see this.<a name=333:30></a>

		Now, God took care that when man ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, he should get a conscience.<a name=334:1></a> Persons talk of the law written in the heart of man, and all that fine kind of thing, but man got his conscience by his fall.<a name=334:2></a> It may be terribly blunted, and nothing deadens it more than false religion, but still there it is in every one -- a blessed thing that it is so, for God works on it to bring the soul to know what God is, when He deals with the sinner in grace.<a name=334:3></a> But it is a mistake to mix up conscience and the law.<a name=334:4></a> If there had been no law, man would have known good and evil.<a name=334:5></a> Do you not think a son would have known he had done wrong to murder a father, though he had never heard of the commandments?<a name=334:6></a> If a boy pilfers from his comrade at school he knows he will get into a scrape if found out, but he knows, too, the thing is wrong in itself.<a name=334:7></a> Conscience in a man makes him know good and evil, and the law coming in only tacks on God's authority to conscience.<a name=334:8></a>

		Before Adam fell he had not the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=334:9></a> There was nothing evil in eating the fruit unless God forbade him.<a name=334:10></a> There was no harm in the thing itself, but forbidding it was solely an expression of God's will, and he got the knowledge of good and evil by disobeying God and eating of the tree.<a name=334:11></a> It is a blessed thing that man has this conscience, for it is what God works upon in grace to bring in the revelation of Himself.<a name=334:12></a> Nothing perverts this knowledge of good and evil more than false religion; still, however depraved, conscience is there, and the effect of the revelation of God to the soul is, to bring into the conscience the remembrance of all that wherein we have sinned against Him.<a name=334:13></a> Therefore, to draw near as a worshipper, I must know that work whereby God has put away sin, and how I have entirely got freed from sin by the work of Christ.<a name=334:14></a> As we read in Hebrews, "That the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins.<a name=334:15></a>"

		Now, dear friends, till your conscience is thus purged you cannot worship God.<a name=335:1></a> I do not say there may not be craving desires -- a going out of the heart after Christ -- all that I grant.<a name=335:2></a> But there can be no worship till you have salvation.<a name=335:3></a> How is it thus with you?<a name=335:4></a> Are there not some here whose consciences are not purged?<a name=335:5></a> Well, you take up a kind of worship; you profess to draw near to God, but you would fly from Him if He were to come in where you are carrying on your worship.<a name=335:6></a> Mark, I do not say <i>He</i> would drive you out; you would run away from Him.<a name=335:7></a> Just as with Adam; the voice of God walking in the garden did not drive Adam out; he ran away and hid himself in the trees of the garden.<a name=335:8></a>

		Now, just take the Lord's prayer as a simple illustration.<a name=335:9></a> You say it; it is what you have been taught from your childhood -- the kind of habits we have all been brought up in.<a name=335:10></a> Mark, I do not accuse you of insincerity, but I ask you, when you call God your Father, do you know Him in this relationship?<a name=335:11></a> Oh no, you say, I could not take that ground.<a name=335:12></a> Then you are none of God's children!<a name=335:13></a> Again, with the words, "Thy kingdom come.<a name=335:14></a>" What do you mean by the Father's kingdom?<a name=335:15></a> Why, you have not one distinct idea about it; all is vagueness.<a name=335:16></a> Well, if that kingdom comes it will be heavenly glory, but the day of judgment must precede it.<a name=335:17></a> Are you ready for that?<a name=335:18></a> No!<a name=335:19></a> you cannot say you are saved from "the wrath to come.<a name=335:20></a>" I take the Lord's prayer as a common illustration of what your worshipping God really comes to.<a name=335:21></a> You own the duty, but you have got a conscience which would make you flee from the presence of God whom you profess to worship.<a name=335:22></a>

		In this chapter the Lord had gone away from Judea into Samaria because He was rejected.<a name=335:23></a> God was in the world, come there in grace, and the world would not have Him.<a name=335:24></a> The chapter opens with His leaving Judea -- the place of which He says in this chapter?<a name=335:25></a> "Salvation is of the Jews.<a name=335:26></a>" We begin, then, with a rejected Christ.<a name=335:27></a> There is no gospel without a rejected Christ.<a name=335:28></a> If you call yourselves Christians you are owning this.<a name=335:29></a> For you own that Christ has been crucified, and what does that mean but that the world has rejected and turned Him out.<a name=335:30></a> As the prophet says of the way the nation treated Him, "Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?<a name=335:31></a>" "He is despised and rejected of men, and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him.<a name=335:32></a>" Put 'Christian' for 'Jew,' and it is just the same story now.<a name=335:33></a> I do not say that there may not be the outward confession of His name, and respect, too, to the outward cross.<a name=335:34></a> But if you are honest you will say of your heart, 'It does not desire him.<a name=335:35></a>' You know this is as sure of you as it was of the Jews.<a name=335:36></a> You may have the outward form of Christianity, but you know you have no desires after Christ.<a name=335:37></a> When you are alone do you find your heart going out in love for Him?<a name=335:38></a> Even a Christian finds it hard to keep this desire for Christ fresh, for he has the flesh in him, and the flesh has no desire after Christ.<a name=335:39></a> The Lord says to His disciples when the Comforter comes, "He shall convince the world of sin, because they believe not on me.<a name=335:40></a>" It is not a class of sinners, but the whole world is under sin, proved guilty all alike of the rejection of Christ; and if an individual is taken up in grace like the woman here, the same thing comes out in detail.<a name=335:41></a> She is convinced of her sins in the presence of Christ.<a name=335:42></a>

		In verses 21-23 he goes into the work of the Father and the Son in two distinct things.<a name=344:3></a> There are two great ways in which the glory of the Son is displayed.<a name=344:4></a> The Father quickens, and the Son quickens whom He will; and now mark: we are dead in sin and the Father comes and quickens, the Son too.<a name=344:5></a> But it is not so when it comes to <i>judgment</i>.<a name=344:6></a> The Father has not been incarnate here, spit upon and trampled on.<a name=344:7></a> The Father judges no man, and He has secured in this way that all should honour the Son even as they honour the Father, by committing all judgment to Him.<a name=344:8></a> They have blessed fellowship in quickening souls, but the Son having come down as Son of man, having been outraged and insulted by everything man could do when he got the chance, all judgment is committed to the Son.<a name=344:9></a> Every knee shall bow; things in heaven, on the earth, and under the earth: no matter how wicked or how infidel and rebellious, he will have to bow to Christ just the same as any saint, though in a very different way.<a name=344:10></a> Thus we get the Father and the Son both giving life -- a divine work and power exercised in our favour; and then we get judgment -- the way of securing honour for the Son; the Father judges no man, but puts it all into His hands.<a name=344:11></a>

		And now comes this solemn question, beloved friends: In which way have <i>I</i> to do with the Son?<a name=344:12></a> In quickening or in judgment?<a name=344:13></a> as the blessed One who loved me and gave Himself for me, washing me in His blood, or as the One who is executing judgment because I would not own Him?<a name=344:14></a> To this God gives an answer in His own blessed way: "He that heareth my word and believeth him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but is passed from death unto life.<a name=344:15></a>" Those that believe do not come into judgment, do not come into Christ's second way of dealing.<a name=344:16></a> The thing is <i>done</i>.<a name=344:17></a> Christ has wrought in His blessed quickening grace, and the judgment is <i>over</i>.<a name=344:18></a> We are not called in question, because the place, the life, the condition we have, are the effect of the work of the Father and the Son, and He will not call <i>that</i> in question.<a name=344:19></a>

		There were three great feasts among the Jews, three very important ones to which all the males had to go up, all gathering round God.<a name=350:7></a> The passover, to which they all went, though it had not so much the character of rejoicing, and the feast of weeks, and the feast of ingathering.<a name=350:8></a> The passover had not so much the character of rejoicing; it was rather God in His character of Judge passing over them.<a name=350:9></a> So the unleavened bread that followed the passover was called the "bread of affliction.<a name=350:10></a>" God is the God of holiness, so He must have holiness.<a name=350:11></a> So after the passover each person went to his own tent; there was no rejoicing, or anything of that sort.<a name=350:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the other two feasts they were to go with an offering in their hands, and to rejoice before the Lord with their sons and their daughters, their manservants and their maid-servants, the Levites, the strangers, the fatherless, and the widows.<a name=350:13></a> They were to rejoice in their feast and all others with them.<a name=350:14></a> And in this feast which we have in John, when the harvest was over, when the discriminating judgment of God had taken place, they were to dwell in tents, and with the fatherless and the widows they were to rejoice.<a name=350:15></a> They were in rest.<a name=350:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first, the passover, was just escaping out of judgment; the next is the enjoyment of the first-fruits; and then the getting into the rest of God, the full thing; God had blessed them in <i>everything</i>.<a name=350:17></a> That is the one that we get here.<a name=350:18></a> The Pentecost does not connect itself with this, though of course everything is connected with the passover.<a name=350:19></a> Here they are not escaping from the condition they were in, but they are in the living enjoyment of the condition they are brought into, of that which God has brought them into.<a name=350:20></a>

		This is what we have to look at in our worship: we should be enjoying more what God has brought us into.<a name=350:21></a> We have to watch that our worship should not be only the remembrance of what we have been brought out of, but the enjoyment of that into which we have been brought.<a name=350:22></a> Here it is all joy, and rest and blessedness.<a name=350:23></a> You will find in Leviticus that it is all connected with the people being brought out of the land of Egypt.<a name=350:24></a> It is all one thing -- the passover, of course, is the foundation of everything; but besides this, I see that man has got into this perfect place of blessing: of our bodies it is not true yet, of course; they belong to this old creation; but in the new man we are connected with Christ up there.<a name=350:25></a> And our place down here is that of having the Holy Ghost, who takes of the things of Christ and shews them to us.<a name=350:26></a> But it is all connected with the passover, with the feast of unleavened bread, and that was connected with the Sabbath; though it began the evening before the Sabbath, it went on after Satan's power and death and judgment were all over, passed and gone.<a name=350:27></a>

		Thus we have poor bodies, bodies of humiliation, but we have got the Holy Ghost, and therefore "our conversation is in heaven.<a name=352:6></a>" And that word means all the associations, everything belonging to a man; as we say, "That man is a Dublin man"; which means that his family, his business, his belongings are in Dublin; so our place and belongings are in heaven, and we are just looking and waiting for Him to come and take us up there.<a name=352:7></a> For the Holy Ghost comes down, not only to associate me with Christ risen, but with Christ glorified.<a name=352:8></a> We are not yet in it, but, where the heart thirsts, it already gets full satisfaction there; otherwise people are thirsting after other things, and there is a famine in the land.<a name=352:9></a> Wherever the flesh works there is thirst; there is no such thing as the new nature thirsting.<a name=352:10></a> When a man has once come to Christ and drunk, then "out of his belly flow rivers of living water.<a name=352:11></a>"

		You see the Holy Ghost is the source of life.<a name=352:12></a> We are "born of the Spirit" in chapter 3; in chapter 4 we get the full purpose of the Spirit in worship; and here it is flowing forth from the believer as "rivers of living water.<a name=352:13></a>" We have the full power and life and liberty of the Holy Ghost in spite of all that is around us in this world.<a name=352:14></a> So we have it instead of the feast of tabernacles.<a name=352:15></a> The Jews will have the literal thing soon, but with us it is entirely heavenly.<a name=352:16></a>

		It is to be remarked that in this part of the gospel of John you get, not the sovereignty of grace towards us which saves, but our individual responsibility and blessing consequent upon our known relationship with the Father as we walk in this place.<a name=371:1></a> Christ is looking for their walk as disciples consequent upon their position as clean through His word.<a name=371:2></a> "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself unto him.<a name=371:3></a>" This is the order here.<a name=371:4></a>

		Therefore, when I find this first truth, that Christ has us on His heart, and can speak to His Father, about us -- that we are become the object of their common interest, surely our hearts should turn to it.<a name=376:10></a> "These things," He said, "I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves" (verse 13).<a name=376:11></a> The character of Christ's love, being perfect, was to bring us into the same blessing with Himself.<a name=376:12></a> It is very true, but it is not all the truth, that we are blessed <i>through</i> Christ: we are blessed <i>with</i> Him, and that was the perfection of His love.<a name=376:13></a> He loves us enough to have us near Him, and have us all in the perfectness of His own heart; and having opened our understandings to see what He is, He gives us the consciousness of His own perfect love.<a name=376:14></a> "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<a name=376:15></a>" If I always saw perfect blessedness before me, with the consciousness at the same time that I never should have it, that would not give comfort to my heart; but if I have a perfect object before me, with a certainty that I shall possess it, I shall be occupied with that object.<a name=376:16></a> Whilst here below we have the consciousness in looking at our blessing in Christ, that we are not perfectly like what He is; we desire it, we long to be conformed to the image of Christ.<a name=376:17></a> But still, if we have in any measure tasted the loveliness of Christ, what distresses the heart is that we are not like Him.<a name=376:18></a> But here Christ engages the affections, and brings the heart to this point -- the consciousness that this is our place in Him before God, and that all the blessedness that He has is ours.<a name=376:19></a> Does it become us to say no?<a name=376:20></a> Is it humbleness to be short of that, to say we are unworthy?<a name=376:21></a> Is God right?<a name=376:22></a> But it is no humbleness to refuse grace.<a name=376:23></a> And then, when it is seen to be such grace -- unmingled grace -- it is no humbleness to speak of not being fit to have such things.<a name=376:24></a> If I talk about not being <i>quite</i> worthy, there is the thought that if I were worthier I should be fit to have these blessings.<a name=376:25></a> Here is just where the want of humbleness is.<a name=376:26></a> You ought to be on the right ground with the Lord.<a name=376:27></a> That which enables us to have this thought and desire of being brought into the presence and blessing of God, and to be like Christ, is, that all is grace; we are nothing.<a name=376:28></a> If we look at the glory that is before us, it at once puts out the thought of all worthiness in ourselves.<a name=376:29></a>

		First, then, look at the way in which He introduces us into this place.<a name=378:1></a> You will see in the first few verses that it is a question of Himself being glorified: "These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, .<a name=378:2></a>.<a name=378:3></a>.<a name=378:4></a> glorify thy Son: .<a name=378:5></a>.<a name=378:6></a>.<a name=378:7></a> as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .<a name=378:8></a>.<a name=378:9></a>.<a name=378:10></a> .<a name=378:11></a> I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.<a name=378:12></a> And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.<a name=378:13></a>" Now there are two thoughts which the Lord brings out here.<a name=378:14></a> He says, "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee" -- that is the title which His Person gives Him to this glory.<a name=378:15></a> And the other is, "I have glorified thee on the earth," etc.<a name=378:16></a>; "And now, O Father, glorify thou me," etc.<a name=378:17></a>; that is, the Lord presents these two grounds on which He is asking for His glory as man.<a name=378:18></a> He is glorified in virtue of His Person, and then glorified in virtue of His work.<a name=378:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in connection with both these titles that we have to see our place on earth.<a name=378:20></a> He takes His place with the Father in virtue of His own personal title, and in virtue of His accomplished work.<a name=378:21></a> There is the basis which He lays for our admission into this place of blessing; and at the close He says, "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.<a name=378:22></a>" The love wherewith the Father had loved Christ should be in the disciples.<a name=378:23></a> They should enjoy it; they should have His joy fulfilled in themselves.<a name=378:24></a> It is this that we are called to: the enjoyment in this world of the love that Christ knew here below -- of His Father's love.<a name=378:25></a> He was there the Son of God, as man in this world; and what was His delight?<a name=378:26></a> Was it from the world?<a name=378:27></a> Surely not.<a name=378:28></a> Was He of the world?<a name=378:29></a> He was not.<a name=378:30></a> He was walking in the world; but His character and place while there was as the Son of the Father.<a name=378:31></a> There was His joy; not from the world, any more than He was of it, but from the Father.<a name=378:32></a> <i>There</i> was His constant blessedness.<a name=378:33></a> The wellspring of His delight in a world that hated Him was the constant inflowing of the Father's love to Him.<a name=378:34></a> He was His beloved Son, in whom He was well pleased.<a name=378:35></a> Now the first point is, how such as we are can get into such a place.<a name=378:36></a> The Lord always retained the perfect consciousness of His Father's love.<a name=378:37></a> How can a sinner get there?<a name=378:38></a> Though He had declared His Father's name to the disciples (take, for an example, the sermon on the mount), did they understand it?<a name=378:39></a> No; they had not the Spirit of adoption.<a name=378:40></a> He revealed the name and character of the Father, but their hearts did not enter into this relationship.<a name=378:41></a> Christ, as man walking down here, was the Son of man which is in heaven.<a name=378:42></a> His Person gives Him this title.<a name=378:43></a> He walks through this world in suffering and trial.<a name=378:44></a> He suffers from man for righteousness' sake, and for love's sake.<a name=378:45></a> But whatever the suffering through which He was passing, He always addressed God as His Father during all the time of His life in this world; every expression of His heart was of His conscious relationship to God as Father.<a name=378:46></a> But when He comes to the cross, it is, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=378:47></a>" Upon the cross, all that God was in His holy hatred of sin fell on Christ for our sakes; and hence it was not then a question of love and fellowship; but all else that God was, His holiness, truth, majesty, righteousness, all was against Him, because in the cross He was as the One made sin for us.<a name=378:48></a> The one other thing in God's nature was His love, and that Christ necessarily could not then taste; therefore, on the cross, He does not say <i>Father</i>, but it is, "My God, my God!<a name=378:49></a>" Afterwards, when just expiring, He does say, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.<a name=378:50></a>" Never was He more perfect, never more acceptable to God, than on the cross.<a name=378:51></a> God was a debtor in that sense to Christ; for His character was brought out as it never had been before.<a name=378:52></a> If God had merely swept away all men in anger, there would have been no love; if He had spared all in mercy, there would have been no righteousness.<a name=378:53></a> But Christ giving Himself up to death, and to the bearing of God's wrath on the cross, there is perfect righteousness against sin, and perfect love to the sinner.<a name=378:54></a> God was there fully glorified in all that He was.<a name=378:55></a> And now, the whole question of sin being settled, and all Christ was being proved in the resurrection -- He says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren.<a name=378:56></a>" The Lord Jesus then comes, having been heard and answered in resurrection; and now He says, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God"; that is, He brings out both these names now: the relationship in which He had been as a Son with the Father all His life long, and the full effect of all that God was as such, which He had borne as wrath against sin, He now brings out as entirely for us.<a name=378:57></a> If it is a question of God's righteousness, we are made the righteousness of God in Christ.<a name=378:58></a> If it is His love, we are loved with the same love with which Christ was loved.<a name=378:59></a> Grace is reigning through righteousness by Jesus Christ.<a name=378:60></a> Everything that the Father can be towards sons that He delights in -- as He was to Christ, so He reveals Himself to us.<a name=378:61></a> Sin is put entirely away, and by the very word of Christ Himself the disciples are even brought, by the efficacy of His work of redemption, into a place along with Himself.<a name=378:62></a> He declares His name unto His brethren, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father"; and He puts them in this place after death and judgment have been gone through, and He is risen out of them.<a name=378:63></a> While Christ was upon earth He remained entirely alone, because the atonement was not made.<a name=378:64></a> "Except a corn of wheat.<a name=378:65></a> fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.<a name=378:66></a>" But He has died, and now He can bring them into the place belonging to Himself; and that is what He is doing now.<a name=378:67></a> Did sin hinder it?<a name=378:68></a> Yes; but it is put away.<a name=378:69></a> Did righteousness?<a name=378:70></a> Yes; but it is for them and for us.<a name=378:71></a>

		If we speak of the sufferings of Christ, there were two kinds of suffering, quite distinct one from the other.<a name=380:1></a> In one sense He went through every possible kind of suffering.<a name=380:2></a> He suffered from man for righteousness' sake, and He suffered from God for sin's sake.<a name=380:3></a> The suffering from God for sin He took for us entirely alone; He suffered it that we might not suffer it.<a name=380:4></a> He took it fully -- drank the cup to the very dregs, and it is done with.<a name=380:5></a> In His sufferings for righteousness' sake, He gives us the privilege of suffering with Him.<a name=380:6></a> "Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.<a name=380:7></a>" If we suffer from man for righteousness' sake, there we are with Him; but with suffering for sin we have nothing to do.<a name=380:8></a> He has taken it entirely alone: not one drop is left; no particle or trace of it remains for us.<a name=380:9></a> He took it that we might never have it.<a name=380:10></a> And now, having done that, He takes another place, in which man, as man, must necessarily remain a stranger to Him.<a name=380:11></a> But the fact, that Christ is gone up on high, is the reason why I can be with Him.<a name=380:12></a> When He was upon earth, I could not be in any full sense <i>with</i> Him.<a name=380:13></a> Why?<a name=380:14></a> Because He was holy, and I was not.<a name=380:15></a> But when sin has been put away, and He is gone into heaven, and has taken a place there in the presence of God, He has done that by which <i>I</i> can draw near.<a name=380:16></a> He has gone into the presence of God, and gives me a title to be there (Hebrews 10: 19, 20).<a name=380:17></a> Thus, the glory in which Christ is, which He has entered as having accomplished redemption, enables me to be with Him, instead of being a hindrance.<a name=380:18></a> I never could be with Him, if He had not been in this glory.<a name=380:19></a> He might visit us in mercy, but it is as risen from the dead and gone up on high that He gives us the place of union with Himself before God.<a name=380:20></a>

		What He is doing now, is to reveal this name of the Father to us.<a name=381:1></a> When He spoke to Abraham He said, "I am the Almighty God; walk before me.<a name=381:2></a>" God revealed Himself in a character on which Abraham's faith was to act: it is the revelation of Himself as the One who was all-powerful, whatever might be the difficulties of the path; and Abraham was to live by faith in that name.<a name=381:3></a> He says to Moses, "I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.<a name=381:4></a>" Now He takes this name with Israel: He puts Himself in relation with Israel by the name of Jehovah.<a name=381:5></a> He was the unchanging One, who would be faithful to His word and oath, however many the changes that Israel might have to pass through.<a name=381:6></a> He was thus a perfect Protector; He was the Almighty One; He was Jehovah; but that is not what I want, blessed as it is in its place.<a name=381:7></a> I want eternal life.<a name=381:8></a> But He comes now with another name.<a name=381:9></a> The Son reveals the Father's name.<a name=381:10></a> If I have found this, that the Father has sent the Son to be a Saviour, and that this work is accomplished, I say this is not now merely a Faithful and Almighty Protector, or the one true God that governs the world righteously: He is interested in my salvation.<a name=381:11></a> He takes this place of a Father to me, if I receive His Son.<a name=381:12></a> I get in Christ the revelation of my place with God, and that, consequent upon the blessed truth that He has taken away the sin that shut me out from the presence of God, and has gone up before the Father, that I may have the very same place that belongs to Him as the Son of the Father.<a name=381:13></a> Can I possibly have more than that?<a name=381:14></a> Yet there is even more than that.<a name=381:15></a> In virtue of it, there is the Comforter sent down.<a name=381:16></a> "If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<a name=381:17></a>" The Holy Ghost comes down because of Christ's being exalted at the right hand of God.<a name=381:18></a> He becomes the Spirit of adoption.<a name=381:19></a> "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.<a name=381:20></a>" So that the place in which we find Christ thus glorified, we find the believer set in, as this righteousness presented to God.<a name=381:21></a> The Holy Ghost is given as that which seals me, and gives me the power and blessing of the place into which Christ has brought me.<a name=381:22></a> "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.<a name=381:23></a>" There is the relationship.<a name=381:24></a> Then there is the work, "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.<a name=381:25></a>" He asks then that the Father should glorify Him, and adds, "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world .<a name=381:26></a>.<a name=381:27></a>.<a name=381:28></a> .<a name=381:29></a> Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.<a name=381:30></a>" It was not merely what Messiah received from God, but what the Son had from the Father, that was made known to them.<a name=381:31></a> And He adds, "I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them," etc.<a name=381:32></a>

		Two things you will find connected with the position in which the disciples are thus set; first, that which ministers to their joy, and then the place which they have as witnesses for Him in the world.<a name=382:1></a> He has communicated to them all the means of this joy: "I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me.<a name=382:2></a>" "Henceforth," as He said before, "I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you friends: for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<a name=382:3></a>" Now He puts us in the place of sons, and as sons the words that the Father gives Him He makes known unto us.<a name=382:4></a> What Christ does is to bring us into the enjoyment of His own relationship and place with God.<a name=382:5></a> The first thing He does is to secure our being in it by this work of atonement.<a name=382:6></a> Then, having wrought this, the next thing is to give us the name by which we are called to know God as the Father; and accordingly He gives us the words of the Father, that we may have the joy of this place in which He has set us.<a name=382:7></a> "I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine .<a name=382:8></a>.<a name=382:9></a>.<a name=382:10></a> .<a name=382:11></a> Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<a name=382:12></a>" He puts them under the shelter of the name "holy Father.<a name=382:13></a>" He looked for them to be kept with all the Father's tenderness; that is, they are in this world under this name of holy Father.<a name=382:14></a> And then He presents these two motives to His Father for keeping them: first, "for they are <i>thine</i>"; and the other is, "I am glorified in them.<a name=382:15></a>"

		THE RESPONSIBLE MAN, AND THE MAN OF PURPOSE

	<div class="paragraph">
		John 17
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I notice first in this chapter that there is responsibility, but of an entirely new order; a responsibility which is connected with Christ, and which He has discharged; "I have glorified thee on the earth," "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world": a responsibility which in righteousness towards God, and in grace to us, has put us into the same place as Himself.<a name=389:1></a> The Word has come down to us; and words have been brought, and we have believed them, and have known surely, as Jesus said, "that I came out from God.<a name=389:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we think of what was previously given by Moses, the law; it was but the measure of man, come down to the earth, and which claimed from man what he ought to be: a perfect rule for man.<a name=389:3></a> It was connected necessarily with responsibility, but the responsibility of the creature, and in which he failed; God was hidden behind it -- He not coming to man, nor man to Him.<a name=389:4></a> But under it man fails.<a name=389:5></a> Then because of this breakdown, "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," but came in when this need was thus made plain.<a name=389:6></a> Man failed in paradise, and failed out of paradise.<a name=389:7></a> He failed upon the question of righteousness by law; and rejected Christ come in grace.<a name=389:8></a> If we look at Jew or Gentile, we see Christ taking up <i>this</i> responsibility too before God, and putting away sin for us, by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=389:9></a> He dies and closes up the whole scene in which that responsibility was.<a name=389:10></a> All is summed up in the words of Jesus, "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.<a name=389:11></a>"

		Another thing is stated in this chapter, "I have glorified thee on the earth.<a name=389:12></a>" He came into the world not only as a man, but as the heir of promises; and they rejected Him in whom these promises were, as the promised seed.<a name=389:13></a> But He has secured the <i>promises</i> by the cross; and also laid the foundation for the eternal <i>purposes</i> of God in His death and resurrection.<a name=389:14></a> He who came with all the promises of God in His hand was rejected and killed.<a name=389:15></a> Salvation on God's part is the answer to this wickedness on man's.<a name=389:16></a> It was not merely that man was a sinner, but all that God would do for a sinner was refused -- "Last of all he sent unto them his Son.<a name=389:17></a>" My soul and conscience are cleared by the very blood which was the proof of my sin and guilt.<a name=389:18></a> The purpose which was before the world can now be brought out, for righteousness has come in, and Christ as man has got a place in the glory of God, because He deserves it!<a name=389:19></a> This is the righteous foundation of the purposes of God; and He is there too in a work done for us.<a name=389:20></a>

		In Luke 15 the great principle set for this, that it is God's happiness when we are brought back to Him.<a name=393:21></a> Of course the joy of the restored one comes in, but is not the primary thing.<a name=393:22></a> The object of all three parables is not to shew our joy, but the joy of God in our restoration.<a name=393:23></a> The three parables all teach the same grace, but we get, I believe, the joy of the Son, of the Spirit, and of the Father.<a name=393:24></a> But remark, that in the two first we find a grace which finds and brings back what was lost, without any further question of the state of the soul.<a name=393:25></a> In the third we have man's departure even into the lowest degradation of sin, and what passes in his soul on his return, till he is clothed in divine righteousness, with Christ in His Father's house.<a name=393:26></a> God has foreseen and provided for the whole case of the sinner.<a name=393:27></a> The younger son was as really a sinner when he left his Father's house as when he was eating husks with the swine.<a name=393:28></a> He had abandoned God to do his own will.<a name=393:29></a> But the Lord pursues the case to the full degradation of sin, for sin degrades man.<a name=393:30></a> The young man comes to himself, turns back towards God, is converted; but he has not yet met God, nor has he the best robe on him.<a name=393:31></a> He did not know in his conscience divine righteousness.<a name=393:32></a> When he really meets his father, not only is he in tender love -- only the more shewn because he has been lost -- received when in his rags into his father's arms, but he is made righteously fit for the house, clothed with Christ.<a name=393:33></a> His father was on his neck when he was in his rags, but he was not received into the house in that state; he could not have been.<a name=393:34></a> But God has provided for the sinner what Adam in his innocence had not.<a name=393:35></a> He has provided Christ.<a name=393:36></a> Grace reigns through righteousness.<a name=393:37></a> The best robe, no part of the son's portion before he left, is now put on him, and he is fit for the house to which that robe belonged.<a name=393:38></a> All the extent of the soul's departure from God has been weighed.<a name=393:39></a> The soul may be exercised about it, and will till self is wholly given up as a ground on which we can stand with God: no going in legally as a hired servant.<a name=393:40></a> Before God it is rags and exclusion, or the best robe and joyful admission.<a name=393:41></a> All true experiences lead to that emptying of self, and Christ all, and we in Him before God.<a name=393:42></a> Then, as I have said, our peace is as solid as the joy of the thought of forgiveness was blessed, and the joy itself deeper, if not more genuine.<a name=393:43></a>

		THOUGHTS ON GALATIANS 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle has been speaking to the Galatians in chapter 2 as having had a sense of what they had gained in Christ, and now in chapter 3 he has to address them thus: "Who hath bewitched you" -- to make you go back to law when you have been justified not by the works of the law, but in Christ?<a name=398:1></a> It is impossible for a man to be justified by the law.<a name=398:2></a> I cannot live <i>to</i> God till my accounts are settled <i>with</i> God.<a name=398:3></a> I have no fortune to spend until my debts are paid.<a name=398:4></a> The effect of the law being given is to kill man, but the apostle can triumph in the killing power of the law, because it has killed Christ instead of him, "I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.<a name=398:5></a> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live," etc.<a name=398:6></a>

		All the promises were made to Christ, or rather confirmed to Christ.<a name=398:7></a> They were first made to Abraham (Genesis 12) and then there are gospel promises in view of the Gentiles.<a name=398:8></a> It is "thee," not "thee and thy seed," as in Genesis 17, where the nation is spoken of, and which was to be as numerous as the sand on the sea shore.<a name=398:9></a> This is a Jewish promise, but in Genesis 22 it is to Abraham's "seed," not to him and his seed, but to his seed Christ; for Isaac, received back from the dead in a figure, is a type of Christ, and it was to Isaac that the promise was confirmed or ratified, though given to Abraham.<a name=398:10></a> The promises are taken up in Christ, as risen; and this is of the last importance to us, because before they are made over to us, there is a righteousness wrought out for us.<a name=398:11></a> The law comes in meanwhile to raise the question of righteousness, and in such a way as to condemn men.<a name=398:12></a> God was righteous and the question has to be raised on that subject, not as to goodness.<a name=398:13></a> Man could not meet the demands of the law, because it required a perfect righteousness; but Christ could and did, and has put us into the place in which we can receive the promise.<a name=398:14></a> The law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth, but when he is dead, he is freed from that law.<a name=398:15></a> Well then, the law has no more power over me.<a name=398:16></a> If a man who is in prison dies, there can be nothing more done to him.<a name=398:17></a> The apostle not only says "dead to the law," but "crucified with Christ.<a name=398:18></a>" I have died to the law through Christ having died to it.<a name=398:19></a> It killed Christ, and now I live by Christ.<a name=398:20></a> The death of Christ closed the whole scene morally.<a name=398:21></a> It was the end of law, the end of man, the end of the world; and a wholly new scene commenced from that point.<a name=398:22></a>

		There are two ways of looking at righteousness.<a name=399:1></a> If I had kept the law, I should have been a righteous man.<a name=399:2></a> But to keep it I must love God with all my heart, soul, and spirit, and my neighbour as myself.<a name=399:3></a> This is human righteousness, which is never found in any man save in Christ.<a name=399:4></a> The law is founded on the knowledge of good and evil which he got by sinning; then there is a righteousness needed to meet its requirements.<a name=399:5></a> There is another thing needed, which we read of in scripture, and that is, God's righteousness.<a name=399:6></a> All that God is was displayed in Christ; human righteousness was perfect in Him; but there was another thing needed, and this need He met on the cross.<a name=399:7></a> He was not keeping the law on the cross.<a name=399:8></a> If God were to shew perfect righteousness towards sinners, they must die.<a name=399:9></a> Then there would be no love displayed.<a name=399:10></a> But if love were shewn to the sinner irrespective of the question about his sins, there would be no righteousness.<a name=399:11></a> Christ glorified God on the cross in the display of His righteousness and His love.<a name=399:12></a> Then, having thus glorified God, He had a title to be glorified by God, and therefore God raised Him from the dead and set Him at His own right hand in glory.<a name=399:13></a> There is the righteousness of God.<a name=399:14></a> All in which Christ glorified God on the cross, I am accepted in; therefore there is more than the cleansing from my sins, through the blood of Christ.<a name=399:15></a> All the devotedness of Christ to His Father's will as far as death, is accepted of God, and by virtue of God's acceptance of Him, He is at the right hand of God, and in that I stand.<a name=399:16></a> I am as Christ, as Luther has expressed it.<a name=399:17></a>

		The promise is made to Christ (not the Jewish but the original promise of blessing).<a name=400:24></a> God does not make a promise to man as a sinner -- He could not do that; but the serpent is told what He will do to Christ; and Abraham becomes the root through which the promise is to come.<a name=400:25></a> "He saith not unto seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.<a name=400:26></a>" After that the law comes in to shew the utter sinfulness of man: in his lusts, he is corrupt; and in his will, perverse.<a name=400:27></a> Thus man, as to corruption and rebellion, was proved to be bad by the law.<a name=400:28></a> So in 1 Corinthians 15 it is said "the strength of sin is the law.<a name=400:29></a>" It brought out the sin which was there already, because it immediately created the desire to do the thing forbidden.<a name=400:30></a>

		Generally speaking Romans gives us entirely the responsibility of man: we get there no counsels of God before the world began.<a name=403:1></a> God did not <i>begin</i> with bringing out His counsels; He created the first man in responsibility, and He went on with that until the cross.<a name=403:2></a> Then we have the supplementary testimony of Stephen rejected, and then, the foundation having been laid in righteousness, the counsels of God that were before the world was came out.<a name=403:3></a> It is quite a distinct thing, these counsels of God and what He gives, from our responsibility: the history of the first man is the history of our responsibility as such.<a name=403:4></a> There is no reason why I should have the same glory as the Son of God; this has nothing to do with my responsibility.<a name=403:5></a> We get both through the cross -- our responsibility met, and the foundation for the counsels of God laid (2 Timothy 1: 9; Titus 1: 2).<a name=403:6></a> A man's debts may be all paid, and yet he may have nothing.<a name=403:7></a> This is not the way in which God has dealt with us; our debts are paid, and God gives us "to be conformed to the image of his Son" too.<a name=403:8></a>

		There are two characters to be noted in Christian life down here: one is running a race towards glory, as in Philippians 3: 14, "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus": another aspect of Christian life is the manifestation of the life of Christ in the world.<a name=408:1></a> The apostle shews how it is that the Christian thus becomes the manifestation of the life of Jesus.<a name=408:2></a> He is reconciled to God as the starting-point of his course.<a name=408:3></a> Both these characters are real.<a name=408:4></a> We are the epistle of Christ; men are to read Christ in our lives, we are to be the "imitators of God as dear children": there, in Ephesians, we are looked at as seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=408:5></a> On the other hand, in Philippians 3, Paul says, "That I may win Christ .<a name=408:6></a>.<a name=408:7></a>.<a name=408:8></a> if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus": He has laid hold of us for glory.<a name=408:9></a> We are running the race through the wilderness, but sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=408:10></a>

		The apostle puts the law as the ministration of death and condemnation, not from any fault in the law (the law is holy, just, and good), but from fault in us.<a name=409:1></a> The law wrote nothing on men's hearts; it was the testimony of what men ought to do, the perfect rule of what the children of Adam ought to be.<a name=409:2></a> It takes up the general principles of relationship to God and to our neighbour, which were obligatory all through before the law was given, so that "sin by the commandment" became "exceeding sinful.<a name=409:3></a>" The law said, Do this, and live; and if you fail to do it, you will be cursed (Galatians 3: 21).<a name=409:4></a> The law is the perfect maintenance, with the authority of God, of the relationship in which men stand; the righteous measure of what they ought to be: it forbids sins, it forbids lust even.<a name=409:5></a> Paul, as touching the righteousness of the law, was blameless; but when the law said, "Thou shalt not covet," then, as he said in Romans 7, "sin revived, and I died.<a name=409:6></a>" The moment he got hold of the fact, that the law went to the inner man as well as to the outward, it brought death and condemnation.<a name=409:7></a> The law does not tell us what we are; it tells us what we ought to be, and, if it really comes home to my conscience, I know I am not that.<a name=409:8></a>

		Mark, beloved friends, how this righteousness comes in: "When he had by himself purged our sins," He "sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high," Hebrews 1: 3.<a name=411:1></a> That is where I know Him now; that is where I get righteousness -- <i>God's</i> righteousness; I own I have none.<a name=411:2></a> Taking men as men, "there is none righteous, no, not one," Romans 3: 10.<a name=411:3></a> Where is righteousness then?<a name=411:4></a> It is in God: then God must condemn me, as I am a sinner.<a name=411:5></a> People seem to think that, because God is merciful, a man with fifteen sins may be let off, while a man with twenty sins must be condemned.<a name=411:6></a> You let loose thus all the iniquity of man: all sin is condemned of God -- is, and must be so.<a name=411:7></a> People say God is merciful; and that means with them that He is perfectly indifferent to good and evil.<a name=411:8></a> Where am I to find the testimony and witness of this righteousness of God?<a name=411:9></a> In Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=411:10></a> "When he is come, he will convince the world .<a name=411:11></a>.<a name=411:12></a>.<a name=411:13></a> of righteousness, because I go unto my Father, and ye see me no more," John 16: 8-10, The world sees Him no more in that character.<a name=411:14></a> I get righteousness manifested -- how?<a name=411:15></a> By putting Christ, who bore my sins, at the right hand of God.<a name=411:16></a> Christ so perfectly glorified God on the cross, that God in righteousness set that Man at His right hand.<a name=411:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Supposing this righteousness of God places Christ at His right hand, where would the Redeemer be without His redeemed?<a name=411:18></a> This places us there -- not at the right hand of God, that belongs to the Son of God, but in the glory of God.<a name=411:19></a> The gospel is thus the ministration of righteousness.<a name=411:20></a> In it the righteousness of God is revealed, and the sin of man is revealed too.<a name=411:21></a> Wrath being revealed from heaven (Romans 1: 18), in comes God in love to sinners, bringing righteousness, because we had none.<a name=411:22></a> In Christ He brings in eternal life, but divine righteousness too.<a name=411:23></a> The law came, and required human righteousness, but did not get it; sovereign grace in the gospel ministers righteousness to us.<a name=411:24></a>

		There is a second thing in Christianity -- it is "the ministration of the Spirit.<a name=412:1></a>" The moment Christ sat down at the right hand of God (it was ten days after, in fact, but morally speaking it was the same thing), the Holy Ghost came down on the day of Pentecost, and sealed all who believed the gospel.<a name=412:2></a> "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father," Galatians 4: 6.<a name=412:3></a> In virtue of this work of Christ, I, through grace, believing in it, am sealed by the Holy Ghost to the day of glory.<a name=412:4></a> "In whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of the inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory," Ephesians 1: 13, 14.<a name=412:5></a> Mark the effect of the presence of the Holy Ghost here.<a name=412:6></a> I see Christ sitting at the right hand of God; I am between the work of Christ and His coming again, and I have the Holy Ghost, the blessed seal of the efficacy of all He did at His first coming.<a name=412:7></a> I own in myself that I deserve utter condemnation; not only am I guilty, but <i>lost</i>.<a name=412:8></a> It is not a question now of what I can be for God.<a name=412:9></a> The gospel has come, and told me what God did when I was lost.<a name=412:10></a> The love of God is now shed abroad in my heart; I see the infinite love of God.<a name=412:11></a> Who put it into His heart?<a name=412:12></a> He has given the very best thing in heaven out of His own heart to save us, and now He has given His Spirit that we may believe in this love.<a name=412:13></a> That is not all: I find in John 14: 20, "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=412:14></a>" People say that I cannot know; Christ tells me I shall.<a name=412:15></a>

		Further, He is the Spirit of adoption: I know I am in Christ before God, and I know I am a son; I cry "Abba, Father.<a name=412:16></a>" Mark the practical power of this.<a name=412:17></a> Suppose a child with his father; if there is a question as to whether it is his father or not, he cannot have the affections of a child.<a name=412:18></a> A child has a nature capable of those affections, but he cannot have the feelings proper to a child till he knows his father.<a name=412:19></a> We are in the consciousness of relationship: the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.<a name=412:20></a> I know I am in Christ, and Christ is in me, and I cry, "Abba, Father.<a name=412:21></a>" In the gospel of Christ I get the ministration of righteousness from God to me, and I get the ministration of the Spirit; I get the Holy Ghost sealing me for the day of redemption.<a name=412:22></a> There is no question as to love now, for God has given His Son; none as to righteousness, for Christ is at the right hand of God; nor as to relationship, for the Spirit teaches us to cry, "Abba, Father.<a name=412:23></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		We learn here what a Christian is, and how a man comes to be one.<a name=416:1></a> First, we notice what introduces the subject; and next, the circumstance to which the apostle alludes as bringing out the true character of Christianity.<a name=416:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle had been forced, by the attacks of those false Judaizing teachers, who said he was no apostle, to speak of himself, though he is grieved to have to do so.<a name=416:3></a> He began, in the end of the previous chapter to say a few words which lead to this: "We are not as many who corrupt the word of God," etc.<a name=416:4></a> Then he asks, "Do we need letters of commendation to you, or from you?<a name=416:5></a>" He means just such letters of commendation as are given now.<a name=416:6></a> But he tells them, "Ye are our letter of commendation.<a name=416:7></a>" He had them so much on his heart, that, if people asked him for proof of his apostleship, he just said, Look at the Corinthians.<a name=416:8></a> At this time they were going on well; they had received the first epistle, and the apostle had seen Titus, and learnt that it had produced its effect.<a name=416:9></a> They were brought back again to a right walk; his heart was enlarged towards them (chapter 7: 11), and he could say, "Ye are our epistle.<a name=416:10></a>" He could hardly have said so in the first epistle, though he was the means of their conversion.<a name=416:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, he shews how or why they were his letter of commendation.<a name=416:12></a> "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ," etc.<a name=416:13></a> (verse 3).<a name=416:14></a> They recommended Paul, because they recommended Christ.<a name=416:15></a> He then passes to a comparison of this with the law, which introduces the general subject of the chapter.<a name=416:16></a> "Written .<a name=416:17></a>.<a name=416:18></a>.<a name=416:19></a> not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.<a name=416:20></a>" The law of the ten commandments, as we all know, was written on tables of stone; the Corinthian Christians, in contrast with that, had Christ graven on their hearts.<a name=416:21></a> This is what a Christian is: an epistle of recommendation of Christ to the world, by having Christ engraven on his heart by the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=416:22></a> It is spoken of the Corinthians collectively, though it is true also individually.<a name=416:23></a> He does not say, Ye ought to be the epistles of Christ, but "Ye <i>are</i>.<a name=416:24></a>" This was the position they were in.<a name=416:25></a> If I call myself a Christian, even without being one, I am in the position of an epistle of Christ.<a name=416:26></a> My profession, though it be merely profession, is a profession of Christ.<a name=416:27></a> The apostle could hardly have had the heart to say that of the Corinthians, when they were walking badly.<a name=416:28></a> Still they were in that position.<a name=416:29></a> They were before the world to shew out Christ, as it is expressed doctrinally in chapter 4, "that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.<a name=416:30></a>" At the end of this chapter he speaks of it as growth into the image of Christ.<a name=416:31></a> It is the same thing under a different figure.<a name=416:32></a> There, too, we see how it is brought about.<a name=416:33></a>

		To return to how this is introduced.<a name=417:1></a> These Corinthians were a testimony to Paul's ministry -- a letter of commendation of him -- because they were a letter of commendation of Christ before the world, shewing what the power of Christ's life was in a man; his motives entirely changed, and above all that is in the world; a walk of holiness; unselfishness; self-restraint; the power of money gone; a conversation in heaven.<a name=417:2></a> He had alluded to the tables of stone on which the law was written, and he follows out that line of thought in the chapter.<a name=417:3></a> He refers to the fact that, when Moses came down from the mount the second time, his face shone, so that the people could not look at him, and asked him to put a veil upon his face.<a name=417:4></a> That veil is done away in Christ; nevertheless it is still upon the heart of the people when the Scriptures are read, but when they shall turn to the Lord it shall be taken away, just as Moses put off the veil when he turned to the Lord.<a name=417:5></a> They will look upon Him whom they have pierced, and mourn.<a name=417:6></a> When Moses came down from the mount the first time, it is not said that his face shone, because then he brought pure law; but the second time a certain measure of grace was added: God had been revealed as "the Lord, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.<a name=417:7></a>" The way in which He spared Israel then was by His goodness, which He had caused to pass before Moses (he could not see His glory).<a name=417:8></a> The people could not look on the glory of God -- not even at the reflection of it in Moses' face.<a name=417:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a most touching history, shewing out again and again the grace, and forgiveness, and patience of God.<a name=417:10></a> First, Moses went up and got the law, graven by the finger of God on two tables of stone; but before ever he had brought it to the people, they had broken it.<a name=417:11></a> They had made a golden calf to worship, and thus broke the very first link with God: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<a name=417:12></a>" Moses, seeing this, cast the tables of the law out of his hands, and broke them.<a name=417:13></a> Thus pure law never came into the camp at all.<a name=417:14></a> Law came in afterwards, when mercy was shewn too, but unmixed law never.<a name=417:15></a> How could Moses carry the tables of the law into the midst of a people who were serving other gods?<a name=417:16></a> How could he put the ten commandments beside the golden calf?<a name=417:17></a> When he comes within hearing of the voices of them that were singing and dancing, his indignation is kindled, and he casts down the tables and smashes them.<a name=417:18></a> That was where pure law ended.<a name=417:19></a>

		Moses went up again, taking new tables, according to the word of God, who wrote the law upon them afresh.<a name=418:1></a> He had told the people, "Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the Lord; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin"; and it is lovely to see how he pleads for them, and how God answers in goodness and grace.<a name=418:2></a> He reveals His mercy in government, as "forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.<a name=418:3></a>" This is sometimes called the gospel, which it is not at all.<a name=418:4></a> God did indeed bear with Israel in patience, but still he adds, "In the day when I visit, I will visit their sins upon them.<a name=418:5></a>" It was not forgiveness as we know it now.<a name=418:6></a> He forgave them in not cutting them off, and putting Moses and his seed in their place, as He had threatened.<a name=418:7></a> Moses had said, in beautiful disinterestedness and love for the people with whom God's name was bound up, "If thou wilt not forgive them, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book.<a name=418:8></a>" The Lord shews present mercy and forgiveness, but at the same time puts every one of the people on his own responsibility.<a name=418:9></a> "Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.<a name=418:10></a>"

		A little further on, in this very epistle, the law is brought in as requiring righteousness from man, and man cannot give it, and therefore there must be death and condemnation.<a name=428:13></a> But when all that man is -- lawlessness, law-breaking, Christ-hating -- is manifested; when sin has come to its highest pitch in the cross, God's wonderful grace comes in, and makes that cross the very means of salvation to sinners.<a name=428:14></a> When the soul is awakened to what it has done, and then finds that God has already dealt with its sins on Christ, once for all, that He has by Himself purged our sins, then the conscience is purged from dead works to serve the living God.<a name=428:15></a> I have a new nature in the light, as God is in the light, and I look to have my heart answer to this in practical holiness, because the question of acceptance is settled.<a name=428:16></a> I am separated to God personally.<a name=428:17></a> I look at the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, the testimony that I am a saved man, and I seek to walk in the Spirit, as I live in the Spirit.<a name=428:18></a> We must not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, whereby we are sealed unto the day of redemption.<a name=428:19></a> We are to be followers of God, as dear children, walking in love, as Christ also has loved us, and given Himself for us.<a name=428:20></a> We are to walk in the consciousness that we are God's children, and to behave ourselves as God's children.<a name=428:21></a> Thus we are the epistle of Christ.<a name=428:22></a> The soul has received this full and blessed truth, that, if I am in Christ, I am in perfect acceptance before God, and Christ is in me.<a name=428:23></a> Then let me take care that nothing else comes out of me.<a name=428:24></a>

		There is the greatest possible contrast between law and gospel.<a name=431:1></a> Paul calls the one the ministration of death and of condemnation, and the other the ministration of the Spirit and of righteousness.<a name=431:2></a> This is what I propose we should now look into.<a name=431:3></a> When Moses received the tables of stone the first time and came down from the mount, we hear nothing about the glory of his face.<a name=431:4></a> He never brought those first tables into the camp at all.<a name=431:5></a> He hears how the people are behaving, pleads with God for the sake of His great name, when God offers to destroy them, and make of him a great nation; but when he came down, and saw the calf and the dancing, he cast down the tables and brake them beneath the mount.<a name=431:6></a> How could he bring God's law into the midst of the people who were breaking the very first command contained in it?<a name=431:7></a> When Moses entreats the Lord, as to His present government, the Lord forgave the people's sin.<a name=431:8></a> Moses could not make atonement, and they were put back under law -- the soul that sinneth it should die.<a name=431:9></a> Then he took with him two other tables like the first, and emboldened by God's graciousness to him, he asks that he may see His glory.<a name=431:10></a> But this may not be; but He makes His goodness pass before him, and proclaims before him His gracious name in government, and then He put them under law again.<a name=431:11></a> Moses had proposed to make atonement for them, but could not; and God proclaimed Himself as the One who would by no means clear the guilty.<a name=431:12></a> After this, when Moses came down, all this intercourse with God caused his face to shine, and the people could not bear to see even the reflection of the glory of the Lord, so he puts a veil over his face.<a name=431:13></a> Here we learn that God deals in mercy with His people, but we do not get a perfect atonement made.<a name=431:14></a> The promise of a deliverer came in from the beginning, even in the garden of Eden; but there was only One who could make this atonement.<a name=431:15></a> In all the revelation of goodness one fundamental point was wanting, and that was the clearing the guilty.<a name=431:16></a> Then guilty Israel asked that a veil might be over his face, and to this day the veil is over their hearts; but when they shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away.<a name=431:17></a> The law could but point in many sacrifices to the one perfect Lamb, and Israel could not see through the figures to the thing figured; but the veil is done away in Christ.<a name=431:18></a> There is no longer any veil over God's thoughts towards us, although the god of this world may still keep it on men's hearts.<a name=431:19></a> It is because this veil is done away with that it is called the gospel of the glory.<a name=431:20></a>

		We find God acting according to two great principles -- law and grace.<a name=432:1></a> Law is God requiring from man what man ought to be.<a name=432:2></a> It takes up all the relationships formed of God towards God and man.<a name=432:3></a> The duties were all there before the law was given, but it gave the rule of them, and attached God's express sanction to them.<a name=432:4></a> The law came and claimed from man obedience.<a name=432:5></a> Our Lord sums up the whole law in two sentences: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart," etc.<a name=432:6></a>; and, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<a name=432:7></a>" The law came and claimed from man what he ought to be.<a name=432:8></a> It gave no life, no power, deliverance, or object to be a motive; it could not clear the guilty, nor was it any help or strength, although God does help His people at all times.<a name=432:9></a> But the law itself could do nothing but demand obedience; and as man was a sinner, and incapable of obedience to a holy law, it was a ministration of death and condemnation.<a name=432:10></a> There is no grace in law (the two are opposed to each other), but God's grace dealt with individuals.<a name=432:11></a> The law was a ministration of death and condemnation because it gave from God what man ought to be, and what man is not.<a name=432:12></a> If a man's heart is not exercised towards God, the law does not trouble him much.<a name=432:13></a> He thinks he has not done anything very bad; he is no worse than his neighbours; he has not committed any very gross sins.<a name=432:14></a> Besides, he says, God is merciful; for he is sure to bring in the thought of a little mercy to meet his need; for deep down in the heart of every man is the sense that he has sinned.<a name=432:15></a> He is pretty comfortable, and it is all very well as long as it is a question of natural conscience; not of God's eye reaching the heart and thoughts.<a name=432:16></a> When the law says, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour <i>as</i> thyself," we are at once convinced of sin; we know that we do not.<a name=432:17></a> Who is as troubled at a loss to his neighbour as he would be at a loss to himself?<a name=432:18></a> But if we get a revelation of God ever so small along with the law, we are utterly condemned at once; for no flesh can stand His eye.<a name=432:19></a> Now one of two things will happen.<a name=432:20></a> You will either seek to hide from God, as Adam did in the garden of Eden, or you will seek to hide God from you, as Israel did when they entreated that Moses should put a veil upon his face: for if a man once gets but a sight of God, he can say with Job, "If I wash myself with snow-water, and make my hands never so clean; yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.<a name=432:21></a>" Whatever I may have thought of myself before, I see that in God's eyes I am only like a man that is just dragged out of a ditch -- utterly unclean.<a name=432:22></a> Under the law the soul may feel all right when it is not exercised towards God; but in His presence no man can stand it.<a name=432:23></a> Lust is there in the heart.<a name=432:24></a>

		The principle of the law is, that what God is for me depends upon what I am for Him.<a name=433:1></a> But God has brought out that I am a sinner, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.<a name=433:2></a> It is a manifestation of death and condemnation, and nothing else.<a name=433:3></a> Law will never give peace.<a name=433:4></a> It is not grace; it is looking not at what the Lord does for me, but at what I find in myself for Him; and I may be under law in looking at the cross itself.<a name=433:5></a> I see a display of perfect love towards me on the cross, and I look into my heart and see there such a feeble response to His love that I begin to doubt whether I really love Him at all.<a name=433:6></a> It is quite right that I should desire to love Him; but it is not the gospel, and you can never get peace in this way.<a name=433:7></a> It is putting a question as to your relationship, founded on your conduct; and what confusion would it cause in a family if the children began to question whether they were their father's children or not.<a name=433:8></a> I may ask, Am I walking according to my relationship?<a name=433:9></a> but I must not question whether I am a child or not.<a name=433:10></a> This is all law, though in a more subtle form.<a name=433:11></a> I am still looking to get peace in what I am for God, and not in what He is for me.<a name=433:12></a> This is the state of a Christian who has not found peace.<a name=433:13></a> Like the prodigal, who, far off from his father, asks to be made as one of his hired servants.<a name=433:14></a> When he comes into his father's presence, no such word: he knew his relationship.<a name=433:15></a> Before he was only thinking of what he was to his father, and not of what his father was to him.<a name=433:16></a> In the first two parables in Luke 15 we get the grace that goes out to seek what was lost, and then reception on the return; and the Lord shews how the work goes on in the heart, how the soul is often still upon the principle of law, saying they are not what they would like to be.<a name=433:17></a> This is looking inside to see if they love God, and when they see no signs of love in their own hearts they then begin to doubt whether He loves them.<a name=433:18></a> This is a more subtle form of law; but it is still the same principle -- looking at what I am for God, and not at what He is for me.<a name=433:19></a>

		Now I turn to the gospel of the glory.<a name=434:1></a> Into the midst of a law-breaking world God came in grace.<a name=434:2></a> Before Jesus came God had not come out to man, and man could not go in to God.<a name=434:3></a> He gave man law and promises, but He did not Himself come to man.<a name=434:4></a> But the great fact that we have now before us is, that God has come.<a name=434:5></a> "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us"; and man is gone right in -- into the presence of God.<a name=434:6></a> When I say man, I mean Christ Himself; but who as the Forerunner has entered in for us within the veil.<a name=434:7></a> I find that God came in perfect goodness, and not in manifestation of His glory.<a name=434:8></a> He came when we were sinners and law-breakers, when we were far off.<a name=434:9></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.<a name=434:10></a>" We get the manifestation of the purest love in our Lord's life down here; His miracles were not only power, but power in love to meet every want in every man.<a name=434:11></a> He removed every effect of sin; He was the manifestation of God in perfect goodness; and the result was that man spit in His face and rejected Him.<a name=434:12></a> May the Lord give us all always to remember, that we are in a world that has rejected God when He was in it in grace!<a name=434:13></a> The world now is as bad as it was then; it is no more in relationship with God; souls are not nearer God by nature than they were.<a name=434:14></a> In fact, as we look around, we can see things are in a worse condition than they were.<a name=434:15></a> Sin has reached its climax.<a name=434:16></a> And it is not only that God has turned man out of the garden of Eden, but that when God came into this world man turned Him out.<a name=434:17></a> As Jesus Himself says, "If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=434:18></a>" He passed through this world in goodness, healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him.<a name=434:19></a> The Son of God has been in the world, and been rejected by the world.<a name=434:20></a> God revealed Himself to us in the Person of His Son while we were sinners.<a name=434:21></a> He shews His perfect holiness in His life; this is brought out in a striking and touching manner when the poor leper comes to Him.<a name=434:22></a> He was with sinners unsullied by them; but there in perfect love.<a name=434:23></a> Here was one who came acknowledging His power, but doubting His love.<a name=434:24></a> And what is His answer?<a name=434:25></a> does He reproach him?<a name=434:26></a> No; His answer is, "I will: be thou clean"; and He put forth His hand and touched him.<a name=434:27></a> One who touched a leper was unclean like the leper; but Christ acquires no defilement by His contact with men, but cleanses them in grace.<a name=434:28></a> It was divine power touching and driving sin away: it was a most beautiful expression of what His grace is.<a name=434:29></a> But such as He was, they rejected Him; and in this act sin was completely manifested, for it was the rejection of God in goodness.<a name=434:30></a> But God uses this crowning act of man's sin for his salvation; Christ was the Lamb of God, who puts away the sin of the world: and here we come to the cross.<a name=434:31></a> The work was done which was the expression and accomplishment of the height of wickedness on the part of man; but it did but manifest the supremacy of grace on God's side.<a name=434:32></a> I get God's righteousness against sin manifested, but more than that, God perfectly glorified.<a name=434:33></a> All Satan's power is put forth, and it but serves to bring out God's perfect love to the poor sinner.<a name=434:34></a> There where sin abounded, grace did much more abound; as it says, "If one died for all, then were all dead.<a name=434:35></a>" If you will not come to Christ, you are still preferring other things to Him; but there is a very solemn thought for you, and a solemn question for you to answer.<a name=434:36></a> Where are you going to spend your eternity?<a name=434:37></a> The question must be settled now in this life.<a name=434:38></a> Men shrink from the thought of eternity; and where there are infidel thoughts about God, they deny it altogether, or at least hope there will be none.<a name=434:39></a>

		It is blessed to see in this chapter how the thought of <i>God</i> comes out in the new creation.<a name=437:1></a> In this aspect man is gone as to his sins and responsibility -- dead in them.<a name=437:2></a> The judgment of the first Adam is complete.<a name=437:3></a> The old thing is entirely gone.<a name=437:4></a> It is a new creation now, and in this new creation I find God instead of man.<a name=437:5></a> Even Christ Himself, as known after the flesh, is known no more.<a name=437:6></a> True, He was, when down here, the hope and expectation of faith as coming into the world; but the apostle only knows Him now as having died for all and been glorified -- all under death whether Jew or Gentile, and Christ no more known after the flesh (that is, as come after the hopes of man in it) but Head of a new creation, where all things are of God, and in which we have been made in Him the righteousness of God.<a name=437:7></a> God has manifested Himself in the second Man, and wrought atonement in His death, and now we are the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=437:8></a>

		In the first creation we see man and his responsibility.<a name=437:9></a> In the new creation, all things are of God, and man is reconciled by Jesus Christ unto Himself.<a name=437:10></a> We want to have the power of this in our souls, to live as belonging to the new creation, as reconciled by God to Himself, all that belonged to the old creation for ever gone to faith, "old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.<a name=437:11></a>"

		We see how the apostle walked in the power of this in verse 13.<a name=437:12></a> "Whether," he says, "we be beside ourselves, it is to God.<a name=437:13></a>" That is, if he were beyond the influences that belonged to him as a man, it was not an excitement that belongs to those influences, it was because he was absorbed in God.<a name=437:14></a> It is what is called ecstasy.<a name=437:15></a> When his spirit was free to rise above present service in what he was in Christ, he was lost in God, carried out beyond himself.<a name=437:16></a> If he were sober, if he had to weigh difficulties -- come down into the sober estimate of what was before him -- it was God in love working in him.<a name=437:17></a> His thought was entirely for others in that love.<a name=437:18></a> This was his daily life; as to himself, transported with God; and, when he did think about things down here, all his thoughts were for others.<a name=437:19></a> It was the love of Christ that constrained him, and he looked upon all around in connection with the death of Christ.<a name=437:20></a> It was no longer a living Messiah in the flesh with promises for Israel.<a name=437:21></a> All this was over.<a name=437:22></a> Christ had died, and he judged that Christ would not have gone into death if men had not been there.<a name=437:23></a> The whole history of Adam's race is closed in death.<a name=437:24></a> If they had not all been dead, Christ would not have been found in death; why have gone down there if others were not lying there?<a name=437:25></a> And therefore those who from amongst these lived were now to live not to themselves, but to Christ who died for them, and rose again.<a name=437:26></a> Thus, if he me.<a name=437:27></a> an unconverted man, he would not think of him as an old acquaintance, and know him as such.<a name=437:28></a> He would look upon him as one that was dead and needed to be saved by the death of Christ.<a name=437:29></a> Or, if the person was a Christian, it would be just the same.<a name=437:30></a> He would not know him after the flesh according to an old acquaintance with him; he would look upon him as one alive with Christ, and his one thought would be that Christ might be glorified in him.<a name=437:31></a> Even Christ Himself was not to be known any more, in connection with this creation.<a name=437:32></a> He had died to it, and if any man is in Christ, he is of the new creation, where old things are passed away, and all things are become new, and all things are of God.<a name=437:33></a> Man is looked upon as dead, and God brings in a new creation.<a name=437:34></a>

		We have the same aspect of truth, when in verse 19 he speaks of Christ coming in the flesh.<a name=438:1></a> It is not looked upon as fulfilling promises to Israel, but God revealing Himself in grace to the world.<a name=438:2></a> "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.<a name=438:3></a>" This was the aspect of Christ's first coming, in which the apostle thought of Him.<a name=438:4></a> We know He came to His own, and was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made to the fathers.<a name=438:5></a> All this is blessedly true; but here we have God in man come here, and the apostle sees neither Jew nor Gentile.<a name=438:6></a> If God were in Christ, He acts toward the <i>world</i>.<a name=438:7></a> To what portion of it can you confine Him, if it be a question of God displaying Himself in grace in the world?<a name=438:8></a> For the same reason, when he speaks of the love of Christ, he judges all to be dead, and sees neither Jew nor Gentile, but a new creation, in which God counts every man that is in Christ.<a name=438:9></a>

		We know that that is God as to the glory of His divine Person, but the apostle is speaking here historically; and therefore when he looks upon the Lord Jesus living in the world, he sees God in Him acting in overtures of grace to the world.<a name=438:10></a> God <i>was</i> in Christ; that is the great fact, that God has been here as the Reconciler, and man would not be reconciled.<a name=438:11></a> Does the apostle say that God is reconciling us?<a name=438:12></a> No, but that God <i>has</i> reconciled us by Jesus Christ unto Himself, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation to the world: specially, no doubt, the apostles, but in their measure true of all.<a name=438:13></a> Man would not have God when He came, and therefore He had to make Christ sin, to work atonement for us, and now He is at God's right hand, in whom we become the righteousness of God.<a name=438:14></a> The apostle does not say to the Corinthians, Be "ye" reconciled, for they <i>were</i> reconciled; but Christ being in heaven, having gone there through death in working out atonement for us, and His presence there being necessary to complete all in glory, He must have ambassadors to carry out His work of reconciliation here; so the apostle says, when he preaches -- that is the gospel to sinners -- "We pray in Christ's stead, be reconciled to God.<a name=438:15></a>" That is what he had to say to men as Christ's ambassador.<a name=438:16></a> How far are we living thus?<a name=438:17></a> Living in the power of God's new creation, judging the whole thing belonging to the first creation as gone to faith, and entering into the blessedness of our place in Christ, in the power of an ungrieved Spirit?<a name=438:18></a> Exercised for others, that the life of Christ may have power in their walk and ways; judging evil practically in our own path through the world, but yet having our souls so full of our blessedness in Christ, of what it is to be reconciled to God, that directly opportunity arises, our hearts burst forth in praises to God, and ever go forth after others still dead in their sins.<a name=438:19></a> That this may be so practically, we must bring the death of Christ to judge everything in ourselves and in our ways.<a name=438:20></a> As the apostle says, "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body," 2 Corinthians 4: 10.<a name=438:21></a> If we do not daily, and hourly, bring everything under.<a name=438:22></a> the sentence of Christ's death, and judge everything by it, the Spirit will be grieved in us, and, instead of filling us with the joy of our portion in Christ, He will cause the light of Christ to awaken us to the judgment of ourselves, and of our ways.<a name=438:23></a>

		May the Lord give us to walk in the power of an ungrieved Spirit, bringing everything into subjection to Christ, that we may know what the apostle goes on to say, "Death worketh in us, but life in you.<a name=439:1></a>" In thus bearing about in his body the dying of the Lord Jesus, Paul found death to self, and the result was life to the Corinthians.<a name=439:2></a> Paul held the power of Christ's death on the natural man, so that when he ministered among the Corinthians, there was no Paul at all, but only Christ.<a name=439:3></a> It was life to them, because death was working in Paul.<a name=439:4></a>

		May the Lord give us thus to live!<a name=440:1></a> And may He grant us, especially in a day like this, to judge of men as Paul did, so that whatever the boast of human nature may be, we may see that all are dead, because Christ died for all in grace -- for the highest act of grace and love is the proof of it -- and that the only living ones are they that live to Him who died for them and rose again, while in our own souls we enter into His new creation.<a name=440:2></a> We may have to go down to babes, and feed them with milk, and not with strong meat; but may we ourselves live in the light of this new creation, where all things are of God.<a name=440:3></a> We must pass through exercise, and be tried and tested to learn what is in our hearts, and to have our senses exercised to discern good and evil.<a name=440:4></a> This is all needful and profitable, but then there is our distinct place in Christ as part of the new creation, where instead of having the first man responsible to God, we have God in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself in grace, and making Christ sin for us, to bring us into the new creation, where all things are of God, and where man is before God in divine righteousness, and, as to his enjoyment, finding himself lost in God.<a name=440:5></a> It is God, and not man.<a name=440:6></a> It is what God is to man, and the blessedness of man being with God: God we know, revealed in Christ; but nevertheless God revealed, and man made the righteousness of God, a part of God's new creation.<a name=440:7></a>

		In this epistle there are two great principles of Christian life (the last chapter is, he is superior to all cares and all circumstances).<a name=441:13></a> In chapter 3, it is the energy that carries a man on, so that everything else is dross and dung -- that is Christ in glory.<a name=441:14></a> He has seen Him up there, and he says, I must get that.<a name=441:15></a> There are hindrances in the way.<a name=441:16></a> I will throw them aside, he says.<a name=441:17></a> You will lose everything.<a name=441:18></a> I cannot help it; I must get Him.<a name=441:19></a> Oh, but you will die.<a name=441:20></a> No matter; that will be all the more like Him; I must get on to Him, the One up there in the glory, whom I have seen.<a name=441:21></a> "If by any means"; that is, whatever it may cost me, even life itself.<a name=441:22></a> "Resurrection <i>from among</i> the dead," that is the character of Christ's resurrection.<a name=441:23></a> The resurrection of the saints has nothing in common with the resurrection of sinners.<a name=441:24></a> Christ is the firstfruits, then those that are Christ's at His coming: He is not the firstfruits of sinners to be judged.<a name=441:25></a> Not a hint in Scripture of saints and sinners being raised together.<a name=441:26></a> "That I may attain unto the resurrection from among the dead" (the apostle uses a rare and emphatic word to explain his meaning) -- what is there to attain to, if the wickedest man in the world goes up at the same time and in the same way?<a name=441:27></a> "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection.<a name=441:28></a>" What is the good of that, if all rise together?<a name=441:29></a> The character of Christ's resurrection was the positive seal of God's approval on Him and His work, and so is ours.<a name=441:30></a> As regards justification His resurrection is of all importance, for it is the seal of God on the excellency and perfectness of the work of Christ.<a name=441:31></a> He was taken out from among the dead as a perfect seal upon His work and Person, and everything else; and so is our resurrection the seal of our acceptance.<a name=441:32></a> Because God delights in us, we are taken out from among the dead, as Christ was.<a name=441:33></a> So he continues his running till he gets that.<a name=441:34></a> You have Christ in glory, and all is dross and dung except that.<a name=441:35></a> He wants Christ instead of Paul, and all he gets by the way is nothing -- if he gets even death, it is all the more like Him.<a name=441:36></a>

		COLOSSIANS COMPARED WITH ROMANS AND EPHESIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In taking up Colossians, I will begin by comparing it with the epistles to the Ephesians and Romans, in order to help us in understanding the different ways in which the condition of the soul is treated.<a name=450:1></a> The chapter I have read (chapter 1) connects itself too, in a remarkable way, with the counsels of God, as well as containing some of the more elementary truths, such as our hope of glory and our responsibility, which makes it practical to all our souls.<a name=450:2></a> You will never rightly connect the doctrines of man's responsibility and God's free grace, until you see them united in Christ.<a name=450:3></a> From Paradise and onwards you find these very questions proposed by God Himself in the tree of life, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=450:4></a> But man broke down in his responsibility, and was shut out from the tree of Life.<a name=450:5></a> Thus there were the two sides of the question from the very starting-point of God's ways.<a name=450:6></a> The same question was raised by the law.<a name=450:7></a> The two things were there, and by satisfying the responsibility man was to find the way to life.<a name=450:8></a> Then came Christ, who did satisfy the responsibility, and is the Life.<a name=450:9></a> Grace, which bestows the life, gave Christ, who met the responsibility.<a name=450:10></a> I receive eternal life through the righteousness of God when I have none, and I have to glorify Him in exhibiting this life in my body.<a name=450:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In divine things, people forget (what they see every day, and which is as simple as possible in human things) that duties flow always from the relationship in which we are already placed.<a name=450:12></a> Putting a person into a relationship, puts him as naturally as possible into the duties belonging to that relationship.<a name=450:13></a> If the place is a constant one, the duty is a constant one, as with parents and children, husband and wife.<a name=450:14></a> The statement often made, that if I am saved I may do as I like, is thus disposed of.<a name=450:15></a> Can my child say that because he is my child he may do as he likes?<a name=450:16></a> No; the duty flows from the relationship.<a name=450:17></a> If I am a child of God, duty is always there; I may fail in it, and be chastened as a naughty child -- quite true; but the duty is there.<a name=450:18></a> That is what redemption does; on the total failure of man under responsibility, it brings me the gift of eternal life in Christ Jesus.<a name=450:19></a> Thus praise, service, obedience -- whatever belongs to the child of God -- flows from it.<a name=450:20></a>

		Now the epistle to the Ephesians gives us the counsels of God, while Romans takes up the responsibility of man, and his failure in it; then his justification from this state.<a name=451:1></a> These are connected with two aspects of sin; first, in its lusts and passions, in which man lives in sin; then its aspect as towards God, in which he is dead in sin.<a name=451:2></a> On the one hand I find him alive in sin, away from God, seeking to gratify his lusts.<a name=451:3></a> Then, I ask, what is the state of this soul towards God?<a name=451:4></a> He is dead.<a name=451:5></a> Scripture speaks of both states.<a name=451:6></a> In Romans, man is alive in sins; in Ephesians, as towards God, he is dead.<a name=451:7></a> If looked at as alive in sins, it is a question of putting them away and justification.<a name=451:8></a> If looked at as towards God, dead, there is nothing of this; it is his being quickened out of that state -- and, therefore, life and a new creation; all that side is connected with the counsels of God.<a name=451:9></a> Taking man as dead, there is nothing to be got out of him; he has not a feeling or a thought towards God: evil goes out towards evil, but not a feeling stirs towards God.<a name=451:10></a> When Christ is brought in, he sees no beauty in Him that he should desire Him; that is man.<a name=451:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to Ephesians, we find the counsels of God, the sealing of the Spirit, the inheritance, and then our being made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=451:14></a> Consequently, in the conduct of the Christian, it is God Himself who is given as the pattern of it -- "be ye imitators of God, as dear children"; and we get the truth in Jesus, which is, you have put off the old man, and have put on the new.<a name=451:15></a> It is not a system of doctrine, but that I have done with the one, and have passed into the other.<a name=451:16></a> In Colossians you never find the Holy Ghost mentioned, except incidentally and exceptionally, as "love in the Spirit"; but life is the great subject.<a name=451:17></a> In Ephesians, the old man having been put off, and the new man put on, the Holy Ghost is in the Christian, as the power to manifest God in his ways, and thus be the expression of God in a man.<a name=451:18></a> God is love, and God is light; "walk in love," and "now are ye light in the Lord"; Christ is the pattern for light, and the pattern for love.<a name=451:19></a> There are two ways in which love is manifested; first, the divine love, which shews its greatness in having to do with the vilest, in rising above the evil, and putting it away; secondly, where the object characterises the affections in giving oneself up in devotedness to Him who has so loved us.<a name=451:20></a> If I love what is base, it is a base affection, and so on; the affection corresponds with the object on which it fixes itself.<a name=451:21></a> I find both these characters of love in Christ, in Ephesians 5: 2, and it is the path for us.<a name=451:22></a> He "loved us," answers to the first; "to God for a sweet-smelling savour," answers to the second.<a name=451:23></a> Love going out <i>to us</i> in every need, but <i>to God</i> as its constant object.<a name=451:24></a> It is so with us; we must have <i>God</i> always before the soul, to keep up the character of our love.<a name=451:25></a> Here, then, I find the fullest description of what the walk of the Christian is: I am sitting in heavenly places in Christ, not in Adam at all.<a name=451:26></a> The works are suitable, and, moreover, fore-ordained.<a name=451:27></a> They are suited to the place we are in.<a name=451:28></a> If the position is Jewish, the works are legal; but the child is not a servant, nor the servant a child.<a name=451:29></a> We are called to walk in works as new in kind, as our position.<a name=451:30></a> There I find the Holy Ghost, consequently, as the link to connect me with Christ.<a name=451:31></a>

		Now, having this growth, what do we find?<a name=455:1></a> Why, the man <i>was</i> meet to be partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light all the time (verse 12), so that after pressing this "growing by the knowledge of God," he can give thanks to the Father for having made us meet.<a name=455:2></a> Am I going to be with saints in light?<a name=455:3></a> Then I must get all the sanctity and light I can have here.<a name=455:4></a> If I am looking for holiness in view of <i>acceptance</i>, it is not really <i>holiness I</i> want, but <i>righteousness</i>.<a name=455:5></a> People call it holiness, but it is not really so.<a name=455:6></a> There is no proper holiness until there is certainty of salvation.<a name=455:7></a> A child has a nature capable of filial feelings, but he may be an orphan and cannot have them, because he has neither father nor mother.<a name=455:8></a> So one born of God cannot have holy affections as such.<a name=455:9></a> He wants a spirit of adoption, "whereby we cry, Abba, Father," before there can be true holiness.<a name=455:10></a> You have been washed clean in the blood of Christ.<a name=455:11></a> Have you been allowing in yourself anything contrary to that?<a name=455:12></a> It will not do.<a name=455:13></a> The blood has been put upon your ear, and upon your hand, and upon your foot.<a name=455:14></a> Nothing must be let into the head or done by the hand or foot that is not fit for the blood of Christ.<a name=455:15></a> This is how sin becomes so exceedingly hateful.<a name=455:16></a> You have gone and found pleasure, if only for five minutes, in that which gave Christ His agony.<a name=455:17></a> It is horrible!<a name=455:18></a> We have it in the case of the red heifer, in Numbers 19, whose blood had been sprinkled seven times before God.<a name=455:19></a> Sins had been consumed when the heifer was killed; but the ashes of the heifer bring <i>me</i> back to the sufferings of Christ, and shew me the horribleness of sin by the very place I am in.<a name=455:20></a> This is for holiness, and is not a question of acceptance.<a name=455:21></a> It is the place we are in that gives the measure of the evil.<a name=455:22></a>

		Now he comes to look at the double character of Christ's glory, and of the reconciliation, unfolding specially the glory of the Head, not of the body.<a name=455:23></a> In verses 16, 17, He takes His place as Head of creation -- of course, because He is Creator.<a name=455:24></a> Then He comes to resurrection from the dead and Headship of the body (verse 18).<a name=455:25></a> Here He is not "first-born of creation" as Man, but "first-born from the dead.<a name=455:26></a>" Then you get all the fulness pleased to dwell in Him.<a name=455:27></a> It is not in verse 19, "it pleased <i>the Father</i>"; for given Godhead would be nonsense; but as in chapter 2: 9, it is the glory of His Person.<a name=455:28></a>

		Remark here, that the obedient side comes first in everything.<a name=480:6></a> It is the natural thing the Christian gets into.<a name=480:7></a> He is "sanctified unto obedience.<a name=480:8></a>" He never gets out of it; he fails in it, of course.<a name=480:9></a> The Lord says, "As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.<a name=480:10></a>" The apostles never said, what often jars on one, I have a right to do so-and-so.<a name=480:11></a> It is, "We ought to obey God rather than man.<a name=480:12></a>" If man hinders me from obeying God, it is wrong.<a name=480:13></a> But it is not, I have a right, but I must "obey God rather than man.<a name=480:14></a>" You get in the path of Christ, the path of divine wisdom, that the vulture's eye hath not seen; and the way to keep yourself in it is to "continue in prayer" (chapter 4: 2), incessantly referring everything to God.<a name=480:15></a> There is the positive direct intervention of God, everything working together for good; and by prayer our hearts get through grace in connection with this overruling power of God, whether to stop some mischief Satan is doing, or to open a door of utterance.<a name=480:16></a> "We will give ourselves to prayer, and the ministry of the word" -- not the ministry of the word and prayer.<a name=480:17></a> Whatever the subject of prayer is, there is continually bringing in God, so that the heart is with God.<a name=480:18></a> If I am entirely dependent on Him, living in Him, and His word living in me to direct my thoughts, I am sure to get what I ask.<a name=480:19></a> Then there is most gracious dealing with regard to my requests -- "Be careful for nothing.<a name=480:20></a>" "Make known your requests to God.<a name=480:21></a>" It does not follow that they are right; but do not brood over anything, bring it to God.<a name=480:22></a> Perhaps He may say He cannot grant it; as when Paul asks for the thorn to be taken away, He says, I have given it to you for a purpose; I am not going to take it away.<a name=480:23></a> And the power of Christ rested on him through the very thing that had broken him down.<a name=480:24></a> So the peace of God keeps my heart.<a name=480:25></a>
