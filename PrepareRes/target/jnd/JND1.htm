		CONSIDERATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF DUBLIN AND THE CLERGY WHO SIGNED THE PETITION TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS FOR PROTECTION¦

	<div class="paragraph">
		[The following paper, printed now more than eight-and-thirty years ago, speaks for itself.<a name=1:1></a> It was sent privately to the Archbishop and Clergy, having been written some time before it was printed, and withheld, from anxiety as to the justness of the step; the course of the Archbishop and Clergy, with which I had from circumstances nothing personally to do, having greatly tried my spirit, and I was about twenty-six years old at the utmost, when it was written.<a name=1:2></a> I may mention that just at that time the Roman Catholics were becoming Protestants at the rate of 600 to 800 a week.<a name=1:3></a> The Archbishop (Magee) imposed, within the limits of his jurisdiction, the oaths of allegiance and supremacy; and the work everywhere instantly ceased.<a name=1:4></a> I remember Mr.<a name=1:5></a> R.<a name=1:6></a> Daly, since a prelate of the Establishment, saying to me after receiving it, You ought to become a Dissenter.<a name=1:7></a> I said, No; you have got into the wrong, and you want to put me there -- but that you will not do.<a name=1:8></a> I attach no importance to the paper, which I have never read since, but as the first germing of truth which has since developed itself in the Church of God.<a name=1:9></a> It is published therefore just as it was first printed.<a name=1:10></a> All the actors are passed, everything is changed, so that there is no indiscretion in publishing it now].<a name=1:11></a>

		My Lord and brethren, <br>I submit to you the following thoughts, occasioned originally by the Metropolitan Charge and Clerical Petition; but suppressed hitherto, from anxiety to take no step which I could not maturely judge to be taken according to the will of God.<a name=1:12></a> I do not <i>publish</i> them, because my object was to bring before the minds of those concerned the view which pressed upon my own, and by no means to make the world a judge of the conduct of Christ's ministers, which it is not, unless they err from their principles; and if they do, it would be my part, while I might state my mind to them, to cover the fault as it regards the world, where I supposed there was a fault committed.<a name=1:13></a> This feeling has guided my conduct on the occasion, and I cannot but feel happy at the delay, as it has given the opportunity of bringing forward some other things, which will, I think, assist in determining the true character of the views from which they originate.<a name=1:14></a> If there should be anything harsh in the expression, I beseech your forgiveness, and that you

		will attribute it to the anxiety of a mind actuated only by the desire that the conduct of those he loves and looks up to should be free, even from the imputation of error.<a name=2:1></a> I send it to the Archbishop, not presumptuously, but with the respect due to his station and office, and with the earnest trust he will weigh the matter fully: and I send it to the Clergy, because, by their petition they seem to have recognised and taken advantage of the supposed support claimed in the Charge; and I earnestly commend it to their attention, not suggesting any particular thing (which I do not feel to be my part), but calling their minds to weigh the place they stand in themselves.<a name=2:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have long felt deeply anxious on the subject, and it seems to me that a sincere and deep interest in the work of the Spirit of God which is going on in this country, and a consciousness that (while the Spirit of God distributes to every man severally as He will, and my prayers are offered up that He may do so freely and abundantly) the ministers of the Established Church have many of them been partakers of His energies, and acted in the furtherance of them, call for an inquiry into the principles contained in this Charge.<a name=2:3></a> No man whose mind has been informed on these subjects can doubt (and least of all those to whom I address myself, who have themselves borne witness to it by their heartfelt interest in its progress; nay, the world, which can know nothing of the real work, has been compelled to own in its effects) the manifestation of the power of the Divine Spirit which has begun a work in this country, which I fully hope will not end in it, and is of no country, but of the power of that kingdom which shall fill the whole earth.<a name=2:4></a> Under these circumstances all who enter into the work of God, as ministers in the power of the same Spirit, are urgently called upon to recognise their just place, to consider, as far at least as their own conduct is concerned, what the order of the operation is, that they may follow in simplicity, and unhindered by any inconsistency of personal or assumed character, the guidance and workings of the Eternal Spirit.<a name=2:5></a> They are bound to hold themselves (I speak this not as urging a claim, but expressing the assumed conviction of their own minds) as servants of Jesus Christ, and who therefore cannot consistently yet please men.<a name=2:6></a> They will feel it their faithful and zealous concern, therefore, as far as in them lies, in order that they may be the servants of all men to their eternal welfare, to be free from all men, not to be "the servants of men" as in the world, that

		they may minister, preaching not themselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and themselves the servants of such as have ears to hear for His sake.<a name=3:1></a> With this view they are called (I do humbly suggest to them) to owe no man anything; called therefore with jealousy to judge, authorised by their obligation to their one Master who has an undivided claim to their service, anything that would prejudice that claim and the consistency of their own conduct with the blessed work which in His grace He has committed them to do: and I do persuade myself, that they have too deep an interest in the work and reign of Him who redeemed them, not to consider with attention any suggestion which reaches them relative to the interests of His name, and the free course of His word to souls.<a name=3:2></a> These considerations weigh with me to induce the communication of the following thoughts.<a name=3:3></a> The Charge and Petition appear to the public, with the sanction of their names; and bound as I must be to suppose, that this must carry to the world a representation of their sentiments, which they might find difficulty in gainsaying, I am emboldened to bring these documents under the maturer consideration of those who are disposed to avow, however humbly as individuals yet openly as servants, their identification with the interests of the Son of God, who loved them and gave Himself for them.<a name=3:4></a> I do feel, if they assume such an office and character, they are bound to approve themselves in it throughout, in that world where they must have every motive and all their conduct canvassed, and where the honour of their Master's name, the name of the Lord, who gave Himself for the church, that He might present it to Himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, will be charged in their persons, with every even error of theirs, while they will be used as proofs against them, that they cannot be the ministers of God, seeing they are in such and such things contrary to the character imprinted on the ministry by their Master, and thus their ministry hindered as towards those who might receive it, and who, in fact for the most part, judge by such very means.<a name=3:5></a> I am indeed persuaded that it has pleased God too decidedly (and I have entire faith in the continuance of it) to manifest His power to shew forth the character of those who are His, to suffer the work itself to be countervailed by any particular act, though inconsistent.<a name=3:6></a> But I am equally persuaded that this work will be carried on by the maintenance of that same sincerity of service, ministering the truth in love,

		which the Lord has ever used for its promotion, and that those who look for a part in the heavenly work, who look to be owned as labourers with Him in that day, so that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together, must look for it in the consistency of their own labour with the spirit and judgment and actual work of Him with whom they seek to rejoice.<a name=4:1></a> Impossible that they can gather the fruit of His blessed suffering and divine labour, so as to be glorified with Him by the display of it as the fruit of the travail of His soul, but as His labourers as working in conformity with the spirit in which He wrought.<a name=4:2></a> I turn from this, which I speak as the undoubted sentiment of those who are engaged in the work and labour of love, to consider the consistency of certain views and acts with these acknowledged principles; if they be acknowledged, they are unquestionably paramount to all motives, and we are able and bound to judge all acts by them, so as to regulate our own conduct with certainty before God: itself a matter of solid comfort to those who find their exercise in proving what the good and acceptable and perfect will of God is.<a name=4:3></a> And surely it does become those who, under the influence of the sense of God's mercies of which they have been made partakers, are disposed to present their bodies a living sacrifice, and not to be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of their minds, if in anything they may have seemed to have acquiesced in conformity to that which crucified the Lord of glory, to let judgment have its free course in their own minds, lest they be further entangled in error, lest the clearness and decision of their moral judgment, on which under God their efficient service, to say the least, in the work of God so much depends, should be impaired.<a name=4:4></a>

		To apply myself then to that which has given occasion to the expression of these thoughts.<a name=4:5></a> We have the following public acts -- a Charge from the Metropolitan, stating the ground on which the Church stands, and then Petitions forwarded by the instrumentality of the hierarchy, seeking the exercise of civil authority for the protection of that Church as a body in this country.<a name=4:6></a> To these I beg attention.<a name=4:7></a> It is to be remarked that the Charge is stated to be published at the request of the Clergy, and the Petition is signed by a numerous body of them to say the least, and ostensibly is the act of them as a body interested in the cause of true religion in this country.<a name=4:8></a> As there are, thank God!<a name=4:9></a> many in the orders of the Church of

		Ireland who are zealous ministers of divine truth, and as they might seem included in the above general body, it is to them particularly that I address myself.<a name=5:1></a> I am not going to discuss the merits of the Archbishop's Charge at all.<a name=5:2></a> I purposely decline it.<a name=5:3></a> My business is with the principles contained and expounded in it.<a name=5:4></a> It amounts to a claim on behalf of the Established Church to protection from the civil Sovereign, founded on these two positions -- that the civil Sovereign is bound and has accordingly the right to choose the best religion for his people, and that the Established Church has every character on which such a choice ought to depend; but, in doing this, the Charge gives a statement of the foundation, nature, and office of the Church, in the principles of which no clergyman zealous in his office as a minister of the Church of Christ, could, I submit, acquiesce.<a name=5:5></a>

		What is the Church of Christ in its purpose and perfection?<a name=5:6></a> And our Lord has taught us to ascribe whatever is inconsistent with this to the hand of an enemy.<a name=5:7></a> It is a congregation of souls redeemed out of 'this naughty world' by God manifest in the flesh, a people purified to Himself by Christ, purified in the heart by faith, knit together, by the bond of this common faith in Him, to Him their Head sitting at the right hand of the Father, having consequently their conversation (<i>commonwealth</i>) in heaven, from whence they look for the Saviour, the Lord of glory; <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:20">Philippians  3:20</a>.<a name=5:8></a> As a body, therefore, they belong to heaven; <i>there</i> is their portion in the restitution of all things, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.<a name=5:9></a> On earth they are, as a people, necessarily subordinate; they are nothing and nobody; their King is in heaven, their interests and constitution heavenly.<a name=5:10></a> "My kingdom is not of this world: if it were, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews".<a name=5:11></a> As such, consequently, they have no power.<a name=5:12></a> The result is, that they are formed into a spiritual community; they are raised, by their Head and centre and source of hope and object of allegiance being in heaven, to be heavenly.<a name=5:13></a> They are delivered in spirit out of this present evil world, and become heavenly, spiritual, in their connections, interests, thoughts, and prospects; while their habits on earth are those, by necessary consequence, of pilgrims and strangers, adorning (by consistent humility, gentleness, patience, and kindness) the grace of which they have been made partakers, through

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the Papacy?<a name=6:3></a> Satan's fiction to answer to all this.<a name=6:4></a> While men are kept down in the lowest desires of a depraved world, in the bondage of the corrupt affections of a nature alienated from the gift of God, it presents a head on earth, earthly in his interests and in his objects, knitting together in a body, not a people separated out of the world to spiritual objects, but one tied by the closest interests to maintain his earthly supremacy, and with it their own importance upon earth, and in an earthly way; and by this universal and astonishing scheme of antichristianity, which is antitheism, precluding the application of the divine word, the instrument of divine sovereignty, to the souls of men.<a name=6:5></a> In short, the system of Popery I look upon as an entire counterpart of the Christian scheme, set up by Satan on the decay of faith to hold its place, uniting men to an earthly head and to each other by those interests from which Christianity delivers, and keeping the world in bondage, instead of leading men to heavenly things out of those interests, to be humbled in the presence of the world's dominion.<a name=6:6></a> The members of the papal system will accordingly be found, in their interests, objects, and activities, such as would result from such a system.<a name=6:7></a> We know, blessed be God!<a name=6:8></a> that, in result, the kingdom of His Son will be glorified in the splendour of its great Head, and the destruction of that antichristian counterpart, by which Satan has deceived the nations under the pretence of Christianity.<a name=6:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, what is the ministry of the Church of Christ?<a name=6:10></a> They are as ambassadors in Christ's stead, beseeching men to be reconciled to God, and ministering that grace and truth of which the fulness is in Him, according to the wisdom given unto them, gathering that very congregation of souls of which I have spoken, and edifying them when gathered.<a name=6:11></a> They are even in the language of an office, which, in its main purport, looked to all being outwardly, at least, within its own cure, "on the one hand, to teach, premonish, to feed, and provide for the Lord's family; on the other, to seek for Christ's sheep that are dispersed abroad, and for His children who are in the midst of this naughty world, that they might be saved through

		Christ for ever".<a name=7:1></a> Their ministry is coextensive with their Master's grace; their testimony with His claim of dominion over the souls of men.<a name=7:2></a> I am not now speaking of the order of its exercise, as between two or more working within their own rule; but as regards the nature of the duty of all, the place which they all occupy as ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God, there is a solemn obligation on them as ministers of Christ; and if there be anything in their present position, or the exigency of the season, which would imprint a special, I do not say an exclusive character, on their office, it is the renewed manifestation of the gospel of Him, whose Spirit and word have commission to the ends of the earth This, while it constitutes their office, constitutes their obligation, gives a decided, formal principle of action, more or less developed, according to the measure of faith.<a name=7:3></a> In the execution of this office of ministering the word of grace and truth, they are met by the great system which Satan has raised to blind men's hearts, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine into them.<a name=7:4></a> They, therefore, find themselves in collision with the Papacy, as a system of darkness, in collision with its influence on the souls of men; and it becomes their business in consequence to contend against its delusion, and expose the artifices of Satan, by which souls are kept from coming to God by Jesus Christ; and in this they are the ministers of Christ, working in His spiritual strength to the fulfilment of the purposes of His grace.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then does this Charge propose as the position of the Clergy?<a name=7:6></a> It views the Papacy, in its practical operation, exercising that intruding spirit, and proposing that claim, however modified or concealed for the sake of expediency, which necessarily flows from the character which it assumes as holding the authority of Christ, the Pope <i>gerere personam Christi</i> (seeking to impersonate Christ), while it is altogether earthly, and I cannot avoid saying, the instrument and plan of Satan, exercising dominion here by his delusions -- <i>here</i>, the only place where by his delusions he can, under a false name, wear the robe of authority, which he once openly exercised in the plenitude of heathen mythology.<a name=7:7></a> It views the Papacy, I say, making inroads by this power in its earthly shape, and calling by seducing arts the kingdom which has been delivered from its direct authority, again to give his power to it.<a name=7:8></a> It views it in its results as affecting the State as proposing a dominion

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		inconsistent with the supremacy of the civil Sovereign.<a name=8:1></a> To what does it lead the Clergy thereupon?<a name=8:2></a> It holds them up to public view in their relation to the State, as formed upon principles which make them useful to the State, subservient to its purposes, in resisting subjection to this renewed satanic dominion over the world.<a name=8:3></a> If counselling the State, this might be all well; if it were a speech in parliament, it might have its place; on temporal grounds its arguments might be strong, why the State should uphold the interests of the Established Church.<a name=8:4></a> With this I have nothing to do.<a name=8:5></a> It presents itself as specifically calling on the Clergy to recognise their own due position.<a name=8:6></a> It is on this ground I enter on the consideration of it.<a name=8:7></a> And what place does it give them?<a name=8:8></a> The result of the whole is this -- they are harmonised with the State and subservient to its supremacy for the effectuation of its moral government in order to the happiness of the subject people; and it is its adequacy to this, as being loyal, social, Protestant, etc.<a name=8:9></a>, which is proposed as its claim on the Sovereign for his support, while it is (being thus embodied with the State) harmless, as not affecting any independent authority.<a name=8:10></a> In result, in order to its claim of support, it must be subservient to the interests of the civil Sovereign, its movements and conduct must be governed by the interests of the Sovereign to this extent; in a word, the Clergy in their office become "instituted orders of the State", and the ecclesiastical supremacy is made to consist, not only in the Sovereign's duty, and therefore right, to choose what he deems a true religion for his people, and thereon be a judge of faith so far, but further, in having the ordering of the ministration under his control, and being the head of discipline.<a name=8:11></a> In one sense the former part of this may be true, but, on the principles of the Charge, is a mere substitution of the civil Sovereign for the Pope, such as Henry VIII introduced, and which made the German Protestants refuse to ally themselves with him.<a name=8:12></a> And in truth he is an illustration of the words of the Charge; he threw off the supremacy of the Pope in the assertion of his own supremacy as Sovereign, and chose what he deemed to be a true religion for his people.<a name=8:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I quote one passage: "The Sovereign cannot prescribe in favour of a system that maintains a spiritual supremacy independent of civil government", pages 29, 30.<a name=8:14></a> There is a spiritual supremacy independent of civil government, the spiritual supremacy of Christ, of which the Clergy are ministers

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The statement of the Charge is in plain hostility to the view and judgment of our Lord, when Satan was endeavouring to bring Him into jeopardy by the very imputation<a href="#9:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=9:3></a> But the Scripture is as plain as possible; it presents God claiming in the Person of the Son the homage of spiritual faith.<a name=9:4></a> So that, "he that believeth not should be damned", for he rejects divine authority claiming obedience to the faith.<a name=9:5></a> It presents civil Sovereigns instituted for the purpose of controlling outward evil, to use its own words, "for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well" -- so that they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation, for they resist the same divine authority.<a name=9:6></a> And thus viewed, there is no possibility of collision; for the ministers who claim obedience to the faith from all nations are the ministers of the same authority, and whose business is the claim of subjection to that authority from which the other flows.<a name=9:7></a> Neither God, I speak with reverence, nor His Spirit in His ministers, is divided against Himself, and he who denies the authority of the Sovereign in the things which belong to Caesar cannot be speaking by the Spirit of that God who gave the Sovereign that authority, or He would be divided against Himself.<a name=9:8></a> The truth is, the apprehension of the heavenly kingdom perfectly clears the whole matter -- it has no right place in the world but tribulation and trial, or its casual rest is of the supreme mercy.<a name=9:9></a>

		But to give up the rightful dominion of the Son of God, in order to avoid the imputation of seeking civil power, or rather to preserve ourselves from the inroads of one who seeks it on apostate grounds, is surely inconsistent, I do not mean in intention but in fact, with fidelity to the glory of the great Head of the Church, humbled for our sakes, and resulting (where taken as a principle of conduct) either in opposition, however mitigated or modified, or at least in the dread of the spiritual energies by which that kingdom of eternal blessing is maintained and promoted.<a name=10:1></a> Does not the system of Christian faith "assume the inherent right to establish itself in every country?<a name=10:2></a>" Is it not, by authority more than human, "essentially supreme in spiritual matters over all?<a name=10:3></a>" Are not both "prince and people bound to submit to its mandates, as to the great Head of the Christian Church?<a name=10:4></a>" And are not "they who refuse to do so rebels against a rightful sovereignty?<a name=10:5></a>" Are not all in truth and reality the subjects of its sway, whether they will acknowledge it or not?<a name=10:6></a> And am I, because Satan has imitated this in an apostate earthly dominion carried on under its name, to give this up (could Satan wish better?<a name=10:7></a>) and to dwindle Christianity into a system harmonised with a particular community, for the purposes of its moral happiness?<a name=10:8></a> Is not the great authority of Christian faith as much relinquished by this as by anything else?<a name=10:9></a> It is surely, for this is the result -- a strange way of opposing Satan's wiles, to give up the claim and possession by which alone he can be overcome.<a name=10:10></a> The apostate dominion of the Papacy is not to be met therefore on the part of the Clergy, by calling the aid of the State to resist its temporal dominion, but by their overcoming the strong man armed as the active, forward ministers of Him who is stronger than he; not by waiting till they are attacked, as if their interests were the thing in question; but now that God has been pleased to shed<a href="#10:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> forth His Spirit, in their due places ministering the spiritual sword, by which they are called upon to deliver poor fellow-sinners from thraldom, going, and actively opening men's eyes, and turning them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive the remission of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in the Lord of glory.<a name=10:11></a> If this be not the place of the Clergy, what place have they?<a name=10:12></a> If they are not bound to establish Christianity wherever the Lord opens a

		And here I am led to the Petition, which, as well as the Charge, bears me out; the latter calling it "manly protests", which is exactly the limits of self-defence as a national, and therefore earthly constituted body; the former, by suggesting, as the very ground of the application for protection, their "confining themselves to the quiet discharge of their proper duties".<a name=13:2></a> The language of the Petition bears out, in a way I had not myself previously adverted to, the view I had taken of the principles of the Charge to be accurate.<a name=13:3></a> It shews that the petitioning Clergy, "influenced by a love of peace, and by a desire of avoiding even the appearance of political discussion, have been hitherto withheld from approaching your Honourable House, against the hostility and calumny with which they and their religion have been, for a length of time, systematically assailed, under the pretence of seeking civil and religious liberty, but with the real design of obtaining powers subversive of both, and with the hope of overturning the established religion, by the defamation of its Clergy, and the misrepresentation of their faith.<a name=13:4></a> While any doubt could remain that such designs and such hopes existed, your Petitioners were desirous, though exposed to daily vexations, and insults, and injuries, to submit in silence, and endeavour, by the quiet discharge of their proper duties, to soften the violence of their enemies, although they had but too good reason to be convinced, that these their enemies were such from being enemies to their Church".<a name=13:5></a>

		The oath of supremacy is proposed by the Archbishop to the converts, which, instead of opening the door of Christ to the soul in bondage, makes the admission into the Establishment a necessary condition: and I would suggest, that such a measure is exceedingly analogous to the conduct which created such difficulty at Antioch, on the admission of the Gentiles, and puts a stumbling-block in the way of a weak believer.<a name=18:9></a> I own myself unable to understand the fitness and still less the necessity of such a step.<a name=18:10></a> It is a closing of the door of Christ against weak souls; and is, on the principles of the Charge, a pledge on the part of the convert to the religion which the civil Sovereign may choose for his people.<a name=18:11></a> While it is on the part of the Clergy a natural consequence of the Charge and Petition; for if they propose themselves as candidates for the favour of the civil government, in order to obtain its protection, and then seek for its aid in the character in which they have proposed themselves, it is at once their interest, and I must add, their obligation to support its interests in their ministry, and bind others to the same system: but how will this consist with their duty to Christ, and the souls which He has purchased with His own blood, and gathering them for Him?<a name=18:12></a> Further,

		The sermon of the Archbishop, as reported, speaks of "the scriptures as rightly interpreted": this, I conceive, is an unperceived acquiescence in Popery; for if there be an interpreter, he must, if anything, be an authorised one; which is Popery.<a name=19:4></a> The assertion of an interpreter is exactly contrary to the testimony of the Spirit, manifested in scripture and asserted by Protestantism, that the Scriptures are able to make wise unto salvation through faith; and to give light and understanding to the simple; so that men thereby become wiser than their teachers.<a name=19:5></a> But it will be said, You discard a ministry.<a name=19:6></a> God forbid.<a name=19:7></a> I look upon it as so much as is committed by the Holy Ghost of the offices of the Redeemer to men; but the system against which I remonstrate puts them in the wrong place.<a name=19:8></a> That of which they have a portion is all revealed to faith by the same Spirit in the Scriptures.<a name=19:9></a> Their order is, therefore, whether in their evangelical or episcopal characters, the representatives of the Apostle of our profession and Bishop of our souls, to preach the truth of Christ, according to their proportion of faith; and then those who have the Scriptures, and receive the word, will search whether these things are so, and become wise unto salvation.<a name=19:10></a> In their episcopal character they will guide the conduct of believers, who will again find their assurance and security in the Scriptures, which make the man of God perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.<a name=19:11></a>

		From the state of things of which I have spoken have resulted other efforts, either of the energies of knowledge, or the desires of spiritual life, exercising themselves, often to the peril of the individual, in (as it is conceived) mistaken efforts at producing a separation or reunion of believers, by taking a ground of their separation quite distinct from ordinary dissent as much as from Establishment.<a name=23:3></a> The spirit and desire in which much of this was carried on, was, doubtless, in many instances the genuine cravings of a mind actuated by the Spirit of God; but it has often been defective, in not practically waiting upon His will; and though doubtless affording a part of that testimony to what the Church was, which was consistent with the infirmity of our nature and the actual position of the Church, yet, even when of the highest order, it has failed for the reason mentioned, as in fact it ran before the general progress of the divine counsels.<a name=23:4></a> But those strivings of the Spirit in us (for such I believe them to be) are surely deserving of the serious attention of the people of God.<a name=23:5></a> This painful sense of our immense distance from that genuine exhibition of the purpose of God in His church, this looking after His power and glory, ought to lead us to thankfulness that He still thus deals with us, and to receive it as a pledge of that faithfulness which shall make the people of God, in due time, shine in the glory of the Lord.<a name=23:6></a> It should lead us also assiduously to seek what is the mind of Christ as to the path of believers in the present day; that it may be, though not exactly according to their own desires, yet perfectly according to what His present will concerning them is.<a name=23:7></a> We know that it was the purpose of God in Christ to gather in one all things in heaven and on

		In the first place, it is not a formal union of the outward professing bodies that is desirable; indeed it is surprising that reflecting Protestants should desire it: far from doing good, I conceive it would be impossible that such a body could be at all recognised as the church of God.<a name=24:5></a> It would be a counterpart to Romish unity; we should have the life of the church and the power of the word lost, and the unity of spiritual life utterly excluded.<a name=24:6></a> Whatever plans may be in the order of Providence, we can only act upon the principles of grace; and true unity is the unity of the Spirit, and it must be wrought by the operation of the Spirit.<a name=24:7></a> In the great darkness of the Church hitherto, outward division has been a main support, not only of zeal (as is very generally admitted), but also of the authority of the word, which is instrumentally the life of the church; and the Reformation consisted not, as has been commonly said, in the institution of a pure form of church, but in setting up the word, and the great Christian foundation and corner stone of "Justification by faith", in which believers might find life.<a name=24:8></a> But further, if the view that has been taken of the state of the church be correct, we may adjudge that he is an enemy to the work of the Spirit of God who seeks the interests of any particular denomination; and that those who believe in "the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ" ought carefully to keep from such a spirit; for it is drawing back the church to a state occasioned by ignorance and non-subjection to the word, and making a duty of its worst and antichristian results.<a name=24:9></a> This is a most subtle and prevailing

		THE NOTION OF A CLERGYMAN DISPENSATIONALLY THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		[It is necessary to give a brief account of the following tract, which is now published for the first time.<a name=36:1></a> It was intended to be published at the time; but the printer and publisher shewed it privately to some of the influential clergy before it was published, and I was surrounded and entreated not to publish it (I cannot really, at this distance of time, say by whom), and gave way.<a name=36:2></a> We can all understand (at least, any who have had deep convictions on points which affect the whole standing of the church of God) how (however deep internal convictions of any such truths may be) a serious and conscientious mind may hesitate as to putting forth what may shock the feelings of many godly persons, and violates established order; and in such matters all ought to be not only conscientious but serious, have the fear of God, and not merely an opinion on that which may work deeply in the minds of any, and affect so sacred a thing, the only sacred thing in the world, as the church of God.<a name=36:3></a> It never therefore appeared.<a name=36:4></a> Nor do I, though it may appear to be weakness in myself, regret it at the hands of Him who makes all things work together for good to them that love Him.<a name=36:5></a> I have a deep, abiding conviction that the building up of good can alone give lasting blessing, not the attacking evil.<a name=36:6></a> I would press It on every one who seeks good.<a name=36:7></a> I had not the most distant feeling of enmity against any, nor against the Establishment; I loved it still, I looked at it as a barrier against Popery.<a name=36:8></a> When I left it, I published the tract on "The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ".<a name=36:9></a> Every one knows, and for myself it is a matter of profound sorrow, and a sign of approaching judgment, that it has ceased to be such a barrier, and, for many, has been the road into it, and that infidel principles have been judicially pronounced to be fully admissible in it.<a name=36:10></a> Christians are thrown (where Paul originally threw them when warning them of the perilous times of the last days) on the word of God, and knowing of whom they have learned anything; as to which we have this word of the Apostle John, "He that is of God heareth us" -- not tradition, not the fathers in numberless folios, but "us" -- not development nor decrees of violent and clashing councils, but "that which was from the beginning", and, I add, the infallible faithfulness of an ascended Lord.<a name=36:11></a> But we are thus cast on great principles, I mean scriptural principles and truth.<a name=36:12></a> Of thus the presence of the Holy Ghost is a cardinal one.<a name=36:13></a> I may add as that which led to this (I mean as to the truth itself in my own soul), that, after I had been converted six or seven years, I learned by divine teaching what the Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, "In that day ye shall know .<a name=36:14></a>.<a name=36:15></a>.<a name=36:16></a> that ye are in me, and I in you" -- that I was one with Christ before God, and I found peace, and I have never, with many shortcomings, lost it since The same truth brought me out of the Establishment.<a name=36:17></a> I saw that the true church was composed of those who were thus united to Christ; I may add, it led me to wait for God's Son from heaven; for if I was sitting in heavenly places in Him, what was I waiting for but that He should come and take me there?<a name=36:18></a> The infinite love of God flowed early into my soul

		In the statement which I make here, I make no rash or hasty expression of feeling, but what I believe the Lord would press upon the minds of Christians, and that which they must receive: that, the converse of which He might bear with in practice, while it did not interfere with and oppose the purposes of His grace, winking at the ignorance, but cannot when it does.<a name=38:9></a>

		The statement which I make is this, that I believe the notion of a Clergyman to be the sin against the Holy Ghost in this dispensation.<a name=38:10></a> I am not talking of individuals wilfully committing it, but that the thing itself is such as regards this dispensation, and must result in its destruction: the substitution of something for the power and presence of that holy, blessed, and blessing Spirit, by which this dispensation is characterised, and by which the unrenewedness of man, and the authority of man, holds the place which alone that blessed Spirit has power and title to fill, as that other Comforter which should abide for ever.<a name=38:11></a>

		If the notion of a Clergyman has had the effect of the substitution of anything which is of man, and therefore subject to Satan, in the place and prerogative of that blessed Spirit exercising the vicarship of Christ in the world, it is clear, that however the providence of God may have overruled it, in the

		ignorance which He could wink at, it does, when stood upon and rested in against the presence and work of the Spirit, become direct sin against Him -- pure, dreadful, and destructive evil -- the very cause of destruction to the church.<a name=39:1></a> I must be observed here to say <i>nothing whatever</i> against offices in the church of Christ, and the exercise of authority in them, whether episcopal or evangelical in character.<a name=39:2></a> It were a vain and unnecessary work here to prove the recognition of that on which scripture is so plain.<a name=39:3></a> But they are spoken of in Scripture as gifts derived from on high: "He gave some apostles" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:5">Ephesians  4:5</a>, 7, 11); so in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, they are known only as gifts.<a name=39:4></a> My objection to the notion of a Clergyman is, that it <i>substitutes</i> something in the place of all these, which cannot be said to be of God at all, and is not found in Scripture.<a name=39:5></a> Now, I believe the whole principle of this to be contained in this dispensation in the word <i>clergyman</i>, and that this is the necessary root of that denial of the Holy Ghost which must, from the nature of the dispensation, end in its dissolution.<a name=39:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am quite aware that people will say, that this is not the sin against the Holy Ghost, that it may amount to resisting the Holy Ghost, but sin against the Holy Ghost is quite another thing.<a name=39:7></a> It is not so much another thing as people suppose.<a name=39:8></a> At any rate the cause of the destruction of the Jewish system was this very thing: "Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye".<a name=39:9></a> And I am perfectly satisfied, however this dispensation may be prolonged in order to the gathering of souls out of the world, of God's elect, it has sealed its destruction in the rejection and resistance of the Spirit of God.<a name=39:10></a> But I go a great deal farther, and I affirm, though that were sin enough, that the notion of a Clergyman puts <i>the dispensation</i> specifically in the position of the sin against the Holy Ghost, <i>and that every Clergyman is contributing to this</i>.<a name=39:11></a> The sin against the Holy Ghost was the ascribing to the power of evil that which came from the Holy Ghost: and such is the direct operation of the idea of a Clergyman.<a name=39:12></a> It charges the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, which the Spirit gives by the mouth of those whom He chooses,<a href="#39:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> whom they are pleased to call laymen, and the righteousness of conduct which flows from the reception of that testimony, with disorder and schism.<a name=39:13></a> Now, God is not the author of confusion or disorder, nor of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Sinners are converted to God, souls called out of darkness, the truth preached with energy and love to souls, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, in the constraint and constancy (in whatever weakness) of the Redeemer's love: men are gathered from evil and wickedness (for I will put the fullest case my adversaries could wish) into the communion of the Lord's love, to bear witness to their sole dependence on His dying love; and this is producing confusion and schism -- of which God is not the author, but Satan -- because they are not, nor are brought together by, clergymen!<a name=40:4></a> What is this but to charge the work of divine grace with proceeding from, and having the character of, the author of evil, which is blasphemy?<a name=40:5></a> and this is the immediate and direct effect, the necessary effect, of the notion -- the exclusive notion of a Clergyman.<a name=40:6></a>

		I will add, the desire for preaching is by no means the only characteristic of the present day.<a name=58:2></a> There are two others equally marked.<a name=58:3></a> And they are the desire, the appetite for scriptural information; and the desire amongst Christians for that which is little or not at all found in existing systems, and that is, communion with one another.<a name=58:4></a> The extent of the latter is, of course more confined, but not less decided; and, perhaps, its operation more remarkable.<a name=58:5></a> Further, I might add, that the necessity for discipline is growingly felt amongst all those who are exercised in Christian service, whether clergy or laity.<a name=58:6></a> In scriptural information the laity, and those who sit loose to the system, are by no means behind the clergy.<a name=58:7></a> If I were to draw a comparison, I should say they were rather before them in it.<a name=58:8></a> It is by no means the whole of Christianity to have extensive scriptural information.<a name=58:9></a> But the desire for it exists, and, I repeat, those conversant with the state of things in Ireland will by no means find the clergy the most informed in Scripture.<a name=58:10></a> In saying this, I beg most anxiously to be understood not to desire (God forbid that I should) to depreciate what God's Spirit has done in, and given to, the clergy.<a name=58:11></a> I believe God has in many instances much blessed them, looking at them individually.<a name=58:12></a> But, in point of fact, it is apparent to many that their extent of scriptural information is by no means such as to make them exclusively the instructors of the laity (if they force the line to be drawn, though I trust the laymen would ever recognise whatever God's Spirit had given to any, and be ready to learn from any), nor to meet the demand for scriptural information which exists, and which, though liable to abuse, like everything else, is surely of God, and the abuse of which can only be met by greater scriptural depth and knowledge.<a name=58:13></a>

		That "the word of the Lord may have free course", is a matter which few will deny to be of ultimate concern to the glory of God, though it be one which has in many ways been let and hindered by human perverseness: and in nothing more than by confining the preaching of the gospel within arbitrary limits of place and person, prescribed by man, but sanctioned in no way by Scripture.<a name=68:3></a> To a single mind which has known the value of God's love, and which views things in the light in which they are put by that blessed knowledge, it would not seem that, in the midst of a world lying under condemnation, yet visited by this love, aught beyond spiritual qualification was needed <i>for any one</i> to declare, to those whom he sees around him ready to perish, the remedy, namely, that Jesus has died for sinners.<a name=68:4></a> <i>Man</i> has been pleased to set up restrictions; but the point with the disciple is to know whether the <i>Lord</i> has done so, and what is the warrant for precluding any from full liberty of preaching to whom He has given His spirit for the purpose: seeing that, if it has been so given, there is infinite loss in the hindrance, and the Spirit of God is grieved.<a name=68:5></a> The same faithfulness to Christ, which will yield unqualified obedience to every jot and every tittle of His commands, will also lead us to search out every hindrance to his service, in order to its removal from ourselves or others.<a name=68:6></a> The present question is one of deep importance; for it is evident that, if the restrictions be not verily and indeed ordered by the Lord Himself or by His apostles, it comes to this, that in upholding them, on the one hand, there is a loss of much comfort and edification to the church by confining to the ministry of the one that which should flow from the Spirit in many; and, on the other, the gospel which was "to be preached to every creature" under heaven, is bound and fettered, and multitudes are shut out from the springs of life for want of the invitation which should be upon the lips of all, who themselves have drunk of the living waters.<a name=68:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, then, as to the speaking of Christians in the church.<a name=70:3></a> And here I remark that the directions in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>are entirely <i>inconsistent</i> with the necessity of ordination to speak.<a name=70:4></a> There <i>is</i> a line drawn there, but it is not between ordained or unordained.<a name=70:5></a> "Let your women keep silence in the churches"; a direction which never could have place, were the speaking confined to a definitely ordained person, but takes quite another ground; and which implies directly, not that it is right for every man to speak, but that there is preclusion of none, because of their not being in any stated office.<a name=70:6></a> Women were the precluded class; <i>there</i> the line was drawn.<a name=70:7></a> If men had not the gift of speaking, of course they would be silent, if they followed the directions there given.<a name=70:8></a> The apostle says, "every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation".<a name=70:9></a> Does he then say none ought to speak but one ordained?<a name=70:10></a> No.<a name=70:11></a> "Let all things be done unto edifying".<a name=70:12></a> <i>That</i> is the grand secret, the grand rule: in a tongue, by two or at the most by three, and by course, and interpret; prophets, let them speak two or three, etc.<a name=70:13></a> "For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted .<a name=70:14></a>.<a name=70:15></a>.<a name=70:16></a> " "for God .<a name=70:17></a>.<a name=70:18></a>.<a name=70:19></a> " etc.<a name=70:20></a> "Let your <i>women</i> keep silence in the churches; for it is not permitted unto <i>them</i> to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience".<a name=70:21></a> We have, then, distinction, not of <i>ordained</i> and <i>unordained</i>, but of those, who from their character -- <i>women</i> -- are not permitted to speak, <i>and the rest are</i>; being also directed in what order to do so, and the ground of distinction stated.<a name=70:22></a> And this is <i>God's</i> plan of decency and order.<a name=70:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the rest, they were all to speak, that all might learn, and all be comforted.<a name=70:24></a> Not all to speak at once, not all to speak every day, but all as God led them, according to the order there laid down, and as God was pleased to give them ability for the edifying of the church.<a name=70:25></a> I apply all this simply and exclusively to the question of Christians in general, having God's Spirit, using their respective gifts; and I assert that

		there was no such principle recognised as that they should not, but the contrary.<a name=71:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may and will be said by many, that these were the times of the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit.<a name=71:2></a> But the Spirit of God does not justify breaking through His own order by systematic rules: it would be most mischievous to say that He did.<a name=71:3></a> But the case, let it be observed, was not one of the prerogative of spiritual gifts, but of order; for women had spiritual gifts, as we read elsewhere, and directions are given for their exercise; but they were not to use them in the church, because it was out of order -- not comely.<a name=71:4></a> At the same time there was no hint that any or all the men were not, but <i>the contrary</i>, because it was <i>not</i> out of order.<a name=71:5></a> Aptness to teach may be a very important qualification for a bishop, but it cannot be said, <i>from scripture</i>, to be disorderly for any member of the body to speak in the church, if God had given him ability.<a name=71:6></a> Besides, though these extraordinary gifts may have ceased, I by no means admit that the ordinary gifts of believers, for the edification of the church, have ceased.<a name=71:7></a> On the contrary, I believe they are the instruments, the only real instruments of edification; nor do I see why, on principle, they should not be exercised in the church, or why the church has not a title to the edification derived from them.<a name=71:8></a> If the presence of the indwelling Spirit be in the church, it has that which renders it substantially competent to its own edification, and to worship God "in spirit and in truth".<a name=71:9></a> If it be not there, nothing else can be recognised, and is a church no longer; for no makeshift is warranted by scripture in default of the original constitutive character and endowments of a dispensation.<a name=71:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in thus upholding the common title of the saints, it may be supposed by some that the argument will be at once met by referring to the orderly way in which Christ originally gave in his church, "some apostles; and some, prophets; and some, pastors and teachers", etc.<a name=71:11></a> Now, unless one man centres all these offices in one person, by virtue of ordination, the objection will not apply, but on the contrary brings its own refutation.<a name=71:12></a> For we read, some had one service, some another -- the head, Christ, "from whom the whole body, fitly framed together and compacted by that which <i>every joint supplieth</i>, according to the effectual working <i>in the measure of every part</i>, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love".<a name=71:13></a> We

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it is a thought which might well commend itself to our minds, that if we have indeed lost many and ornamental members, it is no reason why we should summarily cut off the rest -- the word of wisdom or the word of knowledge, and the like, of which there is assuredly some measure yet remaining in the church.<a name=72:2></a> But if the attempt should be made to close the enquiry, by silencing all discussion with the startling assertion that it is useless, for the Spirit of God is utterly and altogether gone out of the Church; it at once brings on the question, If so, what are we, and where are we?<a name=72:3></a> The church of God without the Spirit?<a name=72:4></a> Verily, if He be not there, all union between Christ and His members is cut off, and the promise, "I am with you always, even unto the end of the world", is of none effect<a href="#72:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=72:5></a> But the word of God shall stand.<a name=72:6></a> "The world indeed cannot receive the Spirit of truth, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him", but let the disciples of Jesus know that He is with them; and that "wheresoever two or three are gathered together in his name", He is in their midst, His Spirit is with them for instruction and blessing.<a name=72:7></a> Is this correct?<a name=72:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus far then, as to the first case of speaking in the church.<a name=72:9></a> I advocate no system.<a name=72:10></a> I mourn over the departure of many of the comely parts or part, however, on which God set comeliness.<a name=72:11></a> These passages of the word I take as scriptural evidence that the confining of the edification of the church to nominal office alone has not the Scriptures to rest upon.<a name=72:12></a> I speak not here of elders, or their value, or the contrary; observing only that grace and scriptural qualities alone should be our standard of valuation; and that, in the arrangements of the Holy Ghost, it is only the gift of God which gives any title to service in the

		But the question becomes more important when considered in the second case, namely, as to speaking out of the church, because it forbids the preaching of the gospel by a vast number of persons who may have faithfully borne it to others.<a name=73:9></a> Let us inquire into the scriptural facts.<a name=73:10></a> In the first place, then, all the Christians preached.<a name=73:11></a> "They that were scattered abroad, went every where preaching the word" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:4">Acts  8:4</a>); and those who were scattered were <i>all</i>, except the apostles.<a name=73:12></a> Some critics have endeavoured to elude this plain passage, by saying that it is only speaking, which one not in office may do.<a name=73:13></a> But a reference to the original at once disproves the assertion.<a name=73:14></a> It is "evangelising the word": and we read elsewhere that "the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:19">Acts  11:19</a> - 21.<a name=73:15></a> Now, unless all the church were ordained (I think they <i>are</i>, to preach as far they have ability), here is the simplest case possible, the case in point.<a name=73:16></a> The first general preaching of the gospel which the Lord blest beyond the walls of Jerusalem knew no distinction between ordained and unordained.<a name=73:17></a> It had not entered into their minds then, that they who knew the glory of Christ were not to speak of it, where and how God enabled them.<a name=73:18></a> "And the hand of the Lord was with them".<a name=73:19></a> Paul preached without any other mission than seeing the glory of the Lord

		And here I will advert to that which is commonly adduced upon the subject -- the case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.<a name=75:5></a> It is remarkable that those who rest upon it should pass by a case immediately preceding, bearing upon this immediate subject; that of Eldad and Medad prophesying in the camp, though they had not come up to the door of the tabernacle, because the Spirit rested upon them.<a name=75:6></a> "Would God", said the meek man of God, "that all the Lord's people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them".<a name=75:7></a> That which was here <i>typically</i> proposed, the pouring out of the Spirit upon all, was in principle fulfilled in the Christian dispensation.<a name=75:8></a> Then, subsequently, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram acted not under the influence and energy of the Spirit in testifying to the people, but would have assumed authority -- the kingship of Moses, and the priesthood of Aaron.<a name=75:9></a> This was their fault, which very outrage is committed by those who attempt to defend themselves by urging the case before us: seeing that they are taking to themselves that kingship and priesthood which are Christ's alone, and setting up themselves as the only legitimate channels of blessing; and usurping His authority again on the other hand by excluding those who have the Spirit of God from exercising that which they have by the authority of God Himself<a href="#75:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=75:10></a> These things here spoken of were typical of our dispensation, as also the apostle states; and the conclusion is, that they make universal preaching desirable,

		This, then, is the force of these passages.<a name=76:6></a> The type of the pouring out of the Spirit in the camp with the gracious wish of Moses is the characteristic, the essential distinction of Christianity.<a name=76:7></a> Accordingly we find its primary presentation in the world, to be the Spirit poured out on the hundred and twenty who were assembled together, who therefore began to speak as the Spirit gave them utterance.<a name=76:8></a> And Peter, standing up, explains to the <i>Jews</i> that they were not drunk, but it was the thing spoken of by Joel -- the undistinguished pouring out of the Spirit upon men of all classes -- servants and handmaidens, their sons and their daughters prophesying -- the pouring out of the Spirit upon all flesh.<a name=76:9></a> This was the characteristic of its agency, and this we have seen acted upon in the subsequent history; to deny this, is to mistake the power of the dispensation, and, I will add, to lose it.<a name=76:10></a> And what is the consequence?<a name=76:11></a> Irregular action goes on, and cannot be restrained, for kingly power cannot be assumed to such purpose, or they are taking the part of Dathan and Abiram; but the power of the Spirit, in which God would give competency to restrain evil, has been slighted; and nominal office, which has been relied on, affords no remedy, unless the rights which the Roman Catholic system has assumed be attached to it, which is the assumption of power not given to the church at all.<a name=76:12></a> It is not for me to assert what is the evil of the present day; I am sure it is not the overflowing boldness of testimony against evil; and if evil exist, the remedy is not in seeking to hinder or to reject (for hindered, it surely will not, and cannot be) the title of preaching the

		One important advantage flowing from taking God's order instead of man's is at once seen; men will have their place and agency, whether within or without the assembly of the faithful, by virtue, not of nominal official situations formerly set up, <i>but of the gifts which God has given them</i>: a most important principle in the difference between Babylon and the divine economy.<a name=77:2></a> In truth, there are few things more important to remember, and especially in the present state of things, when human prescription regulates everything in matters of religion, that for anything but grace to be our criterion of station in the church (save in the awful responsibility of the individual, "these sinners against their own soul") -- <i>must be wrong</i>.<a name=77:3></a> In the last dispensation there was externally appointed order <i>independent of qualification</i>; in the present, the manifold grace and gifts of God in His church are the only means of adjusting and blending in true harmony the various parts and offices of the body of Christ.<a name=77:4></a>

		With regard to one part of the work -- evangelising, it is clear that a large portion of those who preach officially are incapacitated for it by their own act, as being shut up within restricted limits, and universally without any reference whatever to their individual qualifications, whether teachers, pastors, or evangelists, etc.<a name=77:5></a>, or the particular necessities of the station in which they are to labour.<a name=77:6></a> To such it must be obvious, that the deficiency cannot be otherwise supplied than by those who may be willing to allow God to appoint the field of their operations, and to do the work of the Lord wheresoever they shall be led by Him to labour for His name's sake (<a href="../bible/3John.htm#7">3 John  7</a>), and who will be owned by Him, though a Diotrephes may reject them.<a name=77:7></a> Nothing argues greater want of submission to Christ -- greater proof of preference of man's authority to the Lord's, than for any to discredit the free and unrestrained bearing forth of the gospel of the grace of God, who have placed themselves in circumstances where they are obliged to stop short of the work, for fear they should be discredited themselves; a work which they cannot do -- which they have

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would make one further observation, suggested by the present question.<a name=79:2></a> In observing the infinity of contending interests with which the church is now filled, "the wars and fightings" amongst brethren -- the restlessness of those who are spending their power and spirituality in defending one human system against another -- the inquiry solemnly forces itself upon us whilst witnessing the surrounding scene of excitement, For what are <i>we to contend</i>?<a name=79:3></a> The apostle has answered the question, "Contend earnestly for the faith which was <i>once</i> delivered to the saints".<a name=79:4></a> Let the inquiry then be calmly proposed to all our minds, For what are we contending?<a name=79:5></a> If it be for anything of <i>secondary</i> derivation, God cannot own it: the contention is <i>for our own</i>, and not <i>for the things of Christ</i>: for nothing <i>since</i> delivered is of His Spirit.<a name=79:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The preceding considerations tend to shew that opinions, supported by ever so fair an appearance of antiquity, are worthless -- are deeply injurious to the glory of God, unless based upon His word.<a name=79:7></a> The end in view will have been fully answered if but one servant of Christ should be added to that field of labour; or the doubts removed from the mind of but one brother who hesitates to acknowledge, as his fellow-workers, those who have been called by the same Spirit.<a name=79:8></a> And let it be observed that in this, as in all things, the liberty of the believer is not the spirit of insubordination, but of entire subjection to the Spirit and the church of God, wheresoever they may be found; not the spirit of enthusiasm, but of a sound mind -- of a mind <i>at one with God</i>, which alone gives righteous judgment.<a name=79:9></a> And let the people of God be waiting upon Him for His guidance.<a name=79:10></a> It is a time in which those who act with the simplest purpose will carry the work with them (for it is a day in which God is separating realities from forms), as that which can alone stand the universal dislocation which every institution is undergoing, and which the Spirit of God shall, and can, alone go through unscathed, and they that are led by Him unmarred and unhurt.<a name=79:11></a>

		Accordingly, the evidence which the apostle affords of his apostolate is never derivative, or that he had authority from others; but, "If I am not an apostle unto others, doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord": "For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel".<a name=100:2></a> "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, .<a name=100:3></a>.<a name=100:4></a>.<a name=100:5></a> examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.<a name=100:6></a> Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?<a name=100:7></a>" "Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds".<a name=100:8></a> So his argument, as to the dispensation, is "When he ascended up on high, .<a name=100:9></a>.<a name=100:10></a>.<a name=100:11></a> he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets", etc.<a name=100:12></a>

		The dispensation was one born out of due time; it must prove itself by its energy from on high: so it had been proved both in preaching Christ and teaching the church.<a name=103:10></a> But now Barnabas and Paul were to be sent out on a definite mission, and, of course, they had derived authority now.<a name=103:11></a> Whence?<a name=103:12></a> Everything was still made to depend on the energy and calling of God.<a name=103:13></a> "As certain prophets and teachers were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work whereunto I have called them; and when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away".<a name=103:14></a> Did the apostle derive his authority, his apostolic authority, from his ordination?<a name=103:15></a> That would be a strange assertion; and he says he had it neither of nor by man.<a name=103:16></a> If this had been his first going forth to preach, it would have been almost impossible to have hindered the conclusion that it had its source in this, and the apostolate would merely have been from the church at Antioch.<a name=103:17></a>

		Further, I would remark, that while the present care of the church was exactly what would be consistent with the looking for the coming of the Lord, which possessed the mind of the apostle, the arrangement of prospective provision by derivative authority for future ages was wholly inconsistent with it.<a name=109:1></a> When he was passing by Ephesus, in the consciousness that his personal care was closed, he warns the elders himself on their own responsibility, although, long before, Timothy had been left to watch the place (though it would appear he did not stay there long).<a name=109:2></a> But the charge to Timothy was doctrine.<a name=109:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All present care was as to the way in which they would wait for the Lord, and committal of trust to those called and gifted, where needed.<a name=109:4></a> But the arrangement of derivative authority would have been positive unbelief.<a name=109:5></a> Accordingly we find it broken among the Jews, where it had this character, never attempted among the Gentiles where the glory was manifested; now taken nominally from Peter, when <i>he</i> was gone who withstood these things to the face.<a name=109:6></a> Our present duty is every possible care of the church as far as gathered, and of the saints, which God by His Spirit may enable us to take; using (with all diligence, humility, and energy, with crying and tears, in which we may expect to use it) whatever He gives us, to keep out Satan and feed the flock of God, where we may be, or He send us; but to lean in constant dependence on Him for the constant supply of the Spirit of His grace, as our only ground of strength; and when we fail, commend them to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build them up, and give them an inheritance among them that are sanctified.<a name=109:7></a> He who knows this in spirit, will well know its sorrow, and how near it draws one to God.<a name=109:8></a> But all this is God's provision, not for the wickedness of man, but for that failure, which in man's foolishness shall cause all to centre in the glory of the Lord.<a name=109:9></a>

		But there is one further point, with which we must close.<a name=109:10></a> To the mere laying on of hands, if done spiritually, I know of no objection; but reference of the heart to derivative authority has quite another character.<a name=109:11></a> It is Judaizing.<a name=109:12></a> It is, if insisted on, the principle of apostasy, as denying the power and calling of the Holy Ghost, or His competency to send, bless, and sanctify.<a name=109:13></a> Wherever we return to Jewish practice as an imposed necessity, we return to the idolatry of the world.<a name=109:14></a> There was a special sanction of worldly elements to a given purpose; and worldly elements, and glory, and honour had their place, while

	<div class="paragraph">
		it was so ordered.<a name=110:1></a> The principles of the human heart which sought them were dealt with on their own ground and terms, though in God's way; because, till the rejection of Christ, man and the world were not treated with as dead in trespasses and sins, as lying in wickedness, as at enmity with God; and riches, and honours, and worldly things accompanied the love of wisdom, and human principles were dealt with.<a name=110:2></a> But in the rejection of Christ, the truth was brought fully out to light: the system of the world was set aside as to all its elements, as evil; God's sanction to it in any form or sort ceased.<a name=110:3></a> Its friendship was enmity with God.<a name=110:4></a> It was convinced of sin, and righteousness, set up not there but in the heavens, hid with God, revealed to faith.<a name=110:5></a> Judaism had been the place of righteousness, but iniquity was found in it; and, being set aside, its principles became merely the simple worldly elements, without any sanction of God at all, and with merely their own worldly character; and the return to them became apostasy, return to the mere evil world.<a name=110:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the apostle's statement, the force of which is by no means in general sufficiently estimated.<a name=110:7></a> Writing to the Galatians, he says, "Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service to them which by nature are no gods.<a name=110:8></a> But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire <i>again</i> to be in bondage?<a name=110:9></a> Ye observe", etc.<a name=110:10></a> That is, Gentiles become Christians, and looking to Jewish principles, were returning to their own old Gentile state: for what else was Judaizing now?<a name=110:11></a> It was simply joining the world, the ungodly world, which had not the Spirit of God in it, ending in the flesh.<a name=110:12></a> So the apostle argues in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:19">Colossians  2:19</a> - 23, especially verse 20.<a name=110:13></a> Wherever, then, we turn to what is Jewish (a right thing while God's work was of this world), we have the principle of apostasy in us (these things have the rudiments of the world in them), and we shall more or less join the world, which has not the Spirit, which is at enmity with God.<a name=110:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And when, I would ask, has the church looked to this derivative character as essential and necessary that it has not joined the world?<a name=110:15></a> Receiving the principle of the world into its bosom, it soon fell into its practice; and this is the character, the form of apostasy.<a name=110:16></a> And the absence or subversion of justification by faith, and maintaining the doctrine of works for salvation, derived authority, and the church in the world, have

	<div class="paragraph">
		The preceding observations may seem protracted; yet I think the importance of the principles warrants the deepest consideration of the subject.<a name=111:7></a> My own mind is very clear on it in principle, though I may have much to learn in detail.<a name=111:8></a> I have endeavoured, under the Lord's mercy, to confine myself to the principles, to hurt no one, the matter being not of controversy, but of deep and everlasting truth.<a name=111:9></a> It is a remark able thing that -- while almost all the churches more or less hang on derivative authority -- where it is settled as a system, we may note, first, human derivation is its first basis as a principle; secondly, it is connected entirely with Peter, and succession from him; and in conferring the authority, it uses the words used by the Lord in conferring it on His Jewish apostles, previous to His ascension.<a name=111:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I propose saying a few words on the very solemn subject of the apostasy of the dispensation, suggesting the scriptural statements concerning it, rather than making any comment.<a name=112:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This subject has been touched upon connected with the calling of Paul, with the raising up of an extraordinary messenger of grace upon Israel's rejection of the testimony of the Holy Ghost to the exalted Jesus.<a name=112:2></a> I purpose to advert now to the positive scriptural evidence of the apostasy; and I will merely retrace, with some additional circumstances, the previous point, which declared its apostasy in its first or Jewish organisation.<a name=112:3></a> The scriptures I would now refer to are in evidence of the plain fact of direct ecclesiastical apostasy, the revealed existence of that which determined the fate of the dispensation.<a name=112:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The rejection of the Lord Jesus really crowned the sin of the Jewish people -- of man; but on the cross the Lord interposed by intercession, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"; and to this expression of the gracious and blessed mind of the Lord the Holy Ghost replies, when by the mouth of Peter He says, "and now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers; repent ye therefore".<a name=112:5></a> That is, the Holy Ghost now bore testimony to the exaltation of Jesus to give <i>repentance</i> to Israel and remission of sins.<a name=112:6></a> Hence all the testimony of Peter is to God's exaltation of the rejected Messiah, the Son of man.<a name=112:7></a> This testimony, as has been long since observed, was finally rejected in the martyrdom of Stephen; and at this point the Jewish central successional order closed, and Paul, the chief volunteer and agent in carrying the active hatred of, and opposition to the testimony, into effect, is raised up to be a witness of the grace, which in long-suffering overruled it all and surpassed it all.<a name=112:8></a> Thus he was at once a messenger to the Gentiles of sovereign grace, and of the union of the church with Christ; and the type of the calling of a remnant of the Jews, by this sovereign grace, in the latter day: in respect of one, designating himself the chief of sinners; as regards the second, first called -- or all long-suffering in him first shewn forth.<a name=112:9></a> He was taken into a solitary place of sovereign grace, to

	<div class="paragraph">
		To his testimony the Jews scattered everywhere opposed themselves.<a name=113:2></a> They not only refused the testimony themselves, but opposed its being carried to others.<a name=113:3></a> Of this Bar-jesus is the remarkable expression and therefore grace here ceases, and judicial blindness is put on him for a season.<a name=113:4></a> As the apostle expresses it in his meet judgment on them, "forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always; for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost"<a href="#113:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=113:5></a> This manifestly closed the scene, and many were the sorrowful consequences.<a name=113:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The actings of Satan, by the instrumentality of Jewish principles now passed away, in corrupting the church, must be familiar to any one acquainted with the perfect word of God.<a name=113:7></a> Human righteousness, ordinances, succession, and ceremonial observance of times, connecting spiritual religion with human imagination, form the marked characteristics of this corruption of the truth -- perverting, even in the apostle's days, whole houses.<a name=113:8></a> Not the only characteristics, but the chief in principle.<a name=113:9></a> Of other formal ones I might mention tradition and the centralisation of religion upon earth, instead of the power of the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, now associating all with heaven, Jesus bang only known there by the power of a mission not of man nor by man.<a name=113:10></a> But upon this I cannot enlarge here.<a name=113:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would clear the point by a few brief explanations of what I mean; endeavouring, though it be connected with many most interesting subjects, to keep it as simple as possible.<a name=114:4></a> In the first place, I would remark, that the responsibility of man, or any set of men under any dispensation of God, is quite distinct from the salvation of any individuals of that dispensation.<a name=114:5></a> The confounding of these things renders the apprehension of the dealings of God with man impossible: either the security of the Lord's faithfulness, or the responsibility of man in and by any given economy, is lost.<a name=114:6></a> Adam was responsible in innocence.<a name=114:7></a> His individual salvation stood clearly on other ground.<a name=114:8></a> Noah was responsible for the ordering of his house and family (we may say, then, the world) in holy government.<a name=114:9></a> The failure of this, though producing most important results, has nothing to do with Noah's salvation.<a name=114:10></a> In a word, if God deals in a process of government <i>here</i> for the manifestation of His character, this and the salvation of individuals, while that process is going on, are quite distinct; though the conduct of the saved may be guided and formed by the dispensation here below.<a name=114:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nay, so decided is this distinction, it is just where the dispensation entirely fails, that the faithfulness of the saved remnant is most conspicuously manifest.<a name=114:12></a> What judge was like Samuel, when Israel failed under that ordering of God's people and God gave them a king in His anger?<a name=114:13></a> Thus Israel as a whole, under the law, were put as a dispensation under the responsibility of its observance, and nationally failed, though a remnant all through were of God and saved.<a name=114:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Every dispensation has some special deposit, so to speak, entrusted to it, by which its fidelity is tried.<a name=114:15></a> And, as it seems to me, every one of them will be made good, and God glorified in them, in Jesus, on the proved failure of man in each.<a name=114:16></a> Thus, not to go to other examples, the law -- Israel made the golden calf.<a name=114:17></a> The law will be written in their hearts hereafter.<a name=114:18></a> The dispensation of the Holy Ghost's power, or the manifestation of Christ glorified by the Holy Ghost the Comforter, as against the world which rejected Him, has its responsibility too.<a name=114:19></a> It is true, effectual salvation and the grounds of it have been more plainly brought out, so that we can more easily appropriate

		The passages I have hitherto cited prove: --

		First, the liability of the dispensation to apostasy, as <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>, itself sufficient to teach the result to those acquainted with human nature.<a name=119:8></a> Others, as <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2">1 John  2</a>, shew that antichrists were already come; whereby Christians knew that it was then the last time, because evil was found to have its worst form and source from the bosom of Christianity itself.<a name=119:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The evil itself is characterised in the two epistles to Timothy: first, as departing from the faith, but this, it must be observed, chiefly in practical points; and secondly, in the general result of a character analogous to heathenism in its moral evils, but, though the power was denied, maintaining the form of godliness.<a name=119:10></a> Besides these, we have the testimony from the Thessalonians, that the day of the Lord would not come without the apostasy coming first; and that the mystery of iniquity was already then at work.<a name=119:11></a> To these we may add the testimony of the Spirit by Peter, that scorn of the expectation of the Lord's second coming would be characteristic of the scoffers of these perilous days.<a name=119:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All these passages concur to shew that the result of the dispensation would be "apostasy", "perilous times", "departure from the faith"; and that the mystery of iniquity, the

		principles of evil which produced this, were already at work The present effects then were different: partly a hidden spirit at work, hindered as yet, in its great public manifestation in Satanic power; partly an open apostasy, and going out from the saints -- too pure then, too assiduously watched over by apostolic vigilance and spiritual power to allow, when assuming an open form of evil, its continuance among the saints; partly, as we shall see, not by going out, but by the creeping in of corrupt men.<a name=120:1></a> But, however manifested in present effects, these are but the signs of a principle at work which should be consummated in the man of sin -- of a principle which involved the dispensation in apostasy and excision, whatever the gracious patience of God: a principle then operating, and thereby affording an opportunity to the apostles to forewarn the church; and by their authority enabling us to say, that the last times were <i>then come</i>, though there might be a prolonging of mercy.<a name=120:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This assertion, that the last times were then come, is of all possible importance.<a name=120:3></a> There was a moral departure from God in the bosom of Christianity.<a name=120:4></a> The effects of this might be stayed by the hand of the apostle, but forced the apostle to say the last times were come.<a name=120:5></a> Theologians may comment on such an expression, and say that the last times mean the times of Messiah.<a name=120:6></a> But then the presence of <i>Messiah</i> would prove that; but the proof of the last times here is that, after <i>that</i>, antichrists are come: they were characteristically and really the last times of the dispensation.<a name=120:7></a> Men had slept; the enemy had sowed tares; and it must be left as it was till judgment, as regards the place it held in the world.<a name=120:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is admitted that the present effects and manifestations of the apostasy were then different in form and extent from what they will assume when judged.<a name=120:9></a> The apostolic energy, and spiritual life in the body of the church itself on which that energy acted, either cast out the evil or suppressed it; just as the zeal of an untainted Moses rescued Israel from the present effects of the golden calf, and destroyed the present exhibition of the apostasy.<a name=120:10></a> But it was not the less really come in, though the patience of God was not yet exhausted by the rejection of His Son.<a name=120:11></a> And the apostle was well aware, and the Holy Ghost gives us the expression of His assurance, that it was the presence of the apostolic energy which arrested its display.<a name=120:12></a> "I know that after my decease", is the sorrowful testimony of the parting apostle; as Peter also warned them

	<div class="paragraph">
		There remains yet one passage which I have not hitherto quoted, which (as the passage of John has shewn us that the last times -- whatever their prolongation -- were already come) identifies the objects of the revelation as then existing with those who are objects of judgment at the close, on the Lord's return.<a name=121:4></a>

		The book of Jude may be taken as the history or revelation of apostasy.<a name=121:5></a> The very commencement of the epistle marks the necessity which attracted the testimony of the Spirit of God.<a name=121:6></a> "Beloved", says the apostle, "when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you, that ye should earnestly contend for the faith once delivered unto the saints; for there are certain men crept in unawares, who were of old ordained unto this condemnation".<a name=121:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is most distinct.<a name=121:8></a> The evil anticipated by the counsels of God had crept in by the neglect of man already in the days of the apostles.<a name=121:9></a> While men slept, the enemy had come and sown tares.<a name=121:10></a> This infected the susceptibility of the church's conscience; "though ye once knew this", says the apostle, refers to the excision of the whole body save two, in warning to them; and likens the resulting condition of the church to the angels which kept not their first estate, and to Sodom and Gomorrah.<a name=121:11></a> He then intimates to them the different (and, I would add, in some respects progressive) characters of the apostasy (though the entrance of the succeeding ones does not neutralise the former): natural evil and enmity, religious corruption for gain, and open hostility to the priesthood and royalty of Christ, on the part of the religious teachers of the people -- Cain, Balaam, and Core.<a name=121:12></a> Having thus traced the Forms and characters of the apostasy from beginning to end, the apostle gives us the all-important truth, that what had then already found its way into the church was the direct object of the judgment of Christ at His coming, as it had been prophesied from the beginning -- the consummation of iniquity, in the apostasy of the last form of God's goodness, previous

	<div class="paragraph">
		The scriptures we have already cited shew, first, the warning of the possibility of failure and excision; secondly, the prophetic declaration that there would be an apostasy: and thirdly, that those positively designated from the earliest stages as the objects of judgment, as such apostasy, were, if not matured in their effects, already there; so that the ever watchful Spirit of God could descry, designate, and describe them; and evince that the mystery was already at work -- the evil to be judged already there in existence.<a name=122:11></a>

		That which remains of God's word is the warning or the immediate threatening of excision, and the account of a far different scene.<a name=122:12></a> Not the Father's intercourse with His children to instruct, warn, and comfort but the revelation of subsequent evil, and the arranging government of the world in the hands of the Lamb on the throne; when the church was gone from the scene below, and could no longer be the subject of His judgment or His care.<a name=122:13></a>

		ON LAY PREACHING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question of lay preaching is one of the greatest importance, and one in which, it is obvious, the interests of the church are deeply concerned; because, if God give His Spirit to laymen for the purpose, there is positive loss in the hindrance, and the Spirit of God is grieved.<a name=131:1></a> The point to be proved by those who are opposed to it is this, either that no laymen have the Spirit of God in testimony; or that, having it, the sanction of man is necessary for its exercise.<a name=131:2></a> I do not purpose here a general investigation of the principles of the subject, but merely to inquire whether laymen are entitled to preach, if the Lord give them opportunity; or, whether there be any human sanction needful for their doing so.<a name=131:3></a> I affirm that there is not; and that no such sanction can be proved to be necessary from Scripture; and that no such sanction was therein afforded.<a name=131:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The question is not, whether all laymen are individually qualified; but, whether as laymen they are disqualified, unless they are what is commonly called ordained.<a name=131:5></a> I say, commonly called, because the word, used in Scripture, does not in the original convey what it does to an English ear at present.<a name=131:6></a> I affirm that no such ordination was a qualification to preach in the days of scriptural statement.<a name=131:7></a> I do not despise order; I do not despise pastoral care -- I love it where it really exists, as that which savours in its place of the sweetest of God's services.<a name=131:8></a> Though it may be exercised sometimes in a manner not to our present taste or thought, a good shepherd will seek the scattered sheep.<a name=131:9></a> But I confine myself to a simple question -- the assertion that laymen ought not to preach without episcopal or other analogous appointment.<a name=131:10></a> My assertion is, that they are entitled; that they did so in Scripture; were justified in doing so, God blessing them therein; and that the principles of Scripture require it, assuming of course here that they are qualified of God; for the question here is not competency to act, <i>but title to act if competent</i>.<a name=131:11></a> Neither do I despise herein (God forbid that I should do so<a href="#131:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>) the holy setting apart,

		We have then a distinction, not of ordained and unordained, but of those who from their character -- <i>women</i> -- are not permitted to speak, <i>and the rest are</i>; and directed in what order to do so, and the ground of distinction stated.<a name=132:19></a> And this is <i>God's</i> plan of decency and order.<a name=132:20></a> For the rest they were all to speak, that all might learn, and all be comforted; not all to speak at once, not all to speak every day, but all as God led them, according to the order there laid down, and as God was pleased to give them ability, for the edifying of the church.<a name=132:21></a> I apply all this simply and exclusively to the question of laymen speaking; and I assert that there was no such principle recognised as that they should not, but the contrary.<a name=132:22></a>

		On the contrary, I believe they are the instrument, the only real instrument of edification; nor do I see why, on principle, they should not be exercised in the church, or why the church has not a title to the edification derived from them.<a name=133:8></a> If I were to speak of lay preaching, I should be referred to the orderly way in which Christ had given, in His church, some apostles, etc.<a name=133:9></a> Now, unless one man centres all these in one person by virtue of ordination, I do not see how it applies.<a name=133:10></a> I read, Some one; some, another -- "the Head, Christ, from whom the whole body, fitly joined together, and compacted by that which <i>every joint supplieth</i>, according to the effectual working in <i>the measure of every part</i>, maketh increase of the body, to the edifying of itself in love".<a name=133:11></a> And I read, that there are given, one the eye, the other the foot, the other the ear, that there <i>might be no schism</i> in the body.<a name=133:12></a> And if we have lost many and ornamental members, it is no reason why we should cut off the rest; the word of wisdom, or the word of knowledge, or the like.<a name=133:13></a> If the Spirit of God be clean gone out of the church how came that about?<a name=133:14></a> Was it when laymen spoke, or office was maintained?<a name=133:15></a>

		But it comes to be more important out of the church; because it precludes the testimony of the gospel by a vast number of persons, who may have faithfully borne it to others Let us inquire the scriptural facts.<a name=134:8></a> In the first place, then, all the Christians preached -- <i>went everywhere preaching the word</i>; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:4">Acts  8:4</a>.<a name=134:9></a> Some critics have endeavoured to elude this plain passage by saying, that this is <i>speaking</i>, which a layman may do.<a name=134:10></a> The short answer is -- it is not.<a name=134:11></a> It is "evangelising the word".<a name=134:12></a> And we read elsewhere, that "the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord".<a name=134:13></a> Now, unless all the church were ordained -- I think they are, to preach, as far as they have ability -- here is the simplest case possible, the case in point.<a name=134:14></a> The first general preaching of the gospel which the Lord blessed beyond the walls of Jerusalem, was by laymen; or, however, it knew no such distinction.<a name=134:15></a> It had not entered into their minds then, that they who knew the glory of Christ were not to speak of it, where and how God enabled them.<a name=134:16></a> And the hand of the Lord was with them.<a name=134:17></a> Paul preached without any other mission than seeing the glory of the Lord and His word -- in a synagogue, too, and boasts of it.<a name=134:18></a> And he gives his reasons for Christians preaching elsewhere -- "as it is written: I <i>believed</i>, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe and <i>therefore</i> speak".<a name=134:19></a> Apollos preached; and when Paul would have sent him from Ephesus to Corinth, he would not go.<a name=134:20></a> Yet, so far from being ordained before beginning to preach, he knew only the baptism of John.<a name=134:21></a> And Aquila and Priscilla took him to them, and

		ON THE FORMATION OF CHURCHES¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<h3>AIM OF THIS ESSAY</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Circumstances have latterly drawn the attention of many Christians to the question of the competency of believers, in our days, to form organised churches after the model, as they suppose, of the primitive churches, and have led to the inquiry whether the forming of such bodies is at this time agreeable to the will of God.<a name=138:1></a> Some respected and beloved brethren insist that the forming and organising of churches is, according to God's will, the only means of finding blessing in the midst of that confusion which is acknowledged to exist.<a name=138:2></a> Others consider that any such attempt is altogether man's effort, and as such, is wanting in the very primary condition of lasting blessing, namely, the condition of entire dependence upon God; although it may be blessed by God up to a certain point on account of the sincerity of purpose and piety of those who take part in it.<a name=138:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer of these pages, bound by the strongest ties of affection and of love in Christ to many who belong to bodies assuming the title of <i>Church of God</i>, has studiously avoided all collusion of judgment with his brethren on this subject, although he has often conversed with them concerning it.<a name=138:4></a> He has done no more than withdraw himself from the things he found among them, when those things appeared to him at variance with God's word, always endeavouring to "keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace", and remembering that word, "If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#15">Jeremiah  15</a>), a direction of unspeakable value in the present confusion.<a name=138:5></a> His affection is not lessened; his attachment is neither interrupted nor impaired.<a name=138:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two considerations especially constrain the writer to declare what to him appears the instruction of the Scriptures on this head: duty to the Lord (and the welfare of His Church is the highest of all considerations); and love to brethren -- a love which must be guided by faithfulness to the Lord.<a name=138:7></a> He writes these pages because the project of making churches is one of the hindrances in the way of the accomplishment of what all

		<h3>THE LORD'S PURPOSE IN THE GATHERING OF THE SAINTS ON EARTH</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the desire of our hearts, and as we believe God's will under this dispensation, that all the children of God should be gathered together as such, and, consequently, as <i>not of the world</i>.<a name=139:4></a> The Lord hath given Himself "not for that (the Jewish) nation only, but that he should gather together <i>in one</i> the children of God which are scattered abroad".<a name=139:5></a> This gathering together in one was then the immediate object on earth of Christ's death.<a name=139:6></a> The salvation of the elect was as certain before His advent, though accomplished by it, as afterwards.<a name=139:7></a> The Jewish dispensation which preceded His coming into the world had for its object, not to gather the church upon earth, but to exhibit the government of God by means of an elect nation.<a name=139:8></a> At this time the Lord's purpose is to <i>gather</i> as well as to <i>save</i>, to realise unity, not merely in the heavens, where the purposes of God shall surely be accomplished, but here upon earth, by one Spirit sent down from heaven.<a name=139:9></a> By one Spirit we are all baptised into one body.<a name=139:10></a> This is undeniably the truth concerning the church as it is set before us in the word.<a name=139:11></a> Men may go about proving that hypocrites and evil men had crept into the church, but there no resisting the inference that there was a church into which

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h3>NATIONAL SYSTEMS AND THEIR RELATION TO THE GATHERING OF BELIEVERS</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to systems called national, the existence of them cannot be traced higher than the period of the Reformation.<a name=140:3></a> The very idea seems not to have found entrance anterior to that period.<a name=140:4></a> The only thing in the least analogous -- the privileges of the Gallican Church, and the practice of voting by nations in certain general councils -- are so widely different, that they cannot be considered to call for any discussion.<a name=140:5></a> Nationalism -- in other words, the dividing of the church into bodies -- consisting of such and such a nation, is a novelty, not above three centuries old, although many dear children of God are found dwelling in it.<a name=140:6></a> The Reformation did not directly touch the question of the true character of God's church.<a name=140:7></a> It did nothing directly tending to restore it to its primitive estate It did what was more important: it brought out the truth of God as to the great doctrine by which souls are saved, with much more clearness, and with far mightier effect than the modern revival.<a name=140:8></a> But it did not re-establish the church in its primitive powers.<a name=140:9></a> On the contrary, it placed it in general under subjection to the state, in order to free it from subjection to the Pope; because it regarded the papal authority as dangerous, and looked upon all the subjects of a country as Christians.<a name=140:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To escape from this anomaly, believers have sought to shelter themselves under the distinction between a visible and an invisible church.<a name=140:11></a> But I read in Scripture, "Ye are the light of the world".<a name=140:12></a> Of what use is an invisible light?<a name=140:13></a> "A city set on an hill cannot be hid".<a name=140:14></a> To say that the true church has been reduced to the condition of being invisible is at once to decide the question, and to affirm that the church has entirely lost its original and essential standing, and departed from the purpose of God, and from the constitution it received from Him; for God did not light a candle that He might put it under a bushel, but that He might put it upon a candlestick to give light to them that are in the house.<a name=140:15></a> If it has become invisible it has ceased to answer the purpose for which it was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<h3>POSITION OF DISSENT RELATIVELY TO THE GATHERING OF BELIEVERS</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are (may I not say it?<a name=141:3></a>) agreed that the gathering together in one all the children of God is according to God's will as expressed in His word.<a name=141:4></a> But I ask, before I go farther, Can any one believe that the dissenting congregations, such as we see them in this or any other country, have attained to this end, or are at all likely to attain to it?<a name=141:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This truth of the gathering together of God's children is in Scripture seen realised in various localities, and in each central locality the Christians resident therein composed but one body: Scripture is perfectly clear on that head.<a name=141:6></a> It has indeed been objected that such union is impossible, but no evidence is produced from God's word in support of the assertion.<a name=141:7></a> It is said, How could it possibly be in London or in Paris?<a name=141:8></a> Now the thing was practicable at Jerusalem, where there were more than five thousand believers: and even though meeting in private houses and upper rooms, Christians were nevertheless but one body, under the guidance of one Spirit, with one rule of government, and in one communion, and were so acknowledged.<a name=141:9></a> Thus, at Corinth, or elsewhere, a letter addressed to the church of God would have found its way to a known body.<a name=141:10></a> I go farther, and say, that it is plainly our duty to desire pastors and teachers to take the care of such congregations, and that God did raise up such in the church as we see it in the word.<a name=141:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having fully recognised these weighty truths; namely (1) the union of all the children of God; (2) the union of all the children of God in each locality; having, moreover, acknowledged that they are so seen in the word of God -- the question might seem to be settled.<a name=141:12></a> But here we pause.<a name=141:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is indeed undeniable that this state of things, appearing in God's word (for it is a <i>fact</i>, not a theory), has ceased to exist, and the question to be solved is no other than this: How ought the Christian to judge and act when a condition of things set before us in the word no longer exists?<a name=141:14></a> You will say, he is to restore it.<a name=141:15></a> Your answer is itself one proof of the evil.<a name=141:16></a> It supposes that there is power in ourselves.<a name=141:17></a> I would say, Listen to the word and obey it, as it applies to such a

		<a name=142>[Page 142]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		state of declension.<a name=142:1></a> Your answer takes for granted two things: firstly, that it is according to the will of God to re-establish the economy or dispensation on its original footing after it has failed; and secondly, that <i>you</i> are both able and authorised to restore it.<a name=142:2></a> Is this scriptural ground to take?<a name=142:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Suppose a case: God made man upright -- God gave His law to man.<a name=142:4></a> Every Christian will allow that sin is an evil, and that it is our duty not to commit sin.<a name=142:5></a> Suppose that one convinced of this truth should set about fulfilling the law and being upright, and in that way pleasing God.<a name=142:6></a> You will at once exclaim, he is self-righteous and trusting in his own strength, and does not understand God's word.<a name=142:7></a> A return from existing evil unto that which God at the first set up, is therefore not always a proof that we have understood His word and will.<a name=142:8></a> Nevertheless, we shall rightly and truly judge that what He did at the first set up was good, and that we have departed from it.<a name=142:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Apply this to the church.<a name=142:10></a> We all acknowledge (for to such only am I writing) that God established churches; we confess that Christians (in a word, the church generally) have sadly departed from this original settlement by God, and are guilty therein.<a name=142:11></a> To undertake to re-establish it all on its first footing is (at any rate, it may be) an effect of the working of that very spirit which leads one to seek to set up again his own righteousness when it has been lost.<a name=142:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I can accede to your pretensions, I must see, not only that the church was such in the beginning, but, moreover, that it is according to God's will that it be restored to its primitive glory, now that man's sin has tarnished and departed from that glory; and, furthermore, that a voluntary union of "two or three" or two or three and twenty, or several such bodies, are each of them entitled, in any locality, to take the name of the church of God, when that church originally was an assemblage of all believers in any given locality.<a name=142:13></a> You must, moreover, make it clear to me, if you assume such a place, that you have so succeeded by the gift and power of God in gathering together believers, that you can rightfully treat those who refuse to answer to your call as schismatics, self-condemned, and strangers to God's church.<a name=142:14></a>

		The question before us is not whether such churches existed at a period when the word of God was written; but whether, after they have, by reason of man's sin, ceased to exist, and believers have been scattered (and these are facts, the truth of which is admitted), those who have undertaken the apostolic office of re-establishing them on their original footing, and in so doing, to set up again the entire dispensation, have really apprehended the divine will, and are indued with power to accomplish the task they have taken upon themselves -- questions which are widely distinct.<a name=145:8></a> I cannot think that any, even the most zealous of those persons, who, with a desire of which I willingly acknowledge the sincerity, have sought to again set up the fallen dispensation (and David was sincere in his desire to build the temple, although it was not God's will that he should do so), are in a condition to be able to do it, or that they have the right to impose upon my faith, as God's church, the little edifices that they have set up.<a name=145:9></a> And yet I am very far from thinking that there have not been churches in time past, when God sent His apostles to settle them; and in my opinion, he who is unable to discern the difference between the state in which the church was in those days and its present condition, has no very clear judgment in the things of God.<a name=145:10></a>

		It will be said that the word and the Spirit still remain in the church: most true.<a name=146:1></a> Blessed be God for it: this it is which is the whole ground of my confidence.<a name=146:2></a> What the church wants, is to learn to lean upon this.<a name=146:3></a> It is on that account that I am enquiring what the word and the Spirit say of the state of the fallen church, instead of arrogating to myself a competency to realise that which the Spirit has spoken of the first condition of the church.<a name=146:4></a> What I complain of is, that the thoughts of men have been followed, and that which the Spirit has recorded as having existed in the primitive church has been imitated, instead of searching for what the word and the Spirit have declared concerning our present condition.<a name=146:5></a> The same word, the same Spirit, which, speaking by Isaiah, told the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be still, and that God would preserve them from the Assyrian, said, by the mouth of Jeremiah, that he who should go forth to the Chaldeans should be saved alive.<a name=146:6></a> Faith and obedience in the one case was nothing less than presumption and disobedience in the other.<a name=146:7></a> Some will say this tends to confuse simple minds.<a name=146:8></a> Obedience to the word in humility of mind never confuses.<a name=146:9></a> I add, that those who are bent on restoring the whole church ought to be well instructed in the word, and to abstain from doing anything under the pretext of simplicity.<a name=146:10></a> The lowliness that feels aright the real condition of the church, preserves us from pretensions, that impel to an activity which is unauthorised by the word.<a name=146:11></a> The truth is, that the Scriptures, even those already quoted, prove that the condition of the dispensation at its close will be just the reverse of what it was at its opening.<a name=146:12></a> And the text quoted from the Romans (chapter 11: 22) is decisive on this point, that God would cut off the dispensation instead of restoring it, if it continued not in the goodness of God.<a name=146:13></a>

		A point of the utmost importance, which they who wish to organise churches seem to have altogether lost sight of, is that there is such a thing as POWER, and that the Holy Spirit alone has the power to gather and build up the church.<a name=151:6></a> They seem to think that, as soon as they have certain passages of scripture, they have nothing to do but to act them out; but under the garb of faithfulness, there is in this a fatal error -- it consists in leaving aside the presence and the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=151:7></a> We can only act out the word of God by the power of God.<a name=151:8></a> But the constituting the church was a direct effect of the <i>power</i> of the Holy Ghost.<a name=151:9></a> To leave aside that power, and still hold to the pretension of imitating the primitive church in what flowed from that power, is strangely to delude ourselves.<a name=151:10></a> Only I must remark that, where a direct act of obedience is concerned, the Christian has not to wait for power: the constant grace of Christ is his power to obey the word.<a name=151:11></a> In what precedes, I speak of power to do a divine work in the Church.<a name=151:12></a>

		<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I conclude by a few propositions: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The object to be desired is the gathering of all God's children.<a name=152:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. The power of the Holy Ghost can alone effect this.<a name=152:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. Any number of believers have no need to wait till that power produces the union of all (provided they act in the spirit of unity, which, if carried out, would unite the whole body of Christ), because they have the promise that, where two or three are gathered together in the name of the Lord, He will be in the midst of them, and two or three may act in reliance upon this promise.<a name=152:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. The necessity of ordination for the administration of the Supper nowhere appears in the New Testament, and it is clear that it was to break bread that Christians came together on the Lord's Day; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:7">Acts  20:7</a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:20">1 Corinthians  11:20</a>, 23.<a name=152:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5. A commission from man to preach the gospel is a thing unknown in the New Testament.<a name=152:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6. The choosing of presidents or pastors by the church is also altogether without warrant in the New Testament.<a name=152:10></a> The election of a president is a mere act of man, entirely unauthorised.<a name=152:11></a> It is a mere intervention of our wilfulness in the concerns of God's church, an action pregnant with evil consequences.<a name=152:12></a> The choosing of pastors is an encroachment on the authority of the Holy Ghost, who distributes gifts according to His will.<a name=152:13></a> Alas!<a name=152:14></a> for him who does not profit by the gift which God grants to another.<a name=152:15></a> Where elders were appointed, it was either by the apostles or else by those sent by the apostles to the churches.<a name=152:16></a>

		If the church is in ruins, God is sufficient even for that state of ruin; God will lead on and guide His children, if they walk in humility and obedience, without setting about a work that God has not called them to.<a name=153:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		7. It is clearly the duty of a believer to separate himself from every act that he sees to be not according to the word, though bearing with him who ignorantly does the act; and his duty requires this of him, even though his faithfulness should cause him to stand alone, and though, like Abraham, he should be obliged to go out without knowing whither he goes.<a name=153:2></a>

		<h3>FINAL REMARKS</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My design in these few pages has not been to shew either the ruined condition of the church, nor yet that the actual dispensation cannot be again set up, but rather to propose a question which is usually entirely misapprehended by those who undertake to organise churches.<a name=153:3></a> The ruin of the dispensation has been briefly considered in a tract on the apostasy of the present dispensation; but as a brother, to whom these pages have been read over, felt that this question of the ruin of the dispensation was awakened in his mind and desired to have some proof to satisfy such as were in like manner exercised, I add a few sentences.<a name=153:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The parable of the tares of the field is the Lord's judgment on this point -- that the evil wrought by Satan in the field where the good seed had been sown should not be remedied, but should continue until the harvest.<a name=153:5></a> Let it be borne in mind that the parable has nothing to do with discipline among God's children, but relates to the question of a remedy for evil brought in by Satan into the dispensation itself "whilst men slept", and to the restoration of the dispensation on its primitive footing.<a name=153:6></a> This question is decided summarily and with authority by the Lord <i>in the negative</i>, for He tells us that, throughout the duration of the dispensation, no remedy shall be applied to the evil; that the time of harvest, in other words the judgment, should extirpate it, and that until that period the evil should go on.<a name=153:7></a> Let us here call to mind that our separation from the evil, and our enjoyment of the presence of Christ with the "two or three", is altogether a different thing from the pretension to set up the dispensation again, now that the
	</div>

		evil has come in.<a name=154:1></a> The former is at once a duty and a privilege; the latter is the fruit of pride and disregard of the directions of the word.<a name=154:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. The 11th chapter of Romans, already quoted, expressly tells us that the present dispensation shall be dealt with like that which went before it, and that, if it continued not in the goodness of God, it should be cut off -- not restored.<a name=154:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. The second chapter of the second Epistle to the Thessalonians teaches us that the "mystery of iniquity" was already working; that, when an obstacle which then existed should be taken out of the way, that "wicked one" should be revealed; and that the Lord would "consume" him with "the breath of his mouth, and destroy him with the brightness of his coming".<a name=154:4></a> Thus the evil which had come in, in the days of the apostles, was to continue and ripen, and manifest itself, and be consumed by the Lord's coming.<a name=154:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third chapter of the second Epistle to Timothy shews the same thing, that is to say, the ruin of the dispensation, and not its restoration: that in the last days "perilous times should come", that men should be "lovers of their own selves" (and the Spirit adds, "from such turn away"), and that "evil men and seducers" should "wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived".<a name=154:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jude also shews that the evil which had already crept into the church would be the subject of judgment at the Lord's coming.<a name=154:7></a> (Compare verses 4 and 14).<a name=154:8></a> And this awful truth is confirmed by the analogy of all the ways of God toward men: namely, that man has perverted and corrupted what God has given him for his blessing: and that God has never repaired the evil, but has brought forth something better, after judging the iniquity.<a name=154:9></a> And this better thing has been in its turn corrupted, until at last eternal blessing will be brought in.<a name=154:10></a> When the dispensation was a positive revelation, as was the case under the law, God gathered a feeble remnant of believers from among those who were unbelieving, and translated them into that new blessing which He has established in place of that which had been corrupt, transplanting the residue of the Jews into the church.<a name=154:11></a> In the passage of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>the Holy Spirit instructs us that the Lord will in like manner deal with the present dispensation.<a name=154:12></a>

		I have done no more than cite a few express passages; but the more we study God's word, the more do we find this solemn truth confirmed.<a name=155:2></a> I say, then, do whatever you are enabled to do; but do not pretend to accomplish objects which are altogether beyond what the Lord has given you to which are altogether beyond what the Lord has given you to do; and do not thus betray the pretensions and the weakness of the flesh.<a name=155:3></a> Humility of heart and soul is the sure way not to be found fighting against the truth, for God giveth grace to the humble.<a name=155:4></a> And may His name of grace and mercy be for ever praised.<a name=155:5></a>

		The edition of the little tract "On the Formation of Churches" being at present exhausted, instead of publishing a second I give some explanations, called for alike by the circumstances actually surrounding the question and the difficulties which present themselves to many minds.<a name=156:1></a> My intention is not controversy.<a name=156:2></a> I am aware that, instead of doing good, it only tends to create divisions.<a name=156:3></a> I do not think I enter into it by giving these few explanations followed by several remarks on certain passages of the word.<a name=156:4></a> As to that which concerns me personally, I have only to be silent; for me it is a small thing to be judged by man's judgment, I desire to be like a deaf man who heareth not; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#38:13">Psalm  38:13</a>, 14.<a name=156:5></a> A stranger, it is true, according to the flesh, here as elsewhere, I have learnt that the Holy Spirit forms sweet and strong bonds, such as the world cannot understand, between those who, but for that, would never have known each other.<a name=156:6></a> I have also learnt that the children of God know what it is to be strangers (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#23:9">Exodus  23:9</a>; <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#19:34">Leviticus  19:34</a>), in that God has made them themselves strangers and pilgrims on the earth.<a name=156:7></a> The ties uniting them are not of this world, and will remain when all that distinguished them here below will have ceased to exist.<a name=156:8></a>

		I do not propose to myself to reply to Mr.<a name=156:9></a> Rochat's pamphlet.<a name=156:10></a> My only wish is to take advantage of the chief points of this work in order to treat of the important subject now occupying people's minds.<a name=156:11></a> It may be thought perhaps that, if I do not reply, it is because I am unable.<a name=156:12></a> Be it so.<a name=156:13></a> I would rather be reckoned beaten, than go out of the path in which I believe the Spirit of God leads me, or deviate, by uncharitable conduct, from that which may be profitable to all the souls loved of Jesus.<a name=156:14></a> I should not even have published this little work, if some persons had not sought explanations from me on passages quoted on either side.<a name=156:15></a>

		I shall be allowed to make some remarks by the way.<a name=157:1></a> If the name of Rolle has given pain to the well-beloved brother who has undertaken the task of replying to me, I truly regret it.<a name=157:2></a> I might have chosen as an example any other local body; and if the name of Rolle presented itself to my mind, it is probably because the meeting in that town has been formed, as everyone knows, on the principles under discussion.<a name=157:3></a> However, I think I also now see in it the hand of God.<a name=157:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may perhaps be said to me, If desirous of avoiding controversy, why do you enter upon such a subject?<a name=157:5></a> I reply that, along with a sincere desire for peace, it is not right on that account to refrain from setting forth important principles.<a name=157:6></a> If we are content to be judged by men, and commit ourselves entirely to God, I believe controversy can always be avoided.<a name=157:7></a> Those who wish to know the truth will examine the word and will be enlightened on the subject in question.<a name=157:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It strikes me that our beloved brother Rochat would have done better to have brought more calmness into the discussion.<a name=157:9></a> The little tract, according to him, presents 'views really quite new', 'on a point of singular importance'.<a name=157:10></a> Now, since the importance of the subject is so generally recognised, I may at least be excused having spoken of it.<a name=157:11></a> If charity is carefully maintained, I hope in the end what I have done will be proved to be right, and I believe that God Himself will approve me in it.<a name=157:12></a> Although the brother who has replied to me blames me, I continue to respect and love him.<a name=157:13></a> I look upon him, if not as my elder in age according to the flesh, at least as my elder in the grace of Christ.<a name=157:14></a> I love him, notwithstanding that he differs from me; I love him because of the grace God has bestowed upon him, and because I believe him to be much more faithful than I am in many respects.<a name=157:15></a> Blessed be God there is that in the effects of grace which is stronger sometimes than the rather rough usage of man's mind.<a name=157:16></a> I hope not to be wanting in love whilst making a few remarks on my brother's work, which will soon bring me to the main point of the question.<a name=157:17></a>

		<h3>GENERAL REMARKS</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The pamphlet which I have in view strikes me rather as the writing of one who, unaccustomed to argue with equals, looks for the reception of what he says as a thing decided.<a name=157:18></a> I beg this dear brother will bear with me whilst I explain a few things to him and examine with him his interpretations of the

		word.<a name=158:1></a> It seems to me that he has misunderstood me in many respects, and that he has not rightly interpreted some passages.<a name=158:2></a> A considerable portion of his pamphlet is taken up in replies to matters which are in his own thoughts, and not in the little tract; to matters he may have heard of somewhere, but for which I am by no means responsible.<a name=158:3></a> He blames the expression 'apostolic churches'; I have looked for it in vain in the tract.<a name=158:4></a> He argues at great length against the idea that there are no apostles because of the sins of the church; I have never said a word, nor have I even thought, of the question.<a name=158:5></a> One more little remark: he blames me much for using unscriptural expressions, and tells me that a person who thinks with the Bible can speak with the Bible.<a name=158:6></a> I have employed as well as I could words and expressions, which presented themselves to my mind; whether the thoughts are scriptural remains the question.<a name=158:7></a> Our dear brother does not like this expression 'the church dispensation', in fact it does not appear to me very exact, but it is sufficient that everyone understands me.<a name=158:8></a> The substance of the question is what is important in my mind.<a name=158:9></a> But is it not surprising that, in the very pages where these expressions are so strongly blamed, we should find the following words, 'The question is quite a different one.<a name=158:10></a> The dispensation of the new covenant subsists' (page 31 of the reply of Mr.<a name=158:11></a> Rochat)?<a name=158:12></a> Where is the expression found in the word?<a name=158:13></a> Does not our brother think with the Bible in this<a href="#158:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=158:14></a> I am not quite satisfied with my expression; his is perhaps more in accordance with traditional thoughts.<a name=158:15></a> In that it has the advantage, and will be more easily adopted: but in what is it more scriptural?<a name=158:16></a> For my part I do not blame our brother that, in order to express his thoughts, he has chosen words which he found the best adapted for the object he had in view.<a name=158:17></a> Let him on his part also forgive my expressions.<a name=158:18></a> On a point of such great importance for all the church, such observations may be well passed over.<a name=158:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one more thing which seems to have offended our brother.<a name=158:20></a> It is the desire so often expressed in the tract for greater humility.<a name=158:21></a> I have spoken of the tendency of the system to engender pride, but I have never spoken of individual pride.<a name=158:22></a> The pamphlet furnishes me with a very clear example of the evil I desired to specify.<a name=158:23></a> 'If the church', says the author (page 107), 'wishes its decisions to be respected, it should

		make them so as to be able to say, founding itself with full conviction of the word: It has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us'.<a name=159:1></a> Now that is what I call pride.<a name=159:2></a> We must bear in mind that the church, according to our brother, is this or that particular flock.<a name=159:3></a> Let us now examine the passage quoted.<a name=159:4></a> A dispute had arisen at Antioch, on a matter of importance, one that interested all the churches of the Gentiles.<a name=159:5></a> That was the appeal of a church to a higher authority or light.<a name=159:6></a> The authority of Paul and Barnabas having failed to decide it, a resolution was come to that they and other brethren should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, for the decision of this matter.<a name=159:7></a> Then the apostles and elders came together to examine this question, and having associated all the brethren with them, they thus addressed the brethren from among the Gentiles: "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things".<a name=159:8></a> Later, Paul and his fellow travellers, passing through the cities, instructed them to keep the ordinances decreed by the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.<a name=159:9></a> To arrogate to oneself the right of speaking as the apostles and elders spoke, when they were judging a question proposed to them and which referred to all the churches of the Gentiles and to say, It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, appears to me pride, when spoken by a meeting in our times, come out of existing worldly systems.<a name=159:10></a> That is what I mean when I speak of pride; the above example is clear enough and sufficiently precise to elucidate my meaning.<a name=159:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our brother insists much on this; viz.<a name=159:12></a>, that as long as faithful persons remain, it would be wrong to say that the church has apostatised.<a name=159:13></a> He rests his argument upon this precept -- "From such turn away", and he quotes <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>to shew us that there are faithful ones even under the Antichrist himself, connecting this quotation with <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>.<a name=159:14></a> I agree with him as to the connection between these texts, but it is precisely that which proves that the existence of faithful persons does not prevent there being an apostasy; for in this last passage that state of things is called apostasy although faithful persons remain, seeing that there will be such till the end.<a name=159:15></a> The existence then of faithful persons does not prevent there being an apostasy, since there will be some even under the Antichrist.<a name=159:16></a> The presence of Elias, of the prophets hid by fifties in caves, of the seven thousand who had not bowed the

		knee to Baal, did not do away with the fact of the ruin of Israel then in a state of apostasy, worshipping that false God.<a name=160:1></a> Israel apostatised in making the golden calf; but this did not prevent Moses remaining faithful, nor the Levites consecrating themselves to God by their fidelity.<a name=160:2></a> There have been faithful persons in all apostasies, and there will be till the end.<a name=160:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But our brother, having neither understood nor laid hold of the assertions of the tract, argues against things not found therein.<a name=160:4></a> I will explain myself on these points.<a name=160:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He insists upon it that the dispensation has not been cut off<a href="#160:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=160:6></a> Neither do I believe that it has.<a name=160:7></a> Like him, I distinguish between the abolition of a state of things by the Lord 'and the case where this state of things has ceased to exist through the negligence or the wickedness of man'.<a name=160:8></a> What I have proposed for the examination of brethren is this, what is the will of God in this latter case?<a name=160:9></a> In thus putting the question, I can say I have gained my aim, for I am fully convinced that the Holy Ghost will enlighten the saints.<a name=160:10></a> I ought also to say that I do not even think that the apostasy is at its height.<a name=160:11></a> Some there are who apply <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>to the Roman system; these latter cannot deny that the apostasy is already come.<a name=160:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chief point on which I insist is that the word of God predicts an apostasy and a cutting off, and tells us that, if the Gentiles do not continue in the goodness of God, they will be cut off.<a name=160:13></a> Now if the state of things established by God has ceased to exist through the negligence or wickedness of men, it is clear they have not continued in the goodness of God One more explanation.<a name=160:14></a> Provided that the meaning of the term "church" is understood, I have no objection to the word.<a name=160:15></a> The word church means an assembly: there, where two or three are gathered together in the name of Jesus, it is clear that there is an assembly.<a name=160:16></a> But when, by dint of the use of the term church, the belief is entertained that expressions made use of by the apostles and the church at Jerusalem can be employed, then I am afraid; especially when they assume the name of the 'church of God of such a place', an expression which goes much farther than that of church.<a name=160:17></a> It is true, that if some are unwilling to meet, that does not prevent its being

		Is it possible that one who refused to meet with the disciples at Jerusalem, and to be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ, would have been recognised as a Christian?<a name=161:4></a> would not any one who separated himself from them have been treated as schismatic and even worse?<a name=161:5></a> Save in the case of a schismatic or of an excommunicated person, there is no example of a church of God of a place which was not understood to contain all the children of God in that place.<a name=161:6></a>

		I thank God that His word connects with an assembly of two or three disciples gathered in the name of Jesus all that is requisite for its walk before the Lord.<a name=161:7></a> One more little remark.<a name=161:8></a> They tell us, Let us walk in the ordinances of the word: there is no need of apostles since we have their written instructions, which can at all times be carried out.<a name=161:9></a> Be it so.<a name=161:10></a> Well then are there so many flocks habitually deprived of partaking of the Lord's supper through the want of <i>consecrated pastors</i>?<a name=161:11></a> It is not I who prevent them.<a name=161:12></a> I believe that, if all things are done with propriety and good order, there can be breaking of bread quite as well without a consecrated man as with one.<a name=161:13></a> I see in the word no trace of consecration for this purpose.<a name=161:14></a> I cite this fact to shew that the want is felt of something more than precepts to follow: in other words, that God should raise up by His power instruments according to His good pleasure.<a name=161:15></a> Thus it is not enough to say, Here are the precepts: all that is now to be done is to follow them; since there are directions incapable of being followed out, unless God interposes afresh to re-establish what is lost as regards instruments.<a name=161:16></a> Let no one mistake me: I love order with all my heart, the true order which befits the house and ordinances of God.<a name=161:17></a> Leaving aside circumstances, every brother has the same capacity to break the bread.<a name=161:18></a> Nature as well as the word teaches us that young

		the word speaks of the church, it is, as if it were said in French, "the family", to designate the families or each family (see pages 26, 27, first reflection).<a name=163:1></a> I think the word of God speaks very clearly of one body on the earth, having certain gifts and privileges, as also a certain responsibility, and a common destiny here below although belonging to heaven in the counsels of God.<a name=163:2></a> I shall quote a few passages, by which it will be seen that the point in question is of one body, and of one body on the earth endowed with certain privileges, for the employment of which on the earth it is also responsible, although the result, which is the perfection of the body, be in heaven according to the counsels of God.<a name=163:3></a> So this subject can be considered under the point of view either of this responsibility here below, or that of the accomplishment of the counsels of God in the heavens.<a name=163:4></a>

		These are the quotations from holy scripture: "And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:16">Ephesians  2:16</a>.<a name=163:5></a> "Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord" (verse 20).<a name=163:6></a> "There is <i>one body</i> and one Spirit", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:4">Ephesians  4:4</a>.<a name=163:7></a> "From whom <i>the whole body</i> fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in love", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:16">Ephesians  4:16</a>.<a name=163:8></a> Gifts are given, not for the edification of one church, but for the "edification of <i>the body of Christ</i>" (verse 12).<a name=163:9></a> They are placed not in one church, but in the church.<a name=163:10></a> The result of this principle is of all importance, because, if I am a teacher, I am not one of a certain church, but in the church.<a name=163:11></a> But perhaps it may be said, this body has its unity in the heavens.<a name=163:12></a> I reply, that the apostle speaks of the service of the members of the body here below, of the joints of service here below, of which the work will be finished when the church will be glorified.<a name=163:13></a> Moreover, the application of this quotation to the church, a society here below, is in accordance with the views of the author himself of the pamphlet (page 43); and we can convince ourselves of this application in reading attentively the passages quoted by him.<a name=163:14></a> The church is then one body here below, and the gifts sent from on high are gifts placed like joints <i>in the whole body</i>.<a name=163:15></a> All the epistle to the Ephesians might be cited here; for this fundamental and precious truth forms the subject from beginning to end.<a name=163:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The greater part of the difficulty, which in general presents itself to the minds of the faithful on this subject, consists in their confounding the intentions of God with regard to the dispensation with His counsels regarding the faithful found in it.<a name=169:9></a> These counsels can never fail in their effect, but the dispensation itself may pass away and come to an end (although having been to the glory of God, in that it has displayed His ways), because the unfaithfulness of man has rendered it unfit to be the means of manifesting any longer this glory.<a name=169:10></a> Then God, who foreknows all that He purposes to accomplish, substitutes for it another dispensation in which man is placed in another kind of trial, and thus all the ways of God are manifested, and His manifold wisdom shines in its true brightness even in the heavenlies.<a name=169:11></a> We know that the Levitical dispensation has passed away, and that the faithful found there have been saved according to the counsels of God.<a name=169:12></a> Let us again examine, with more development, what the word of God says of the present dispensation.<a name=169:13></a> First, there is a very solemn

		Moreover, the apostle would not have us to be ignorant of this mystery, that there is a fulness of the Gentiles to come in, and that then Israel will be saved as a nation by the coming of the Deliverer, who will come out of Sion and who will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<a name=182:3></a> So Israel, Jacob, the nation, will be saved, for the counsels of God do not change.<a name=182:4></a> But is it in this dispensation?<a name=182:5></a> By no means; this has, for its first principle, the absence of the Saviour, and a heavenly calling, by the presence of another Comforter, who unites us to Jesus in the heavenlies, and who, in communicating to us His perfect and accomplished salvation, causes us to walk as pilgrims and strangers here below, being one body with Him who is on high, wrestling against wicked spirits in heavenly places, and passing through a world called "this present evil age", while taking up our cross to follow Jesus in His humiliation.<a name=182:6></a> But Israel will be saved, when the Deliverer shall come out of Sion.<a name=182:7></a> The world will be blessed by the presence and the reign of the Saviour; the present evil age will have terminated; Satan will be bound; the glory of this world, instead of being a snare laid by the enemy to turn away the faithful from their heavenly calling, will be the glory of Christ Himself; the enjoyment of all that this world can give will be the portion of the faithful here below, instead of the cross.<a name=182:8></a> Is this the same dispensation?<a name=182:9></a> In the place of the grace that endures all things, and which, while submitting to all things, commits itself to Him who judges righteously, it will be a kingdom of righteousness, which will not permit evil, because Jesus will have taken His great power and will act as a king.<a name=182:10></a> Yes, the presence and the reign of Jesus will bring in this immense change.<a name=182:11></a> In a word, whilst now we have to follow Jesus in His humiliation and rejection -- precious participation in His sufferings, so that we may be glorified together, then it will be the presence of Jesus reigning in power.<a name=182:12></a> It will be the dispensation of the fulness of times.<a name=182:13></a> The Jews will be a separate nation, and all the promises made to the fathers will be fulfilled on their behalf.<a name=182:14></a> I speak now of the earthly part of this dispensation, of that which concerns

		If I know how to bring but little profit, little strength to that which has fallen, though avoiding the evil, I will at least bring to it my tears, my sympathies, and my testimony, which the spirit of Christ also seems to me to bring.<a name=185:14></a> Moreover, individual faithfulness does not prevent one feeling, in spite of oneself, the effect of the unfaithfulness of the body of which one forms a part.<a name=185:15></a> Although Joshua and Caleb in the end reaped the effect of their faithfulness, they experienced also, during the passage through the wilderness, the effect of the unbelief of the assembly; nevertheless, not without receiving consolations and a strength in their hearts, which the rest of the people did not enjoy.<a name=185:16></a> The members of the same body ought to suffer from the misery of the other members through love, through the spirit of Christ and of charity.<a name=185:17></a> If they will not do it through love, they do it through necessity.<a name=185:18></a> Although our dear brother is unwilling to say "we", I do not think he can escape from the consequences of the general state of the church.<a name=185:19></a> But all that is the result of his having lost the idea of the unity of the body, this precious bond of charity.<a name=185:20></a>

		<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY OBSERVATIONS</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have yet to add a few remarks in addition to the observations that I have been making on the pamphlet of our dear brother.<a name=186:11></a> The important point to notice, for the well-being of the whole church, is, in the first place, the fundamental and very serious error, which consists in the denial of the unity of the church of Christ -- a unity such that it should manifest itself on earth by the presence and the power of the one Spirit during this dispensation.<a name=186:12></a> Secondly, the confusion of this dispensation with that of the fulness of times.<a name=186:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two errors suffice to obscure or to warp the judgment on all that concerns the present state of the dispensation, and on the whole subject of the church of God here below.<a name=186:14></a> For my part, I think I see, along with our dear brother, the hand of God in that he has been constrained to state them clearly, so that they should be examined by the word in all patience and love, and that the brethren, asking of God the help of His Spirit, might form their judgment according to the word, where the truth lies as to these points.<a name=186:15></a> The author says (page 81), to choose, to nominate, to establish, is more scriptural than to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=187>[Page 187]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		own.<a name=187:1></a> To own is also scriptural (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:12">1 Thessalonians  5:12</a>) -- with this difference, however, that the word of God calls on all the faithful persons to own and never to choose gifts, nor even elders, as we have seen.<a name=187:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nay, further, when a person is owned, the heart, the conscience, the affections, and respect are engaged; it is <i>a bond</i>, a bond formed by the exercise of the gift, in the heart of such who have profited thereby.<a name=187:3></a> The heart that has received blessing responds to the action of the Holy Spirit, which has taken place by means of the brother who has been its instrument; and thus the heart attaches itself to that instrument, and owns God in him; it is God's will that it should be so, and He binds together the members of the body by these mutual helps.<a name=187:4></a> And this is very especially applicable to a pastor, whose task is, to my mind, the most difficult that exists.<a name=187:5></a> What powerful bond does there not result when we own one from whom we have received blessing, who has led us on, counselled us, warned us, and preserved us from danger, and has made us know God -- our God -- better!<a name=187:6></a> The fact is that, according to my experience, there is more danger of overvaluing than of undervaluing a <i>true pastor</i>.<a name=187:7></a> Nevertheless, I see that the apostle puts a very great value upon such affections.<a name=187:8></a> Can one compare a vote of the church to bonds thus formed?<a name=187:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not deny that apostolic authority may have been of use, in certain cases, to give a sanction to the office of elder.<a name=187:10></a> This is what can never be done by the vote of a church, where perhaps new converts are called to determine a matter requiring the greatest spiritual discernment.<a name=187:11></a> It is never said that an apostle nominates a pastor, seeing that a pastor is a gift coming directly from God.<a name=187:12></a> They did choose elders.<a name=187:13></a> It was an office for which the gift of feeding the flock of God, in one way or another, was necessary or suitable.<a name=187:14></a> But they could not nominate to a gift -- a very important distinction for us, because we can enjoy the gift, without there being any one with authority to appoint an elder.<a name=187:15></a> Besides, I put no limit to what the Holy Spirit can do in this respect by counsel and a truly spiritual wisdom, although there be no apostle.<a name=187:16></a> It is my wish that all that the Holy Spirit gives may in all respects be freely exercised.<a name=187:17></a> It is not here a question of right, of authority, but of duty, of charity, of those bowels of love, which spends itself for the flock of God, which desires that all that God has given may be used in its place.<a name=187:18></a> There is no rule for that.<a name=187:19></a> The Holy

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is still a difference to point out between this dispensation and the Jewish dispensation.<a name=188:10></a> In the Jewish dispensation, the branches cut off were natural branches, so that, although sin occasioned the cutting off, it was not sin that had given them their place on the good olive tree.<a name=188:11></a> But in the present dispensation, as it is a remnant according to the Spirit,<a href="#188:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> which is of the essence of the dispensation, it is clear that the introduction of the wild branches has been occasioned by sin.<a name=188:12></a> "While men slept, the enemy came and sowed tares".<a name=188:13></a> At least, if it was not absolutely sin that introduced these branches, they were, however, never legitimate, and they would very soon

		<a class="footnote" name="#188:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>For, whenever I can find a remnant according to the Spirit, I find what is essential to the dispensation, although I have not all that was possessed by those who were faithful at the beginning of the dispensation. It is the confusion of these two things which leads our brother into error. I acknowledge that which is essential to the existence of the dispensation, where there are two or three believers gathered in the name of Jesus; but I do not pretend to possess in that state what I do not actually possess, and I do not wish to fill up its place by human means.

		As to presidency, there is one more explanation to give.<a name=189:3></a> I do not find that the word 'president' is employed in the word of God in the sense of presiding in an assembly.<a name=189:4></a> In this sentence, "that he who presides,<a href="#189:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> let him do it with diligence", it is the same word which is translated <i>to rule</i> in this text, "If a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:8">Romans  12:8</a>; <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:4">1 Timothy  3:4</a>, 5, 12.<a name=189:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us mark this well.<a name=190:2></a> In this passage of the Report, ministry does not mean service rendered to God and to men, whether of evangelisation, or of faithful care amongst those who have already been brought into the Lord's sheepfold; but it means a body of men, to whom belongs the right of exercising their ministry; of men who are, as it is said, a few lines lower down, a government in Christian churches.<a name=190:3></a> In short, ministry does not mean a certain service, or the subject of testimony with which this service is occupied (as it might be said, for instance, the ministry of the apostle, to designate his service; the ministry of the gospel, to designate the subject matter of testimony); but what has been falsely called the <i>Clergy</i>.<a name=190:4></a> I fully acknowledge a ministry (that is, a service rendered by God to men, by means of men raised up by God to this end), whether it be that this ministry is exercised towards the world in evangelisation, or is exercised in the church by gifts and suitable instruments of every kind.<a name=190:5></a> "Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation", etc.<a name=190:6></a>, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:6">Romans  12:6</a> - 8, etc.<a name=190:7></a> Peter also said, "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God", etc.<a name=190:8></a>, <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:10">1 Peter  4:10</a>.<a name=190:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, Jesus Himself approves of those, as faithful servants, who have traded with the gift that He entrusted to them, because they have sufficient confidence in Him to labour without further authority than the communication of the gift; and intelligence enough to understand that God does not light a candle to put it under a bushel.<a name=190:10></a> But this is not the meaning of the word ministry, in the paragraph we have just quoted.<a name=190:11></a> There the ministry is contrasted with the work of Priscilla, and Aquila, and of Origen before his ordination.<a name=190:12></a> "<i>They</i> were only simple believers", but besides that, "there is a ministry", that is, a clergy.<a name=190:13></a> Christian churches need a government.<a name=190:14></a>

Clergy has been made out of this, and the term is applied to the body ecclesiastic to make it the Lord's heritage and the government of the churches; whereas, there is found in the passage a warning against such conduct.

		<h3>APPENDIX</h3>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to add a few words on an objection, or rather on an aspect under which one may view a part of the reasoning of my pamphlet, in order to take away from its force.<a name=200:4></a> The answer to this objection is already to be found in the reasoning itself.<a name=200:5></a> Nevertheless, I would say a word about it.<a name=200:6></a> Here is the difficulty: it is admitted that God has set in the church, apostles, prophets, etc.<a name=200:7></a>; but it is said that it is in the body of Christ, in the church, one part of which is in heaven already, while another is in conflict, and a third part, finally, is not yet manifested; consequently, it is said, one cannot speak of a unity of the church on earth.<a name=200:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is my answer: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It cannot be denied that there has been a manifestation of that body, and of the unity of that body on earth, at the beginning of the present dispensation.<a name=200:9></a> Apostles and prophets did not exercise their ministry in heaven, although it was a spectacle there to angels; and the faithful who composed that unity, that body, were all on earth.<a name=200:10></a> This fact once admitted, the objection loses all its force; or, rather, it becomes an argument in favour of the truth on which I insist; for the blessed and powerful unity which then existed, does no longer exist.<a name=200:11></a> I only wish to enter upon the question, as concerning the conscience of those who now form the church of God on earth, and not with respect to the counsels of God.<a name=200:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If this objection be attentively considered, it will be seen that it gives greater prominence to the idea of the unity of the church, as a body on earth during this dispensation.<a name=200:13></a> If the unity of the church is not taken in the sense of forming a society here below, but only in the sense of the assembly of the elect, in a state of eternal salvation; then, it is evident that a considerable portion of the church was already in heaven, when the present dispensation began.<a name=200:14></a> This beginning has taken place, and the apostles were given, as well as the other gifts, as the result and manifestation of the glorification

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The unity I speak of, is, therefore, a unity produced by the sending of the Holy Spirit here below, after Christ had been glorified; it only existed after the sending of the Holy Spirit, as the result of His mission.<a name=201:2></a> It is evidently a question of something different from the unity of all the elect in heaven; for a great portion of these elect were already saved and removed from the earth when the unity that is spoken of began.<a name=201:3></a> It is therefore, a unity which belongs to the present dispensation, of which the Holy Spirit, sent from above, was to be the strength; it is a unity which should have acted on the world and consequently have been seen of the world.<a name=201:4></a> As the Saviour Himself said: "That they also may be one .<a name=201:5></a>.<a name=201:6></a>.<a name=201:7></a> that the world may believe", etc.<a name=201:8></a> And the manifestation of the Spirit applied in effect to the welfare of the body here below.<a name=201:9></a> Further, that unity was visible at the beginning of the dispensation; all the manifested saints formed part of it.<a name=201:10></a> The joints of supply were all working in the unity of the body on earth.<a name=201:11></a> But, it is said, this unity of the body must necessarily have ceased, since many of those who formed part of it are gone to heaven.<a name=201:12></a> In speaking thus, one admits that the unity took place; for, if it has ceased, it existed once.<a name=201:13></a> Yes; there has been here below a manifestation of the unity of the body by the power of the Holy Spirit, carrying it out in all the joints of supply.<a name=201:14></a> These joints of supply did exist, and were active, and if any joint did not perform its functions aright, the Holy Spirit, by means of the apostles, applied the remedy, although Jesus was no more on earth.<a name=201:15></a> "What will ye", says Paul, "shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, or in a spirit of meekness?<a name=201:16></a>" Thus, <i>the glory of Christ was not in the dust</i> here below.<a name=201:17></a> The church, filled with the Holy Spirit, one and united, reflected in the midst of the darkness of the night of the world the glory of that hidden Sun, of Jesus its beloved Saviour.<a name=201:18></a> This manifestation of the glory of Christ by the church in unity no longer exists.<a name=201:19></a> Is that a matter of indifference?<a name=201:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To me, it is a subject of tears and of deep humiliation.<a name=201:21></a> The glory of Christ, present, so to speak, in the church, by the power of the Holy Spirit, shed all its light on the cross, all its brightness on sin, and on the world.<a name=201:22></a> The cross, which began the Christian life, closed the life and hopes of the world; but it shone with all the brightness of the glory to which it led,

		<a name=202>[Page 202]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and which was to be its crown.<a name=202:1></a> These were the two terms of the Christian life.<a name=202:2></a> All the rest, that which lay between, was only passing.<a name=202:3></a> It was easy to be a stranger and a pilgrim, where the cross and the glory united to place in its true light the world which had crucified the Lord of glory; where the world was for the heart only, the empty tomb of Christ -- for love, only the scene of a testimony borne to a glory and to a love, which produced the ardent desire that He might come quickly.<a name=202:4></a> Is it so now?<a name=202:5></a> Are we united as at the beginning?<a name=202:6></a> Does that testimony of devotedness still exist?<a name=202:7></a> Are the glory of Christ and His coming things so present to the church, that every sacrifice is easy to it -- that the cross is light for it -- that the riches of this world are only for it an opportunity given of God to bear witness to His love, only unrighteous riches, of which one frees oneself, as of a burden, in order to cast them into the treasuries of Christ, that they may come out transformed and purified in the waters of His love?<a name=202:8></a> Am I to be satisfied when people tell me that the unity, in the bosom of which all this did manifest itself, can no longer exist, because the first Christians, who formed part of it, are dead?<a name=202:9></a> Ought my heart and my conscience to content themselves with such an answer?<a name=202:10></a> Dear brethren, are your hearts satisfied with it?<a name=202:11></a> If they are, I have done reasoning.<a name=202:12></a> If the manifestation of the glory of Christ in us and by us on earth, in His body, which is the church, does not touch you, I have nothing more to tell you.<a name=202:13></a> If the heart is indifferent to all this, there is no more reasoning for the Spirit of God.<a name=202:14></a> But if it be only knowledge that you lack, may God deign to bless my words for your heart!<a name=202:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of the union of the church, as a body, whether at the beginning or through the whole duration of the dispensation, is closely connected with the doctrine of the presence of the Holy Spirit here below.<a name=202:16></a> If He unites the members which are on earth to those who have departed, is it not just as true, that, being on earth as regards the order of the dispensations, He necessarily unites into one body all the Christians who are on earth?<a name=202:17></a> It is perfectly certain that this it is which He did at the beginning.<a name=202:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The objection which we are discussing, admits this truth.<a name=202:19></a> If, therefore, the Holy Spirit does not now unite the children of God into one body -- if that is impossible, for whatever reason it may be, it is evident that the state of things established

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order that the force of the unity produced by the Holy Spirit may be better understood, I shall call attention to a fact.<a name=203:7></a> At the time of His coming, Jesus, as Son of man, was corporally here below, although, as God, He was present everywhere; all the ways of God, on earth, were connected with that great fact.<a name=203:8></a> And so it is also with respect to the Holy Spirit: Jesus, when He was going away, promised "another Comforter"; that promise was fulfilled not many days after, and the Holy Spirit came down on the disciples, although He was present everywhere, inasmuch as He is God.<a name=203:9></a> According to the dispensation of God, the Holy Spirit dwells now also personally in the church of God on earth.<a name=203:10></a> All the ways of God are connected with this great fact -- the presence of the Holy Spirit in the church.<a name=203:11></a> The Spirit bears a living testimony to the glory of the Son of God, as the Son Himself glorified the Father while He abode here below.<a name=203:12></a>

		I do not quote again the passages of the Epistle to the Ephesians and of the Epistle to the Corinthians already quoted above.<a name=204:2></a> At the beginning, "the Lord added to the church .<a name=204:3></a>.<a name=204:4></a>.<a name=204:5></a> such as should be saved".<a name=204:6></a> I shall only call attention to the expression: "And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:26">1 Corinthians  12:26</a>.<a name=204:7></a> This expression is scarcely applicable to the members of the body of Christ who are already in heaven.<a name=204:8></a> Either this principle of love no longer finds its application, or the church has yet a unity on earth and must be viewed as a body which has "many members", but the members of which -- of this body which is one, although they are "many" -- are but "one body", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>.<a name=204:9></a> But in its present state, that body is imperfect, dilapidated, ruined, if you will.<a name=204:10></a> To say this is only to give one proof more of the ruin I have spoken of, a proof, the force of which is, I believe, but little appreciated by those who bring it forward.<a name=204:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The word <i>apostasy</i> has frightened many persons, and it has been said that the word is not scriptural.<a name=204:12></a> This is a mistake.<a name=204:13></a> It has been used because it is the word which the apostle employs to mark what is to happen before the judgment.<a name=204:14></a> Martin has translated it by the word "revolt" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:3">2 Thessalonians  2:3</a>); Sacy, by the word "apostasy"<a href="#204:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=204:15></a> The term "apostasy" necessarily supposes a certain body or a certain person that has been in a certain position, but who is fallen, who has failed, who has not kept his original state, etc.<a name=204:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The same objections might be made to the language of the Spirit of God Himself, speaking by the mouth of Jude, as are made to the use of the word "apostasy" to designate a state of things which is not yet openly manifested.<a name=204:17></a> "And Enoch also", says Jude, in speaking of those who had got into the church unnoticed, "prophesied of these".<a name=204:18></a> Man, reasoning according to his own views, might say, They are not "these" at all.<a name=204:19></a> According to man, he would be right.<a name=204:20></a> In fact, they were not these persons; but the Holy Spirit is not afraid of saying "of these", because, though hidden, they were of the same race.<a name=204:21></a> It was the same principle: they were the same men morally speaking: only the discernment of the Spirit

		ON MINISTRY: ITS NATURE, SOURCE, POWER, AND RESPONSIBILITY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The state of the church of God sufficiently, it seems to me, points out the usefulness of the following observations on ministry, which are not presented with a view to controversy, but to throw light on a subject on which much controversy has been expended.<a name=206:1></a> It is a subject, moreover, of sufficient dignity and interest to lead us above the mists of theological discussions, and into the enjoyment of the pure light of heaven, whence true ministry emanates.<a name=206:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be well as a preliminary to give its true place and proper aspect to the idea of ministry; for it appears to me, that the importance of it has scarcely been fully apprehended.<a name=206:3></a> Its details may be taken up afterwards.<a name=206:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<h3>COMPARISON BETWEEN THE LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD AND THE MINISTRY OF THE GOSPEL</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The existence of ministry is consequent on the nature of the present dispensation; and, in saying this, we ascend very high to discover its source; for the nature of this dispensation is nothing less than the sovereign grace of God, the activity of His love.<a name=206:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position and the character which distinguish the servants of God, are always, and necessarily, in unison with the principles of the relation which exists between God and men.<a name=206:6></a> When God only recognised certain families, the head of the family was its priest and prophet.<a name=206:7></a> We find examples of this in Abraham, Noah, and the other patriarchs.<a name=206:8></a> But this principle acquires a more general and important application, when a whole dispensation is in question; as in the case of Judaism and Christianity.<a name=206:9></a> The ways of God, and the principles of His dealings with sinners, are here unfolded with many more details for the conscience, and more distinctness and splendour as to the accomplishment and the revelation of grace.<a name=206:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, accordingly, the marked distinction between these two dispensations.<a name=206:11></a> In Judaism, under mount Sinai, where the law was given and those ordinances established which regulated the intercourse between the people and God, we have a people already formed and recognised as such before God; a people
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=207>[Page 207]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		whom God had already brought to Himself (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>); whose existence and whose rights depended on their being the children of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, and who, with few exceptions, were perpetuated by natural descent.<a name=207:1></a> In a word, they already existed as a people, when God entered into covenant relationship with them; for it pleased God to try if man, so privileged and put in possession of every possible advantage for the maintenance of his position, could stand before Him.<a name=207:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The work and principle of Christianity are altogether different.<a name=207:3></a> Christianity supposes man to be lost; it supposes that the trial, to which God has subjected him by means of the law, has only served to prove more plainly how impossible it is for man, whatever his advantages or his privileges, to stand before Him.<a name=207:4></a> But this having been proved, Christianity presents to us God in His grace visiting this ruined race.<a name=207:5></a> He beholds the Gentiles sunk in ignorance and idolatry, and degraded by the most revolting crimes; He finds the Jews still more culpable, having been unfaithful to higher privileges; and He exhibits both Jew and Gentile as the terrible proof that human nature is fallen and corrupt, and that <i>in the flesh</i> good does not dwell.<a name=207:6></a> In Christianity God sees man wicked, miserable, rebellious, lost; but He sees him according to His infinite compassions; He only notices the wretchedness of man to bear witness to him of His own pity.<a name=207:7></a> He beholds and comes to call men by Jesus; that they may enjoy in Him, and through Him, deliverance and salvation, with His favour and His blessing!<a name=207:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequence of the position of the Jewish nation was very simple: a law, to direct the conduct of a people already existing as such before God; and a priesthood, to maintain the relations which existed between this people and their God -- relations which were not of a character to enable them to draw nigh to Him without mediation.<a name=207:9></a> The question was not, how to seek and call those without; but to <i>order the intercourse</i> with God of a people already recognised as such.<a name=207:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we have already seen, Christianity has an entirely different character.<a name=207:11></a> It considers mankind as universally lost, proves them in reality to be so, and seeks, through the power of a new life, worshippers in spirit and in truth.<a name=207:12></a> In like manner does it introduce the worshippers themselves into the presence of God, who there reveals Himself as their Father -- a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=208>[Page 208]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Father who has sought and saved them.<a name=208:1></a> And this is done, not by means of an intermediate priestly class who represent the worshippers because of the inability of the latter to approach a terrible and imperfectly known God; but it introduces them in full confidence to a God known and loved, because He loved them, sought, and washed them from all their sins, that they might be before Him without fear.<a name=208:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequence of this marked difference between the relations in which Jews and Christians stand as toward God is, that the Jews had a <i>priesthood</i> (and not a ministry) which acted outwards, that is, outside the people; while Christianity has a <i>ministry</i> which finds its exercise in the active revelation of what God is -- whether within the church or without -- there being no intermediate priesthood between God and His people, save the Great High Priest Himself.<a name=208:3></a> The Christian priesthood is composed of all true Christians, who equally enjoy the right of entering into the holy places by the new and living way which has been consecrated for them -- a priesthood, moreover, whose relations are essentially heavenly.<a name=208:4></a> Ministry, then, is essential to Christianity; which is the activity of the love of God in delivering souls from ruin and from sin, and in drawing them to Himself.<a name=208:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On earth, then, as regards the relations subsisting between God and man, a <i>priesthood</i> was the distinguishing characteristic of the Jewish dispensation; <i>ministry</i>, of the Christian: because priesthood maintained the Jews in their relations with God; and because by ministry Christianity seeks in this world worshippers of the Father.<a name=208:6></a> I say, <i>on earth</i>, for, in truth, when we consider the portion of the Christian in its highest point of view, namely, in that which has relation to heaven, Christianity has its "kings and priests" -- that is to say, all saints.<a name=208:7></a> The <i>worship</i> of God is not ministry; it is the expression of the heart of the children before their Father in heaven, and of priests before their God; in the intimacy of the presence of Him who, in His love, has rent the veil, which His justice had opposed to the sinner; and has rent it by a stroke which has disarmed justice, and left her nothing but the happy task of clothing with the best robe those to whom before all entrance had been denied.<a name=208:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To suppose, then, the necessity of a <i>priestly order</i> is to deny the efficacy of the work of Christ, which has procured for us

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We thus see, that the <i>principle</i> of ministry is the active energy of love, of grace, flowing from the faith by which we know God.<a name=210:4></a> To touch this is to overthrow the whole in its fundamental principle.<a name=210:5></a> In its essence, ministry flows from individual knowledge of the Master's character.<a name=210:6></a> Grace known and strongly felt becomes active grace in our hearts -- the only true, the only possible source, in the nature of things, of a ministry according to God.<a name=210:7></a> We see, moreover, that it is the sovereignty of God, who gives, as He sees good, either natural capacity -- as the vessel to contain the gift -- or the gift, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, out of those treasures which are found in Him, and which He has received for men.<a name=210:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We find ministry based on the same principle, when the Lord says to Peter, "Simon Peter, lovest thou me"; and, on His reply adds, "Feed my sheep, feed my lambs".<a name=210:9></a> This leads to the two essential parts of ministry, namely: first, the free activity of the love, which impels to call souls to Christ; and secondly, the service of love which is unwearied in its efforts to edify them when called.<a name=210:10></a> As regards the ministry of the word (for there are other gifts), these two divisions are distinctly presented to us in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians.<a name=210:11></a> In verse 23, Paul is "a minister of the <i>gospel</i> preached to every creature under heaven"; and in verse 25, a minister of the body of Christ, the <i>church</i>, to fulfil the word of God.<a name=210:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the mainsprings and sources then of all ministry, there are these two things: the love produced in the heart by grace, the love which impels to activity; and the sovereignty of God, who communicates <i>gifts</i> as seems good to Him, and calls to this or that service -- a call, which renders ministry a matter of faithfulness and duty, on the part of him who is called.<a name=210:13></a> It is to be observed, that these two principles both suppose an entire freedom from man, who cannot interfere, as either the source or the authorisation of ministry, without, on the one hand, neutralising love, as the source of activity, or, on the other, infringing on the sovereignty of God, who calls and sends, and whose call constitutes duty.<a name=210:14></a> Co-operation and discipline according to the word find, withal, their own place untouched.<a name=210:15></a>

		<h3>ON THE POWER OF MINISTRY, AND ON ITS RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus briefly considered the question of the source of ministry, which connects itself with the very first principles and with the existence of Christianity, and which has its being in the activity of the love of God, let us examine the power which works in this ministry, and under what responsibility it is exercised by those to whom it is committed.<a name=211:3></a>

		<h3>POWER OF MINISTRY</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>indicates its general character.<a name=211:4></a> It is the ministry of the Spirit.<a name=211:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two grand features which characterise the work of Christ in the world.<a name=211:6></a> He is the Lamb of God who takes away sin, and He baptises with the Holy Ghost.<a name=211:7></a> I pass by the first point, however full of interest, as not belonging to our subject, save so far as it is an object about which ministry is occupied.<a name=211:8></a> I rest on the second of those things by which John the Baptist describes the work and the glory of Christ.<a name=211:9></a> "He shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost" -- a point which is evidently of the utmost importance, and the spring of all the power and spiritual energy which is to be found in the church.<a name=211:10></a> And truly, a spiritual energy is needed, that Satan may be combated with success, and that these poor bodies, the flesh being mortified, may become the vessels of testimony and of the power of God.<a name=211:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This power of the Holy Ghost in <i>man</i> is a most important truth.<a name=211:12></a> Jesus Himself was anointed by the Holy Ghost and with power.<a name=211:13></a> "How", said Peter to Cornelius, "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him".<a name=211:14></a> This was not spoken of His divinity; for He was God before the foundation of the world; nor of His perfection as man; for, as born of the Virgin Mary, His flesh was holy.<a name=211:15></a> He was the Son of God not only when He created the world, but also in the world, as the man born of this same Mary by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=211:16></a> He had the consciousness thereof when He answered His mother who sought Him in the temple: "Wist ye not

		that I must be about my Father's business?<a name=212:1></a>" Neither does it refer to His love: His mere presence in the world was love itself.<a name=212:2></a> But in addition to this, John the Baptist sees the Holy Ghost descending like a dove, and remaining upon Him.<a name=212:3></a> "God had anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power"; and then, for the first time, filled with the Holy Ghost, He begins His ministry, acts <i>officially</i> as Son of man in the world, and endures the temptations by which the Last Adam was to be tried, in order that He might assert His title beyond the power of Satan; while, on the contrary, the first Adam had fallen under that power.<a name=212:4></a> Then it is that we see Him casting out devils by the Spirit of God, and saying to His mother, "What have I to do with <i>thee</i>?<a name=212:5></a>" His whole life was the power of the Holy Ghost in ministry.<a name=212:6></a> By the Holy Spirit He offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=212:7></a> He was much more than man; and yet was He a man -- this Jesus of Nazareth, "whom God had anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power".<a name=212:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our part in all this has another and different element.<a name=212:9></a> In Him it was man, the Last Adam on the earth, Himself accomplishing, in the face of Satan, all that the spiritual man could offer to God in His life.<a name=212:10></a> His voice was not heard in the street.<a name=212:11></a> He must needs <i>be</i> perfect, and as man overcome Satan in that world in which man had failed, and in the very circumstances in which man found himself in consequence of his fall.<a name=212:12></a> This is what that precious Saviour has perfectly accomplished.<a name=212:13></a> Up to this, however, He had not become the commencement of a new order of things.<a name=212:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first Adam failed in the garden of Eden, in the very place where he was surrounded by blessings.<a name=212:15></a> It was when driven from it, that in his fallen state he became the head of a fallen race in this world of sin and ruin.<a name=212:16></a> Jesus, the Last Adam, must needs first be perfect, and personally gain the victory over Satan in the midst of the ruin -- a victory so complete, and so perfect, that, having bound the strong man, He could spoil his goods, and that His name, in the mouth of those whom He sent, sufficed to cast out devils.<a name=212:17></a> But to commence a new world of glory and of blessing, to redeem His church, and make her like unto Himself, according to the power by which He is able to subdue all things to Himself, it was necessary that He should overcome Satan in the last stronghold in which he held men captive, by the judgment and under the sentence of God

		Thus, the wrath of God having passed over (except as to those who reject Jesus), all the power of Satan being destroyed in the very seat of that power as regards man, death being overcome, his gates of brass burst open -- Jesus, the Last Adam, Victor over Satan and death, Heir, as Son of man, and, by the righteousness of God, of all that Adam possessed, and much more than Adam lost, while, as Son of God, upholding all things by the word of His power; the image of the invisible God, and the expression of His glory -- Jesus, conformably to the counsels of God concerning man, begins to act as the Head of a new world, and of a new creation.<a name=213:4></a> Nevertheless, although He had abolished all that was against us, although He had triumphed over Satan on the cross, and led captivity captive, the time for the deliverance of creation had not yet come.<a name=213:5></a> The present was only the period for the witness of the power of Jesus, in the midst of a creation still in its fallen state and from whence Satan was not yet expelled.<a name=213:6></a> It was the time for gathering the church of His elect out of the world, that He might nourish and cherish them, until they should be presented to Himself in glory; that is, in a word, for making this church on earth the receptacle<a href="#213:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> of the power possessed by the Son of man at the right hand of God.<a name=213:7></a> He, who now filled all things, having first descended into the lower parts of the earth, and then re-ascended up far above all heavens -- He had received gifts for men, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:8">Ephesians  4:8</a> - 10.<a name=213:8></a>

		And here we may remark, in connection with the point which has been occupying us, the progress of ideas presented to us in chapters 3, 4, and 7 of John.<a name=215:2></a> In chapter 3 the Holy Spirit is seen as quickening; in chapter 4 He is the power of communion -- of true communion; in chapter 7, the Son of man, not being able as yet to shew Himself to the world, declares, that rivers of living waters shall flow from the bellies of those who should believe; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified; and it was <i>then</i> that He (the Spirit) was to become the witness of the glory of the Son of man, and to bear testimony on earth to this glory.<a name=215:3></a>

		The power of the gift came from the Holy Spirit (comparing verses 6 and 11 we learn the divinity of the Holy Spirit); but inasmuch as the Spirit acted in each with a view to the glory of the Son, as the Son had with a view to the glory of the Father, each became, by his gift, the servant of Christ, as Christ Himself had become a servant in His ministry.<a name=221:5></a> The Holy Spirit acts in sovereignty, but ever in the accomplishment of the counsels of God (even as the Son quickeneth whom He will, <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:21">John  5:21</a>); and, being a witness of the glory of Jesus -- Son of man, and <i>Lord</i> -- each one of those in whom He acts becomes the obedient instrument of this Lord.<a name=221:6></a> Such operations are not, however, secondary, nor of any subordinate spirit, nor of any angel; they are the operations of God Himself, and the servants have to do with Him.<a name=221:7></a> Thus the apostle, who was gifted for his apostleship by the Holy Spirit, calls himself an apostle, not of man, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father.<a name=221:8></a> He also calls himself the apostle of Jesus Christ, the servant of God, and, speaking generally, "by the will of God".<a name=221:9></a>

		All these things, although, in a certain sense, they might constitute a testimony of the love of God, might be exercised without love; the question was more properly of power.<a name=222:3></a> Accordingly, the apostle here shews us a more excellent way.<a name=222:4></a> Love or edification ought to have directed the exercise of these things, and at Corinth this was not the case then: discipline was needed, as the apostle teaches us in these chapters.<a name=222:5></a> The gifts, in themselves, were rather the expression of power; for this reason, the Spirit, as exercising the authority of Christ in the church, regulates and controls the exercise of the gifts which He has entrusted to this or that individual; and even represses their exercise when they are not used in love, for the edification of the body.<a name=222:6></a> This is what we find in the Epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=222:7></a>

		We have here enumerated apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers.<a name=224:3></a> The first two, in the exercise of their highest functions, have laid the foundation of the church, either by revelation, or by the authority of Christ, which was committed to them; for it is by this last that the apostles were distinguished from prophets.<a name=224:4></a> A prophet revealed the mind of God, and his work was, in this respect, finished.<a name=224:5></a> An apostle was sent direct, as an architect, authorised by Christ to build His church.<a name=224:6></a> They ordained, put in execution, took the oversight, governed, established authorities in the churches, and took cognisance, as having authority, of everything that went on in them, in order to regulate it; in a word, they were authorised, on the part of Christ, to found and to build, and to establish rules in His church.<a name=224:7></a> In this sense there are no longer apostles.<a name=224:8></a> Paul knew that after his departure grievous wolves would come in.<a name=224:9></a> Peter takes care, by his epistle, to remind them of what he had said to them.<a name=224:10></a> But it appears to me, that, in a lower sense, there may be apostles and prophets in all ages.<a name=224:11></a> Barnabas is termed an apostle.<a name=224:12></a> Junius and Andronicus are called apostles, and it is said of them that they were "of note amongst the apostles" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:7">Romans  16:7</a>, 8): so that there were others who were not named.<a name=224:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the revelation of God, it is complete; as regards any authority to found the church, it no longer exists: neither the twelve nor Paul have had any successors.<a name=224:14></a> The foundation cannot be twice laid; but one may act under an extraordinary responsibility as sent by God, and by a faith which depends upon communications made only to him who enjoys them (although there can be no new truth, which would not be found in the word) -- a line of conduct which is only vindicated in the eyes of others, by its resulting in blessing to the children of God.<a name=224:15></a> This may still exist.<a name=224:16></a> We may cite as examples, without pretending to justify all that they did, a Luther, a Calvin, a Zwingle[-i], and perhaps others.<a name=224:17></a> So for prophets; although there be no new revelations of truth, there may be, as proceeding from God Himself, a power of applying to the circumstances of the church, or of the world, truths hidden in the word; such as, in practice, might render the ministry prophetic.<a name=224:18></a> Moreover, all those who expressed the mind of God "to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Teachers and pastors, to guide and to instruct the flock, are, in this epistle, joined in one gift (for the Holy Spirit is speaking of edification), although the gift of teacher is mentioned separately elsewhere.<a name=225:3></a> It is by these gifts that Christ nourishes, cares for, and strengthens the sheep, as it is by evangelists that He calls and brings them to Himself.<a name=225:4></a> The distinction between teacher and pastor is easily perceived, although connected together; for the one is occupied about the doctrine, the other about the sheep -- an obvious distinction, but a very important one; because there is an affectionate interest in the progress of the sheep, an exercise of heart, in the gift of pastor, a care for the sheep, which is not necessarily presupposed for the simple act of teaching.<a name=225:5></a> It is thus that this gift of pastor gives occasion to the most tender affections, and to the strongest ties, as did also the gift of an apostle, and as does the gift of the evangelist with regard to those who have been converted through his testimony.<a name=225:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I notice here, that the apostle does not speak of the gifts, but of the persons who possessed them.<a name=225:7></a> "He gave some pastors and teachers".<a name=225:8></a> The gift, without doubt, was in the vessel.<a name=225:9></a> But God had attached it to the person, and this person, known by his gift, was given to the church.<a name=225:10></a> We cannot be united to a gift, but to a person.<a name=225:11></a> God has given not a mere apostolate, but an apostle.<a name=225:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is certainly conceivable, that he who possesses the gift may be unfaithful, and even that the gift itself may be withdrawn, or at least, that it may not be in exercise.<a name=225:13></a> But, generally, we have to do with a person having a certain function permanently committed to him; we have to do with a joint in the body, and that joint is always that joint.<a name=225:14></a>

		The circumstances of the church may occasion difficulties in this matter; but humility and faithfulness to the Lord will always know what to do.<a name=226:3></a> Love and obedience always find the path.<a name=226:4></a> The Spirit will ever be with him who obeys Christ in love.<a name=226:5></a> This responsibility of the individual to Christ is of the utmost importance -- as important, in its place, as regards service flowing from gift, as it is when the question is one of moral conduct.<a name=226:6></a> Whatever affects this, affects the rights of Christ and the responsibility from which none can be exempt.<a name=226:7></a> We sometimes see both destroyed by the spirit of corrupted Christianity, and men exempted from their individual responsibility in matters of moral duty, just as in their responsibility to Christ in the exercise of their gift: God, however, never forgoes His claims upon them.<a name=226:8></a> To hinder this service, does not hinder heretics or false teachers.<a name=226:9></a> The flesh in the most true Christian must be everywhere kept down; and it needs to be so in the use or abuse of gifts real or supposed, as in other things.<a name=226:10></a> The flesh is never a gift of God.<a name=226:11></a> I cannot think, that to strengthen the sense of individual responsibility is to open a door to the flesh.<a name=226:12></a>

		These gifts placed in the church as a whole, in the body of Christ, become joints and bands; and it is in the church, in the body, that they are placed.<a name=226:13></a> A gift is a gift in the body and for the whole body, as a member of the human body acts for the whole.<a name=226:14></a> My eye sees for my whole body; my foot steps for the whole body.<a name=226:15></a> To give them a charge over that which is not the body, is to dislocate them.<a name=226:16></a> They may, indeed, be exercised in a given locality, but as the expression of the grace and of the claims of Christ; and this grace and these claims of Christ extend to all the body.<a name=226:17></a> Let us remember, that they are never to be used by the will of man: where that will comes in, sin enters.<a name=226:18></a> This may happen, as may any other sin; but, as in the case of any other sin, it becomes the subject of discipline.<a name=226:19></a> We see this in the abuse of the gift of tongues at Corinth.<a name=226:20></a> On the other hand, the narrow spirit of man is often corrected by the inalienable and universal rights of the Spirit of God, supreme and one in all the body.<a name=226:21></a> No human arrangement can supersede His claims; but He, as we have seen, has

		There are other very precious practical passages, besides the two we have been considering, which take up the subject of ministry in its highest connection with the glory of Christ and of God: we desire not to omit them.<a name=227:5></a> The first of these passages, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, enjoins particularly the modesty which leads the servant of God to confine himself to the assiduous and faithful employment of the gift committed to him.<a name=227:6></a> The second requires that if any man speak, he should speak as from God, in order that God may be glorified.<a name=227:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let each one, says the apostle, think soberly of himself (how truly gracious and good, how encouraging to the heart, and, at the same time, how wholesome is the word of God!<a name=227:8></a>): let him "think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .<a name=227:9></a>.<a name=227:10></a>.<a name=227:11></a> .<a name=227:12></a> Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation".<a name=227:13></a> Hence we may also remark, that we find not only special gifts as joints in the body; but, generally, the humble and faithful use of the talent confided to the servant -- a talent with which he trades, according to his responsibility towards the Master, from whom he had received it.<a name=227:14></a>

		In <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:10">1 Peter  4:10</a>, there is the same responsibility operating in love towards others.<a name=227:15></a> "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.<a name=227:16></a> If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God".<a name=227:17></a> I know that many fear such a principle; but that does not change the truth.<a name=227:18></a> If any one does not speak to me as announcing the truth of God, I do not know why he speaks to me at all.<a name=227:19></a> Moreover, this is what the apostle says; not <i>according</i> to the word of God, as some translate, but "as the oracles", as announcing the word, of God.<a name=227:20></a> This is what every man does who preaches the gospel: he has no doubt of the certainty of what he says.<a name=227:21></a> If one has not this assurance, he ought not to teach.<a name=227:22></a> The pretension to infallibility is one

		This responsibility would often prevent a man from speaking, when he is not taught of God: and if, as among the Bereans, even what an apostle says is judged by the word, there is no danger.<a name=228:2></a> It is not a question of new revelations, nor that the things spoken should be received without examination; but that the speaker should have the assurance that he is giving utterance to the mind of God, and not merely to his own thoughts.<a name=228:3></a> If anyone undertakes to teach me, and I ask, Are you sure that this comes from God, that it is the truth of God, and that God would have you to teach it to me?<a name=228:4></a> and he answers me that he is not sure of it, what confidence can I have in him?<a name=228:5></a> Even supposing that he replies he is sure, I have still to examine it by the word.<a name=228:6></a> The more we place him who teaches under such a responsibility, the more solemnity and sobriety will there be in his teaching; and where there is love, and real gift, he will not shrink from this responsibility.<a name=228:7></a> If he does, let him reflect upon the parable of the servant who buried his talent: if he has not sufficient love to trade, because of the responsibility, he is exactly in the position of this wicked servant; he is not acting according to grace.<a name=228:8></a> We are thus reminded of this great principle: direct responsibility to Christ, by whom the talent has been entrusted to us -- a responsibility from which no earthly relationship can disengage us.<a name=228:9></a> The claims of Christ, and His judgment, are ever there.<a name=228:10></a>

		<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the source of power, and order of ministry, as set before us in the word of God.<a name=229:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Essential to Christianity, because Christianity in accordance with the active energy of the love of God seeks that which was lost, testifying to the work and to the victory of Jesus by which the lost may be saved, this ministry of Jesus, who alone is worthy to be thus glorified, receives all its power, and has its only source, in the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=229:7></a> It is the ministry of the Holy Ghost, in the choice and employment of His servants.<a name=229:8></a> In all this God is sovereign.<a name=229:9></a> The exercise of the gifts bestowed by Him is regulated by the Holy Spirit, who acts sovereignly in the church.<a name=229:10></a> The proofs and examples of this are found in the word.<a name=229:11></a> As a source of ministry, or as authority for its exercise, man interferes only to sin.<a name=229:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be seen, that I have not touched the question of local charges, as not exactly entering into my present subject.<a name=229:13></a> It is evident, that the apostle Paul, and those delegated by him, established, according to his direction, several elders in the churches which he had gathered; and that servants or deacons of the assemblies, and even deaconesses, had been, at least in certain cases, appointed for the temporal affairs and necessities which were ministered to by the charity of those female servants.<a name=229:14></a> Peter speaks of elders much more vaguely.<a name=229:15></a> There is no proof that elders were appointed among the Hebrew converts.<a name=229:16></a> It would rather appear, that men of gravity and of character acted among them upon their own responsibility -- a responsibility laid upon them in this matter by love.<a name=229:17></a> In the Epistle to the Corinthians, where details of discipline are given, there is no mention made of elders.<a name=229:18></a> The Holy Spirit has perhaps

	<div class="paragraph">
		permitted this in order that we might have these things directly from the hand of the apostle.<a name=230:1></a> It is only, I believe, in the Epistle to the Philippians that we have the expression "with the bishops and deacons".<a name=230:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ruin in which the church is found at the present day acts more directly upon the apparent order in this respect, than upon ministry itself; because, in this matter, man can more easily come in with exterior arrangements.<a name=230:3></a> But we must not confound gifts, and the service flowing from such gifts, with charges.<a name=230:4></a> Furthermore, the Holy Spirit is sufficient for this, as for every other need of the church, provided she take the position in which the Holy Spirit sees her.<a name=230:5></a> Love will then suffice for all that God requires, and will make the best improvement of the means of blessing bestowed by Him; and He ever bestows that which is suited to His own glory, and to the real welfare of His believing people.<a name=230:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see no more real difficulty, as regards authority, than as regards the ministry of the word; because authority in the church is not a place with certain powers limited by a written law; nor something confided by men jealous lest the authority they have given should be overstepped through the lust of power, or the ambition of the person to whom it has been entrusted.<a name=230:7></a> Authority in the church is always, like the ministry of the word, the power of the Holy Spirit on the conscience; which moreover will not be found wanting.<a name=230:8></a> Where it exists, God will enforce, even by chastisements, the authority of His Spirit which He has lodged in a man, if that authority be despised.<a name=230:9></a> The discipline of the church also confirms it in certain cases; examples of this may be seen in the Epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=230:10></a> If we do but believe in the presence of God in the church, we cannot doubt that He is able to compel respect to Himself, and that in the authority which He has entrusted, to whomsoever it may have been given.<a name=230:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the spirit in which this ministry should be exercised, I say nothing; for it does not become me to speak of it.<a name=230:12></a> An entire self-renunciation (and that goes very far when we know the subtlety of the heart) is the only means of walking with the full blessing which belongs to this happy position of service to God, our brethren, and mankind.<a name=230:13></a> We must always remember, that is, by the power of God, we are free from all men, and responsible to God alone for the employment of the gift which He has confided to us, it is in order that we may be the servants

		of all.<a name=231:1></a> Let us remember that no one is able to give liberty to himself; and if the love of God has given us liberty, it is in order that, by this love in us, we may serve one another.<a name=231:2></a> He has made us free from self, free from independence, free from our own wills, to act as God acts, as He has acted in Christ -- not to please ourselves, but to serve one another in love.<a name=231:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing more blessed in this world<a href="#231:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> than ministry in this kind.<a name=231:4></a> We shall quickly find how much faith is needed in order thereto, and how much of that holiness which keeps us near to God that we may draw strength from Him.<a name=231:5></a> May God teach us to keep near to Him every moment, that we may not in detail be following our own wills, even although on the whole we may be seeking to do His.<a name=231:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would here remark, that grace is required in these days to realise at the same time the two principles of brotherhood and the exercise of gifts; because the latter necessarily gives externally an appearance of superiority.<a name=231:7></a> The flesh, it is true, may use these gifts to seek an earthly superiority, instead of the love and service of others.<a name=231:8></a> The humility which seeks only the good of all, makes everything easy.<a name=231:9></a> In worship there is an entire equality of position.<a name=231:10></a> More holiness may give a nearness to God in which the worship will be more true, and will be a juster expression, and at the same time nearer to God, of the wants of the assembly.<a name=231:11></a> The Spirit of God will then act more immediately, and will produce a more intelligent development of the links of souls with God; so that there may be in this a difference of capacity.<a name=231:12></a> What we have to seek is spirituality; this is the principal thing.<a name=231:13></a> The priest was in a higher place than the Levite; and all the priests were one, save the high priest: this is our position as worshippers.<a name=231:14></a> There was another position, which was very blessed, and where God, as sovereign, assigned the occupation.<a name=231:15></a> This was the position of the Levite.<a name=231:16></a> The glory of the Levite was to do that which God gave him to do.<a name=231:17></a> A Merarite was not to touch the vessels of the sanctuary, nor a Kohathite the different parts of the tabernacle.<a name=231:18></a> The Gershonites and the Merarites had a more extensive charge -- more oxen and chariots; but they were not entrusted with such precious things as the Kohathites.<a name=231:19></a>

		We may add the following extract from "Some further developments on the formation of churches": "Let no one mistake me; I love order with all my heart -- the true order which befits the house and ordinances of God.<a name=234:3></a> Setting aside circumstances, every brother has the same capacity to break the bread.<a name=234:4></a> Nature, as well as the word, teaches us that young men, that new converts, are little fitted to take the lead in any way, and that elders, if God has raised up any, have their own proper place in the house of God".<a name=234:5></a> I here repeat, with all my heart, what I said in the little tract, "On the formation of churches": that is, "That with earnest and continual supplication I do pray, that God may raise up pastors and teachers according to His own heart, for the wants of His own dear sheep, in order that the church of God may be preserved, cared for, instructed, rendered capable of resisting the snares of Satan, and that the little ones of the flock may be sheltered from every wind of evil doctrine.<a name=234:6></a> Yes; this is the fondest desire of my heart; it cannot be otherwise to such as love the church and who know something of the love that Jesus has for His own, of the privileges which belong to them, and who know something also of the snares and the machinations of the enemy.<a name=234:7></a> Moreover, I think that the relation of the pastor to the sheep of God's flock, is the sweetest and the most precious which exists on earth.<a name=234:8></a> In its fruits and its joy, this relation will not end there".<a name=234:9></a>

		If some persons refuse to occupy their minds with these things, under the pretence that they are but secondary points, this is only an artifice of the enemy.<a name=236:1></a> For behind all this, as we have already said, we find the solemn question, Is the church of God responsible for the present state in which it is found?<a name=236:2></a> It is scarcely denied now that the state of things which existed in the days of the apostles no longer exists at present.<a name=236:3></a> Undoubtedly many things remain in our day, as then; there are Christians, and the church possesses certain gifts.<a name=236:4></a> But that visible unity, where the Holy Ghost displayed His power, so that the grace and power of Christ, manifested in the body of the church, were seen by the world itself, because the Spirit of the Head dwelt in the body; where is, I say, that unity?<a name=236:5></a> It no longer exists.<a name=236:6></a> The "So also is Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>), to use the expression of the apostle, is no longer perceivable.<a name=236:7></a> Two answers have been made to what has been said of the guilt of the church and of the final judgment that awaits the whole system.<a name=236:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been alleged, first, that the church has no unity as a society of persons; and, secondly, that we are not responsible for the evil that others have done before us, although we suffer from it.<a name=236:9></a> This last point, especially, is of the highest importance.<a name=236:10></a> I do affirm, that the church has been placed on earth to display, as a body, in a visible unity, the glory of its Head, by the Holy Ghost.<a name=236:11></a> This it no longer does; it is responsible for it, and, regarded as a dispensation, it will be punished on that account, although the faithful are sure of being saved in glory.<a name=236:12></a> We have in the word a great number of passages and principles, which prove this community of interest and this responsibility in the church.<a name=236:13></a> The fact that its ruin is an opportunity for marked faithfulness on the part of individuals, in nowise affects the truth established by these passages.<a name=236:14></a> The Lord told the Jews: "Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#13:35">Luke  13:35</a>.<a name=236:15></a> Those whom the Lord addressed will never utter these words, but the nation will, at least the remnant of their posterity.<a name=236:16></a> Ten virgins went forth to meet the Bridegroom (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>); they are the same ten virgins who are there when the cry is heard, "Behold the Bridegroom cometh!<a name=236:17></a>" The same evil servant also is there, when the master returns (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:48">Matthew  24:48</a> - 51); and it is the same as to those who had received the talents, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>.<a name=236:18></a> Are we not all

		But we have no need to insist on this scriptural notion of the unity of the whole system from its beginning to its end.<a name=237:5></a> The question is very simple and of the greatest solemnity.<a name=237:6></a> Is the church responsible for the state in which it is found, or can it say, like the Jews, in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:29">Jeremiah  31:29</a>: "The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge"?<a name=237:7></a> An infidel, speaking of himself, may say: If I have inherited the bad condition of Adam, it is no fault of mine; I suffer from it, but I am not responsible for it.<a name=237:8></a> God, in the government of the world and of His people, does not judge thus; He treats man as responsible, and He acts towards His people, as considering them to be responsible for the state in which they are found.<a name=237:9></a> They have been themselves in the evil; they are partakers in it.<a name=237:10></a> His grace may deliver one individual or another from the eternal consequences of sin, but those consequences are none the less certain for the human race.<a name=237:11></a> Grace may deliver children of God from the order of things which is going to be judged, so that they be gathered into the barn in time of harvest (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:30">Matthew  13:30</a>); but they are taken away from the coming judgment, because the church is responsible.<a name=237:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The church is in a state of ruin; it has ceased to bear testimony to the glory of Christ, as it ought to have done, and as it did indeed at the beginning.<a name=237:13></a> When I come to the discovery of this sad and overwhelming truth, I feel my responsibility; and I think it is enough to put the question thus, in order to reach the conscience of those whose ear is open to the voice of the Holy Spirit, and who have at heart the glory of Christ.<a name=237:14></a> To abide faithful, under this conviction, is the means of being able to enjoy a safe shelter in Him who keeps His own for glory, whatever be withal the circumstances in which they may be found.<a name=237:15></a> Nevertheless, this will not prevent God from manifesting that He has looked upon the dispensation as being responsible, when He will put an end to it by judgment.<a name=237:16></a> And if God has given a testimony as to this (and He has done so), does not the responsibility already lie on us?<a name=237:17></a> Here it is that <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>finds an important application.<a name=237:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"There is", says Mr.<a name=240:15></a> Rochat (page 25), "the general assembly and the church of the firstborn", and (page 27) there are churches.<a name=240:16></a> But in page 26, he gives us another idea of the church, which is very just, and very important practically: "The church on earth, at each successive period, is thus the aggregate of the elect which are then manifested".<a name=240:17></a> It is in this sense, adds our brother, "that it is said that God has established in the church, first apostles", etc.<a name=240:18></a>, etc.<a name=240:19></a> That is just the sense which I meant to present, which I have pressed, and which appears to me most essential as regards our responsibility and the judgment which we form of the state in which we are.<a name=240:20></a> If the church on earth is the aggregate of the elect manifested at each period, in what state is this aggregate found at the present time?<a name=240:21></a> I have also some considerations which appear to me important to present on this point.<a name=240:22></a> I merely point out by the way this manner of looking at the church.<a name=240:23></a> Our brother owns that his views on the subject are modified; it matters little what instrument has produced this change, provided it be through the teaching of God (page 25, note).<a name=240:24></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#240:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Also Mr. Rochat tells us elsewhere: "The signs of the times announce the approach of His glorious kingdom." Therefore, the apostasy and the falling away are things which closely concern us, since they are to precede this glorious reign.

		There is another thing as to which our brother admits a principle, which tells all that I could wish on the subject.<a name=241:1></a> "If I am a member of the whole body", he says (page 41), "I am a member of the parts of that body".<a name=241:2></a> I insist on this.<a name=241:3></a> A Christian does become a member of a local church (if, however, one can admit this expression of "member of a church", for it is now owned to be unscriptural); he is a member of the parts of the body, if he is a member of the body.<a name=241:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing more simple; we cannot become what we are already; and, according to Mr.<a name=241:5></a> Rochat, if I am a member of the whole body, I am a member of the parts of this body, which meet in divers places: it is not a question of becoming such -- I am such already.<a name=241:6></a> This is the principle I have always maintained, and on which I have insisted and acted.<a name=241:7></a> By the very fact that I am a Christian, I have all the claims of a member of the body, wherever I may be found.<a name=241:8></a> It is not a right which I acquire by joining any particular body; it is a right which I possess as any member of the body of Christ.<a name=241:9></a> Let brethren weigh well this principle which Mr.<a name=241:10></a> Rochat asserts, and on which I insist.<a name=241:11></a> Practically, the whole question between us is thereby decided.<a name=241:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=241:13></a> Rochat also admits that the expression of "a member of a church" is not scriptural.<a name=241:14></a> We know how much the habits of brethren have been formed from that expression, and how much it has guided their conduct; so that in many localities, if a person did not declare himself member of a church, he was not admitted among brethren to partake of the Lord's supper.<a name=241:15></a> It was not enough to be a member of the body of Christ, a faithful Christian, owned of all<a href="#241:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=241:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I resume the first of the subjects mentioned above, in order to shew, I do not hesitate to say, in what respect our brother has not yet laid hold of the truth with respect to the doctrine of the millennium.<a name=242:7></a> "The consideration", he says, "of the eternal glory (page 72) appears to me much more fruitful, in consequences of every kind; for what are the thousand years when compared with eternity?<a name=242:8></a> Moreover, the millennial glory is not that of heaven, where God will be all and in all".<a name=242:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This phrase contains such confused ideas, that the best and indeed the only answer to make to it is to present the scriptural truths on this point.<a name=242:10></a> If Mr.<a name=242:11></a> Rochat takes the trouble to study the passage which he now applies to the coming dispensation, he will find that God purposes to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth, and that heaven is the place where the millennial glory will shine with greatest brightness.<a name=242:12></a> When Mr.<a name=242:13></a> Rochat speaks of heaven, and says that God will there be all and in all, he falls into complete confusion.<a name=242:14></a> Is not Christ in heaven?<a name=242:15></a> There is no connection between heaven and this declaration "That God may be all in all", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:28">1 Corinthians  15:28</a>.<a name=242:16></a> The difference which there is between the time which precedes and God being all in all, is that the essentially mediatorial glory will be ended, and Christ will have given up the kingdom to God the Father.<a name=242:17></a> It is here a question of a period of time and not of a place.<a name=242:18></a> Christ will always be in heaven; the church will be in heaven always with the Lord, enjoying all the blessings in the heavenlies, before the time when God will be all in all.<a name=242:19></a> And even then

		the church will be essentially in its state of eternal glory.<a name=243:1></a> And so little is it true that there is any idea of heaven attached to the words, "God all in all", that the only other passage which speaks of that post-millennial state rather presents the idea that men will be upon the earth, although heaven be mentioned, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:1">Revelation  21:1</a> - 8.<a name=243:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If I do not mistake, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>and <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>are the only passages which speak of the time when God will be all in all -- a time which indeed gives rise to thoughts that are full of blessing and deeply interesting.<a name=243:3></a> Nevertheless, God has thought fit to present much oftener, and with much more detail, the coming of Christ, and His glory to the conscience and heart of the faithful.<a name=243:4></a> Then we shall be like Him; then we shall see Him as He is.<a name=243:5></a> The object of God's predestination will be accomplished as to us, and we shall be conformed to the image of His Son.<a name=243:6></a> The marriage of the Lamb will have taken place.<a name=243:7></a> His bride will have been presented to Himself, having no spot or wrinkle or any of such things.<a name=243:8></a> We shall be then in our Father's house, Jesus having come for us in order to introduce us there, that where He is there we may be also.<a name=243:9></a> The desire of Christ's heart will be accomplished: "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world".<a name=243:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know whether our dear brother has postponed all this till the time when God will be all in all, or if he considers it as of small importance.<a name=243:11></a> However it may be, he is entirely mistaken when he says that the millennial glory is not that of heaven, for we shall see Christ as He is, we shall be like Him, and we shall be either raised or changed; we shall go to meet Him; we shall be ever with the Lord, and we shall reign for ever and ever.<a name=243:12></a> The difference is not that heaven does not form a part of this glory, but that it is the mediatorial glory of the Son of man; afterwards He will have given up the kingdom.<a name=243:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the earthly part, I think that our brother (page 73) has wrongly applied these words: "He unites the Jews and the heathen into one body, establishes them heirs, and gives to both access by one Spirit unto the Father".<a name=244:3></a> It is never said of the Gentiles that they will be one body with the Jews during the millennium.<a name=244:4></a> The contrary is the case.<a name=244:5></a> See, for instance, <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#60">Isaiah  60</a>, 61, 62.<a name=244:6></a> It is never said that they will be joint heirs, but the very contrary, and, indeed, not even a single passage can be shewn, where the last expression -- "access by one Spirit unto the Father" is applied to the millennium.<a name=244:7></a> It is confounding the body of Christ, raised for the heavenly glory, with the state of the Jews, the elect people on earth, and with the state of the Gentiles, who, though blessed, are in a state of inferiority with respect to the Jews, as a multitude of passages proves.<a name=244:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the author does not believe that the millennium applies to heaven, although heaven be the most important part of the glory of that day of God; and he applied the passages which speak of the privileges of the body of Christ then in heaven, to the Jews and Gentiles who will be on earth, during the millennium, in a completely different state.<a name=244:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would now present a few considerations on the falling away and the manifestation of the Antichrist.<a name=244:10></a> We have here, as I said, an extremely important practical truth, a truth admitted by Mr.<a name=244:11></a> Rochat's tract.<a name=244:12></a> This dispensation will end by a general falling away (page 73), which the signs shew us to be near.<a name=244:13></a> Mark well that such is the doom of Christendom.<a name=244:14></a> And what is to terminate the falling away?<a name=244:15></a> The judgment of this world by the presence of Christ.<a name=244:16></a> Can one say then (page 78), that it is the same dispensation of the grace of God, which will last till the end of the world?<a name=244:17></a> Mr.<a name=244:18></a> Rochat consents to substitute in the room of the word phasis that of dispensation; but it is always, he says, the same dispensation of the grace of God.<a name=244:19></a>

		Is then the judgment of this habitable earth of all the living (the church being raised and glorified), is that a continuation of the dispensation of grace?<a name=245:1></a> Why weaken the effect of such solemn truths, truths that God has revealed, that they may act upon the conscience?<a name=245:2></a> I repeat my question: Is then the judgment of the living on earth a continuation of the dispensation of grace?<a name=245:3></a> Or does Mr.<a name=245:4></a> Rochat think that it is not even necessary to point out, that this judgment interrupts the dispensation, although it requires the presence of Christ for its execution?<a name=245:5></a> Moreover, I think he will find that the coming dispensation is precisely a dispensation of judgment on the earth, which contrasts with grace, as a multitude of passages declares (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#96">Psalm  96</a>, 97, 98, 99; <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#32">Isaiah  32</a>; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#72">Psalm  72</a>), although it be always true that it is only grace which saves individuals in every dispensation.<a name=245:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What grieves me in our brother's pamphlet is that, while disputing about words, he could remain silent as to the most solemn testimony God has given us on the state of things in which we are, and that he has sought to weaken the importance of the warnings which flow therefrom for the church.<a name=245:7></a> If the Lord be near, as Mr.<a name=245:8></a> Rochat tells us, and as I believe He is, is it not true that He comes to judge, because the present state of things demands and requires judgment?<a name=245:9></a> Is it then that the Lord comes to judge and to reap, before the tares and the wheat are ripe?<a name=245:10></a> And if Christendom is in a state which provokes this judgment, or if it is hastening to become such, is it the time for saying, that there are other things of greater importance?<a name=245:11></a> Is it right, while admitting with difficulty that it is another dispensation, to pass over the universal judgment of the living and the harvest of God, without saying a word on the subject, and even with the assertion, that what is to follow will be a continuation of the dispensation of grace?<a name=245:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One remark more.<a name=245:13></a> There will be, then, a general falling away, an apostasy.<a name=245:14></a> But the evil which characterises the last days had already begun in the days of the apostles; the mystery of lawlessness was already working; and it was already sufficiency developed before their death to enable one of them to inform us that many antichrists had already come, so that they knew that it was the last hour, <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:18">1 John  2:18</a>.<a name=245:15></a> One may cry up the continuation of the churches; and yet there was evil enough in the days of the apostle John to point to the last hour as having already come.<a name=245:16></a> I beg leave to notice here that those

		<a class="footnote" name="#246:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I have consented to lay aside the word "apostasy," because I do not attach myself to words, provided the truth be admitted. One has shouted victory, but it has been a mistake. I think that that expression is thoroughly applicable, according to its scriptural sense, to the state of things that we see around us. I consent to abandon it, in order to render more easy the discussion of these subjects with such as are sincere, because, in fact, the falling away which will take place at the end is a more open falling away, more undisguised. But the word of God applies this term to a moral and real abandonment of the true principles of Christianity and to the men who, while they call themselves Christians, act under the influence of Satan (@1 Timothy 4), who corrupts everything which he cannot hinder. This abandonment of the true principles of Christianity, by the very persons who pretend never to have abandoned it, is called apostasy in the word; and it is most important that this should be understood, in order that the outward form of Christianity may no longer deceive the simple, but that they may fully know that the apostasy is none the less real for being hidden. <p>Mr. Rochat says (page 22), that scripture places the moment of the apostasy at the time of the appearing of the Antichrist. He mistakes; scripture says nothing of the kind. The passage quoted only says, that the day of the Lord will not come unless the apostasy have first come and the man of sin have been revealed, etc. But the falling away may take place long before the revelation of the man of sin. <p>In the "Abridged History of the Church of Christ," the author of which I need not name, we find a chapter with this title: "Apostasy Consummated." I quote a passage from it (volume 1, page 121): "what progress that unfortunate church had made, in the eighth century, in the path of error and perdition! After having for a long time followed the instructions of the Holy Ghost, such as it possessed in the epistle especially addressed to them, at length tired of watching, praying, combating, weary of bearing the yoke of the good Shepherd, it relaxed by degrees from its pristine faithfulness. At first it had neglected, then afterwards it had abandoned, the word of truth. Instead of remaining a particular church, as it originally was, it had wished to become generally catholic, and had insensibly exalted itself to that degree, that it aspired to universal dominion, drawing away with it all the West in its apostasy." <p>Is then the word "apostasy" more terrible under my pen than in that work? All the West has been drawn away into the apostasy. It is said, that the truth is only contested when it becomes important. <p>Again, the author of the same work applies @Romans 11 to the cutting off of that church. "The moment is approaching," he adds in a note to volume 1, page 122,"when that adulterous church, which has become high minded, will be cut off for ever." <p>I would only add two remarks here. First, I have not made a wrong use of the word "apostasy," since an author who well knows how to write his mother tongue, uses it in a more positive way than I do. The church of Rome acknowledges the Trinity; it owns that Christ is the Lord, that He is both God and Man, as well as other fundamental truths; and yet it is the consummated apostasy, because it has first neglected and afterwards abandoned the word of truth because it has become high minded, etc. Then next @Romans 11 applies to this state of things, to all that has been led away by the church of Rome. Secondly, the author goes farther than I. I do not believe that the apostasy is consummated, as I have already said elsewhere. On the other hand, if the author extends the application of @Romans 11 beyond individuals at Rome, or the church of Rome itself, then you must take the apostle according to his own expressions. "I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles." Besides, I am persuaded that, ere long, the Romish church will put an end to this difficulty, at least within the limits of the fourth empire. At all events, the whole of the West has been drawn away. The author leads us to perceive the consequences of the unbelief by quoting @Romans 11.

The inhabitants of the Canton de Vaud form a Society, because, being all born Vaudois (though there be different parishes), they are all attached to a common centre; they possess common rights; they have charges filled by men who work for the common interests of the country. They are all Vaudois. That unity is felt and known, although it might be difficult to present in a visible way the bond which unites one Vaudois to another Vaudois. Thus it was in the church at the beginning; all were Christians, born again, fellow-citizens of a heavenly country; there were charges by functions, which had their sphere of activity in the whole body, namely, apostles, prophets, teachers. Though there were churches, as in the Canton de Vaud there are parishes, Christians formed a society, as the Vaudois form one, because there was internal unity, manifested, maintained, and developed by charges. There were local charges; but there were also charges and gifts which were for the whole body (as the Council of State in the Canton de Vaud); and the apostles, the prophets, etc., did not any more belong to a local church, than the Council of State in the Canton de Vaud belongs to a particular parish.

		<a class="footnote" name="#252:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>God has proposed to Himself two great objects with regard to a Christian: the one, to save him; the other, to manifest in him His own glory. These two objects will be fully attained when the Christian is in glory. Meanwhile, his salvation is certain, because God is true. But, on the other hand, it thus becomes the duty of such as enjoy this salvation, to be on earth the living witnesses of God's glory, by the power of the Holy Spirit who dwells in them. It is the same with the church: it is saved;¦ but it is its duty and its privilege to manifest here below the glory of Him who saved it, and who dwells in it by the Holy Spirit. It is here that the responsibility of such as are saved finds its place. The rigid Calvinist only sees the accomplished salvation of the Church -- an infinitely precious truth, the results of which in heavenly glory can never fail; but he does not see the establishment of the church here below -- and that by God Himself -- as depositary of the glory of God, and under the responsibility of man. The Arminian, on the contrary, concludes from this responsibility of Christians the uncertainty of their salvation, thus weakening the counsels of God, the eternal efficacy of the work of Christ, and all the sense and force of the seal of the Spirit, who would be bearing witness to an error, if after all we were not eternally saved. <p>There is a responsibility which results from grace, from the position which it has made for us. If God has adopted me for His child, I am bound to walk as a child, without questioning whether I shall always be a child. Thus God may Himself secure the accomplishment of His glory in His elect, and outwardly also by their means; or He may leave the manifestation of His glory to their faithfulness as His children. All these suppositions will be realised, the glory will be fully manifested in His elect, when Christ shall have glorified them. Then also will they fully glorify Him, as the angels do. But, in the meantime, God has entrusted His glory here below to the church, as He had of old entrusted it to the Jews. Christians are faithful to this responsibility, by the Spirit who dwells in them, and who acts with efficacy, if He be not grieved. This therefore concerns the whole church, because the Holy Ghost dwells as the one Spirit in the Church. And although the evil may begin by one individual only, belonging to one particular church, it is here a question of principles which corrupt the whole lump in general, such, for instance, as a Judaizing spirit. <p>I deem it important to notice here that all the epistles which speak of ruin, of false principles which are the occasion for judgment, do not speak of a church, but of Christians in general -- of the state of that which is called Christendom.

		The apostasy is not an isolated future fact; but the revelation of a state of things, all the elements of which are ripe before its manifestation; which ripens under the form of Christianity, having borrowed its ordinances, having given to it forms, which, substituted for life, hold in bondage even those who possess life, and hinder the manifestation of the truth and of the glory of Christ, until the moment when, everything being undermined and God Himself having removed that which restrains, the public falling away will break out and thus call for the judgment of God.<a name=256:1></a> I will add here, that I have no doubt that there will be a blessed manifestation of the elect before the catastrophe of the world.<a name=256:2></a> God will bring them out from among the worldly, that they may not be condemned with the world.<a name=256:3></a> It was so at Jerusalem before the judgment of that city; so that I expect, through the gospel, a work which fills with joy the heart of the believer.<a name=256:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ministry and baptism, those two links between the exterior and interior of this society, are of necessity become the turning points of these questions, and the occasions of the corruption of the society; of exaggerated pretensions on the part of those who will have it that the exterior alone is the church, and of so many difficulties on the other hand, for those who will only own as the church the internal society -- difficulties which they cannot escape, until they admit the ruin in which we are found, not for eternity (because in this respect the faithfulness of God interposes), but as to the manifestation of the church for the glory of God here below.<a name=258:6></a> These difficulties will only disappear for them when they admit this ruin; because, as the Holy Spirit does not act at present in that power which made the exterior to be the expression of the interior, the separation of those two things has left a gap which nothing can fill up as to this world, and which places us in a state of things where we are found guilty of having failed as to the manifestation of the glory of God on earth.<a name=258:7></a> This is a painful conviction, undoubtedly, and humbling for us, but in which we have, first, this consolation that God in His grace can never fail, and that we shall certainly have the heavenly glory; and, secondly, that God directs the hopes of those who are faithful, even in the midst of unfaithfulness, to that which in His counsels is the result of that ruin -- to the glorious appearing of Christ, who will take us unto Himself, that we may appear with Him in glory, when He will appear to judge all this evil.<a name=258:8></a>

		<h3>OF GIFTS PLACED IN THE CHURCH</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been sought to weaken the proof of the existence of a universal church on earth, the internal unity of which was manifested, maintained, and developed, by shewing that gifts were found in the churches.<a name=262:1></a> I said -- and the thing is evident -- that gifts were to be exercised usually in the assemblies; and that, if there were prophets residing in a town, it might naturally be said, there are prophets in the church of that town.<a name=262:2></a> But when I said that gifts were placed in the church, not in the churches, I only quoted the express revelation of God, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:28">1 Corinthians  12:28</a>.<a name=262:3></a> "And God hath set some in the church, first apostles", etc.<a name=262:4></a> This is never said of a particular church, and cannot apply to it.<a name=262:5></a> Mr.<a name=262:6></a> Rochat now admits in his pamphlet that, when it is said, God has given some, apostles, this applies to the church, in the sense of the aggregate of the elect manifested on earth at a certain period.<a name=262:7></a> That is precisely what I say.<a name=262:8></a> There was an aggregate of elect persons on earth, which had a unity and joints of supply, and which thus formed a body, a society, an aggregate, the unity of which was recognised.<a name=262:9></a> Mr.<a name=262:10></a> Rochat acknowledges that this is true with respect to three of the gifts mentioned in the word.<a name=262:11></a> I believe it to be applicable to all, inasmuch as they are gifts; for those who possessed certain gifts, or other qualifications, were thereby rendered capable of filling charges which might be more or less circumscribed in their exercise, and which Mr.<a name=262:12></a> Rochat confounds with gifts.<a name=262:13></a> But at least, according to him, there were three of the gifts mentioned (page 26), which were not placed in the churches, but in the church.<a name=262:14></a> Consequently there was the one body, the one church.<a name=262:15></a> And this is so true, that if one united all the churches, the aggregate of the church would not be realised; for it is evident that Paul, Timothy, Titus, Silvanus, and many others, did not belong to a particular church.<a name=262:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They walked with the church, if there was one in the place where they were; but they acted, in the exercise of their gifts, outside the churches, or in several churches at the same time.<a name=262:17></a> When Titus was in Crete to establish elders in every church, he did not act as a member of a local church; still more was it so in the case of apostles and prophets.<a name=262:18></a> Thus the most powerful action, the most striking, that which came most directly from Christ, was outside the churches, though recognising them, just as I fully recognise that they existed in those

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall, farther on, add a few words on charges and gifts; I only mention them here to prove the existence of a church of God, as a body, on earth.<a name=263:3></a> When our brother pretends (page 42), that some children of God have a kind of antipathy for the churches of the Lord, he mistakes.<a name=263:4></a> There are Christians who do not like to see that title wrongly applied, because they attach too great an importance to the idea of a church of the Lord and to the state in which the church of God was found, when the churches were owned of Him.<a name=263:5></a> They do not wish to lower the force of this expression, by applying it to gatherings, which would monopolise it without having a well-grounded claim to it, and thus depreciate in the eyes of the world a precious title, and destroy the true idea of the church and the churches, among those who appropriate that title to themselves.<a name=263:6></a> Hence the wrong use made of this word by those who apply it to themselves alone has kept away from the churches a great number of persons.<a name=263:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in those countries where Christians have had the pretension to be the church, that the most sincere children of God have had the greatest dread of this.<a name=263:8></a> It does not follow, because the Lord sent messages to the primitive churches, that all the assemblies which, in our day, arrogate to themselves that title, because they have been organised in such or such a way, ought to be owned when everything is in a state of ruin.<a name=263:9></a> Without doubt, the gathering of the children of God in each locality is a thing infinitely precious and well-pleasing to the Lord; but it is not because they call themselves the church, that this union is well-pleasing to Him, but because, according to the will of Christ, they are united, and united, because there is but one Spirit who is in them all, and who attracts them one towards another by the constraining power of His love.<a name=263:10></a> Moreover, the word church signifies an assembly, it is the assembly of those who have common privileges, and it is important that this should be known, in order not to exclude from it those who hold these privileges from God Himself.<a name=263:11></a>

		Our brother tells us that Wahl translates, not merely "I choose", but "I choose by way of suffrages".<a name=264:5></a> He has quoted Wahl wrongly in the very thing that is in question.<a name=264:6></a> I am fully persuaded that it is through pre-occupation, as it may happen to everyone; but it is important to know that Wahl says, "I choose by way of suffrage", without an <i>s</i> at the end of the word.<a name=264:7></a> The reason for this is quite simple, and the difference is immense.<a name=264:8></a> The suffrage is always the suffrage of the person who chooses, so that one could not translate, I choose by way of suffrages, with an <i>s</i>, since it would be choosing by other suffrages besides my own; whereas, if I say, I choose by way of suffrage, in the singular, it is my act in view; it is a question of myself.<a name=264:9></a> It is always the suffrage of the person who is the subject of the verb "to choose", which is spoken of.<a name=264:10></a> The word translated by "chose" means to stretch out the hand, and those who did choose stretched out their own hands, and not the hands of others.<a name=264:11></a> If anyone wishes to confine himself to etymology, although the verb, like so many others, has lost its etymological sense, the only sense which can be given to it is, "the apostles chose by stretching out their hand".<a name=264:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thing in question is not to know if the word retains the sense of suffrage (although in its general use, it has lost it) but, admitting the sense of choosing by way of suffrage, we must know by whose suffrage it is.<a name=264:13></a> Then I answer, by the suffrage of him who chooses, and of him alone.<a name=264:14></a> As for the case of <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:19">2 Corinthians  8:19</a>, it is exactly the same thing.<a name=264:15></a> The churches "chose", but then the "churches" are in the same relation to the verb, as Paul and Barnabas in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:23">Acts  14:23</a>.<a name=264:16></a> The churches, like Paul and Barnabas, did not choose by the suffrages of other persons, but by their own suffrages.<a name=264:17></a> This passage in 2 Corinthians entirely confirms this interpretation, which, after all, is the only reasonable or possible one.<a name=264:18></a> I do not here exclude the idea of hands being lifted up; but this I say, that the hands lifted up, if there were any, according to the form of the word, were the hands of the apostles.<a name=264:19></a> Moreover, I do not think that Mr.<a name=264:20></a> Rochat would dispute it now.<a name=264:21></a>

		Our brother is very much astonished also that I said, As to the service of tables, the choice was granted to the church, because the church supplied the tables, as the choice also was reserved for God, when God supplied the gift.<a name=266:4></a> He asks if God does not supply the gifts for a deacon.<a name=266:5></a> Everything is confounded here, because our brother has not understood the use of the word gift.<a name=266:6></a> All the things that we possess are gifts of God undoubtedly; but, in the word, the use of this expression is specially connected with certain gifts, which result from the glory of Christ, as Son of man.<a name=266:7></a> "He gave gifts for men".<a name=266:8></a> "He gave some apostles", etc.<a name=266:9></a> "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit".<a name=266:10></a> "Covet earnestly the best gifts", etc.<a name=266:11></a>

		Now the charge of deacon was not one of these gifts, but a charge which had to do with the care of temporal things.<a name=266:12></a> A person was the deacon or the servant of the church.<a name=266:13></a> Certain qualities were necessary, to be a deacon, but this charge was in nowise one of the gifts mentioned in the list which is left us, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>and <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=266:14></a> A man might very well possess a special gift of service, in a more general sense, without being officially a deacon, but the things intrusted to deacons were temporal, and they were intrusted to them by the brethren.<a name=266:15></a> As to those who possessed gifts, the things which were intrusted to them were spiritual; they came directly from God; and those men were immediately responsible towards the Lord in their service.<a name=266:16></a> They were servants or deacons of Jesus, in things which were spiritual, and not servants of the church in things which were temporal.<a name=266:17></a> But here comes out the whole thought of our brother.<a name=266:18></a> "The church", he says (page 55), "ought to have named elders, not only because it paid them, but also because it intrusted to them something much more precious than its money, namely, the souls of the faithful which composed it".<a name=266:19></a> I only ask where such a thought is to be found in the word as this, that the church intrusts to the elders the souls which compose it?<a name=266:20></a>

		As to the phrase which astonishes our brother, I maintain it in all its force; and I see great perfection in the ways of the Spirit of God as to this.<a name=266:21></a> As regards the difference which exists between the elder and the pastor, I say that the pastorate was

		a gift of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>), whereas the charge of elder was not one.<a name=267:1></a> This charge was established by men in the church, according to God undoubtedly, but it was an institution connected with government, and not a gift from above, although certain gifts and certain qualities were necessary for those who were named elders.<a name=267:2></a> I said that the gift of shepherding the flock of God, in one way or in another, was necessary or suitable for them, because it is shewn by the first epistle to Timothy that the elders who laboured in word and teaching are distinguished from the other elders.<a name=267:3></a> Peter speaks of the elders in a very vague manner, calling himself an elder, and contrasting them with all the younger, so that it would be difficult to suppose a choice.<a name=267:4></a>

		I admit this, that on certain occasions the disciples did take resolutions in common.<a name=267:5></a> In the case of the disputes about circumcision, which the apostle Paul could not settle, the brethren at Antioch agreed to refer to the decision of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.<a name=267:6></a> If our brother, Mr.<a name=267:7></a> Rochat, likes to quote this as an instance of a decision on the part of the church, he is quite free to do so.<a name=267:8></a> For my part, I see the incapacity in which the church was to decide anything on the subject; they agreed to refer this question to a superior authority.<a name=267:9></a> Except the answer from the apostles and elders, with the church, to the question which had thus been proposed to them, all the other cases (excluding what was done before the coming down of the Holy Spirit), only relate to deacons and to pecuniary aid.<a name=267:10></a> Let brethren take resolutions in common when circumstances arise, I have nothing in the world to say against it, provided their direction be from God; but this, I repeat, that I see nothing in the word that resembles the decision of a majority.<a name=267:11></a> It is evident that, if the church is in a bad state, the majority will probably decide wrong, and nothing can prove that the Holy Spirit is with the majority.<a name=267:12></a> It is merely a human means of settling an affair.<a name=267:13></a> In matters of arrangement one may very well consult what suits the greater number; but, as regards moral things, the number is of no moment.<a name=267:14></a>

		Our brother (page 59) returns to the subject of gifts.<a name=267:15></a> He asks if the gifts connected with the charge of elder did not come directly from God.<a name=267:16></a> When it is a question of governing one's household, and one's own children (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:4">1 Timothy  3:4</a>, 5), it is quite a different thing from gifts, in the scriptural sense of the expression.<a name=267:17></a>

		Mr.<a name=268:1></a> Rochat (page 60) insists on the answer he gave in his first pamphlet to this remarkable fact, that every direction about elders is given to Titus and to Timothy, and never to the churches.<a name=268:2></a> He remarks that Paul says to Timothy (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>), "These things write I unto thee .<a name=268:3></a>.<a name=268:4></a>.<a name=268:5></a> that thou mayest know [not, 'how <i>thou</i> oughtest to behave <i>thyself</i>', but] how <i>one</i> ought to behave <i>oneself</i>".<a name=268:6></a> I take a similar case.<a name=268:7></a> My son is chosen councillor of state, and I write to him to explain how one ought to behave oneself in the affairs of the state.<a name=268:8></a> This shews, according to Mr.<a name=268:9></a> Rochat's mode of reasoning, that every citizen may, at any time, exercise the functions of councillor of state, because I told my son how one ought to behave oneself.<a name=268:10></a> I confess I do not see where the force of that argument lies.<a name=268:11></a>

		The author adds to his thought, which is also mine, that we must not go in advance of the gifts of God.<a name=268:12></a> "When God", he says (page 61), "sends elders and deacons, <i>I will not have</i> them to be tacitly owned, but to be established through their being recognised by a regular vote of the church".<a name=268:13></a> But, first of all, in the case of establishing elders and deacons, it is supposed that all is in order, the very thing that always remains to be proved; and if even it were supposed that all is in order in the church, it would still remain to be proved, that it has a right to establish elders by a regular vote, as Mr.<a name=268:14></a> Rochat says.<a name=268:15></a> This has not been done, but quite the contrary.<a name=268:16></a> It ever remains true, that what is presented to us in the word, is the choosing of elders by the apostles; their establishment by the delegates of Paul; directions for those same delegates, and an absolute silence on this subject in all that is written directly to the churches.<a name=268:17></a>

		I will point out here a principle, which is expressed twice in Mr.<a name=268:18></a> Rochat's pamphlet, with a very slight difference: where the word has determined nothing, man is free.<a name=268:19></a> The essential thing is to follow its spirit (page 66).<a name=268:20></a> There is no principle more dangerous than that one.<a name=268:21></a> Were it followed, all kinds of innovations might be introduced into an assembly, and imposed on the brethren by the vote of a majority.<a name=268:22></a> It is true that the Holy Spirit leads us according to the spirit of the word in cases where we do not find at first a positive text; for the Spirit has not abandoned the church.<a name=268:23></a> But to say, in such a case, that man is free, is a horrid principle.<a name=268:24></a> It is this especially that I

		<a class="footnote" name="#273:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It has been asked why this portion of the word has been taken rather than others to be applied to the present time. It is astonishing to what a degree pre-occupation of the mind blinds the judgment. Do not people see that this is a promise which only requires the faithfulness of Him who has promised? Where two or three are gathered together in the name of Jesus, the word receives its accomplishment. It is evident that the rules that Paul was giving to Timothy and to Titus are very different, and that they suppose an altogether special mission.

		As to discipline, remember that cutting off is the extreme resource.<a name=274:8></a> The children of a family may be obliged, according to the wisdom of their Father, to refuse all intercourse with one of their brethren; but does not the heart understand in what spirit this is to be done?<a name=274:9></a> To preserve the holiness of the Lord's table is a positive duty.<a name=274:10></a> We owe it to Christ Himself.<a name=274:11></a> Cases may present themselves, where we repel with fear the manifestation of sin (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#23">Jude  23</a>); but, on the other hand, beware of a judicial spirit, as of fire in your house.<a name=274:12></a> The Christian who knows Himself best, and who loves most, will never fail to exercise discipline when he is obliged to do it; but he will do it, as on the part of Christ's heart that has been grieved -- the heart of Him who ever loves, and with the sense that the flesh is also in himself.<a name=274:13></a> Moreover, if it be a question of excommunication, all ought to take a part in it, not because they have a right to it (for what would be the spirit of a child who could insist on his right to take a part in the exclusion of one of his brothers!<a name=274:14></a>), but because the conscience of all must be purified, and because the whole assembly must be, through this act, separated from a sin which demands the putting away.<a name=274:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If God raises up several brethren who feed His flock, and who labour (though with little gift, perhaps, but in love, and in a sense of responsibility, and therefore of humility, as those will always have who are truly sent of the Lord), let them seek to help each other in their labours, to pray together on the subject, and to profit by the counsel one of another.<a name=275:8></a> This confidence is very precious; and he that is humble and truly seeks the good of souls will always be most happy to profit thereby.<a name=275:9></a> This will never take from us our individual responsibility, but will often help us to fulfil it for the good of the church and for the glory of Christ.<a name=275:10></a> At the same time, let each one remember that, if God uses one of His children to labour in the church, it is that he may be (although free with respect to others, and responsible to Christ), the servant of all.<a name=275:11></a> Whoever departs from this position abandons both his duty and his privilege.<a name=275:12></a> Let us always remember that it is God's will that we should be dependent upon Him, and that every effort to free ourselves from that dependence upon Him, who is our only safeguard and our stay, is but the work of the flesh, which would have its ease in the world.<a name=275:13></a>

		Finally, I close by presenting again that which is at the root of the whole question -- the responsibility of the church.<a name=275:14></a> In general, discussions descend to details; here it is the contrary.<a name=275:15></a> The details have served to bring into evidence the fact, that there was a serious principle in question, a fundamental principle for judging soundly about the church, its state and its affairs.<a name=275:16></a> Is the church responsible for the state in which it

		The following pages require two words of preface.<a name=278:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly.<a name=278:2></a> Whatever may be the source of this opposition, I am convinced that the pamphlet of Mr.<a name=278:3></a> François Olivier is an effort against the truth.<a name=278:4></a> Its tendency is to hinder simple brethren from acting in faith.<a name=278:5></a> I have therefore freely expressed my thoughts with regard to it.<a name=278:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly.<a name=278:7></a> Although I do not doubt that the substance of what is found in these pages is solid, it is, perhaps, well to warn him who may glance over them, that they do not pretend to furnish anything but a few rapid observations on the views of Mr.<a name=278:8></a> Olivier.<a name=278:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I received Mr.<a name=278:10></a> Olivier's pamphlet on Monday evening, and have had to answer it without giving up my other occupations, and during a journey I have taken this week to Vevey, in order to be able to give the manuscript to be printed before leaving for France.<a name=278:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The life that we lead down here is a very mingled one; and we must keep very near to God in order to preserve the soul in equilibrium, and to rejoice in the very things which would naturally pain the heart, as seeing them in connection with our Father's will.<a name=278:13></a> Returning from a journey, in which I had been able to enjoy the happiness of the brethren assembled in peace, finding God near to them and in their midst, where I tasted the joy that one experiences in seeing many souls awakened and numerous conversions, sharing the joy of those who labour in it more faithfully than oneself, and seeing them

		happy in their work because God has blessed and is still blessing them -- returning thus from places, where, having laboured oneself, one is happy to see the brethren again in peace, walking better even in one's absence than in one's presence, I stumble upon a pamphlet which sees nothing in all this but "disorder, misery, and premature teachers": a pamphlet, which pronounces upon the brethren judgments that reveal the thoughts of its author, much more than they depict the character of those whom he blames.<a name=279:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The condition of many persons at the present time brings to my mind the curse pronounced upon him who leans upon an arm of flesh, <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#17">Jeremiah  17</a>, "He shall not see when good cometh".<a name=279:2></a> I pity them with all my heart.<a name=279:3></a> We are poor, weak, yea, very weak.<a name=279:4></a> Our faith, or rather our lack of faith, often puts us to shame; and I doubt not, alas!<a name=279:5></a> that we often do things that are not according to the wisdom of God.<a name=279:6></a> When God, in His grace, gives us to be conscious of it, we have to humble ourselves: notwithstanding we are happy, for we walk with God; and He, in His great mercy, blesses us -- unworthy as we are He has permitted us in our little measure (a very little measure, I confess, but according to that which He has given us) to work with God.<a name=279:7></a> But I have already said too much of this; I act as a fool.<a name=279:8></a> It will be thought that, because I am happy in the blessing of God, I seek to commend myself.<a name=279:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How can I rejoice in pamphlets, which, composed by the sad wisdom of men, will not have the foolishness of faith?<a name=279:10></a> This is how it is.<a name=279:11></a> Even when done in a spirit of strife, those who write them are forced to propagate the substance of the truth: and they themselves help on the work, while they condemn the persons who follow the truth heartily and joyfully.<a name=279:12></a> As for the faith and joy which accompany them: God has "hidden these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes"; and, "there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last" -- for such has been the Father's good pleasure.<a name=279:13></a> But the last, like the first, are forced to help on the spread of the truth, for such is the good pleasure of God, who will not allow His Church to slumber in these last days.<a name=279:14></a> If we will be "the last" when God is working, we have but ourselves to blame.<a name=279:15></a> Must God stop in His work of blessing because man will not go forward?<a name=279:16></a> God, in His goodness, forbid it!<a name=279:17></a>

		Without approving every sentence or the spirit of the whole, let people examine the pamphlet of this minister, Mr.<a name=280:1></a> François Olivier, from page 52 to 69, and what evils -- "<i>irremediable</i> evils" -- he is speaking of in detail.<a name=280:2></a> Now he wishes us to call this state of things "the kingdom".<a name=280:3></a> And he will not have us call the outward kingdom of God "the church".<a name=280:4></a> Be it so.<a name=280:5></a> It is at least the general condition of things.<a name=280:6></a> Let it be called kingdom, as he wishes, or with others <i>the visible church</i>, the thing is admitted and is according to him "irremediable".<a name=280:7></a> This is serious.<a name=280:8></a> For one could then truly say of the church, with which, according to Mr.<a name=280:9></a> Olivier, the kingdom was confounded, what God says of Israel in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:21">Jeremiah  2:21</a>, "yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed".<a name=280:10></a> "But", says Mr.<a name=280:11></a> Olivier, "I must continue to repeat, it is in the kingdom, and not in the church, that this corruption began and increases".<a name=280:12></a> Then I find in page 19, "Here one sees the kingdom of God is confounded with the church"; and, page 20, "the church is itself the spiritual kingdom, in which, and over which, Christ reigns"; and, in page 23, "as long as this was the case, I repeat, the church and the kingdom in their visible state here below would have been but one and the same thing".<a name=280:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to Mr.<a name=280:14></a> Olivier, that continued until some church ceased to receive all the Christians in its locality, or admitted into its bosom persons whose profession was <i>evidently</i> not real.<a name=280:15></a> Up to that time the church and the kingdom had been confounded; but it was during this period that the evil began.<a name=280:16></a> It was while the apostles were addressing all professors as saints, that heresies and corruption began, and that antichrists "went out", which alone manifested that they were not "of them": so that the corruption began, the mystery of iniquity was at work, when the church and the kingdom were confounded.<a name=280:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The evil began in that assembly, which, according to Mr.<a name=280:18></a> Olivier, was at the same time the church and the kingdom.<a name=280:19></a> He wishes us to believe that the church cannot become corrupt (page 25); he admits that it may be enfeebled and may suffer from the condition of the kingdom (page 68).<a name=280:20></a> If he means that God will keep true believers to the end, he does not think, I suppose, to give us fresh light by telling us so.<a name=280:21></a> Substantially, therefore, the only result of his book is, that he admits that the existing state of things (believers, as believers, excepted)

		is an "impure Babylon", "without remedy".<a name=281:1></a> "It is a horrible corruption which must definitively end in the accomplishment of the <i>mystery of iniquity</i>, in a <i>general apostasy</i>, upon which the Lord will only have to cause His most terrible judgments to fall" (page 68).<a name=281:2></a> Let us also remark that he justifies the application of the word apostasy to the state of things which has long existed (page 65).<a name=281:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=281:4></a> Olivier applies the passage, <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:1">1 Timothy  4:1</a> - 3, to religious forms destitute of life.<a name=281:5></a> The errors which are there pointed out "exactly concern superstitious practices".<a name=281:6></a> We find (page 67), that those who are guilty of them "have already apostatised".<a name=281:7></a> In this catalogue of irremediable evils is found the state of the dissenting churches themselves, as also that of the primitive churches immediately after their formation (pages 50, 56, etc.<a name=281:8></a>).<a name=281:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another remark to be made here.<a name=281:10></a> We have seen that Mr.<a name=281:11></a> Olivier asserts that the church cannot become corrupt; it is in the kingdom and not in the church that this corruption arises and increases.<a name=281:12></a> The great thing is, that corruption and apostasy (according to <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4">1 Timothy  4</a>) do exist.<a name=281:13></a> Let them call it kingdom, or give it any name they will, provided that consciences are reached.<a name=281:14></a> Popery, Nationalism, and in many respects even Dissenters are infected by this corruption, all being in the kingdom; and this state of things is irremediable.<a name=281:15></a> I go farther, and I say that this corruption began in the church as well as in the kingdom, since it began by principles of evil and not by the apostasy of individuals -- by principles of evil among true Christians who formed what existed of the church upon earth.<a name=281:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My first witness for a part of this truth will be Mr.<a name=281:17></a> Olivier (page 46).<a name=281:18></a> "Another inevitable source of corruption is the sins of true Christians themselves".<a name=281:19></a> Mr.<a name=281:20></a> Olivier will have it that this has acted upon the churches, or the kingdom.<a name=281:21></a> That may be; but at least the "source of corruption" was found in the true Christians who composed the church.<a name=281:22></a> But one may go still farther; for that which was a source of corruption was not only the sins of true Christians, but, yet more, Judaism.<a name=281:23></a> What overthrew Christianity was found in true Christians.<a name=281:24></a> The Galatians were not only a church; they were true disciples.<a name=281:25></a> Those who had come down from Jerusalem to Antioch are recognised by the apostles as belonging to them, although not authorised on their part.<a name=281:26></a> The Pharisees who blamed Peter for having eaten with the Gentiles were believers.<a name=281:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=282>[Page 282]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One sees many other examples of it.<a name=282:1></a> We find then, that the machinations of Satan among true Christians were the first and principal source of the evil.<a name=282:2></a> I admit that this may have been an occasion for the introduction of false brethren; but the corruption began in the church.<a name=282:3></a> It is in the church that we find it now, unless the most gross errors and superstitions, in which real Christians are found even according to Mr.<a name=282:4></a> Olivier, are not corruption.<a name=282:5></a> I say according to Mr.<a name=282:6></a> Olivier; for he admits that there are Christians in popery, in Nationalism, and elsewhere.<a name=282:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If, again, Mr.<a name=282:8></a> Olivier will not allow that true Christians, whose sins and whose errors, as we have seen, are an inevitable source of corruption, form the church, because in the sight of God the church will only be truly gathered together in heaven at last, then I answer, that his reasoning is both false and absurd: false, because Timothy ought to know how to behave himself in the church of the living God, and certainly that was not in the church gathered in heaven -- the body of Christ was increasing by joints of supply, and certainly that was not in heaven -- absurd, for no one dreams of corruption being in heaven; and the reasonings of every man of good sense, and of the Bible, are occupied with the church upon earth.<a name=282:9></a> But if true Christians composed the church then there was in the church, according to Mr.<a name=282:10></a> Olivier, "an inevitable source of corruption" in the sins, and (shall I add according to the word of God?<a name=282:11></a>) in the errors which were found there: errors, which for a moment made Paul doubt that those who had adopted them were true Christians, <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:11">Galatians  4:11</a>, 20.<a name=282:12></a> So it is true that there is corruption at the present time in the church, for the sins and errors have been increasing from the commencement among true Christians, although God has often raised up some special lights in their midst.<a name=282:13></a> It was not necessary that all Christians should be corrupted to make it true that the corruption began in the church.<a name=282:14></a> It was sufficient that "there was an inevitable source of corruption" in those who formed part of it.<a name=282:15></a> That is what took place by Mr.<a name=282:16></a> Olivier's own confession.<a name=282:17></a> But this is a fact, a truth of the greatest importance, because the church is found to be compromised in the corruption which has invaded the kingdom itself.<a name=282:18></a> Inevitable sources of this corruption were found there.<a name=282:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=282:20></a> Olivier may try to persuade us that the sleep of the workmen was a legitimate rest, although the apostle tells us

	<div class="paragraph">
		Dare I add, for my own part, that if there had not been such a want of clearness, equilibrium, and measure in the theories of that poor Mr.<a name=283:3></a> D.<a name=283:4></a>, we should not, it is to be supposed, have possessed the description of calm, and moderate things that is contained in pages 50 to 69 of Mr.<a name=283:5></a> Olivier's pamphlet?<a name=283:6></a> One must have a forlorn hope to mount the breach first: prudent men no doubt follow in better order.<a name=283:7></a>

		First, Mr.<a name=285:8></a> Olivier wishes to make the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God the same thing.<a name=285:9></a> In some places this is true; just as the canton and the republic of Geneva are now the same thing.<a name=285:10></a> But if I were to try and identify the canton and the republic in history, I should only shew my ignorance.<a name=285:11></a>

		The expression "kingdom of heaven" is only found in Matthew; and when the Spirit of God wishes to speak of what has already come, He always changes the expression, and says, "kingdom of God".<a name=285:12></a> Thus in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:17">Romans  14:17</a>, one would never find such an expression as this, "For the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink"; because, although the kingdom of heaven is necessarily the kingdom of God, the expression "kingdom of heaven" relates to an order of things in the dispensations of God, and alludes, I doubt not, as Mr.<a name=285:13></a> Olivier says, to <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>.<a name=285:14></a> That is why this expression is found in Matthew -- a gospel full of Jewish points of view -- a gospel which devotes itself to shewing the accomplishment of the prophecies and of the promises made to the Jews.<a name=285:15></a> This is why it is always said, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand": Jesus Himself said it, while He says, "The kingdom of God is among you", for the King was there; but it was not the kingdom of heaven whilst the King was upon earth.<a name=285:16></a> Since the exaltation of Jesus, this kingdom of heaven has taken a special character, on account of the rejection of the Jews for a time.<a name=285:17></a> And this is what is explained in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>; the rejection of the people having been proved at the end of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now come to the word <i>dispensation</i>.<a name=288:20></a> Here Mr.<a name=288:21></a> Olivier is very unfortunate even in the things in which "a smattering" is necessary for teachers, from the time when miraculous gifts ceased in the church, and on account of the distance of times and places.<a name=288:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But these economies, until the coming of Christ, are, as far as their course is concerned, left to man, and to his responsibility, although God may work secretly.<a name=289:12></a> For example, the Lord speaks thus of the present economy, "So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.<a name=289:13></a> For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.<a name=289:14></a> But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come".<a name=289:15></a> Outwardly, all goes on without the intervention of Christ, from the sowing of the seed until the harvest.<a name=289:16></a> Well, the time which elapses from the seed-sowing till the harvest is what is generally called <i>the present dispensation</i>.<a name=289:17></a> I have called it "the church dispensation", because it is the time during which the church is called, and exists here below, in contrast with the Jews and the legal system.<a name=289:18></a> And one sees that, although in fact it is God who causes the corn to ripen, outwardly He seems to let everything take its own course.<a name=289:19></a> Thus, Satan may act in the midst of all this; man may sleep; and the whole state of things may become corrupt: and, in

		As to the apostasy of the dispensation, I have already touched upon it in speaking of the dispensation; but I have treated it at length in the <i>Remarks on the State of the Church</i>.<a name=291:11></a> Only when Mr.<a name=291:12></a> Olivier says that the apostles pointed out the evils which were creeping into the churches, he makes a mistake; it is in the so-called General Epistles, and in the Epistles to Timothy: epistles that are not addressed to churches, that the Spirit of God speaks of these evils.<a name=291:13></a> These epistles speak neither of churches nor of the kingdom -- an all-important point, as I have already observed.<a name=291:14></a> The apostles do not speak of churches as becoming corrupt, but of a mystery of iniquity which was already at work, and which was not in such or such a church.<a name=291:15></a> Mr.<a name=291:16></a> Olivier is entirely wrong on this point.<a name=291:17></a> Let us remember that Mr.<a name=291:18></a> Olivier applies the word apostasy to the doctrines and to the conditions of the national churches and of the Roman church, which, however, are not churches; and we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us come to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:1">Romans  11:1</a> - 22.<a name=292:3></a> First Mr.<a name=292:4></a> Olivier says that from verses 1 - 10, Paul is shewing that God, while He has cast off Israel as a nation, has not cast off the Israelites as individuals.<a name=292:5></a> It is surprising that anyone should have fallen into such a mistake.<a name=292:6></a> The church, which was chiefly, or at least in great part, composed of Jews, could never have raised the question of the Israelites being individually rejected.<a name=292:7></a> What kind of a gospel would it be, that could leave such a question undecided?<a name=292:8></a> The question is this, "Has God cast off <i>his people</i>?<a name=292:9></a>" The first proof that He has not done so is, that there is an election, as in the time of Elias -- the rest were blinded.<a name=292:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second proof.<a name=292:11></a> If they stumbled, it was not that they should fall, but that salvation might be granted to the Gentiles.<a name=292:12></a> Here, observe, the apostle does not say to <i>some</i> Gentiles, but to the Gentiles; and that the Gentiles, not some Gentiles, are put in contrast with the Jews.<a name=292:13></a> It is very certain that they are not elect Gentiles in contrast with elect Jews; but Gentiles in contrast with Jews.<a name=292:14></a> This is why the apostle says that the rejection of the latter is the reconciling of the world.<a name=292:15></a> So that the apostle tells us that the Gentiles, the world, have been placed, since the fall of the Jews, in a different relation with God from that in which they were before.<a name=292:16></a> It is not a question of deciding whether they have all been made partakers of the efficacy flowing from that relationship; but the relationship exists.<a name=292:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third proof is that, when the fulness of the Gentiles has come in, all Israel, Israel as a nation, shall be saved, and that at the return of Christ.<a name=292:18></a> When the apostle says, "I speak to you Gentiles", he does not say, as Mr.<a name=292:19></a> Olivier makes him, "to you faithful Gentiles"; for he adds, "Inasmuch as I am an apostle of the Gentiles".<a name=292:20></a> Was he the apostle of the faithful Gentiles?<a name=292:21></a> Clearly not.<a name=292:22></a> He was the apostle of the Gentiles as Gentiles, in contrast with the Jews, the circumcision, of whom Peter was the apostle.<a name=292:23></a> Again, verse 13 precedes verse 25, where he says "my brethren".<a name=292:24></a> In verse 13, and following, he is occupied with the salvation granted to the Gentiles, and the reconciliation of the world as a doctrine, and not as a warning to his brethren.<a name=292:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=292:26></a> Olivier further makes verses 17 - 22 to be a warning to the faithful and the believing; as if Paul said to them that, if

		they did not persevere, they would be cut off.<a name=293:1></a> But it seems to me rather singular to say that, because the mass of unbelieving Israel had been cut off and the election saved, the election from among the Gentiles was to take heed lest it also should be cut off.<a name=293:2></a> The more the passage is examined, the more evident it is that the interpretation which applies to the present dispensation (looked at under the aspect of the calling in of the Gentiles, and which makes it a warning to the Gentiles as to their responsibility) is the only true interpretation.<a name=293:3></a> As to Abraham, I consider him as the root, but looked at as the personification of the three principles -- election, calling, and promise<a href="#293:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=293:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I distinctly maintain that there are privileges outside vital union with Christ, and privileges for which the Gentiles will be responsible, as the Jews have been for theirs.<a name=293:5></a> See <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>.<a name=293:6></a> Those who have enjoyed these privileges will be beaten with more stripes if they have not profited by them; whilst those who have not possessed them will be beaten with few stripes.<a name=293:7></a> It was a privilege to be a servant in the house, to have received a talent; but such persons, or classes of persons, were not vitally united to Christ.<a name=293:8></a> The seed sown on the stony ground was a privilege; but it had no root, no vital union.<a name=293:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now for the three economies (page 140) -- it is a very unexpected result.<a name=293:10></a> If there were three, I should not make so great a mistake as to confound them with the same word used in the sense of an administration entrusted to an individual, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:25">Colossians  1:25</a>; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:2">Ephesians  3:2</a>.<a name=293:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of God says three things as to the present dispensation.<a name=293:12></a> First; by the existence and by the principles of this dispensation, the world is placed in a fresh relationship with God.<a name=293:13></a> The Gentiles are no longer regarded as "dogs" in contrast with "the children".<a name=293:14></a> It is the time of salvation for the Jew first and also for the Greek.<a name=293:15></a> Salvation is granted to the Gentiles; the fall of the Jews has been the reconciling of the world.<a name=293:16></a> If the church has not been faithful in using this grace for profit to the poor world, so much the worse for the church.<a name=293:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly; those who are called, but not elect, all the baptised, are put in direct relation with the Lord, and are responsible in general (I say in general, because circumstances

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third place; there is the body of Christ, those who are united to Him, who partake of His life and who will be saved spite of all the obstacles that they meet with in the journey.<a name=294:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see in this neither three dispensations nor a single difficulty.<a name=294:4></a> No one thinks that the Gentiles were grafted in as a body.<a name=294:5></a> Those who believed stood by faith.<a name=294:6></a> Those who entered without faith will be judged according to the privileges which they abused.<a name=294:7></a> And, before the end, God will send the gospel of the kingdom in order that judgment may not fall upon all without a testimony having been given to them.<a name=294:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all his reasonings upon this subject, Mr.<a name=294:9></a> Olivier has confounded the ways of God towards Israel and towards the world with the salvation of individuals.<a name=294:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is one of the points of the church's responsibility in which it has completely failed.<a name=294:11></a> It ought to have been one, that the world might believe; it has not been so.<a name=294:12></a> It ought to have been a witness to all nations; it has not been so.<a name=294:13></a> And instead of being the source of good to the world, as it ought to have been, the world has been a source of evil to it -- the church, properly so called -- to true Christians.<a name=294:14></a> Instead of being the light of the world, it has become, according to its own confession, the <i>invisible</i> church.<a name=294:15></a> This is why I have spoken of Christendom and of the Gentiles grafted into the place of the Jews; for what God had grafted into the place of the Jewish branches became worldly, failed in faithfulness, and is become, in the modern sense, Christendom -- the little seed, a great tree where the birds of the air make their nests.<a name=294:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All Mr.<a name=294:17></a> Olivier's reasonings are only obscuring a very simple thing.<a name=294:18></a> As the early Christians have not been faithful, the consequence is that the testimony and the profession of Christianity as a whole in this world have been marred.<a name=294:19></a> If it were a question of the taste of wine, a bottle of the best wine put into a cask; of water might give rise to many reasonings whether good wine were there or not: those who are fond of drinking it would soon settle the question.<a name=294:20></a>

		When Mr.<a name=295:1></a> Olivier says that I consider infidels as members of the body of Christ, it is only because he did not understand the application of what I said in answer to Mr.<a name=295:2></a> Rochat's pamphlet.<a name=295:3></a> Mr.<a name=295:4></a> Rochat, having separated from evil, did not wish to share the responsibility of the state of things which surrounded him; for myself, I bear the burden of it.<a name=295:5></a> It would not be worth while noticing an accusation which refutes itself, if what is said were not a fresh proof of the absence of all idea of the church's responsibility down here.<a name=295:6></a> I have neither spoken of unbelievers nor of the members of the body of Christ; I have spoken of the state of the church.<a name=295:7></a> Nor do I only speak of the unfaithfulness of true members.<a name=295:8></a> The glory of Christ is not manifested: the church does not shine before the world.<a name=295:9></a> The glory of Christ is, as it were, hidden, dragged in the dust; and enemies triumph because of it.<a name=295:10></a> The enemy's power succeeds morally in most cases, as the enemies of Israel succeeded when Israel was unfaithful.<a name=295:11></a> Nor was there only individual unfaithfulness to deplore, but a condition of things which dishonoured God in the world.<a name=295:12></a> Mr.<a name=295:13></a> Olivier does not perceive this, at least according to what he says here.<a name=295:14></a> Hence the accusation he brings against me of regarding unbelievers as members of the body of Christ, although I neither spoke of unbelievers nor of members of His body.<a name=295:15></a> This is the root of the matter -- the manifestation of the glory of Christ upon the earth by the church: ought the church to have manifested it?<a name=295:16></a> Ought we to humble ourselves if it does not do so?<a name=295:17></a> If this be false, I am mistaken; if this be true, the opposite system is profound iniquity -- an iniquity of which people, no doubt, are not aware, but which is none the less an iniquity that leaves the church without hope from those who prop it up.<a name=295:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the attack upon the meetings of brethren, I make no answer.<a name=295:19></a> That there is difficulty and weakness, I do not doubt; but to answer would be either to justify ourselves or to accuse others.<a name=295:20></a> According to the blessing that exists in the meetings, God will bring those who He means to bless.<a name=295:21></a> If there is not any blessing, one cannot expect that He will make His children come.<a name=295:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have for many years been accustomed to similar attacks, and I have found that the effect has been to turn aside those who had not faith enough to act from conviction, to stop simple persons for a time, and thus to exercise the faith of the brethren; but that after that the reaction has been stronger, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		that it all turned to good and brought souls into a freer and more blessed position.<a name=296:1></a> Besides, in every case if we are reviled, we have only to submit in patience and to commit all to God.<a name=296:2></a> It is not surprising that those who have lived under a completely false system should not quickly accustom themselves to simple truths.<a name=296:3></a> I can understand Mr.<a name=296:4></a> Olivier being accustomed to lead the worship, and wishing to do so; but I do not think he can shew me anything like this in the word of God -- at least, in the New Testament.<a name=296:5></a> That the dissenting principle<a href="#296:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> of all having a right to speak should have produced in others the desire to be the only speakers or to lead the worship, I understand very well; and that these two evils should have made simplicity more difficult, I also understand.<a name=296:6></a> But the wretchedness of a system which I think bad ought not to become a rule for the walk of those who wait on God.<a name=296:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The tendency of Mr.<a name=296:8></a> Olivier's tract is to lead to the denial of the union and bringing together of the church on earth, and of the responsibility of the church as to the condition in which it now is.<a name=296:9></a> Consequently, I think it is an effort against the truth, although many grand truths are brought out in it.<a name=296:10></a> I consider his whole system, as to the church and kingdom, completely false.<a name=296:11></a> The results of it are to make Christ the King of the "unclean Babylon"; for, certainly, He is the King of the kingdom.<a name=296:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The apostasy of the kingdom" is an absurdity, because, I repeat, the King and His government always exist; and the judgment of the King is a part of the manifestation of the kingdom.<a name=296:13></a> It is false to say that the pure kingdom is the same thing as the church; for the field, as much as the good corn, forms part of the kingdom.<a name=296:14></a> The field is purchased as much as the treasure hidden in it.<a name=296:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is but the consequence of traditional ideas, and the reasonings founded on them only serve to confuse.<a name=296:16></a> It is, as if I said, The canton of Geneva is composed of so many square miles of ancient territory, and of so many new ones united to them; and, afterwards, The canton of Geneva has voted such and such a thing in the diet; and then insisted upon the absurdity of a vote given by square miles.<a name=296:17></a> It is just the same if a person say, that, because the good seed is one of the elements of the description of the kingdom, therefore the kingdom is the good seed.<a name=296:18></a>

		THOUGHTS ON @ROMANS 11, AND ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH IN REFERENCE TO A PAMPHLET OF MR. F. OLIVIER, ENTITLED "DEFENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN IN THE PAMPHLET, 'ESSAY ON THE KINGDOM OF GOD', ETC".¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reading of Mr.<a name=298:1></a> Olivier's defence of his principles did not dispose me to answer him regularly on all points.<a name=298:2></a> The character of his reasoning did not induce me either to follow him in details, or to take up that which he has thought fit to oppose to me.<a name=298:3></a> Happily, after going through the pamphlet and examining somewhat attentively the conclusion at which he has arrived, I found there was no need for it; because, while blaming the reasoning through which I arrived at my own conclusions, and pointing out a few contradictions into which I had fallen, he ends by admitting the truth for which I stood up.<a name=298:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This will appear with the greatest evidence, if we examine with a little attention two things which are to be found in his writings on the subject.<a name=298:5></a> The great question raised between myself and the adversaries of the important truth on which I insist, is the existence of a church on earth; then the responsibility of Christians for the condition in which we are found -- in which this church is found.<a name=298:6></a> I have insisted on the unity of God's assembly and on the responsibility of its members as to the condition in which it is found.<a name=298:7></a> I have said that we are responsible for that condition, or, to speak more exactly, for the glory of God, such as it ought to have been manifested in the church on earth.<a name=298:8></a> Now Mr.<a name=298:9></a> Olivier says I have not by direct passages proves this responsibility; but that what I presented may be considered as a pretty strong presumption of the responsibility of the church.<a name=298:10></a>

		We shall say a word on responsibility; but there can be no presumption, either strong or feeble, of the responsibility of the church, if there be no church.<a name=298:11></a> The existence of the church, therefore, is recognised, and that on earth; for in the glorified church there is no question of appearing to be members of Christ, or of viewing sins or not as our own.<a name=298:12></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#302:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>The two truths with which this question connects itself are: the return of Christ and the presence of the Holy Spirit in the Church; for the Holy Spirit has come down on earth, and this it is which gives to the church its unity and corporate responsibility upon earth. It is with the church as with a human body, all the component parts of which are said to be entirely renewed in a very short period of time, yet the individual remains the same man: the spirit of man which is in him attaches vitally to itself, and appropriates successively new heterogeneous elements, and the unity and the person change not. <p>There are three great truths which are connected with Christ, the centre of all truth, or, if you please, three different positions in which He is seen: dead and risen; then in heaven (with this corresponds, as its proof, the presence of the Holy Spirit upon earth, @John 16); and lastly, His return down here. Dead and risen -- thus is the church, His body, justified, risen with Him. Such is the doctrine of justification; and although it is evidently true as to the whole church, considered as a body, yet in its application day by day, and for each conscience, it is an individual matter for each. The Holy Spirit dwells as the seal of this doctrine in the body of an individual as in a temple. Then in heaven Jesus is hid in God, yet crowned with honour and glory; the doctrine which thence flows is the presence of the Holy Spirit in the church upon earth,¦ in His body; of the Holy Spirit who gives to this body its unity, and makes the terms "body of Christ" -- "bride of Christ" -- "church of Christ" to be applicable to those who, upon earth, are united to Him who is in heaven, and who thus form a unity upon earth; the dead in Christ being for the moment out of sight. If this is understood (for one may be converted and not understand it), one desires, as bride of Christ, the return of the Bridegroom. Justification is connected with His death and resurrection; for we know that His work has been accepted on high. The unity of the church, and her waiting for Christ as is becoming for a faithful bride -- this it is which is connected with the glory of Christ on high, and the presence of the Holy Spirit down here. These are the two great truths which have been specially put forward, which, as I believe, God Himself has put forward at the present moment, and which have produced so much disquietude in those who desire to remain without the sphere of their influence -- whether in the national churches or in dissent. That there should be ignorance of these things, one can well understand; that there should be opposition to them is indeed sad; but to say that these truths are secondary is utterly to deceive oneself. To make little account of the glory of Christ manifested in the unity of the church here below is, in truth, a proof that that glory and the love of Christ for His church are not dear to the heart, and therefore offers little opportunity of speaking to the conscience. If after having urged upon a son his duty towards a tender and affectionate father, and having explained to him the nature of filial affection, he should ask one to trace out accurately his duty, one might well refuse; he has not the mind to understand his position: the request is the request of a hireling. The feeling must be awakened if conscience is to act; but woe, woe to him in whom it does not exist! It is just the same with regard to the responsibility of the church, the grace of the relationship must be owned, and it is the heart taught by the Holy Spirit which understands it. I doubt not that there is enough to condemn, by means of the conscience itself, him who thus fails; but to do so is neither my task nor my desire. If the heart could be awakened so as to feel the force of this relationship, of this obligation -- that would be the most precious fruit of all the conflict in which I have had to engage on these points. Israel might have been condemned by the law; but is not the appeal of God much stronger, and Israel much more hardened, not to have replied to it, when it is said, and said in vain, "Go yet, love a woman beloved of (her) friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel"? For, as the first principle is love, if that fails, all fails. I admit, and I always have admitted, that one may understand the love which saves without knowing that the church is the bride of Christ; but under existing circumstances, this it is which the Holy Spirit in a peculiar way calls to mind: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come." Such is the normal position, such the primary testimony which the church renders. After that, it can turn towards others and say, "And let him that is athirst come," for living waters already flow there; "and whosoever will," etc. But for Christians this is the Spirit's last behest to the church pointing out her true position. Her sentiments are based upon her relationships to Christ, and the Spirit demands that those who hear should be in unison with this desire of His heart. Is it wrong to engage those who have heard the voice of the good Shepherd, to take the position of the bride and to join in the cry, "Come"? But the doctrines of the presence of the Holy Spirit here below in the Church, and of the return of Christ, are identified with its unity upon earth, with the position of bride, or rather of her who here below is espoused to be presented as a chaste virgin unto Christ, and with the desire of His coming, which detaches us from all that is not of Him, and attaches us entirely, exclusively, to Himself. <p>It is easy to understand how those who are in national establishments feel themselves troubled by such a truth. They have quite another sort of unity; and, as to them, division is that which separates from what is really union with the world and subjection to another than Christ. That dissenters -- who, faithful in separating from that which is contrary to the precepts of the gospel have made churches, though they have never apprehended, but contrariwise have rejected, the idea of the church upon earth -- should be opposed to it, this also is intelligible enough. But it ought not to enfeeble the power of these two great truths upon our hearts, nor alienate us from them. Division in the latter case is sometimes in appearance less reasonable, because the evil among them is less gross than elsewhere, but they have not accepted, and still do refuse to accept these truths. They have no influence upon their manner of acting. That there should be patience there can be no doubt; but that these two immense truths should not produce effects, that they should leave those who oppose them in tranquillity -- will never be the case. It is well for brethren, and even for those who oppose, to understand what really is in question. Hitherto the unity and the responsibility of the church have been denied. The return of Christ has had no practical effect upon the opponents of these doctrines. Scarcely are they even now recognised as being strongly probable -- which is not such a conviction as can furnish a motive for conduct; while all the affections of the church ought to be formed upon, and her walk regulated by, these doctrines, while awaiting Christ's return. <p>I find two things presented in the word as the great means of judging of the state of the people of God: 1st, the comparing it with the state in which God placed them at the first; 2nd, with the glory of Christ who is about to return. Compare @Isaiah 5 for the first and chapter 6 for the second.

		<a class="footnote" name="#308:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>If the question were about a warning to brethren in Christ as members of the Church, and not about the earthly administration of the economy, how could it be said that the Gentiles were grafted into the place, or into the midst of the Jews? The Jews and the Gentiles were grafted or admitted together; but when speaking about the tree of promise, and the ways of God toward this tree of promise here below, then the Holy Spirit may well speak of the cutting off of branches, because the tree remains always and necessarily there, whatsoever in other respects might be its form in detail. This is really the subject of the chapter, and not the church properly so called. Then, also, in like manner, the Gentiles might be, and were grafted into the place of the dry branches which were cut out; in the meanwhile the green branches, which remained in the tree, of necessity took the form of the dispensation of grace, the mould in which the promises were now cast. It will be the same with the Gentile world; all those who have professed the name of Christ, except the elect, will be cut off -- the others will be in heaven -- and the dispensation of the promises upon earth will again take the Jewish form; yet according to the new covenant, and in blessing upon the Gentiles also, under the reign of the Son of man. The truth is, it was not only the law which applied to man upon earth, but the promises also of God revealed in the word before the manifestation of His Son, of the eternal life which was with the Father and has been manifested to us. These promises, I say, reached not to the heavens either: they were given since the foundation of the world, had reference to the world, and must be fulfilled upon earth. Even the resurrection itself, concealed as it was in the declaration, "I am the God of Abraham," etc., presented no distinct revelation of heaven. The promise of eternal life given to us in Christ before the world was, was not of this world, and is not fulfilled here, although we are possessed of it while here in pilgrimage; the life, according to which we enjoy it, existed before the world was, the life of the Word, the life of Christ. This is the life of the church, and what was revealed in order that the church might exist: but it must needs, here below, equally take the position of the seed of promise, that is, though its life is the life which Christ had before the world was made, it must needs, at the same time, be placed in the position of heir of the promise here below. But how does it take that place? In that it is united to Christ (to Him who, while indeed having divine and eternal life in Himself, is the true Seed of Abraham), and in that it is made partaker of His life. As partaker of His life, it expects heavenly things, the same glory with Him; but in that it has that life, it is placed upon the same root, is introduced into the position of the heirs of the promise here below, of the seed of Abraham, according to the promise, because Christ, although He had the life of God in Himself, deigned to place Himself there. By the possession of that life, it is properly speaking the church¦ (whether composed of Jews or Gentiles matters not); but as introduced into the position of the seed of Abraham and heir of the promise here below, it is sustained by the root. The branches grafted in take the place of those which had been cut off. It is the administration of the promises here below which is treated of; and it is in this latter point of view that the subject is looked at in this eleventh chapter. When I say that the promises made to Abraham do not go beyond this world, I mean not to say that Abraham or any other such had not the enjoyment of other things in his soul; but it was not in such things that the promises by the which he was called through faith consisted. It is only when he entered Canaan, the land of promise, where he possessed nought, that his heart by faith rose higher; @Hebrews 11: 8, 9; @Acts 7: 5. <p>As to us we are called by a testimony to heavenly things; it is in heaven that the church in spirit finds herself; in the meantime we are the seed of Abraham and heirs according to promise. There it is, that the administration of God as to His promises and His ways towards Israel enters into the account, even for the church; and it is about this that the chapter treats, and not of the promise of life given before the world was. Therefore it is that He speaks of cutting off the branches grafted in amid others, of grafting in afresh the branches which had been cut off, of the Gentiles, of the people beloved although enemies as concerning the gospel, etc. To distinguish these things, and the government of God which flows thence and is connected therewith, from the power of eternal life in Jesus Christ, is of all importance for the understanding of the word.

		This passage is found at the close of a development of the ways of God, contained, as we have just seen, in this epistle: and to make of it a simple warning, is to misapprehend all the thought of God in it, and thus to forget that when the church as such is spoken of, there is neither Jew nor Gentile; we are all one in Jesus Christ.<a name=311:1></a>

		In general, the reply I made (page 28 of my last pamphlet) is sufficient as to pages 34 and 35: "the cutting off of Israel has been the reconciling of the world".<a name=313:11></a> All the baptised are under the responsibility, in general, of the privileges of the economy, and will be judged <i>accordingly</i>; believers find their enjoyment therein, according to their faith.<a name=313:12></a> I add, that Mr.<a name=313:13></a> Olivier is mistaken, when he says that the world can lose nothing.<a name=313:14></a> It is true that the world will enjoy other advantages during the millennium, far greater it may be; but the world now has the enjoyment of great advantages, which will be taken from it when the judgment takes place -- when the Master of the house rises up and shuts to the door.<a name=313:15></a> If, by an act of divine judgment, the gospel can no longer be preached in any country, that country has lost a privilege; so it will be with the world.<a name=313:16></a> The world has not been grafted in, but the world has been placed in a new relationship towards God.<a name=313:17></a> Farther on, I will return to this point; in the meanwhile, I will cite a remarkable passage which applies to this subject (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:32">Luke  2:32</a>); Christ has been a light for the revelation of the Gentiles.<a name=313:18></a> They were, before, so entirely in obscurity, that they were as if not in existence in the sight of God, not as to the judgment of the

		That God will be justified, when He shall judge and condemn the world, I cannot doubt; that He will send the gospel of the kingdom at the end, the church having failed in its duty, I believe; but this changes nought as to that which God has revealed concerning His relationship to the world, as we have seen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:30">Acts  17:30</a>, 31.<a name=314:6></a>

		In fact, I feel a difficulty in replying to Mr.<a name=314:7></a> Olivier's observations, because he appears to have entirely neglected this thought of the government of God.<a name=314:8></a> It is the government of God which is the subject of these chapters in the Epistle to the Romans, and not the salvation of the individual, properly so called.<a name=314:9></a> In the second chapter, the apostle speaks of that, of perishing without law, of being judged by the law, etc.<a name=314:10></a>; but to say that a sovereign disposition by God imposes no responsibility upon those to whom it is not known, is to misconceive the whole subject, although such a thought may have to the natural heart an air of great justice.<a name=314:11></a> Men sometimes find themselves without excuse under the effect of a judgment of God, occasioned by the fault of their fathers, themselves persevering in the moral consequences of the fault, though they may not have individually committed the very fault itself.<a name=314:12></a> See, for example, the judgment of the Spirit upon the state of Gentiles (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1">Romans  1</a>), "Having known God, they glorified him not as God", etc.<a name=314:13></a> The Gentiles, of whom he speaks, had never known Him; their fathers, Noah, etc.<a name=314:14></a>, had known Him.<a name=314:15></a> If fresh light came which made manifest that state, they are held responsible to quit it according to that light, and guilty, also, according to that light of all which they do as individuals

		On the other hand, if great privileges have been granted to a people, and they have lost the knowledge thereof, they will yet be responsible (see what Josiah said when he found the book of the law), because, according to the government of God, one is responsible according to the place in which one is found, and not according to our capability of fulfilling it.<a name=315:2></a> Moreover, it is clearly not to the world that Paul addressed himself; but that is not the question.<a name=315:3></a> Even if it were true that Paul spoke only to believers, yet, since it is to a special class of believers that he does so (a distinction which would be impossible if the question were about the fundamental idea of the church), he can speak to that class under a peculiar aspect, all the while that he calls them brethren (and so he does), and give them instructions upon all that which concerned the subject on which he treats; and this is what he does.<a name=315:4></a> He may, at the same time, include other persons who are found in the same position without true faith, and this he insinuates; he can also speak of the consequences of his doctrine to the world, as also he does.<a name=315:5></a> To suppose, as some have done, that because he speaks <i>to</i> brethren he speaks only <i>of</i> brethren, and concerning those who are really such, seems futile; and one can see indeed that up to verse 25 he reasons in an abstract manner, according to the train of thought which the Spirit suggests to him; and having explained all the consequences of the ways of God, he at last declares, using the expression, "I say, then", addressing himself to his brethren, that he does so because he would not have them ignorant of this mystery.<a name=315:6></a> But he had previously developed the great principles and thought of God as to the mystery, its effect upon the world, upon the Gentiles, etc.<a name=315:7></a>

		To me it is evident, that as to that practical bearing and application of these words, "you Gentiles", though all Gentiles be liable to their application, those who are referred to in the words of Simeon (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>) are the only ones who are the object of them; the rest, as the inhabitants of Central Africa, for instance, exist not for the application of the reasoning of God in this chapter.<a name=315:8></a> When God applies them so, He will take care, by the preaching of the everlasting gospel, that all the Gentiles should be the objects of the judgment which will shew the justice of His government; but we cannot exactly address to

		As to the disappearing of the contrast (page 37) between the unbelief of the Jews, and the Gentiles standing by faith, there is no such thing.<a name=316:6></a> If the faith spoken of were the faith of an individual, there could be no cutting off; but the apostle points out the principle upon which the standing is, and that by which a falling may take place, in order to shew that as the Jews enjoying certain privileges lost them <i>through unbelief</i>, a similar thing would befall the Gentiles as to their privileges, if they should be found in the same <i>position of unbelief</i>.<a name=316:7></a> This is clear enough, I think.<a name=316:8></a> The apostle speaks not of those "standing by faith" in order to shew that those who were would be cut off, but to shew the principle upon which they stood, and that if, on the contrary, that failed, they would be cut off.<a name=316:9></a> Now as to a true believer, that could not ever be; but for him who was in the enjoyment of privileges, who was in the goodness of God as to his position, but who had not faith, the same thing which had happened to the Jews in similar circumstances might happen to him.<a name=316:10></a> It is in such persons that these warnings ever find their fulfilment.<a name=316:11></a>

		Nevertheless the Jews, ever setting themselves in opposition to the truth preached by Paul, and withstanding the preaching to the Gentiles according to the grace of God, filled up the measure of their sin, and wrath came upon them to the uttermost: they were sold with all that they possessed until payment should be made.<a name=325:5></a> From that point of time, the Gentiles are the subject of divine history.<a name=325:6></a> The Gentiles appear in the foreground, either as from attachment to their idols rejecting, or as receiving the testimony of grace which was proposed to them.<a name=325:7></a> Jerusalem trodden under foot by them, entirely disappears from the scene; and the iniquity and conduct of the Gentiles, such as it was, becomes the object of the judgment and actions of God.<a name=325:8></a> Meanwhile the Jews are as if buried (see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#26">Isaiah  26</a>; <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#36">Ezekiel  36</a>), yet preserved, even as the Gentiles had previously been, as if not in being.<a name=325:9></a> It is evident that the Gentiles professing Christianity, and the Gentiles of the four monarchies, subjected to the Beast, are the special though not sole objects of the ways of God in His government; but it is on the occasion of the destruction and judgment of these in particular, that the Son of man will establish His kingdom in power, although He will subject and judge all the others afterwards.<a name=325:10></a> Of this the prophecies of the Old and New Testament speak plainly enough.<a name=325:11></a>

		The need of union is felt now by every right-minded Christian.<a name=353:1></a> The power of evil is felt by all.<a name=353:2></a> Its pressure comes too near home, its rapid and gigantic strides are too evident and affect too nearly the particular feelings which characterise distinctively every class of Christians, to allow them to be blind to it, however little they may appreciate its true bearing and character.<a name=353:3></a> Better and holier feelings, too, arouse them to the sense of common danger, and (as far as it is entrusted to man's responsibility) the danger in which the cause of God is, from those who never did, and never would spare it.<a name=353:4></a> This need is felt wherever the Spirit of God acts, so as to make the saints value grace and truth and one body.<a name=353:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The feelings which the sense of the progress of evil produces may be different.<a name=353:6></a> Some, though they are but few, may yet trust to the bulwarks they have long looked at, but which had their force only in a respect for them which exists no longer.<a name=353:7></a> Others may trust to a fancied force of truth, which it has never exerted but in a little flock, because God and the work of His Spirit were there; others, to a union which never yet was the instrument of power on the side of good -- that is, a union by concord and agreement.<a name=353:8></a> While others may feel bound to abstain from such an agreed union, by reason of previously subsisting obligations, or prepossessions, so that the union tends to form only a party.<a name=353:9></a> But the sense of danger is universal.<a name=353:10></a> That which was long mocked at as a theory is now too practically felt to be denied; though the apprehensions of the word, which made those who were subjected to that mockery foresee the evil, may be rejected and slighted still.<a name=353:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, unity is a divine doctrine and principle; but, as evil is possible wherever unity is taken by itself so as to be a conclusive authority, wherever evil does enter, the conclusive obligation of unity binds to the evil, because the unity, where the evil is, is not to be broken.<a name=354:10></a> Of this we have a flagrant example in Romanism.<a name=354:11></a> There the unity of the church is the grand basis of argument; and it has been the ground of keeping the world, we may say, in every sanctioned enormity, and made the name of Christianity its warrant -- an authority to bind souls to evil, till the name itself became shameful to the natural conscience of man.<a name=354:12></a> The plea of unity may then be, in a measure, the latitudinarianism which flows from the

They are to be subject to the church: let the church allow it or not, that makes no difference. He who allows can hinder (that is, hinder God's addressing the saints).

		Thus Christ becomes, not only the centre of unity to the universe in His glorious title of power, but (as the manifester of God, the one owned and set up of the Father and attracter of man) He becomes a peculiar and special centre of divine affections in man, round which they are gathered as the sole divine centre of unity.<a name=359:9></a> For indeed, as the centre, necessarily the sole centre, "he that gathereth not with me scattereth".<a name=359:10></a> And such, as to this point, was the object even, and power of His death: "I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me".<a name=359:11></a> And more specially, He gave Himself "not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God which were scattered abroad".<a name=359:12></a> But here again, we find this separation of a peculiar people, "He gave himself for us that he might .<a name=359:13></a>.<a name=359:14></a>.<a name=359:15></a> purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works".<a name=359:16></a> He was the very pattern of the divine life in man, separate from the evil, by which it was universally surrounded; He was the friend of publicans and sinners, piping in grace to men by familiar and tender love; but He was ever the separate man.<a name=359:17></a> And so He is as the centre of the church and high-priest.<a name=359:18></a> "Such a high-priest <i>became us</i>, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, <i>separate from sinners</i>" -- and, it is added, "made higher than the heavens".<a name=359:19></a> Here in passing we may remark, that the centre and subject of this unity then is heavenly.<a name=359:20></a> A living Christ still became the instrument of maintaining the enmity, being Himself subject to the law of commandments contained in ordinances.<a name=359:21></a> Hence, though the divine glory of His Person necessarily reached over this wall as a fruitful bough of grace to poor passing Gentiles without (and it could not be otherwise, for where faith was, He could not deny Himself to be God, nor what God was, even love);

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here I might close my remarks, having developed the great, though simple, principle, flowing from the very nature of God, that separation from evil is His principle of unity.<a name=362:7></a> But a difficulty collateral to my main object and subject presents itself.<a name=362:8></a> Supposing evil introduces itself into this one body so formed actually on earth, does the principle still hold good?<a name=362:9></a> How then can separation from evil maintain unity?<a name=362:10></a> And here we can touch on the mystery of iniquity.<a name=362:11></a> But this principle, flowing from the very nature of God, that He is holy, cannot be set aside.<a name=362:12></a> Separation from evil is the necessary consequence of the presence of the Spirit of God under all circumstances as to conduct and fellowship.<a name=362:13></a> But here there is a certain modification of it.<a name=362:14></a> The revealed presence of God is always judicial when it exists; because power against evil is connected with the holiness which rejects it.<a name=362:15></a> Thus in Israel God's presence was judicial; His government was there, which did not allow of evil.<a name=362:16></a> So, though in another manner, it is in the church.<a name=362:17></a> God's presence is judicial there -- not in the world, save in testimony, because God is not yet revealed in the world; and hence it plucks up no tares out of that field.<a name=362:18></a> But it judges them that are within.<a name=362:19></a>

		Hence the church is to put out from itself the wicked person, and thus maintains its separation from evil.<a name=363:1></a> And unity is maintained in the power of the Holy Ghost and a good conscience.<a name=363:2></a> And indeed, that the Spirit may not be grieved, and the practical blessing lost, saints are exhorted to look diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God.<a name=363:3></a> And how sweet and blessed is this garden of the Lord, when it is thus maintained and blooms in the fragrance of Christ's grace.<a name=363:4></a> But, alas!<a name=363:5></a> we know worldliness creeps in, and spiritual power declines; the taste for this blessing is enfeebled, because it is not enjoyed in the power of the Spirit; the spiritual fellowship with Christ the heavenly Head decays, and the power which banishes evil out of the church is no longer in living exercise.<a name=363:6></a> The body is not sufficiently animated by the Holy Ghost to answer the mind of God.<a name=363:7></a> But God will never leave Himself without witness.<a name=363:8></a> He brings home the evil to the body by some testimony or other -- by the word or by judgments, or both in succession -- to recall it to its spiritual energy, and lead it to maintain His glory and its place.<a name=363:9></a> If it refuse to answer to the very nature and character of God, and to the incompatibility of that nature with evil (so that it becomes really a false witness for God), then the first and immutable principle recurs, the evil must be separated from.<a name=363:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, the unity which is maintained after such separation, becomes a testimony to the compatability of the Holy Ghost and evil: that is, it is in its nature apostasy; it maintains the name and authority of God in His church, and associates it with evil.<a name=363:11></a> It is not the professed open apostasy of avowed infidelity; but it is denying God according to the true power of the Holy Ghost, while using His name.<a name=363:12></a> This unity is the great power of evil pointed out in the New Testament, connected with the professing church and the form of piety.<a name=363:13></a> From such we are to turn away.<a name=363:14></a> This power of evil in the church may be discerned spiritually, and left when there is the consciousness of inability to effect any remedy; or if there be an open public testimony, it is then open condemnation to it.<a name=363:15></a> Thus, previous to the Reformation, God gave light to many who maintained a witness to this very evil in the professing church, apart from it; some bore testimony and still remained.<a name=363:16></a> When the Reformation came it was openly and publicly given, and the professing body or Romanism became openly and avowedly apostate, as far as a professing Christian

		Thus, then, the word of God affords us the true nature, object, and power of unity; and, in so doing, it gives us the measure of it, by which we judge of what pretends to it, and the manner of it; and, moreover, the means of maintaining its fundamental principles according to the nature and power of God by the Holy Ghost in the conscience where it may not be realised together in power.<a name=364:7></a> Its nature flows from God's; for of true unity He must be the centre, and He is holy; and He brings us into it by separating us from evil.<a name=364:8></a> Its object is Christ; He is the sole centre of the church's unity, objectively as its Head.<a name=364:9></a> Its power is the presence of the Holy Ghost down here, sent as the Spirit of Truth withal from the Father by Jesus.<a name=364:10></a> Its measure is walking in the light, as God is in the light; fellowship with the Father, and with His Son Jesus, and, we may add, through the testimony of the written word -- the apostolic and prophetic word of the New Testament especially.<a name=364:11></a> It is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets (of the New Testament), Jesus Christ Himself being the corner stone.<a name=364:12></a> The means of maintaining it is putting away evil (judicially if needed), so as to maintain, through the Spirit, fellowship with the Father and the Son.<a name=364:13></a> If evil be not put away, then separation from that which does not becomes a matter of conscience.<a name=364:14></a> I return, if alone, into the essential and infallible unity of the body, in its everlasting principles of union with the Head in a holy nature by the Spirit.<a name=364:15></a> The path of the saints thus becomes clear.<a name=364:16></a> God will secure by eternal power the vindication, not here perhaps, but before His angels, of them who have rightly owned His nature and truth in Christ Jesus.<a name=364:17></a>

		Allow me, in passing, before entering on the examination of the point which is now directly my object, to say a word on the sweet passage I have referred to, because it opens out God's full thoughts in bringing into the unity of which that epistle speaks.<a name=367:11></a> We are blessed in Christ, and God Himself is the centre of the blessing, and in two characters, His nature and His relationship; He is both as related to Christ Himself, viewed as man before Him, though the beloved Son.<a name=367:12></a> The verses I refer to, are <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a> - 7.<a name=367:13></a> He is the <i>God</i> and <i>Father</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=367:14></a> As the Lord, when ascending up on high, said, "I go to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God"; only that here He goes on to the unity in Christ.<a name=367:15></a> There Christ speaks of them as brethren.<a name=367:16></a> In this double character then, in which God stands to Christ Himself, He has blessed us with all spiritual blessings, none left out, in heavenly places, the best and highest sphere of blessing, where He dwells; not merely sent down to earth, but we taken ourselves up there, and in the best and highest way, in Christ Jesus, save His divine title to sit on the Father's throne.<a name=367:17></a> Wonderful portion, sweet and blessed grace, which becomes simple to us in the measure in which we are accustomed to dwell in the perfect goodness of God, to whom it is natural to be all that He is, who could be no other.<a name=367:18></a>

		There is another danger: a Christian separates from evil, I still suppose, in a case in which he is bound to do so.<a name=369:10></a> Say, he leaves the corruptest system in existence; on this principle, it is the evil acting on the conscience of the new man, and known to be offensive to God, which drives him out.<a name=369:11></a> Hence he is occupied <i>with the evil</i>.<a name=369:12></a> This is a dangerous position.<a name=369:13></a> He attaches it, perhaps anxiously, to those he has left, to give a clear ground why he has done so.<a name=369:14></a> They conceal, cover over, gloss, explain.<a name=369:15></a> It is always so where the evil is maintained.<a name=369:16></a> He seeks to prove it, to make his ground clear; he is occupied with evil, with proving evil, and proving evil against others.<a name=369:17></a> This is slippery ground for the heart, to say nothing of danger to love.<a name=369:18></a> The mind becomes occupied with evil as an object before it.<a name=369:19></a> This is not holiness, nor separation from evil, in practical internal power.<a name=369:20></a> It harasses the mind, and cannot feed the soul.<a name=369:21></a> Some are almost in danger of acquiescing in the evil through the weariness of thinking about it.<a name=369:22></a> At all events power is not found here.<a name=369:23></a> God separates us surely from evil, but <i>He</i> does not fill the mind when it continues to be occupied with it; for He is not in the evil.<a name=369:24></a> It is quite true that the mind may say, Let us think of the Lord and drop it, and get a measure of quiet and comfort; but in this case the

		law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<a name=375:1></a> The law told man what he ought to be.<a name=375:2></a> It did not <i>tell</i> him what he was.<a name=375:3></a> It told him of life if he obeyed, of a curse if he disobeyed; but it did not tell him that God was love; it spoke of responsibility; it said, "Do this and live".<a name=375:4></a> All this was perfect in its place, but it told neither what man was nor what God was; that remained concealed; but that is the truth.<a name=375:5></a>

		The truth is not what ought to be, but what is -- the reality of all relationships as they are, and the revelation of Him who, if there are any, must be the centre of them.<a name=375:6></a> Now that could not be told without grace, for man was a ruined sinner, and God is love.<a name=375:7></a> And how tell, moreover, that all relationship was gone<a href="#375:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> -- for judgment is not a relationship, but the consequence of the breach of one -- as the truth of any existing one, but in the revelation of that grace which formed one on this very ground by divine power?<a name=375:8></a> Hence we read "of his own will begat he us<a href="#375:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures"; that incorruptible seed of the word.<a name=375:9></a> Hence Christ is the truth.<a name=375:10></a> For since, grace, God Himself, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, even, are revealed as they are; what man is in perfection, in relationship with God; what man's alienation from God; what obedience, what disobedience, what holiness, what sin, what God, what man, what heaven, what earth; nothing but finds itself placed where it is in reference to God, and with the fullest revelation of Himself, while His counsels even are brought out, and of which Christ is the centre.<a name=375:11></a> Hence grace is the acting power in and alone capable of revealing truth; for Christ's being here is grace; His working effectual grace.<a name=375:12></a>

		Now, the very existence of such an object and such a power would prove a gathering power, gathering into unity, for it must, being divine, gather to itself; yet, we are not left to abstract consequences, however practically familiar to every renewed soul who does and must know, that all such are drawn together to Christ.<a name=375:13></a> The word of God is plain: "He should die .<a name=375:14></a>.<a name=375:15></a>.<a name=375:16></a> that he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad".<a name=375:17></a> I speak of these

		Now this, I apprehend, is what Ephesians shews, only that as it begins with the divine glory, the true source of all, that epistle begins with the purpose of love as to us in heaven in glory; and brings in redemption itself as a second thing, needed to bring us there.<a name=376:9></a> But this clearly does not alter the love which is, and is acting to bring us into this blessed and heavenly unity, and which is thus heavenly, and, in connection with God's glory, is holy according to the holiness of His presence.<a name=376:10></a> Christ's path on earth is the pattern of it below -- in its full measure on the cross.<a name=376:11></a> Hence heaven and the cross are correlative.<a name=376:12></a> When the blood went into the holiest the body was burnt without the camp -- outside; yea, denying all relationship of God with man as he was.<a name=376:13></a> Then gathering into one began.<a name=376:14></a> He slew the enmity -- as between Jew and Gentile -- and reconciled both in one body to God; and so we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.<a name=376:15></a> Ordinances always separate according to human holiness; grace unites according to divine.<a name=376:16></a>
