		The events which we have been considering, at the close of Kings and Chronicles, were deeply significant.<a name=1:1></a> The throne of God was no longer at Jerusalem.<a name=1:2></a> God had fulfilled His threat of casting off the city which He had chosen.<a name=1:3></a> He had bestowed the throne of the earth upon the Gentiles (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:37">Daniel  2:37</a>).<a name=1:4></a> Not only had Israel failed under the old covenant, and rejected God (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#8:7">1 Samuel  8:7</a>), so that God was no longer their king; but even after grace had raised up the house of David to sustain the relations of the people with God, under the rule of that house everything was entirely corrupted by sin; so that there was no more remedy, and God had written Loammi (not my people), as it were, on the forehead of a people who had forsaken Him.<a name=1:5></a> The counsels of God cannot fail; but such was the sad state in which the relationship between this people and God stood, if it can be said that a judgment like this allowed any relationship still to exist.<a name=1:6></a> So far as it depended on Israel, on man, all was lost.<a name=1:7></a> The consequences of this, with respect to God's dealings, were of great importance; they were nothing less than His taking His throne from the earth, casting off His people for the time as to His earthly government, and transferring power to the Gentiles.<a name=1:8></a> Man, in probation under the law, had failed, and he was condemned.<a name=1:9></a> He had been sustained in the way of grace through means which God had granted, in the family of David, for his continuance in the enjoyment of the blessings granted him, and he had failed again.<a name=1:10></a> Kingly power was in the hands of the Gentiles, and the people were under condemnation according to the old covenant.<a name=1:11></a>

		But God now brings back a little remnant, that the true King might be presented to them, and causes the temple to be rebuilt in its place, according to the promises given by the mouth of Jeremiah, and at the request of His servant Daniel.<a name=1:12></a>

		the real condition of the people, than they had who were rebuilding the temple, and received also much more extensive information as to the future destiny of Israel and the intentions of God respecting it.<a name=2:1></a> But a due appreciation of this return from captivity also is not without importance, since it is evident that the understanding of God's dealings with respect to the restoration of Israel, and the coming amongst them upon earth of Messiah Himself is connected with this event.<a name=2:2></a> It was the will of God that there should be some respite.<a name=2:3></a> The current of His purposes, however, concerning the times of the Gentiles, and the position of His people, was unaltered.<a name=2:4></a> They were still in subjection to the Gentiles.<a name=2:5></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:2">footnote</a></i>)

		It is Cyrus, king of Persia, who commands the people to return to Jerusalem, and to rebuild the temple.<a name=2:6></a> A type himself in some respects, of a far more glorious deliverer, he confesses Jehovah, the God of Israel, to be the true God.<a name=2:7></a> He is "the righteous man, raised up from the east, who treads down the princes like mortar".<a name=2:8></a> Called of Jehovah by name for this purpose, he favours Israel and honours Jehovah.<a name=2:9></a> Distinguished and blessed by the favour of the mighty God, a man whose conduct was certainly under the guidance of God, his personal character did not interfere with its being the times of the Gentiles, notwithstanding that God had put it into the heart of one of these Gentiles to favour His people.<a name=2:10></a> The word of God, by Jeremiah, is fulfilled.<a name=2:11></a> Babylon is judged, a characteristic event of all importance.<a name=2:12></a> But, in fact, that which still exists is a prolongation of its power.<a name=2:13></a> The seat of the royal authority which God bestows on man is a city which is not the city of God, which is neither the earthly Jerusalem nor the heavenly.<a name=2:14></a> The house of David no longer holds the sceptre entrusted to it.<a name=2:15></a>

		Nevertheless, God still gives the people -- guilty under the law -- an opportunity for the exercise of faith.<a name=3:4></a> Let us examine the principles that characterise the energy of the Holy Ghost in the people at the time of their return.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing to be observed is that, having felt what it was to have to do with the Gentiles, and having experienced the power and wickedness of those whose help they had formerly sought (the unclean spirit was, in this respect, gone out of them), the children of the captivity resolve that Israel shall be an unmingled Israel, and proved to be so.<a name=3:6></a> They are most careful in verifying the genealogies of the people, and of the priests, in order that none but Israel should be engaged in the work.<a name=3:7></a> Formerly one priest succeeded another without previous examination; genealogy was not verified, and children came into their father's place in the enjoyment of the privileges which God had granted them.<a name=3:8></a> But Israel now, through the great grace of God, had to recover their position.<a name=3:9></a> This was neither the beginning of their history, nor the power suited to the beginning; it was a return, and the disorder that sin had brought in was not henceforth to be endured.<a name=3:10></a> They were escaping from the fruits of it, at least in part.<a name=3:11></a> What had any but Israel to do there?<a name=3:12></a> To mark out the family of God was now the essential thing.<a name=3:13></a> Deliverance from Babylon was their deliverance.<a name=3:14></a> It was this family, or a small remnant of it, which God had brought, or was bringing, out from thence.<a name=3:15></a> Thus, even amongst those who had come back to Judea, whoever could not produce his genealogy was set aside; and every priest with whom this was the case was put away from the priesthood as polluted, whatever, as it appears, might be the reality of his qualification.<a name=3:16></a> Divine discernment might, perhaps, recognise them and their rights another day; but the people who had returned from captivity could not do so.<a name=3:17></a> They were a numbered and recognised people.<a name=3:18></a> They dwelt each in his own city.<a name=3:19></a> It was weakness, no priest with Urim and Thummim, but it was faithfulness.<a name=3:20></a>

		In the seventh month, (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:4">footnote</a></i>) the children of Israel gather themselves together at Jerusalem, each one going up from the place where he dwelt.<a name=4:1></a> The first thing which they do there, under the direction of Joshua and Zerubbabel, is to build the altar, to place themselves under the wings of the God of Israel, the sole Help and sole Protector of His people; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries.<a name=4:2></a> Their refuge is in God.<a name=4:3></a> Beautiful testimony of faith!<a name=4:4></a> precious effect of the state of trial and abasement they were in!<a name=4:5></a> Surrounded by enemies, the unwalled city is protected by the altar of her God erected by the faith of God's people; and she is in greater security than when she had her kings and her walls.<a name=4:6></a> Faith, strict in following the word, confides in the goodness of its God.<a name=4:7></a> This exactness in following the word characterised the Jews, at this time in several respects.<a name=4:8></a> We have seen it, chapter 2: 59 - 63, where some could not shew their genealogy; we find it again here, chapter 3: 2; and again in verse 4, on the occasion of the feast of tabernacles.<a name=4:9></a> Customs, traditions, all were lost.<a name=4:10></a> They were very careful not to follow the ways of Babylon.<a name=4:11></a> What had they left except the word?<a name=4:12></a> A condition like this gave it its full power.<a name=4:13></a> All this takes place before the house is built.<a name=4:14></a> It was faith seeking the will of God, although far from having set everything in order.<a name=4:15></a> We find, then, no attempt at doing without God those things which required a discernment that they did not possess.<a name=4:16></a> But with touching faith these Jews exercise piety towards God, worship God, and, as we may say, set Him in their midst, rendering Him that which duty required.<a name=4:17></a> They acknowledged God by faith; but until the Urim and Thummim should be there, they placed no one, on God's part, with the object of giving some competency to act for Him, in a position which required the exercise of God's authority.<a name=4:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having at length, brought together the materials which the king of Persia had granted them, the Jews begin to build the temple and lay its foundations.<a name=4:19></a> The joy of the people, generally, was great.<a name=4:20></a> This was natural and right.<a name=4:21></a> They praise Jehovah according to the ordinance of David, and sing, (how well it became them now to do so!<a name=4:22></a>) "His mercy endureth for ever".<a name=4:23></a> Nevertheless, the ancient men wept, for they had seen the former house, built according to the inspired direction

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joy was in His presence and acceptable.<a name=5:7></a> Tears confessed the truth, and testified a just sense of what God had been for His people, and of the blessing they had once enjoyed under His hand.<a name=5:8></a> Tears recognised, alas!<a name=5:9></a> that which the people of God had been for God; and these tears were acceptable to Him.<a name=5:10></a> The weeping could not be discerned from the shout of joy; this was a truthful result, natural and sad, yet becoming in the presence of God.<a name=5:11></a> For He rejoices in the joy of His people, and He understands their tears.<a name=5:12></a> It was, indeed, a true expression of the state of things.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in such a case, difficulties do not arise only from the weakness of the remnant; they proceed, also, from elements with which the remnant are outwardly connected, and which, at the same time, are foreign to the relationship of God's people with Himself.<a name=5:14></a> In Israel's case, there was real weakness, because God -- although faithful to His people according to their need -- did not, in fact, come forward to establish them on the original footing.<a name=5:15></a> To do so would not have been morally suitable, either with respect to the position in which the people stood with God, or with regard to the power which He had established among the Gentiles apart from Israel, or with a view to the instruction of His own people in all ages as to the government of God.<a name=5:16></a> Relationship with God is never despised with impunity.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But besides this, in such a state of things the power of the world having gained so much ground already in the land of promise, even among the people to whom the promise belonged, difficulties arose from the fact that persons who, in consequence of the intervention of the civil powers, were within the borders of the promised land, desired to participate with the Jews in constructing the temple.<a name=5:18></a> They alleged, in support of their claim, that they called upon God as the Jews did, and had sacrificed unto Him since Esarhaddon had brought them into the land.<a name=5:19></a> This was not enmity.<a name=5:20></a> Why repel such a desire?<a name=5:21></a>

		The Spirit of God calls them the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin.<a name=6:1></a> The people of God -- the assembly of God -- ought to be conscious of their own peculiar privileges, and that they are the assembly of the Lord.<a name=6:2></a> The Lord loved Judah and Benjamin.<a name=6:3></a> From His grace towards this people flowed all the blessing of which they were the object; and the people were bound fully to recognise this grace.<a name=6:4></a> Not to recognise it was to despise it.<a name=6:5></a> Now this grace was the sovereign goodness of God.<a name=6:6></a> To admit strangers would have been insensibility to this grace as the only source of good; it would have been to lose it, and to say that they were not its objects according to the sovereign goodness of God, more than other persons of the world.<a name=6:7></a> But the faithfulness and intelligence of the chiefs among Israel delivered them from this snare.<a name=6:8></a> "We ourselves together", said they, "will build unto Jehovah the God of Israel".<a name=6:9></a> "Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God".<a name=6:10></a> In fact, it would have been to deny that He was their God, the God of Israel.<a name=6:11></a> This is especially the case of the assembly when called to remember her privileges after long forgetfulness and painful chastisement.<a name=6:12></a> If God allow it for the trial or the chastening of His people, it is possible that the work may be stopped through the practices and the malice of those who will praise the great and noble Asnappar to the powers of the earth; before whom they will appear in their true earthly character, just as they assumed the garb of piety when seeking to insinuate themselves among the remnant of Israel.<a name=6:13></a> The power that belonged to God's people, at the time of their former independence, will alarm one who, not trusting in God, dreads the effect upon his own authority of the energy which the Spirit of God produces in the people of God independently of this authority, however submissive the people may be.<a name=6:14></a> Israel was acting here according to Cyrus's own decree; but this is of no avail.<a name=6:15></a> That which depends on God is absolute; that which does not depend on Him is arbitrary; but the faithful have nothing to do with all this.<a name=6:16></a> God may see that trial and chastening are needful to them.<a name=6:17></a> Whatever happens, they have to go through that which puts faith to the proof; but their path is ordered by the will of God, and their faith relies upon Him.<a name=6:18></a> In this case they had to wait; but God's time would come; and that, not by means of a mere decree from the Gentile king: God raises up a much more precious encouragement for them from another quarter.<a name=6:19></a> Although the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said that the people were obliged to wait.<a name=7:6></a> This was the case as soon as they received the decree that forbade their continuing to build.<a name=7:7></a> But many years had elapsed before this prohibition came; and it seems evident to me, from examining the prophecies which throw so much light on the contemporary history, and from comparing their dates, that it was want of faith in the remnant which was the true hindrance.<a name=7:8></a> There were adversaries in the land who made them afraid, and who thus prevented their building.<a name=7:9></a> It appears that the Jews did not dare continue.<a name=7:10></a> Their adversaries hired counsellors in the Persian court to frustrate the purpose of the Jews.<a name=7:11></a> But the first thing was that the adversaries weakened the hands of the people.<a name=7:12></a> It was not until two reigns later that the prohibition was obtained; but the Jews had left off building through fear of their adversaries (compare chapter 4: 4, 21, and 5: 1, with <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1:1">Haggai  1:1</a>, 2, 4; <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:15">Haggai  2:15</a>).<a name=7:13></a> Neither was it because the king's decree was brought them that they began again to build, but because they feared Jehovah, and feared not the king's command, as seeing Him who is invisible (<a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1:12">Haggai  1:12</a>, 13).<a name=7:14></a> God was not any more to be feared in the reign of Darius than in that of Cyrus or of Artaxerxes; but the source of their weakness was their having forgotten God.<a name=7:15></a> This makes manifest the great grace of God in awakening them by the mouth of Haggai.<a name=7:16></a> God had until then also chastened the people.<a name=7:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this shews us that, in ceasing to build the temple, Israel was in fault.<a name=7:18></a> It appears from Haggai (chapter 2: 15) that they had made no progress at all.<a name=7:19></a> The terror with which the adversaries had inspired the Jews had stopped them.<a name=7:20></a> They had no excuse for this, since even the king's commandment was on their side.<a name=7:21></a> That which they lacked was faith in God

		Jehovah's great grace in this was a real occasion for joy.<a name=8:6></a> The priests are set in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, according to the law of Moses, and we find more faithfulness than in the best days of the kings (compare chapter 6: 20 with <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#29:34">2 Chronicles  29:34</a>).<a name=8:7></a> But we hear nothing of the ordinances of David, and a still greater deficiency is seen in their celebration of the feast of dedication.<a name=8:8></a> They kept the passover -- a proof that the redemption of the people could be remembered in the land.<a name=8:9></a> Happy privilege of the restored remnant!<a name=8:10></a> Many also had joined them, separating themselves from the filthiness of the heathen of the land.<a name=8:11></a> Jehovah had given them cause for joy; but fire no longer came down from heaven to testify divine acceptance of the sacrifice offered for the dedication of the house.<a name=8:12></a> This was indeed a negative difference, but one of deep significance.<a name=8:13></a> And even that which formed the subject of their joy betrayed their condition.<a name=8:14></a> "Jehovah had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel".<a name=8:15></a> It was great kindness and touching grace on His part.<a name=8:16></a> But what a change!<a name=8:17></a>

		The character of this intervention of God by Ezra's mission is, I think, a touching proof of His loving-kindness.<a name=9:1></a> It was exactly suited to the wants of the people.<a name=9:2></a> It was not power.<a name=9:3></a> That had been removed to another place.<a name=9:4></a> It was the knowledge of the will and the ordinances of God, -- of the mind of God in the word.<a name=9:5></a> The king himself recognised this (chapter 7: 25).<a name=9:6></a> Guarded by the good hand of his God, this pious and devoted man goes up with many others to Jerusalem.<a name=9:7></a> Alas!<a name=9:8></a> as soon as he can look into these things, he finds the law already broken, evil already come in.<a name=9:9></a> The people of Israel had not kept themselves separate from the people of the lands, and even the princes and rulers had been chief in this trespass.<a name=9:10></a> Ezra is confounded at this, and remains overwhelmed with grief the whole day.<a name=9:11></a> Can it be that the remnant, whom God had snatched, as it were, from the fire, have so soon forgotten the hand that delivered them, and married the daughters of a strange god?<a name=9:12></a> Those who trembled at Jehovah's word having assembled with him, Ezra humbles himself on account of it.<a name=9:13></a> At the time of the evening sacrifice, he pours out the deep sorrows of his heart before the Lord.<a name=9:14></a> A great multitude have their hearts touched by grace.<a name=9:15></a> There is no prophetic answer, as so often before had happened in similar circumstances; but there is an answer from God in the hearts of the guilty.<a name=9:16></a> "We have sinned", said one among them; "yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing".<a name=9:17></a> And they set themselves heartily to the work.<a name=9:18></a> Israel is summoned, each one under pain of exclusion, to come up to Jerusalem, and they assembled at the time of rain, for the matter was urgent; and the congregation acknowledge it to be their duty to conform to the law.<a name=9:19></a> Under the hand of Ezra, and by the diligence of those who were appointed to this work, it was accomplished in two months.<a name=9:20></a> As for all those who had taken strange wives, they gave their hand that they would put away their wives: they confessed their sin and offered a ram for this trespass.<a name=9:21></a>

		Once more we find that that which characterises the operation of the Spirit of God, and the intervention of God among His people, with respect to their walk and moral condition, is separation from all who are not the people of God as they were.<a name=9:22></a> Those of the priestly family who were unable to produce their genealogy had been excluded from the priesthood as polluted; and those among the people who were in the same case were not acknowledged.<a name=9:23></a> They positively refuse any participation

		NEHEMIAH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Nehemiah will require but few remarks; but it is important to establish its import.<a name=12:1></a> It is a necessary link in the history of God's dealings, in the recital of His patience and loving-kindness towards Jerusalem, which He had chosen.<a name=12:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ezra we have seen the temple rebuilt and the authority of the law re-established among the people, who are again separated from the Gentiles, and set apart for God.<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Nehemiah we witness the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, and the restoration of what may be termed the civil condition of the people, but under circumstances that definitely prove their subjection to the Gentiles.<a name=12:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Through grace, faith had set up the altar, and the Gentiles had had nothing to do with it, except by voluntary service; but when the city is to be rebuilt, it is the governor appointed by the Gentiles who holds the prominent place, God having touched the heart of these Gentiles and disposed them to favour His people.<a name=12:5></a> We see in Nehemiah himself a heart touched with the affliction of his people, a precious token of the grace of God; and He who had produced this feeling disposed the king's heart to grant Nehemiah all he desired for the good of the people and of Jerusalem.<a name=12:6></a> We see also in Nehemiah a heart that habitually turned to God, that sought its strength in Him, and thus surmounted the greatest obstacles.<a name=12:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The time in which Nehemiah laboured for the good of his people was not one of those brilliant phases which, if faith be there, awaken even the energy of man, imparting to it its own lustre.<a name=12:8></a> It was a period which required the perseverance that springs from a deep interest in the people of God, because they are His people; a perseverance which, for this very reason, pursues its object in spite of the contempt excited by the work, apparently so insignificant, but which is not the less the work of God; and which pursues it in spite of the hatred and opposition of enemies, and the faintheartedness of fellow-labourers (chapter 4: 8, 10, 11); a perseverance which, giving itself up entirely to the work, baffles all the intrigues of the enemy, and avoids every snare, God taking care of those who trust in Him.<a name=12:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the midst, however, of all this faithfulness, we perceive the influence of the Gentile power controlling the whole state of things.<a name=13:2></a> Nehemiah's arrival and even his conduct are marked with this influence.<a name=13:3></a> It was not faith alone that was in action, but a protecting power also (compare <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#8:22">Ezra  8:22</a>; <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#2:7">Nehemiah  2:7</a> - 9).<a name=13:4></a> Nevertheless, the separation from all that was not Jewish is carefully maintained (chapter 2: 20; 7: 65; 9: 2; 10: 30; 13: 1,3, 29, 30).<a name=13:5></a>

		This history shews us, first of all, how, when God acts, faith stamps its own character on all who surround it.<a name=13:6></a> The Jews, who had so long left Jerusalem desolate, are quite disposed to recommence the work.<a name=13:7></a> Judah, however, is discouraged by the difficulties.<a name=13:8></a> This brings out the perseverance which characterises true faith when the work is of God, be it ever so poor in appearance.<a name=13:9></a> The whole heart is in it, because it is of God.<a name=13:10></a> Encouraged by Nehemiah's energy, the people are ready to work and fight at the same time.<a name=13:11></a> For faith always identifies God and His people in the heart.<a name=13:12></a> And this becomes a spring of devotedness in all concerned.<a name=13:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us remark, that in times of difficulty faith does not shew itself in the magnificence of the result, but in love for God's work, however little it may be, and in the perseverance with which it is carried on through all the difficulties belonging to this state of weakness; for that with which faith is occupied, is the city of God and the work of God, and these things have always the same value, whatever may be the circumstances in which they are found.<a name=13:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God blesses the labours of the faithful Nehemiah, and Jerusalem is once more encompassed by walls; a less touching condition than when the city of God was defended by the altar of God, which was a testimony to His presence and to the faith of those who erected it; but a condition that proved the faithfulness and loving-kindness of God, who, nevertheless, while outwardly re-establishing them, revoked no part of the judgment pronounced on His people and His city.<a name=13:15></a> He who rebuilt the walls was but the vicegerent of a foreign king; and it was the security of the people, and that which uprightness of heart required of them to acknowledge this; and it was done (chapter 9: 37).<a name=13:16></a> Still, God blesses them.<a name=13:17></a> Nehemiah recurs to the numbering of the people, according to the register of their genealogies that was drawn up at their first return from

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will add a few more remarks in this place.<a name=16:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Nehemiah places Israel, or rather the Jews, in the position they were to hold in their land until the coming of the Messiah; separate from the nations, faithful in keeping the law, but deprived of the privileges which had belonged to them as the people of God; under the yoke of the Gentiles, capable of rendering unto God the things that were God's, but deprived of His presence in their midst, as they had formerly enjoyed it in the temple; and, finally, bound to render unto Caesar the things that were Caesar's.<a name=16:5></a> When the Messenger of the covenant came (the Son of God, who could have cleansed the temple and placed the glory there), they received Him not; and they continue under the burden of the consequences of this rejection.<a name=16:6></a> This is now their condition until the coming of Christ.<a name=16:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is this which gives to the Book of Nehemiah its importance.<a name=16:8></a> Nehemiah's faith embraced those promises of God which were connected with His government -- such, for instance, as those contained in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#26">Leviticus  26</a>.<a name=16:9></a> But his faith went no farther (see chapter 1).<a name=16:10></a> There was blessing upon this faith, and it accomplished the purposes of God; but it left Israel where they were The precious phrase, "His mercy endureth for ever", is not found in this book.<a name=16:11></a> Nehemiah's faith did not rise so high.<a name=16:12></a> He is himself the servant of the Gentiles, and he acknowledges them.<a name=16:13></a> Such trust in God as is expressed in the words just quoted was linked with the altar and the temple, where Jehovah was everything to faith, and the Gentiles nothing, except as enemies (<a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#3">Ezra  3</a>, 4).<a name=16:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although it leaves the Jews in a much better condition than that in which they had previously stood, through the good hand of God upon them for immediate blessing, yet the Book of Nehemiah has no prophetic future, no future for faith.<a name=16:15></a> (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:16">footnote</a></i>) The Jews are still Lo-ammi (not my people).<a name=16:16></a> The presence of God,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Nehemiah the people are only set, meanwhile, in this place of blessing.<a name=17:7></a> The prophecies of Zechariah and Haggai are connected with the work of Zerubbabel, and not with that of Nehemiah; with the simple faith that reared the altar as the means of blessing and safety.<a name=17:8></a> There (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#1:16">Zechariah  1:16</a>) Jehovah could say that He had returned to Jerusalem with mercies, but it is "after the glory" that He will come to dwell there (chapter 2: 8 - 13).<a name=17:9></a> The prophecy encourages them by blessing, and promises them the coming of Christ, and the presence of Jehovah at a still future period.<a name=17:10></a> Chapter 8 of the same prophet connects these two things together to encourage the people to walk uprightly; but it will be seen in reading it that the fulfilment is there clearly marked as taking place at the end of the age, the rejection of Christ (chapter 11) becoming the occasion of the judgments that were to fall upon them, and to give occasion, in a still more striking manner, for that sovereign grace which will use the power of the rejected Messiah for the deliverance of His people, when they are utterly ruined in consequence of their sin.<a name=17:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophecy of Malachi, which was uttered after this, declares and denounces the corruption already brought in after the blessing restored in a measure by mercy; and the coming of Jehovah in judgment.<a name=17:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To these remarks it may be added, that neither in Zechariah nor in Haggai does the Lord call the people, My people.<a name=17:13></a> It is said, prophetically, that this shall be the case in the time to come, in the latter days, when Christ shall come to establish His glory.<a name=17:14></a> But the judgment pronounced in Hosea has never been revoked, and there is not one expression used that could gainsay it.<a name=17:15></a>

		The Book of Nehemiah gives us, then, the partial and outward re-establishment of the Jews in the land, without either the throne of God or the throne of David, while waiting for the manifestation of the Messiah, and His coming to seek for the fruit of so much grace; in a word, their restoration, in order that He may be presented to them.<a name=18:1></a> The people are provisionally in the land, on God's part, but under the power of the Gentiles who possess the throne.<a name=18:2></a>

		ESTHER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Nehemiah has shewn us Judah reinstated in the land, but deprived of the presence of God, except as to general blessing, and unacknowledged by God as His people; so that, whatever length of time may elapse, their condition leads us morally up to the moment when the Messiah should be presented to seal up prophecy, to finish the transgression, and to bring in everlasting righteousness.<a name=19:1></a> That book gave us the last word -- until the coming of Christ -- of the history of Israel; and that, in grace and patience on God's part.<a name=19:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Esther shews us the position of Israel, or, to speak more accurately, the position of the Jews, out of their own land, and looked at as under the hand of God, and as the object of His care.<a name=19:3></a> That He still cared for them (which this book proves to us), when they no longer held any position owned by God, and had, on their part, lost all title to His protection, is an extremely touching and important fact in the dealings of God.<a name=19:4></a> If, when His people are in such a state as this, God cannot reveal Himself to them -- which is manifest -- He yet continues to think of them.<a name=19:5></a> God reveals to us here, not an open interposition on His part in favour of His people, which could no longer take place, but that providential care which secured their existence and their preservation in the midst of their enemies.<a name=19:6></a> Those who were in danger were of the captivity of Judah (chapter 2: 5, 6), and of those who had not returned to the land of Canaan.<a name=19:7></a> If this betrays a want of faith and energy on their part, and of affection for the house and city of God, we must see in it so much the greater proof of the absolute and sovereign goodness, absolute and sovereign faithfulness, of that God Himself.<a name=19:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see then in this history, the secret and providential care that God takes of the Jews, when, although maintaining their position, as Jews, they have entirely fallen from all outward relation to Him, are deprived of all the rights of God's people, and are stripped of the promises, in the fulfilment of which, as offered them by the mercy of God at that time in Jerusalem, they take no interest.<a name=19:9></a> Even in this condition God watches over and takes care of them -- a people beloved and blessed in spite of all their unfaithfulness; for the gifts and calling of God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been often remarked that the name of God is not found in the Book of Esther.<a name=20:4></a> This is characteristic.<a name=20:5></a> God does not shew Himself.<a name=20:6></a> But, behind the power and the mistakes of that throne to which the government of the world had fallen, God holds the reins by His providence; He watches over the accomplishment of His purposes and over everything necessary to their fulfilment; and He cares for His people, whatever may be their condition or the power of their enemies.<a name=20:7></a> Happy people!<a name=20:8></a> (compare, as to Israel, <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:20">Jeremiah  31:20</a>).<a name=20:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noticed that faith in the protection of God, and an acknowledgment of it, are to be found even when the dealings of God, with respect to His promises, are not owned.<a name=20:10></a> We are speaking of God's government, and not of salvation.<a name=20:11></a> Salvation is not the question here.<a name=20:12></a> The Gentile reigns and does according to his will, taking at his pleasure one of the daughters of Benjamin for his wife.<a name=20:13></a> Sad condition, indeed, for the people of God!<a name=20:14></a> a position contrary to all divine law, to all faithfulness under other circumstances, but here not leading even to expostulation.<a name=20:15></a> The people of Israel are lost here as to their own state.<a name=20:16></a> But God acts in His sovereignty, and makes use of this sorrowful evidence of their position to preserve them from the destruction with which they were threatened.<a name=20:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nehemiah unfolds the last relationship of God with the people before the coming of the Messiah; a relationship of longsuffering, in which God does not own them as His people; a provisional and imperfect relationship.<a name=20:18></a> Esther teaches us that God watches in sovereignty over the dispersed Jews, and preserves them even without any outward relationship, and that, without revoking any part of the judgment passed upon them, God shelters them without displaying Himself, and consequently by hidden means.<a name=20:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was this that, as a matter of history, had yet to be made known before the public interposition of God at the end, in the Person of Messiah, which prophecy alone could reveal.<a name=20:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This interposition appears to me to be pointed out in the circumstances of this history; vaguely, indeed, yet clearly enough for one who has traced the ways of God, as revealed in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, in the details of this book there is a very interesting point, namely, the providential means which God employed, the opportuneness of the moment at which everything happens -- even to the king's wakefulness, shewing, in the most interesting manner, how the hidden hand of God prepares and directs everything, and how those who seek His will may rely upon Him at all times and under all circumstances, even when deliverance appears impossible, and in spite of all the machinations of the enemy and their apparent success.<a name=21:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The close of the book presents, historically, the great characteristic facts of the dominion of the Gentiles; but one can hardly fail to see in it typically, in the position of Mordecai, the Lord Himself as head of the Jews, in closest connection with the throne that rules over all.<a name=21:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The very circumstances into which this book enters are appropriate.<a name=21:7></a> When an acknowledged relationship subsists, the dealings of God are according to the conduct of those who stand in this relationship; but here there is no such relationship subsisting.<a name=21:8></a> The scene is filled, and rightly filled, with heathen circumstances and heathen manners.<a name=21:9></a> Israel is as lost among them, their conduct does not come forward; but their preservation, where to the eye of man heathenism is everything, and their enemies seemingly all powerful.<a name=21:10></a> This is all in place.<a name=21:11></a> Any other picture would not have been the truth, nor given the true representation of the state of things, nor brought out into their true light the dealings of God.<a name=21:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be easily understood that this book concludes the deeply interesting series of the historical books, which, through the goodness of God, we have been considering, exhibiting -- as far as there has been ability -- their leading features.<a name=21:13></a> May the Spirit, who has enabled us to enjoy that which God has deigned to reveal in them, continue to instruct us while meditating on those books which we have still to examine!<a name=21:14></a>

		In Job we have man put to the test; we might say, with our present knowledge, man renewed by grace, an upright man and righteous in his ways, in order to shew whether he can stand before God in presence of the power of evil, whether he can be righteous in his own person before God.<a name=26:3></a> On the other hand we find the dealings of God, by which He searches the heart and gives it the consciousness of its true state before Him.<a name=26:4></a>

		The Psalms are almost all the expression of the sentiments produced in the hearts of God's people by the events (or I should speak more correctly if I said, prepared for them in the events), through which they pass, and indeed express the feelings, not only of the people of God, but often, as is known, those of the Lord Himself.<a name=33:6></a> They are the expression of the part the Spirit of God takes, as working in their hearts, in the sorrows and exercises of the saints.<a name=33:7></a> The Spirit works in connection with all the trials through which they pass, and the human infirmity which appears in those trials; in the midst of which it gives thoughts of faith and truth which are a provision for them in all that happens.<a name=33:8></a> We find in them consequently the hopes, fears, distress, confidence in God, which respectively fill the minds of the saints -- sometimes the part which the Lord Himself takes personally in them, and that, occasionally, exclusive of all but Himself, the place which He has held that He might so sympathise with them.<a name=33:9></a> Hence a maturer spiritual judgment is required to judge rightly of the true bearing and application of the Psalms than for other parts of scripture; because we must be able to understand what dispensationally gives rise to them, and judge of the true place before God of those whose souls' wants are expressed in them; and this is so much the more difficult as the circumstances, state, and relationship with God, of the people whose feelings they express are not those in which we find ourselves.<a name=33:10></a> The piety they breathe is edifying for every time; the confidence they often

		express in God in the midst of trial has cheered the heart of many a tried servant of God in his own.<a name=34:1></a> This feeling is carefully to be preserved and cherished; yet it is for that very reason so much the more important that our spiritual judgment should recognise the position to which the sentiments contained in the Psalms refer, and which gives form to the piety which is found in them.<a name=34:2></a> Without doing this, the full power of redemption and the force of the gospel of the grace of God is lost for our own souls; and many expressions which have shocked the christian mind, unobservant of their true bearing and application, remain obscure and even unintelligible.<a name=34:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The heart that places itself in the position described in the Psalms returns back to experiences which belong to a legal state, and to one under discipline for failure and trial in that state, and to the hopes of an earthly people.<a name=34:4></a> A legal and, for a Christian, unbelieving state is sanctioned in the mind: we rest content in a spiritual state short of the knowledge of redemption; and while we think to retain the Psalms for ourselves, we keep ourselves in a state of soul in which we are deprived of the intelligence of their true use and our own privileges, and become incapable of the real understanding of, and true delight in, the Psalms themselves; and, what is more we miss the blessed and deeply instructive apprehension of the tender and gracious sympathies of Christ in their true and divinely given application.<a name=34:5></a> The appropriating spirit of selfishness does not learn Christ as He is, as He is revealed, and the loss is really great.<a name=34:6></a> There are comforts and ministrations of grace for a soul under the law in the Psalms, because they apply to those under the law (and souls in that state have been relieved by them); but to use them in order to remain in this state, and to apply them prominently to ourselves, is, I repeat, to misapply the Psalms themselves, lose the power of what is given to us in them, and deprive ourselves of the true spiritual position in which the gospel sets us.<a name=34:7></a> The difference is simple and evident.<a name=34:8></a> Relationship with the Father is not, cannot be introduced in them, and we live out of that if we live in them, though obedience and confiding dependence be ever our right path.<a name=34:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I purpose in this study of the Psalms to examine the book as a whole, and each of the Psalms, so as to give a general idea of it.<a name=34:10></a> The most profitable manner of doing this (though the character of the Book of Psalms renders it more difficult here) will be,

		as I have attempted in the books we have already considered to give the meaning and object of the Spirit of God, leaving the expression of the precious piety which it contains to the heart that alone is capable of estimating it, namely, one that feeds on Jesus through the grace of the Spirit of God.<a name=35:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Psalms, and the workings of the Spirit of God expressed in them, belong properly in their application and true force to the circumstances of Judah and Israel, and are altogether founded on Israel's hopes and fears: and, I add, to the circumstances of Judah and Israel in the last days, though as to the moral state of things those last days began with the rejection of Christ.<a name=35:2></a> The piety and confidence in God with which they are filled find an echo, no doubt, in every believing heart, but this exercise, as expressed here, is in the midst of Israel.<a name=35:3></a> This judgment, of which the truth is evidently demonstrated by the reading of the Psalms themselves, is sanctioned by the Apostle Paul.<a name=35:4></a> He says, after citing the Psalms, "Now we know that whatsoever things the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law".<a name=35:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Psalms then concern Judah and Israel, and the position in which those who belong to Judah and Israel are found.<a name=35:6></a> Their primary character is the expression of the working of the Spirit of Christ as to, or in, the remnant of the Jews(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:35">footnote</a></i>) (or of Israel) in the last days.<a name=35:7></a> He enters into all their sorrows, giving expression to their confessions, their confidence of faith, their hopes, fears, thankfulness for deliverances obtained -- in a word, to every exercise of their hearts in the circumstances in which they find themselves in the last days; so as to afford them the leading, the sanction, and the sympathy of the Spirit of Christ, and utterance to the working of that Spirit in them and even in Christ Himself.<a name=35:8></a> In addition to this, the Psalms present to us the place which Christ Himself when on earth took among them, in order to their having part in His sympathies, and to make their deliverance possible, and their confidence in God righteous, though they had sinned against Him.<a name=35:9></a> They do not

		as the Epistles, reason on the efficacy of His work; but in the Psalms which apply to Him, present His feeling in accomplishing it.<a name=36:1></a> They intimate to us also the place He took in heaven on His rejection, and ultimately on the throne of the kingdom, but, save His present exaltation (which is only mentioned as a fact necessary to introduce, and to give the full character to Israel's ultimate deliverance), all that is revealed of the Lord in this His connection with Israel is expressed, not in narration but in the utterance of His own feelings in regard to the place He is in, as is the case with the remnant themselves.<a name=36:2></a> This feature it is which gives its peculiar character and interest to the Psalms.<a name=36:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They teach us thus that Christ entered into the full depths of suffering which made Him the vessel of sympathising grace with those who had to pass through them -- and that as seeing and pleading with God in respect of them.<a name=36:4></a> In the path of His own humiliation, He got the tongue of the learned to know how to speak a word in season to him that was weary.<a name=36:5></a> They were sinners, could claim no exemption, count on no favour which could deliver and restore.<a name=36:6></a> They must, if He had not suffered for them, have taken the actual sufferings they had to undergo in connection with the guilt which left them in them without favour.<a name=36:7></a> But this was not God's thought; He was minded to deliver them, and Christ steps in in grace.<a name=36:8></a> He takes the guilt of those that should be delivered.<a name=36:9></a> That was vicarious suffering as a substitute.<a name=36:10></a> And He places Himself in the path of perfect obedience and love in the sorrow through which they had to pass.<a name=36:11></a> As obedient, He entered into that sorrow so as to draw down, through the atonement, the efficacy of God's delivering favour on those who should be in it, and be the pledge, in virtue of all this, of their deliverance out of it as standing thus for them, the sustainer of their hope in it, so that they should not fail.<a name=36:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still, they must pass through sorrow, according to the righteous ways of God, in respect of their folly and wickedness, and to purify them inwardly from it.<a name=36:13></a> Into all this sorrow Christ entered, as He also bore their sins, to be a spring of life and sustainer of faith to them in it, when the hand of oppression should be heavy without, and the sense of guilt terrible within and hence no sense of favour, but that One who had assured to them and could convey this favour had taken up their cause with God, and passed through it for them.<a name=36:14></a> The full efficacy
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=37>[Page 37]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		indeed of His work in their deliverance, in that one Man's dying for the nation, will not be known by them till they look on Him whom they have pierced.<a name=37:1></a> They are purposely left (and especially the remnant, because of their integrity; for the rest will join the idolatrous Gentiles for peace' sake) in the depth of trial, which, as ways of God in government, brings them through grace to the sense of their guilt in a broken law and a rejected and crucified Messiah, that they may truly now what each of them is, and bow before an offended Jehovah in integrity of heart, and say, "Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah".<a name=37:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, though the deliverance and a better salvation be not to come till then, still, in virtue of the work wrought to effect it, Christ can sustain and lead on their souls to it; and that is just what is done in these Psalms.<a name=37:3></a> These are His language to, or rather in, their souls when they are in the trouble -- sometimes the record of how He has learned it.<a name=37:4></a> Hence too, souls yet under the law find such personal comfort under them.<a name=37:5></a> Let not any soul, let me remark in passing, suppose that deep heart interest in these sorrows of Christ is lost by passing from under the law to be under grace.<a name=37:6></a> There is immense gain.<a name=37:7></a> The difference is this -- instead of using them merely selfishly (though surely rightly) for my own wants and sorrows, I, when under grace, enter in adoring contemplation and joyful love into all Christ's sorrows, in the deeper competency given by His Spirit dwelling in me.<a name=37:8></a> I go back now in peace, as He is on high, and I trace with divinely given interest and understanding (whatever my measure) all the sorrows through which He passed when here, tracing this "path of life" in love to us across a world of sin and woe, glorifying God in it, through death itself, to the righteous glory in which He now is.<a name=37:9></a> Christ comforted His disciples in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, though not indeed as under law, but He says at the close, "If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go to the Father".<a name=37:10></a> Under law the Psalms may comfort us in profitable distress; under grace we enjoy them as loving Christ and with divine intelligence.<a name=37:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to return.<a name=37:12></a> The great foundation which had to be laid to make sympathy possible was, that Christ did not escape where the remnant of Israel will,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:37">footnote</a></i>) because He must suffer the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=38>[Page 38]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		full penalty of the guilt and evil, or He could not righteously and for God's glory deliver them.<a name=38:1></a> Thus Christ must pass personally fully through the sorrow as He did in spirit; and besides that, make atonement for the guilt.<a name=38:2></a> He passed through it, save in atonement work, near to God; and makes all the grace and favour of God towards Him, all that He found God to be for Him in sorrow, available, through the atonement, to those who should come to be in it, that they might thus have all the mind of God towards them in grace in that case to use when they found themselves in it, even though in darkness.<a name=38:3></a> If it be said, How can they when they have not yet learned that God is for them in the atonement?<a name=38:4></a> These Psalms, entering into every detail, are precisely the means of their doing so according to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50">Isaiah  50</a>, as already referred to.<a name=38:5></a> In truth, many Christians are in this state.<a name=38:6></a> They cling to promise, feel their sins, are comforted by hope, see the goodness of God, use the Psalms as suiting them, and do not know redemption nor peace.<a name=38:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Psalms, then, belong properly to Israel,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:38">footnote</a></i>) and in Israel to the godly remnant.<a name=38:8></a> This is the first general principle, which the word itself establishes for us, as we have seen stated by Paul -- What they say, they say to those under the law.<a name=38:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In examining the Psalms themselves, we shall find other elements of this judgment, which are very clear and positive.<a name=38:10></a> The Psalms distinguish (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>) and commence by distinguishing (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>) the man who is faithful and godly, according to the law, from the rest of the nation.<a name=38:11></a> "The ungodly are not so", nor shall they "stand in the congregation of the righteous".<a name=38:12></a> Indeed, Isaiah teaches the same truth doctrinally just as strongly.<a name=38:13></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:38">footnote</a></i>) Their characteristic subject is the true believing remnant, the righteous in Israel (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:3">Psalm  16:3</a> and many others).<a name=38:14></a> It is, therefore, the portion and hope of Israel
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=39>[Page 39]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which are in view in them.<a name=39:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>this is definitely and distinctly presented.<a name=39:2></a> But it is the hope of a remnant, whose portion is from the commencement distinguished in the most marked way from that of the wicked.<a name=39:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, it is evident (and it is the second general principle I would notice), that it is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of prophecy, which speaks.<a name=39:4></a> That is to say, it is the Spirit of Christ interesting Himself in the condition of the faithful remnant of Israel.<a name=39:5></a> This Spirit speaks of things to come as if they were present, as is always the case with the prophets.<a name=39:6></a> But this does not make it the less true that it is a spirit of prophecy which speaks of the future, and which in this respect often resumes its natural character.<a name=39:7></a> But if the Spirit of Christ is interested in the remnant of Israel, Christ's own sufferings must be announced, which were the complete proof of that interest, and without which it would have been unavailing.<a name=39:8></a> And we find, in fact, the most touching expressions of the sufferings of Christ, not historically, but just as He felt then, expressed as by His own lips at the moment He endured them.<a name=39:9></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:39">footnote</a></i>) It is always the Spirit(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:39">footnote</a></i>) of Christ that speaks, as taking part Himself in the affliction and grief of His people, whether it is by His Spirit in them or Himself for them, as the sole means in presence of the just judgment of God, of delivering a beloved though guilty people.<a name=39:10></a> Hence we see the beautiful fitness of the language of the Psalms in a point I shall touch upon farther on.<a name=39:11></a> In the Psalms which speak properly of atonement Christ is alone, and thus His work is secured.<a name=39:12></a> In those which speak of sufferings not atoning in their nature, even though they go on up to death, parts may be found personally applicable to Christ, because He did personally and individually go through them, but in other parts of the same Psalms the saints also are brought in because they will have a share in them, and thus His personal sufferings are presented to us, but His sympathy too is secured.<a name=39:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another principle connects itself with this, which gives the third great characteristic of the Psalms.<a name=39:14></a> The sins of the people
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=40>[Page 40]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		would morally hinder the remnant's having confidence in God in their distress.<a name=40:1></a> Yet God alone can deliver them, and to Him they must look in integrity of heart.<a name=40:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find both these points brought out: the distresses are laid before God, seeking for deliverance; and integrity is pleaded and the sins confessed at the very same time.<a name=40:3></a> Christ, having come into their sorrows, as we have seen, and made atonement, can lead them in spite of their sins and about their sins, to God.<a name=40:4></a> They do not indeed know at first perhaps the full forgiveness, but they go in the sense of grace as led by Christ's Spirit, (and how many souls are practically in this state!<a name=40:5></a>)(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:40">footnote</a></i>) in expressions provided in these very Psalms, to the God of deliverances, confessing their sins also.<a name=40:6></a> They "take with them words and return to the Lord".<a name=40:7></a> Forgiveness also is presented to them.<a name=40:8></a> The Spirit of Christ being livingly in them (that is, as a principle of life), and fixing the purpose of their heart, they can, through confessing their sin, plead unfeignedly their integrity and fidelity to God.<a name=40:9></a> But the thought of mercy everywhere precedes that of righteousness as their ground of hope.<a name=40:10></a> In substance, all this is true of every renewed soul who has not yet found liberty, the liberty obtained by known redemption.<a name=40:11></a> The Psalms, unless certain praises at the close of the book and the end of some others, are never the expression of this liberty: and even when the expression of it is found, it is that of earthly deliverance or forgiveness.<a name=40:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In sum, then, the Psalms are the expression of the Spirit of Christ, either in the Jewish remnant (or in that of all Israel), or in His own Person as suffering for them, in view of the counsels of God with respect to His elect earthly people.<a name=40:13></a> And since these counsels are to be accomplished more particularly in the latter days, it is the expression of the Spirit of Christ in this remnant in the midst of the events which will take place in those days, when God begins to deal again with His earthly people.<a name=40:14></a> The moral sufferings connected with those events have been more or less verified in the history of Christ on the earth; and whether in His life, or, yet more, in His death, He is linked with the interests and with the fate of this remnant.<a name=40:15></a> In Christ's history, at the time of His baptism by John, He
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		already identified Himself with those that formed this remnant; not with the impenitent multitude of Israel, but with the first movement of the Spirit of God in these "excellent of the earth", which led them to recognise the truth of God in the mouth of John, and to submit to it.<a name=41:1></a> Now it is in this remnant that the promises made to Israel will be accomplished; so that, while only a remnant, their affections and hopes are those of the nation.<a name=41:2></a> On the cross, Jesus remained the only true faithful one before God in Israel -- the personal foundation of the whole remnant that was to be delivered, as well as the accomplisher of that work on which their deliverance could be founded.<a name=41:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are some further general observations on a point to which I have already alluded, which, while in a great measure they are drawn from the Psalms themselves, yet, through the light the Gospels also cast on it, may aid us in seeing the spirit of the whole book, and entering into the purport of many psalms in detail.<a name=41:4></a> I mean the sufferings of Christ.<a name=41:5></a> We have seen in general already that the book brings before us the remnant, its sorrows, hopes, and deliverance, and Christ's association with them in all these.<a name=41:6></a> He has entered into their sorrows, will be their deliverer, and has wrought the atonement which lays the foundation of their deliverance, as it does of the deliverance of any living soul -- but He died for that nation.<a name=41:7></a> Of course His own perfection shines out in this; but here we are to look for its connection with Israel and the earth, though His personal exaltation to heaven be mentioned, from which their final deliverance flows.<a name=41:8></a> We are not, however, to look for the mystery of the assembly, which at this time was hid in God, nor for Christ viewed in His associations with the assembly.<a name=41:9></a> The Psalms furnish most exquisitely all the earthly experiences of Christ and His people which the Spirit of Christ would bring before us.<a name=41:10></a> We must look to the New Testament (as in Philippians, for example, and elsewhere) to find the heavenly ones of those He has redeemed.<a name=41:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christ passed through every kind of moral suffering the human heart can go through, was tempted in all points like as we are, sin apart.<a name=41:12></a> Nor can anything be more fruitful in its place (for it must not be too long dwelt on in itself, and entirely separated from the divine side of His character, or it becomes profitless or hurtful, because really fleshly sentiment), than to have the heart engaged in contemplating the sorrows

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		During His whole life, up even to death itself, He suffered from man for righteousness' sake (see, in connection with this <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#11">Psalm  11</a>and others).<a name=42:15></a> Besides this, on the cross He suffered for sin, drank the cup of wrath for sin, the cup His Father had given Him to drink.<a name=42:16></a> But besides these two kinds of suffering He bore in His soul, at the close of His life (we may say from after the paschal supper), all the distress and affliction under which the Jews will come through the government of God -- not condemnation, but still the consequence of sin.<a name=42:17></a> No doubt He had anticipated, and, so far felt it, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>the coming cross; but now He entered into it.<a name=42:18></a> It was, as to the point we are now on, as He said, apostate Israel's hour then and the power of darkness.<a name=42:19></a> But He was still looking to His Father in the sense of faithfulness.<a name=42:20></a> Nor was He yet forsaken of God.<a name=42:21></a> He could still look to man's watching with Him.<a name=42:22></a> What could watching do when divine wrath was upon Him?<a name=42:23></a> But the distinctive character of these kinds of suffering is clearly seen if we, as

	<div class="paragraph">
		taught of God, weigh the psalms which speak of them respectively.<a name=43:1></a> Thus we shall see that, when He suffers from man, He looks, as speaking by His Spirit in and for Israel, for vengeance on man.<a name=43:2></a> Others too are then often seen to suffer with Him.<a name=43:3></a> When He suffers from God, He is wholly alone, and the consequences are unmingled blessing and grace.<a name=43:4></a> As to suffering from man, we can have the privilege of so suffering, having the fellowship of His sufferings.<a name=43:5></a> In suffering from God as under wrath, He did so that we might never have the least drop whatever of that cup; it would have been our everlasting ruin.<a name=43:6></a> In the sufferings He underwent under Satan's power, and darkness, and death, when not yet actually drinking the cup of wrath, besides what was due to the majesty of God in view of this see <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>), He suffered to sympathise with the Jews in their afflictions, which they come into through their integrity and yet in their sins.<a name=43:7></a> Every awakened soul under the law will find comfort in this.<a name=43:8></a> All these sufferings are entered into in the Psalms as to Christ and as to Israel.<a name=43:9></a> But the Jews passed into utter ruin, and loss of all the promises (save sovereign grace), and the remnant into their place of trial and sorrow as such, by the rejection of Messiah.<a name=43:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be remembered that, though all three principles of suffering are essentially different, and all very clear and important in their character, at the close of Christ's life all coalesced and united in the sorrows of His last hours -- save that I doubt not, in coming out of Gethsemane, the pressure of Satan's power on His spirit had been gone through and was over, but on the cross He suffered from man for righteousness, and from God for sin only.<a name=43:11></a> I am persuaded that this last, when fully on His soul, was too deep to leave it possible for the other or anything else to be much felt.<a name=43:12></a>

		Having made these general observations, which appeared to me necessary to understand the book, we will now examine, with the Lord's help, its contents; and may He indeed guide both myself and my reader in doing it!<a name=43:13></a> If it does depict Christ's sufferings and His interest in His people on earth, it behoves us to search into it reverently, yet with child-like confidence, and to wait -- as indeed we ever should -- upon His teaching, that we may be led and taught in our search.<a name=43:14></a> That which speaks of what He felt should be touched with confiding love, but with holy reverence.<a name=43:15></a>

		The subject of the first book is the state of the Jewish remnant before they have been driven out of Jerusalem, and hence of Christ Himself in connection with this remnant.<a name=44:4></a> We have more indeed of the personal history of Christ in the first than in all the rest.<a name=44:5></a> This will be readily understood, as He was thus going in and out with the remnant, while yet associated with Jerusalem.<a name=44:6></a> I use Jewish here in contradistinction with Israel or the whole nation.<a name=44:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second book, the remnant are viewed as cast out of Jerusalem (Christ, of course, taking this place with them and giving its true place of hope to the remnant in this condition) The introduction of Christ, however, restores them, in the view of prophecy, to their position in relationship with Jehovah as a people before God (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#46">Psalm  46</a>).<a name=44:8></a> Previously, when cast out, they speak of God (Elohim) rather than Jehovah, for they have lost covenant blessings; but by this they learn to know Him much better.<a name=44:9></a> I doubt not, the history of Christ's life afforded occasion to His entering into the practical personal sense of thus condition of the people, though, of course, less historically His place in general.<a name=44:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>the remnant own the nation's (more precisely the Jews') guilt in rejecting Him.<a name=44:11></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:44">footnote</a></i>)

		In the third book we have the deliverance and restoration of Israel as a nation, and God's ways towards them as such (Jerusalem, at the close, being the centre of His blessing and government).<a name=44:12></a> The dreadful effect of their being under the law, and the centring of all mercies in Christ are brought out in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#88">Psalm  88</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89">Psalm  89</a>, closing with the cry for the accomplishing of the latter.<a name=44:13></a> Electing grace in royalty for deliverance, when all was lost, is presented in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>.<a name=44:14></a>

		In the fourth, we have Jehovah at all times the dwelling place of Israel.<a name=45:1></a> Israel is delivered by the coming of Jehovah.<a name=45:2></a> It may, in its main contents, be characterised as the bringing in the Only-begotten into the world.<a name=45:3></a> Jehovah having been always Israel's dwelling-place, they look for His deliverance.<a name=45:4></a> For this the Abrahamic and millennial names of God, Almighty and Most High, are introduced.<a name=45:5></a> And where is He to be found?<a name=45:6></a> Messiah says, "I seek them in Jehovah, the God of Israel".<a name=45:7></a> There He is indeed found.<a name=45:8></a> Thus there will be judgment on the wicked, and the righteous delivered.<a name=45:9></a> The full divine nature of Messiah, once cut off, is brought in to lay the ground for His having a part in the latter-day blessings, though once cut off.<a name=45:10></a> He is the unchangeable living Jehovah, the Creator.<a name=45:11></a> Then comes blessing on Israel, creation, judgment of the heathen, that Israel might enjoy the promises.<a name=45:12></a> But it is the same mercy which has so often spared them.<a name=45:13></a>

		Having spoken of the details of their restoration, through difficulties and dangers, and God's title to the whole land, the wickedness of the antichristian tool of the enemy, the exaltation of Messiah to Jehovah's right hand till His enemies are made His footstool, and the earthly people made willing in the day of His power -- we have then a rehearsal of God's ways, a commentary on the whole condition of Israel and what they have passed through, and the principles on which they stand before God, the law being written in their hearts.<a name=45:15></a>

		As this rapid sketch will have shewn (and the details I shall now enter on will shew more clearly still), there is far more order in the Psalms than is generally supposed by those who take them up as each an isolated ode to serve as the expression of individual piety.<a name=45:17></a> They are not connected, it is true, in one continuous discourse or history, as other parts of scripture may be; but they express in a regular and orderly way distinct parts of the same subject; that is, as we have seen, the state of the remnant of the Jews or Israel in the latter day, their feelings, and Messiah's association with them.<a name=45:18></a> These topics are treated in the most orderly way.<a name=45:19></a> The Spirit of God, who has superintended the structure, as He has inspired the contents of the whole scripture, has stamped the unequivocal traces of His hand on this especial part of it.<a name=45:20></a> Who collected these divine

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have already noticed generally the subject of each of the five books.<a name=46:3></a> The distinction of subject I found in them had led me to divide the whole Book of Psalms in the same way, before my attention had been drawn to the well-known fact of its being so divided in the Hebrew Bible.<a name=46:4></a> But this principle of order is carried out also in the details of each of the books This order in the first book, and the contents of the psalms which compose it, are now to occupy us.<a name=46:5></a> It is, perhaps, the most complete in the general and characteristic view it gives of the subjects treated of in the Psalms, and so far the most interesting.<a name=46:6></a> The others naturally pursue more the details which carry out the general idea thus given.<a name=46:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be remarked that the following principle runs through it, and indeed, more or less, the others when it is applicable some great truth or historical fact is brought forward as to Christ or the remnant, or both, and then a series of psalms follows, expressing the feelings and sentiments of the remnant in connection with that truth or fact.<a name=46:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is extremely important that, on the one hand, some psalms should personally bring before us the Messiah; but it is also important that the moral traits which form the beauty and excellency of His character in God's sight, and the attractive object which God delights to bless, should be brought before us also, that, on the one hand, we may delight in them, and, on the other, the indissoluble moral connection between Christ and the remnant may be brought into view.<a name=47:5></a> This connection of moral character and its display in Christ is very distinctly brought before us in the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount.<a name=47:6></a> There blessing is pronounced on those who exhibit certain moral traits and qualities.<a name=47:7></a> These characterise the remnant; yet, if they be carefully looked into, they will be found to be morally a description of Christ Himself.<a name=47:8></a> Hence it is that we find Him and the remnant so mixed up together in many psalms, while some, as I have said, present distinctively the great foundation of blessing in Himself.<a name=47:9></a> We may apprehend also thus the difference of the associations of Christ with the remnant of Israel and those of the assembly with Him.<a name=47:10></a> Those of the assembly begin when redemption is accomplished, and Christ is already exalted on high.<a name=47:11></a> By the Spirit sent down from heaven the saints are united to Christ there; and their experiences as Christians flow from their position as united to Christ consequent on accomplished redemption, and then in conflict with the world.<a name=47:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Previous to the knowledge of redemption, and for that very reason, saints may now pass through experiences analogous to, and in principle the same as, those of the Psalms, and find, in consequence, great comfort from them; but their own place,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This makes the tone and purport of the Psalms very plain The "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" was on the cross when atoning work, the fruit of grace, was going on.<a name=48:8></a> Judgment on Israel was then suspended, and the Holy Ghost blessedly took this cry up by the mouth of Peter in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:17">Acts  3:17</a>, where the return of Jesus to them (as the children of the prophets, and the people in whom the blessing of the nations was to be) was proposed on their repentance.<a name=48:9></a> This grace was then of no effect; but in the last days all the fruit of that cross and that cry on earth will be made good on earth, when they have repented and looked on Him whom they have pierced.<a name=48:10></a> But this demand (as its final accomplishment will be also) was founded on atoning work, accomplished with God alone, which was based on grace and will bring grace; and not in connection with His sufferings from men, which bring judgment on men, His adversaries.<a name=48:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Psalms constantly present to us this consequence of the wickedness of men against Christ, and the wish of the remnant

		<a name=49>[Page 49]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that it may arrive.<a name=49:1></a> Such a wish will never be found expressed by Christ in the Gospels.<a name=49:2></a> He pronounces prophetic woes on others for hindering those that were entering in; but this is love to these souls.<a name=49:3></a> No call for judgment is found.<a name=49:4></a> In the Psalms, on the other hand, no such passage as "Father forgive them" is found; though the fruit of grace, after His own deliverance from the horns of the unicorns, is most strikingly unfolded.<a name=49:5></a> The gospel was the good news of the visitation of the world and of Israel in love by the Son of God.<a name=49:6></a> The incarnation was Christ entering alone into this path of love towards all.<a name=49:7></a> God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.<a name=49:8></a> Nought else was, nought else could be, revealed and unfolded then.<a name=49:9></a> It was what He was personally in the world.<a name=49:10></a> But the remnant of God's people are to go through these sorrows.<a name=49:11></a> The only possible means of their deliverance was the destruction of their enemies.<a name=49:12></a> We shall go up from the midst of our sorrows to meet the Lord in the air; we have no need to wish our enemies destroyed in order to our deliverance; we have in the gospel to do with grace, with a heavenly Christ that is not passing through sorrows, and with glory.<a name=49:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remnant of Israel therefore call for this execution of judgment on their enemies.<a name=49:14></a> They have to do, not with that heavenly, sovereign, abounding grace which gives us a place with Christ clean out of the world (not of it, as He was not of it who was loved before the world was founded), but with the government of this world.<a name=49:15></a> Objects, no doubt, of grace themselves (and of mere grace, for they have rejected the promises in Christ presented to them in the truth of God, and have been concluded in unbelief that they might be the objects of mercy), still, they are the nation in whom the government of this world centres and in respect of whom it is displayed.<a name=49:16></a> Hence they await judgment, and the display of the righteous exercise of that government, and the cutting off of the oppressor and the wicked.<a name=49:17></a> Hence Christ (who has entered into, and will in spirit enter into, their sorrows, but was Himself cut off instead of seeing His enemies cut off, accomplishing a better and more glorious work) did not then ask for the world, but for those that were His, and that they might be with Him where He was.<a name=49:18></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>marks the formal contrast of the two systems.<a name=49:19></a> He would not call down fire from heaven -- would not execute righteous judgment.<a name=49:20></a> It is intimated indeed in the Sermon on the Mount that He was in the way with Israel (as in John, that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, while passing through the sufferings, He could only prophetically be associated with the desires and aspirations after judgment which will have their righteous place when the time of public divine government of this world and judgment is come.<a name=50:3></a> Hence already in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>this is the place we find Him set in.<a name=50:4></a> All the psalms are constructed in view of that.<a name=50:5></a> Thus the remnant in suffering, calling for judgment, reach back to Him who, though He never sought judgment for Himself, did suffer and will seek judgment for them and execute it-Himself the centre of that centre of earthly government divine.<a name=50:6></a> He is seen by the prophetic Spirit in the same circumstances and the cry for judgment is heard.<a name=50:7></a> But it will be found that, wherever this is the case, as we have remarked, the remnant, other men, are found besides the Lord Himself.<a name=50:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In principle, any suffering Jew might so speak; only, as Christ suffered above all, the terms used in the Psalms, where the demands for vengeance occur, sometimes rise up to circumstances which have been literally true in Him in His sorrow on earth.<a name=50:9></a> But the point of departure of the feeling, and of the whole of what is said, is any godly Jew whatever in the last days.<a name=50:10></a> Into that Christ has entered.<a name=50:11></a> The proper or exclusive personal application to Himself is only true when it is proved by the circumstances and the terms of the passage.<a name=50:12></a> The point of moral departure is always the remnant and their state.<a name=50:13></a> He is merely associated with them in the mind of the prophetic Spirit; though, as to the facts, He entered into deeper sorrow than they all.<a name=50:14></a> Hence the immense importance of first of an seeing the position and necessary thoughts of the remnant in the Psalms.<a name=50:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is merely associated with them and their position in grace; though He must be the centre, and pre-eminent, wherever He is found.<a name=50:16></a> There is no possibility of understanding the Psalms at all otherwise.<a name=50:17></a> All interpretation is false which does not take this principle or truth as its point of departure.<a name=50:18></a> When we get into a prophetic and governmental order, even in the New Testament, we at once find the same demands of vengeance.<a name=50:19></a> It is judgment, and not grace.<a name=50:20></a> The souls under the altar in the Revelation desire that their blood may be avenged; and the holy apostles and prophets are called to rejoice over the destruction of Babylon.<a name=50:21></a>

		This important principle then is to be laid down, that, in every psalm in which the godly remnant can have a part, that is, where the Person of Christ is not the direct subject (we have seen there are some, as <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102">Psalm  102</a>, and others, which speak personally of Christ), the whole is not to be applied to Christ, nor the psalm itself, in general, primarily.<a name=51:1></a> It belongs to the condition of the remnant, and speaks of it; and the principle of God's dealings with them through Christ is often given as the great example of the sorrow of the suffering godly.<a name=51:2></a> And hence, in the circumstances it refers to, it may rise up to such as literally depict those through which Christ has passed, so as to shew the way in which Christ has entered into their circumstances.<a name=51:3></a> This last may be evidently the most important part of the psalm.<a name=51:4></a> But this does not change the principle.<a name=51:5></a> There may be psalms where the remnant are introduced collaterally as objects of blessing in result, but where a particular part may be evidently applicable to Christ, who only procures that result.<a name=51:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>has a distinct and peculiar character, because there Christ, while speaking of sufferings common in kind, though not in degree, to Him and the remnant, yet, as in them already, passes into that in which He was entirely alone.<a name=51:7></a> Indeed, the bringing these out in contrast is the very subject of the psalm.<a name=51:8></a> The godly have been, the remnant will be, in suffering.<a name=51:9></a> But the godly were delivered when they cried, so will the remnant; but Christ, perfect in the fullest sorrow, was not.<a name=51:10></a> So that Christ is really alone here; though, in order to shew the contrast of this suffering with others in which saints could be, and had been, this last character of suffering is mentioned.<a name=51:11></a> The fact already mentioned (that, in the psalms expressive of the godly man's suffering from men, there is always the call for vengeance on the part of the speaker, and that in Christ's life -- as the Gospels give it to us, that is, according to truth as personally come into the world, and standing as a witness alone in the world -- He never does so, but the contrary when on the cross, and in His life-time forbids it, reproaching the disciples with not knowing what manner of spirit they were of) evidently has the most important influence on our judgment, how far and in what way we find the living historical Christ in the Psalms as a direct object.<a name=51:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark here, in confirmation of previously expressed judgments, that the righteous man, Messiah, according to the counsels of God, but rejected (with the consequent sorrows of the remnant into which He thus enters), and in result glorified as Son of man, and set over all the works of God's hands, having been brought before us in the first eight psalms, we find ourselves at once (when entering on the historical detail of circumstances) in the last days, the righteous remnant being under the oppression of the wicked and the heathen.<a name=64:5></a> Messiah, in Spirit, in the oppressed remnant, owns the righteousness of Jehovah, in judgment, sitting on the throne judging right.<a name=64:6></a>

		To turn now to the psalms before us: <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#9">Psalm  9</a>presents to us Jehovah, the Most High (the names of God which connect themselves with the Jews, and the millennial accomplishment of the promises made to Abraham), delivering the people by judgment from the oppression of the heathen, and destroying the wicked.<a name=65:6></a> The delivered Jew celebrates this goodness which has maintained the right and cause of the righteous.<a name=65:7></a> The Spirit of Christ speaks fully in this, as having taken up their interests.<a name=65:8></a> It is really His right.<a name=65:9></a> If the Jew has any, it is through Him.<a name=65:10></a> If they say it, He has put the words in their mouth.<a name=65:11></a> Indeed, if Christ had not entered into their sorrow, and given them these words, they could not have said, My right.<a name=65:12></a>

		Another point is brought out also.<a name=66:18></a> Jehovah dwells in Zion as thus revealing Himself.<a name=66:19></a> His doings, what He does for the display of His name through judgment in favour of the remnant, are to be declared among the peoples(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:66">footnote</a></i>) -- another word than that often used, and signifying, I apprehend, the peoples that He owns -- that they may be able thus to trust in Him.<a name=66:20></a> He is returned thus to Zion at the close.<a name=66:21></a> Verses 13, 14, are the cry of the remnant, and on the ground of mercy, that their hearts may praise Jehovah in Zion, as well as because of His judgments; verse 15 celebrates the judgment; and the moral, so to speak, is told in verse 16.<a name=66:22></a> Jehovah is known by the judgment which He executes.<a name=66:23></a> The way in which this psalm serves as a preface for understanding the scope of the book, and its application to the last days, is evident.<a name=66:24></a> Once seized, it largely helps in the intelligence of the whole book.<a name=66:25></a> In verse 17 the wicked,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:66">footnote</a></i>) be

		The body of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#10">Psalm  10</a>depicts the state of things in the last days, until Jehovah arises to judgment, and more especially the character of the wicked, for he is known by his character, and is especially to be found in the Jew.<a name=67:7></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40">Isaiah  40</a>- 48 and 49 - 58: in the one passage, the question being particularly idolatry and Babylon; in the second, the rejection of Messiah (the two capital sins which bring the Jews to judgment -- Jehovah, and His Anointed).<a name=67:8></a> The wicked in his pride acts upon that which is seen; as the righteous by faith on the character of Jehovah, faith in Him.<a name=67:9></a> The wicked boasts himself in his heart's desire, and blesses him (counts him happy, that is) whom Jehovah abhors.<a name=67:10></a> He pursues his plans without conscience, seeking to destroy the humble by craft, and reckons that God has forgotten him.<a name=67:11></a> How well Christ could help them here!<a name=67:12></a> The humble cry under the oppression.<a name=67:13></a> Why does Jehovah stand afar off, and hide Himself in the time of trouble?<a name=67:14></a>

		One or two remarks are required on both psalms.<a name=68:5></a> There are two parties, and in a certain sense three, besides the poor humbled remnant who wait upon God: the heathen (Goim), strangers to Israel, who oppress them, enemies of God; and the wicked, then more especially among the Jews, as we have seen.<a name=68:6></a> I have said three, because the wicked are spoken of in a double way.<a name=68:7></a> In general, indeed exclusively so in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#10">Psalm  10</a>and each time it is used in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#9">Psalm  9</a>, except verse 17, it is in the singular.<a name=68:8></a> In verse 17 it is plural, to shew that all of them will be cast down into sheol.<a name=68:9></a> In the singular it is, I judge, characteristic; yet I doubt not, there will be one special wicked one The Lawless One, <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:8">2 Thessalonians  2:8</a>; the Antichrist, but known here certainly by his character, not by a distinct prophecy of his person.<a name=68:10></a> The lawlessness is manifested, but not The Lawless One, and it is not confined to one.<a name=68:11></a> The analogy of this, with the circumstances in which Christ was in His rejection on earth, is very plain, as is the case with all the forms of wickedness.<a name=68:12></a> The very Trinity is imitated in mischief in the Apocalypse.<a name=68:13></a> There is the city of corruption, as the bride of Christ; and so on.<a name=68:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Up to this, save as the Messiah of God's counsels was brought out in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, the righteous man was given characteristically, and here it was necessary to characterise the whole party opposed to Jehovah and His Christ, though one may be the concentrated expression of this character.<a name=68:15></a> The remnant were to judge by this character morally.<a name=68:16></a> Next, remark, these wicked ones are judged with the heathen; they all come together under the same judgment.<a name=68:17></a> The wicked shall be turned into "sheol", and all the heathen who forget God.<a name=68:18></a> So verse 5: "Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked".<a name=68:19></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#9">Psalm  9</a>is, as we have seen, the general view of Jehovah's intervention in judgment.<a name=68:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#10">Psalm  10</a>we have particularly the position of the sorrow and trial of the remnant within.<a name=68:21></a> Hence we find the wicked (man), not the heathen until on the execution of judgment they are found

		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#15">Psalm  15</a>gives the answer -- he in whom is uprightness of heart in the path of the law.<a name=71:2></a> Remark here, that while the godly (when all is utterly dark, and wickedness has entirely the upper hand, and the foundations of human earthly hope, even in the things that belong to God on the earth, are destroyed, and wickedness is in the place of righteousness) look above and see God's throne immutable in heaven, and thus all in heaven and earth brought into connection; yet, as to the point they look to, it is Jehovah in His holy temple and deliverance coming out of Zion; and so it will (see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#66:6">Isaiah  66:6</a>).<a name=71:3></a> The immutable throne in heaven will establish in sure power the long desolate throne upon the earth.<a name=71:4></a> Jehovah will be in His temple, but will reign in the Person of Christ in Zion.<a name=71:5></a> This is Jewish deliverance and according to just Jewish hopes.<a name=71:6></a>

		There is one important general remark to make here -- the sense of full relationship with Jehovah is enjoyed.<a name=71:7></a> Whatever the trial, whatever the condition of the remnant, the wickedness of the people, the oppression of the Gentiles in the land, the faith of the remnant contemplates its relationship with Jehovah.<a name=71:8></a> And hence Jehovah is viewed as in His holy temple, though there is as yet no manifestation of His power.<a name=71:9></a> We have not, therefore, the remnant as yet entirely cast out, nor is the power of Antichrist here contemplated as manifested.<a name=71:10></a> When he sets up his power, there will be open apostasy, and the faithful will be driven out.<a name=71:11></a> But the wicked and the Gentile, as such, in the land, are contemplated.<a name=71:12></a> We learn clearly from this psalm (11) that the wicked is characteristic.<a name=71:13></a> It is plural, except verse 5 where it is in contrast with the righteous.<a name=71:14></a>

		These psalms, passing over the driving out from Jerusalem, go on in hope to another scene -- the deliverance wrought by Jehovah when He is indeed returned to Jerusalem; not the destruction of Antichrist by the Lord coming from heaven, but the driving out of the Gentile oppressors by Jehovah established in Zion.<a name=71:15></a> Hence all Israel is brought in (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#14:7">Psalm  14:7</a>).<a name=71:16></a> And their salvation comes out of Zion.<a name=71:17></a> Hence these psalms, as far as they refer to Christ, look at the time in which He walked on earth before His final rejection.<a name=71:18></a> They do not, save <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, directly refer to Him, but to the remnant.<a name=71:19></a> But in His public path on earth, He did, from His baptism by

		These psalms present to us the state of the remnant while still having their place among the nations who have not yet openly broken, in apostasy, with Jehovah, but whose wickedness is in fact shewing itself, and ripening to its highest pitch.<a name=72:2></a> And they pass over, in faith, to the time when Jehovah, seated in Zion, delivers His people, casting all the Gentiles out of His land, all Israel being restored from their captivity.<a name=72:3></a> The whole latter-day scene, except the last half-week of Antichrist's power, is before us.<a name=72:4></a> Jehovah is still in His place, as publicly owned.<a name=72:5></a> It was just thus in the Lord's days.<a name=72:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#14:5">Psalm  14:5</a>, Elohim is spoken of, because it is not relationship which is there in question, but God Himself in His nature and character.<a name=72:7></a> Not man, or anything human, or even Satan's power, was there; but God was in the generation of the righteous.<a name=72:8></a>

		With <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>we begin a very important series of psalms-those in which the connection of Christ Himself with the remnant is brought before us by the divine Spirit.<a name=72:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, Christ takes formally His place among the remnant.<a name=72:10></a> It is quoted by the apostle Peter to prove His resurrection, and the principle of it is referred to in the epistle to the Hebrews to shew His participation in human nature.<a name=72:11></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:72">footnote</a></i>) After examining many critical authorities, I adhere to the English translation of the second verse.<a name=72:12></a> The third leaves the sense obscure, from not changing the preposition.<a name=72:13></a> "But to the saints" answers to "said unto the Lord", not to "extendeth not to thee".<a name=72:14></a> He says to the Lord, "My goodness .<a name=72:15></a>.<a name=72:16></a>.<a name=72:17></a> to the saints, .<a name=72:18></a>.<a name=72:19></a>.<a name=72:20></a> in them is all my delight".<a name=72:21></a> Thus this psalm has a most important and deeply interesting place.<a name=72:22></a> It is Christ taking His place in grace amongst the poor remnant of Israel -- of the servant to tread the path of life which none as in flesh had found in this world, and that leading through death to beyond it, where there was fulness of joy.<a name=72:23></a> He takes the place of dependence, of trust, not of divine equality.<a name=72:24></a> And He who says He does not, must have had title to do so, or need not have said it.<a name=72:25></a> He was taking another place.<a name=72:26></a> He takes the place of servant, and calls Jehovah His Lord.<a name=72:27></a> Nor was this all.<a name=72:28></a> He takes a place, however alone He might be in perfection and perfect in doing it, with the saints on earth.<a name=72:29></a> And this He does, not

	<div class="paragraph">
		Note further, it is not with the heavenly saints He associates Himself, nor are those of whom He speaks here united to Him in heaven, but He associated with them.<a name=73:4></a> Some may go to heaven by that path of life of which He has Himself left the track, but His association with them, and theirs with Him, is under the title of the excellent of the earth.<a name=73:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We may further remark, that the whole psalm breathes this spirit, and takes this place, of dependence, so precious for the poor remnant.<a name=73:6></a> It is not, Destroy this temple and I will raise it up in three days -- that was taking a divine place.<a name=73:7></a> His body was a temple; He raised it up Himself.<a name=73:8></a> Here He leans as man on Jehovah -- in both perfect.<a name=73:9></a> "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption".<a name=73:10></a> Let us now consider the contents of this psalm in more detailed order.<a name=73:11></a> We have already noticed the first verses; but the principles are of the last importance, as presenting Christ taking this place, so that I return to them.<a name=73:12></a>

		Messiah looks as man to God to preserve Him.<a name=73:13></a> He takes the place of man.<a name=73:14></a> It is not merely a Jew already there calling on Jehovah, but a man with God.<a name=73:15></a> He puts His trust in Him.<a name=73:16></a> The principle of trust Paul alleges in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>as a witness that Messiah was the true man.<a name=73:17></a> Next, He takes the place of a servant.<a name=73:18></a> He says to Jehovah -- for now He takes His place before Him -- "Thou art my Adon, my Lord".<a name=73:19></a> This is a definite and distinct place.<a name=73:20></a> He moreover takes His place, not in divine goodness towards others, but before God in a man's place.<a name=73:21></a> My goodness, He says, extendeth not to thee.<a name=73:22></a> Thus He said to the young man who came to Him, "Why callest thou me good?<a name=73:23></a> there is none good but one, that is God".<a name=73:24></a> But though in truth alone, looked at in His relationship to man, for all were sinners, He takes His place with the remnant, the excellent of the earth.<a name=73:25></a> This He did historically, when He went to the baptism of John Baptist, with those whom the Spirit led to God in the holy path of repentance.<a name=73:26></a> They went first there.<a name=73:27></a> He associates Himself with them in grace.<a name=73:28></a> Still, we look on to the full result in the last days even here.<a name=73:29></a> He will not hear of any God but Jehovah.<a name=73:30></a> The sorrows of those who did should be multiplied.<a name=73:31></a> Jehovah Himself was His portion, and He maintained Him in the sure enjoyment of that which He was to enjoy in the purpose of God, and pleasant was the

		This psalm presents us also with a direct scriptural proof and illustration of a most essentially important principle as to the nature of all the psalms, giving a key to their general character and form.<a name=79:8></a> We know from the book of Samuel that the occasion of this psalm was the celebration of David's deliverances from the hand of Saul and of all his enemies.<a name=79:9></a> But it is evident that the language of the psalm in no way stops short at any events in the life of David, or that in its main purport the Spirit of God contemplates even what happened to that already anointed sufferer, who was the occasion of the psalm.<a name=79:10></a> The Spirit of God takes up the circumstance which has present personal interest for him whom He uses as prophet merely, as the occasion to bring out the larger and wider scene of which Christ alone can be the centre, giving a meaning to the whole, in respect of which the more immediate circumstance only forms a partial, though perhaps a most interesting, link in the chain which leads up to the full display of God and His ways in the great result.<a name=79:11></a> So it was with all the prophets, only here more personally predictive.<a name=79:12></a> Sennacherib's invasion, for example, is the occasion of bringing on the scene the Assyrian of the latter days.<a name=79:13></a> Thus prophecies had an application of the deepest interest at the time and became the instrument of

		In the Psalms the writer and immediate occasion sometimes almost wholly disappear, are never the main object, but are not to be lost sight of in the expressions used as the utterance of personal feeling, and which are not the revelation of objective facts.<a name=80:5></a> In the latter case the circumstances of the writer have little application.<a name=80:6></a> The Psalms necessarily bring in the speaker more, though believers find that the Holy Ghost used the speaker's feeling to provide for the hearts of others, yet commanded and wrought in them, and led the writer by His power far beyond anything that the occasion would have suggested to his own mind.<a name=80:7></a> The feeling, in its nature suited to the event which might give rise to the psalm, was only the occasion of the Holy Ghost taking the writer up to provide a divine record to guide feelings in future days, or to reveal those of Christ as taking up the cause of His people.<a name=80:8></a> They may be those of the speaker too, as in simple piety was often the case; but in all cases it was the Spirit's provision for future days, or a prophecy relating to Christ Himself and the part He takes in those dealings of God with Israel, and going on, looking at the book as a whole, to the full and undisguised celebration of the results.<a name=80:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The psalm, as we have said, takes in the whole history of Israel, and speaks as in the time when deliverance from the pressure of hostile power is already accomplished.<a name=80:10></a> But it celebrates especially Jehovah Himself the Deliverer, and still declares the speaker's dependence on Him.<a name=80:11></a> This is the thesis of the psalm.<a name=80:12></a> It then, as is the usual form of the Psalms, goes through all the circumstances which lead the soul up to what is celebrated in the first verse or verses.<a name=80:13></a> Christ is seen, the sorrows of death compassing Him and floods of ungodly men besetting Him, the sorrows of hades upon Him and the cords of death about His soul.<a name=80:14></a> I have no doubt the letter of this was the expression of what David had felt, as indeed verse 50 shews.<a name=80:15></a> Still, as I have said, this was merely the occasion.<a name=80:16></a> The substance of it applies to Christ.<a name=80:17></a> He passes in His mind, as

		in Gethsemane, through the sorrows of death.<a name=81:1></a> This is the groundwork laid for all the rest.<a name=81:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is dependence and entreaty.<a name=81:3></a> In His distress He calls upon Jehovah and cries to His God.<a name=81:4></a> He hears Him as in the midst of Israel, His cry comes before Him Now comes the results.<a name=81:5></a> Christ but represented Israel here, for we have nothing to do with the assembly here.<a name=81:6></a> From verse 7 - 16 we have the deliverance of Israel from Egypt by the mighty acts of Jehovah.<a name=81:7></a> But these were not all Israel's difficulties The power of his enemies was to be annulled, who were stronger than he as regards flesh.<a name=81:8></a> This also was accomplished, and he was brought into a wealthy place.<a name=81:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this introduces another principle -- the righteousness in which God delighted; and which, while found absolutely and perfectly only in Christ as a living man, yet characterises the remnant of Israel in whose hearts the delight in God's law is written.<a name=81:10></a> This principle is brought out from the latter part of verses 19 - 26.<a name=81:11></a> Christ is the foundation of this, but it is as entering into the condition and sorrows of His people.<a name=81:12></a> He is the Israel in spirit; and hence, while all the value of His perfectness is before God for them, the perfectness of that One whose whole life, as identified with the remnant, was well-pleasing to Him, yet we must take the place and state of the remnant, as of David himself.<a name=81:13></a> For, though Christ entered into this place of the remnant in His own perfectness, to give the value of that perfectness to them before God, as agreeable in His sight, yet the state of those to whom it was to be applied is that which is substantially before us in the psalm.<a name=81:14></a> Hence we find, "I kept myself from mine iniquity".<a name=81:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is most important in judging of the literal use of the Psalms.<a name=81:16></a> Christ could have said, "from iniquity"; but personally, "from mine iniquity", He could not.<a name=81:17></a> But the Spirit of godliness (of Christ) in the remnant thus working guards them from following the flesh.<a name=81:18></a> They own, that if Israel goes astray (and so they did all but universally in principle), this wickedness was theirs, in themselves; but they were kept from it.<a name=81:19></a> Now this is truth in the inward parts -- just what God wants.<a name=81:20></a> It is the government of God which we have here distinctly brought out in its unchangeable principle (verse 25, 26).<a name=81:21></a> Now Christ, having taken up their cause, as associated with them, with these "excellent of the earth", all the value of what awakened God's delight in Him, and which, by grace, animated

		them, was their place of acceptance before God, though the atonement was the final ground of it.<a name=82:1></a> But in their case this integrity and divine inward nature were shewn in keeping themselves from their natural course.<a name=82:2></a> But there was another part of this government, tender care of the afflicted ones, saving them and bringing down all man's pride (verse 27).<a name=82:3></a> In darkness there would be light.<a name=82:4></a> To the righteous there arises light in the darkness.<a name=82:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another scene dawns on us -- the coming in of power in their behalf.<a name=82:6></a> And, as Christ had taken the sorrow at the beginning, and then we had the remnant in their own condition, yet Christ not separated from them in the way of interest and association (for it is not union here, that is the assembly's portion), so here He must take the power in Person too; just as in Mark He was engaged in the sowing and engaged in the harvest, all the intermediate time going on without His personal intervention or seeming care, though the crop was always His.<a name=82:7></a> God's word had stood good all through, and Jehovah Himself was a buckler to those that trusted in Him.<a name=82:8></a> But now He gives strength and victory to His anointed for Israel from verse 29 to the end.<a name=82:9></a> Doubtless the language is that of David, but it is substantially the introduction of the kingdom of Christ.<a name=82:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A very few remarks will suffice to give the details, this general character of the latter part of the psalm being seized.<a name=82:11></a> The general strain is resistless victory.<a name=82:12></a> But in verse 43 there are particulars to be noted.<a name=82:13></a> Three classes of persons are here introduced: the people -- He is delivered from their strivings; the heathen -- He is made their head; then a people, not before known with which He had not been in relation as in Israel, shall serve Him.<a name=82:14></a> That is, Messiah delivered from the strivings and revoltings of ungodly Jews; made the head of the heathen; and then a people hitherto strangers should serve Him -- become now a people to Him.<a name=82:15></a> Submission will be immediate, so evident is His glory and power now.<a name=82:16></a> And even where there is no sincerity, or at least no proof of it, they will at once serve, bowing down to Him.<a name=82:17></a> This is the introduction of what is millennial.<a name=82:18></a> Here Jehovah is again recognised.<a name=82:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We return, so to speak, to the original thesis of the psalm, having arrived with Israel, or the Jews at least, across all the difficulties of the way.<a name=82:20></a> I do not see the Antichrist here.<a name=82:21></a> The only word which might seem to speak of him is in verse 48 -- the man of violence; but I apprehend it is an enemy from

		We now come (it is just the same order of thought in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>) to the testimonies given in the world or to Israel.<a name=83:9></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>gives us two: the creation, particularly that in the heavens, which is above man and has not been corrupted by him (this a testimony to God as such).<a name=83:10></a> Then the law (verse 7).<a name=83:11></a> This is the law of Jehovah.<a name=83:12></a> Here, in lowliness, the godly Jew takes two views of sin.<a name=83:13></a> First, he cannot tell his: so much lies hidden from him.<a name=83:14></a> Here he desires to be cleansed.<a name=83:15></a> Secondly, presumptuous sins: from these he desires to be kept.<a name=83:16></a> Thus he would be kept from any falling away from Jehovah.<a name=83:17></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#20">Psalm  20</a>we have, in the midst of sorrows and evil come in as regards the two preceding testimonies, the faithful witness, the living witness Himself.<a name=83:18></a> He is seen in the day of His distress, for He is come down into the midst of an ungodly people.<a name=83:19></a> The remnant is prophetically designated by the fact that they in heart enter into His distress, assured that Jehovah will hear His Anointed.<a name=83:20></a>

		Conscience then characterises the remnant, truth in the inward parts in presence of the law, and taking that law spiritually; interest of heart in Messiah, when He is the despised and rejected of men.<a name=83:21></a> Still we are in Israel, and the help is sought from the God of Israel, and still as dwelling amongst them, having His sanctuary there.<a name=83:22></a>

		I have already remarked an infinitely important characteristic of this psalm, so opposed to those which speak of Christ's suffering from man: I mean that all is grace -- no word of judgment.<a name=89:11></a> Who was to be judged, when God had been the One to inflict the suffering -- the hiding of whose face rather was the suffering -- and the men who had a part in it, believing, had their sins put away by it?<a name=89:12></a> It was as to them the judgment, and the judgment executed and passed.<a name=89:13></a> Hence what follows is the wide out-spreading of wave beyond wave of blessing and nought else.<a name=89:14></a> We may remark, however, that the blessing here is all on earth: so much does the Lord confine Himself to Israel and the Jews in the Psalms.<a name=89:15></a> And though we have seen His own resurrection, and we shall see His ascension brought in, and the path of life thus opened up to faith into the presence of God Himself, yet the heavenly place for the saints is not unfolded.<a name=89:16></a> We know well that the truths on which the blessing is based carry us farther; but the psalm does not speak of them.<a name=89:17></a>

		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#107">Psalm  107</a>is a kind of heading or introduction to all this.<a name=164:4></a> It celebrates the enduring of God's mercy for ever -- that blessed formula of faith -- in the unchanging goodness of Jehovah in all ages from the display of grace in David's time.<a name=164:5></a> It is restored Israel's part especially to chant it.<a name=164:6></a> The psalm celebrates the two parts of that deliverance in which the mercy has been shewn.<a name=164:7></a> They are redeemed from the hand of the enemy; they are gathered back from east, west, north, and south.<a name=164:8></a> This is the double character of the restoration of Israel -- deliverance in the land, and the gathering from amongst the heathen on every side.<a name=164:9></a> But the proper theme of the psalm is the goodness of Jehovah.<a name=164:10></a> The various circumstances of deliverance of every kind (and that as an answer to the cry of distress of man who has brought himself low by his folly) are gone through, with the desire that men would praise Jehovah for His goodness, His wonderful works for the children of men.<a name=164:11></a> Israel is he in whom it may be fully learnt.<a name=164:12></a> It goes on to their chastisement in the land after their return, but adds the complete ruin of the pride of men as the result.<a name=164:13></a> He pours contempt on princes, and sets the poor on high from affliction, giving him families like a flock.<a name=164:14></a> The great result of God's government is then shewn: the righteous rejoice; all iniquity has its mouth stopped.<a name=164:15></a> Whoso is wise and will consider these ways of God will understand the lovingkindness of Jehovah.<a name=164:16></a> It is to be remarked how entirely the goodness of God, here rehearsed, is shewn in temporal things.<a name=164:17></a> It does not for that cease to be His goodness and to have its sweetness, but it gives very clearly the character of the ground on which these teachings go.<a name=164:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be remarked here that the general character of this, as indeed of the previous book, as far as regards the position of Israel, is that of the people being restored by God to the land and delivered, but not free yet from attack, nor in possession of all the promised land; so that there is thanksgiving and praise, for God has interfered, and the state of Israel is changed; but there remains the need of help and securing against enemies yet undestroyed, and the full blessing of God in peace.<a name=165:4></a> A very few psalms at the end are of unmingled praise, and only praise called for.<a name=165:5></a> This state of deliverance, and yet full security waited for, is expressed at the end of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#107">Psalm  107</a>; as to final deliverance, the fact only is stated.<a name=165:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection of the two parts of this psalm is not without interest.<a name=165:7></a> The first part praises Jehovah for what He is as known to the heart in faith; but God in contrast with man.<a name=165:8></a> His mercy is great above the heavens and His truth reaches to the clouds, mercy being as ever first as the root of all.<a name=165:9></a> The second part begins with looking for Jehovah to rise up as God above the heavens and His glory above all the earth.<a name=165:10></a> He is to take His place and vindicate His name as God, that His beloved may be delivered.<a name=165:11></a> Verse 7 brings out the answer of God, taking up in detail all Israel's rights as His.<a name=165:12></a> Thus Jehovah has war with the nations possessing their land, but it is in Israel, and through God they will do valiantly.<a name=165:13></a> Hence here it is God, not Jehovah, because it is not the covenant relation, but what He, who is so, is in contrast with man whose help is vain.<a name=165:14></a>

		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>is in general the law written in the heart.<a name=171:6></a> This gives it an important place in the series of psalms.<a name=171:7></a> It is found distinctly connected too with Israel's sorrows in the last days and their previous departure from God.<a name=171:8></a> The different divisions of the psalm shew, I think, each a different phase of the exercises of heart connected with the law being written on it, though the general principle runs of course through it.<a name=171:9></a> I will very briefly notice the main bearing of each.<a name=171:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first part presents to us naturally the great general principle.<a name=171:11></a> It is the third general "Blessed is the man" -- the return of the soul in trial and distress to the great truth of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>, where the effect is seen under the immediate government of God.<a name=171:12></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32">Psalm  32</a>gives the blessedness of forgiveness; this, of the walk with God on the return of the wanderer in spite of all difficulties and contempt.<a name=171:13></a> We have indeed another special blessing at the end of the first book, where Christ is so fully brought in.<a name=171:14></a> In the last psalm of that book he is pronounced blessed who understands His position, be it in Himself or in those who walk in His footsteps; for the first psalm supposed blessedness under the government of God, making good all His will towards the just, and the reverse seemed to be true.<a name=171:15></a> In fact, as we know, to man's eye this wholly failed (bringing in a heavenly and divine righteousness and redemption).<a name=171:16></a> Hence true blessedness was shewn in discerning, in understanding, the position in which that true blessed One was as rejected by men -- that true poor man -- taking Himself practically the place He describes as blessed, as we have seen

		in the sermon on the mount, while the great truth of the law in the heart is laid down.<a name=172:1></a> Yet the circumstances also come out in this first part -- "forsake me not utterly".<a name=172:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly the word associates with God.<a name=172:3></a> Not only is one blessed who keeps it, but it is cleansing: the desire of the heart is positively fixed on it (see the connection of Jehovah and His word, verse 10, 11).<a name=172:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third part we find very distinctly the leaning on divine mercy in trial, connected with the law in the heart.<a name=172:5></a> The godly Israelite looks to Jehovah's bountiful dealing, but with a view to hearty obedience (verse 17).<a name=172:6></a> Verse 19 shews his state; verse 21, as we have seen in all this book, Jehovah's intervention, already known in deliverance, though not in complete blessing; verses 22, 23, the contempt the poor remnant undergo.<a name=172:7></a> Jehovah's law had been his delight and comfort under it.<a name=172:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the fourth part the trial is more inward.<a name=172:9></a> His soul is cleaving to the dust, but he looks to divine relief according to the word.<a name=172:10></a> His desire looks to the effect of that living water from God.<a name=172:11></a> He has been open before God -- has declared his own ways: so it ever is.<a name=172:12></a> He desires all way of evil to be removed by God from him.<a name=172:13></a> He has held fast by the word -- looks that God should not put him to shame.<a name=172:14></a> But he is looking for enlargement of heart, that he may run freely in God's ways.<a name=172:15></a> Such is the sure effect when under the discipline of God.<a name=172:16></a> A soul who has found delight in His will and holiness is yet looking to run in liberty.<a name=172:17></a> Though in the heart, the word here referred to is more of an outwardly expressed will, like Zacharias and Elizabeth, a beautiful moral expression of the remnant.<a name=172:18></a> With the Christian it will be more absolute and inward, more holiness than testimonies (though it may begin by them perhaps), whether in his first divine calling or under discipline.<a name=172:19></a> It is for him walking in the light as God is in the light -- not the "ordinances and commandments of Jehovah".<a name=172:20></a> Yet it is in principle essentially the same.<a name=172:21></a> To apply this psalm directly is to lower the divine standard of thought for the saint now.<a name=172:22></a> But the nature of the moral exercise may be most instructively used; just as subjection and confidence in trial is always right, though the forms of it in the Jew are wholly below the Christian's (compare with this Philippians, where we have christian experience).<a name=172:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ninth brings out the circumstances of the psalm.<a name=173:11></a> In the comfort of the last part he can look with God's eye and mind at these circumstances.<a name=173:12></a> These are much before our view (that is, feelings about them) in this part of the psalm.<a name=173:13></a> Jehovah has already dealt well with him according to His word, and he looks for divine teaching to understand the mind of God well.<a name=173:14></a> He had been under discipline: but before this he had gone astray, but now had got into the spirit and path of obedience.<a name=173:15></a> He sees the proud lying against him, and their heart fat as grease (no link in state or obedience with Jehovah); and sees how good it was to have been afflicted, that he might learn Jehovah's statutes.<a name=173:16></a> Nothing marks more the setting right of the soul than this -- the turning to Jehovah's will -- "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=173:17></a>" -- and counting all good that leads to this, and gives God's will as authority, and morally its place in the heart.<a name=173:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The tenth part has two main thoughts.<a name=173:19></a> Jehovah is his Creator -- has formed him.<a name=173:20></a> He looks to Him to guide His own poor creature as a faithful Creator.<a name=173:21></a> Those that fear Jehovah will be glad when they see Him, because they hope in His word.<a name=173:22></a> Secondly, he knows that thus in very faithfulness He has caused him to be afflicted, and now looks for mercies to come unto him, and the proud to be ashamed, and that those that fear Jehovah may turn to him.<a name=173:23></a> All this is linked with soundness in Jehovah's statutes.<a name=173:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the eleventh the cry becomes more urgent.<a name=173:25></a> He is under the pressure of trial, his soul fainting for deliverance -- looking for Jehovah to execute judgment, for he is walking in Jehovah's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fifteenth gives the horror of vain thoughts, and looking to God as his hiding-place, with his rejection of evildoers.<a name=174:12></a> He looks to Jehovah to uphold him, that he may not be ashamed in his hope; and looks with solemn trembling on the sure judgment of the wicked.<a name=174:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the sixteenth he presses more earnestly the interference of Jehovah in deliverance.<a name=174:14></a> The way in which the wicked have made void Jehovah's law only makes him cling the closer to it.<a name=174:15></a> It was time for Jehovah to work.<a name=174:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The following parts all bring out the effects of his strong attachment to Jehovah's law and testimonies, its value in every aspect for his heart; the trial he was in still in this path of righteousness; and how he would walk in Jehovah's ways when set free; his grief at transgressors.<a name=174:17></a> He looks for teaching, quickening, keeping; and recalls the everlasting character of God's testimonies; so that he held fast, though oppressed by the wicked.<a name=174:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last part is more general as a closing one, though in the same spirit.<a name=174:19></a> It sums up, so to speak, the whole.<a name=174:20></a> It desires that the cry of the oppressed delighter in the law may come up before Jehovah; asks for understanding according to His word -- for deliverance according to it; and assures praise when taught His statutes.<a name=174:21></a> His tongue will speak of His word.<a name=174:22></a> He has the sense of their righteousness -- looks for the hand of Jehovah to help, because he has chosen His precepts.<a name=174:23></a> Jehovah's salvation has been longed for (man not trusted in).<a name=174:24></a> Jehovah's law has been his delight, not his own will, nor the prosperous

		INTRODUCTION TO THE PROPHETS

	<div class="paragraph">
		We enter, now, dear reader, on the field of prophecy; a vast and important one, whether in view of the moral instruction that it contains, or on account of the great events that are announced in it, or through its development of God's government, and, by this means, its revelation of that which He Himself is in His ways with men.<a name=207:1></a> Jehovah and His dealings, and the Messiah, shine through the whole.<a name=207:2></a> Israel always forms the inner circle, or chief platform, on which these dealings are developed, and with which the Messiah is immediately in relation.<a name=207:3></a> Outside of, and behind this, the nations are gathered, instruments and objects of the judgments of God, and finally, the subjects of His universal government made subject to the Messiah, who however will assert His especial claim to Israel as His own people.<a name=207:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that the assembly and the Christian's individual place is outside this whole scene.<a name=207:5></a> In it there is neither Jew nor Gentile; in it the Father knows the objects of His eternal election, as His beloved children; and Christ, glorified on high, knows it as His body and His bride.<a name=207:6></a> Prophecy treats of the earth, and of the government of God.<a name=207:7></a> For after personal salvation is settled, there are two great subjects in scripture, the government of this world, and the sovereign grace which has taken poor sinners and put them into the same place as God's own Son as the exalted man, and as adopted into sonship -- the divine glory, and that in Christ, being of course the centre of all.<a name=207:8></a> If we measure things not by our importance, but by the importance of the manifestation of God, whatever develops His ways as unfolded in His government will have much importance in our eyes.<a name=207:9></a> There can be no doubt that the assembly, and the individual Christian, are a still more elevated subject, because God has there displayed the whole secret of His eternal love, and deepest present divine affections.<a name=207:10></a> But if we remember that it is not only the sphere of action that is in question, but He who acts therein, the dealings of God with Israel and the earth will then assume their true importance in our eyes.<a name=207:11></a> And these are the subjects of prophecy.<a name=207:12></a> For the others we must specially look to Paul and John.<a name=207:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is yet another principle, simple but important to our understanding of the prophets.<a name=209:6></a> Whatever figures the Spirit of God may use in depicting the ways of God or those of the enemy, the subject of the prophecy is never a figure.<a name=209:7></a> I am not speaking of those prophecies in which all is symbol; this remark could not be applied to them.<a name=209:8></a> Moreover a symbol is not the same thing as a figure.<a name=209:9></a> It is a collection of the moral or historical qualities, or of both, which belong to the prophetic object, in order to present God's idea of that object.<a name=209:10></a> Certain elements which compose this symbol may be figures; but the symbol itself, correctly speaking, is not a figure, but a striking whole, made up of the qualities that morally compose the thing described.<a name=209:11></a> Accordingly nothing is more instructive than a well-understood symbol.<a name=209:12></a> It is the perfect idea which God gives us of the way in which He looks upon the object represented by the symbol -- His view of its moral character.<a name=209:13></a>

		ISAIAH

	<div class="paragraph">
		Isaiah takes the first place; and in fact he is the most complete of all the prophets, and perhaps the most rich.<a name=210:1></a> The whole circle of God's thoughts with respect to Israel is more given here.<a name=210:2></a> Other prophets are occupied with certain portions only of the history of this people.<a name=210:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will give here the division of this book into subjects.<a name=210:4></a> There is in the beginning an appearance of confusion; nevertheless it helps to explain the moral bearing of the book.<a name=210:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And here what a scene presents itself to our view!<a name=210:6></a> -- sorrowful in one aspect, yet at the same time lovely and glorious, like the first glimmerings of dawn after a long and cold night of darkness, telling of the bright day which soon will rise over a scene, the beauties of which are faintly perceived, mingled with the darkness that still obscures them -- a scene that shall be vivified by the sun that will soon enlighten it.<a name=210:7></a> One rejoices in this partial light: it tells of the goodness, the energy, and the intentions of that God who has created all things for the accomplishment of His purposes of grace and glory.<a name=210:8></a> But one longs for the manifestation of the fulness of this accomplishment, when all will repose in the effects of this goodness.<a name=210:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is prophecy.<a name=210:10></a> It is sorrowful, because it unveils the sin, the ungrateful folly, of God's people.<a name=210:11></a> But it reveals the heart of One who is unwearied in love, who loves this people, who seeks their good, although He feels their sin according to His love.<a name=210:12></a> It is the heart of God that speaks.<a name=210:13></a> These two characters of prophecy throw light upon the two-fold end it has in view, and help us to understand its bearing.<a name=210:14></a> First of all, it addresses itself to the actual state of the people, and shews them their sin; it always therefore supposes the people to be in a fallen condition.<a name=210:15></a> When they peacefully enjoy the blessings of God, there is no need of displaying their condition to them.<a name=210:16></a> But, in the second place, during the period in which the people are still acknowledged, it speaks of present restoration on their repentance, to encourage them to return to Jehovah; and it proclaims deliverance.<a name=210:17></a> And in this, the law and so the blessings connected with it, have their place as that to which they should return.<a name=210:18></a> Of this the last prophetic word

		I would add that, although the subject of prophecy is not a figure, yet figures are not only largely used, but they are often intermingled with literal expressions; so that in explaining the prophetic books one cannot make an exact rule to distinguish between figure and letter.<a name=211:7></a> The aid of the Holy Ghost is necessary, as is always the case in the study of the sacred word, to find the true sense of the passage.<a name=211:8></a> What I have said is equally applicable to other parts of scripture, and in the most solemn circumstances.<a name=211:9></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, for instance, is a continual mixture of figures, which represent the moral character of certain facts, with other facts recited in the simplicity of the letter.<a name=211:10></a> There is no difficulty in understanding it.<a name=211:11></a> "Dogs have compassed me; the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me, they pierced my hands and my feet".<a name=211:12></a> The word dogs gives the character of those present.<a name=211:13></a> This way of speaking is found in all languages.<a name=211:14></a> For instance, it would be said, "He drew a fine picture of virtue".<a name=211:15></a> Drew a picture is a figure.<a name=211:16></a> I say this in order that a difficulty may not be made of that which belongs to the nature of human language.<a name=211:17></a>

		I come now to the contents of this important book of prophecy.<a name=211:18></a> It is thus divided: -- The first four chapters are apart, forming a kind of introduction.<a name=211:19></a> The fifth also in itself stands alone.<a name=211:20></a> It judges the people in view of the care that God has bestowed upon them.<a name=211:21></a> But we shall find this judgment resumed in detail in verse 8 of chapter 9.<a name=211:22></a> In chapter 6 we have the judgment of the people in view of the Messiah's coming glory; consequently there is a remnant acknowledged.<a name=211:23></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:211">footnote</a></i>)

		Chapter 7 formally introduces the Messiah, Immanuel, the Son of David, and the judgment upon the house of David after the flesh; so that there is an assured hope in sovereign grace, but at the same time judgment upon the last human support of the people.<a name=212:1></a> In chapter 8 we have the desolating Assyrian who overruns the land, but also Immanuel (previously announced in chapter 7) who finally brings his schemes to nought.<a name=212:2></a> Meantime there is a remnant, separate from the people, and attached to this Immanuel;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:212">footnote</a></i>) and the circumstances of anguish through which the apostate people must pass are alluded to, which terminate in the full blessing flowing from Immanuel's presence.<a name=212:3></a> This closes with verse 7 of chapter 9; so that we have here in fact the whole history of the Jews in relationship with Christ.<a name=212:4></a> In verse 8 of chapter 9 the Spirit resumes the general national history from chapter 5, interrupted by this essential episode of the introduction of Immanuel.<a name=212:5></a> He resumes it from the time then present, pointing out the different judgments of Jehovah, until He introduces the last instrument of these judgments -- the Assyrian, the rod of Jehovah.<a name=212:6></a> And here the immediate deliverance is presented as an encouragement to faith, and as prefiguring the final destruction of the power that will be the rod of Jehovah in the last days.<a name=212:7></a> Jehovah, having smitten the desolator, presents (chapter 11) the Offspring of David, at first in His intrinsic moral character, and then in the results of His reign as to full blessing, and the presence of Jehovah established again in Zion in the midst of Israel.<a name=212:8></a> Thus the whole history of the people is given us in its grand features, until their establishment in blessing as the people of God, having Jehovah in their midst.<a name=212:9></a> Only that it is to be remarked that nothing is given of Antichrist, nor of the power of the beast, nor of the time of tribulation as such, because that is the period during which the Jews are not owned, though they be dealt with, while our prophecy speaks of the time when they are owned.<a name=212:10></a> It is stated in general terms that God

		From chapter 13 to the end of chapter 27 we find the judgment of the Gentiles; whether Babylon or the other nations, especially of those which were at all times in relationship with Israel; the position of Israel, not only in the midst of them, but of all the nations in the last days (this is chapter 18); and, finally, the judgment of the whole world (chapter 24), and the full millennial blessing of Israel (chapters 25 - 27).<a name=213:2></a> From chapters 28 to 35 we have the detail of all that happens to the Jews in the last days.<a name=213:3></a> Each revelation closes with a testimony to the glory of God in Israel.<a name=213:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapters 36 to 39 the Spirit relates the history of a part of Hezekiah's reign.<a name=213:5></a> It contains three principal subjects: -- the resurrection of the Son of David as from death; the destruction of the Assyrian, without his having been able to attack Jerusalem; and the captivity in Babylon.<a name=213:6></a> These are the three grand foundations of the whole history and state of the Jews in the last days.<a name=213:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From chapter 40 to the end is a very distinct part of the prophecy, in which God reveals the consolation of His people and their moral relations with Himself, and the double ground of His controversy with them, whether in view of the position in which He has placed the nation as His elect servant -- the witness of Jehovah the one true God, in the presence of the Gentiles, and their idolatrous failure -- or in respect to their rejection of Christ the only true elect Servant(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:213">footnote</a></i>) who has fulfilled His will.<a name=213:8></a> This gives occasion to the revelation of a remnant who hearken to this true Servant, as well as to the history of the circumstances that this remnant pass through, and therefore at the same time to that of the people's condition in the last days, ending with the manifestation of Jehovah in judgment.<a name=213:9></a> The position of Israel with respect to the idolatrous nations gives occasion also to the introduction of Babylon, of its destruction, and the deliverance of captive Judah by Cyrus.<a name=213:10></a> This idolatry is one of the subjects on which Jehovah pleads with His people.<a name=213:11></a> The other and yet graver subject is that of the rejection of Christ.<a name=213:12></a> For more detail we must wait till these chapters come under examination.<a name=213:13></a>

		Prophecy supposes that the people of God are in a bad condition, even when they are still acknowledged, and prophecy addressed to them.<a name=214:1></a> There is no need of addressing powerful testimony to a people who are walking happily in the ways of the Lord, nor of sustaining the faith of a tried remnant by hopes founded on the unchangeable faithfulness and the purposes of God, when all are enjoying in perfect peace the fruits of His present goodness -- attached, as a consequence, to the faithfulness of the people.<a name=214:2></a> The proof of this simple and easily understood principle is found in each of the prophets.<a name=214:3></a> It does not appear that the prophets, whose prophecies we possess in the inspired volume, wrought any miracles.<a name=214:4></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:214">footnote</a></i>) For the law was then in force, its authority outwardly acknowledged; there was nothing to establish; and Jehovah's authority was the basis of the public system of religion in the land according to the institutions appointed by Himself in connection with the temple.<a name=214:5></a> It was on practical duty that the prophets insisted.<a name=214:6></a> In the midst of the ten apostate tribes Elijah and Elisha wrought miracles to re-establish the authority of Jehovah.<a name=214:7></a> Such is the faithfulness of Jehovah, and His patience towards His people.<a name=214:8></a> A new object of faith requires miracles.<a name=214:9></a> That which is founded on the already acknowledged word, and which does not demand; the reception of it as a new object, requires none, whatever the increase of light or claim on conscience may be.<a name=214:10></a> The word commends itself to the conscience in those who are taught of God; and if there are new revelations, they are to the comfort of those who have received the practical testimony, and have thus recognised the authority of one who speaks on the part of God.<a name=214:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus re-established, Zion, the mountain of Jehovah, will be the centre of blessing and peace to all the nations (chapter 2: 1 - 4).<a name=215:5></a> This puts the invitation to the people into the prophet's mouth to come and walk in the light of Jehovah.<a name=215:6></a> Why has He forsaken His people?<a name=215:7></a> Because they have learnt the ways of the heathen.<a name=215:8></a> Well, the day of Jehovah shall be upon all the glory of man, and upon all his idols.<a name=215:9></a> They may cease from man, for God's own people on the earth, the place of His rest, shall be judged and smitten by their God (chapters 3, 4).<a name=215:10></a> But in that day shall the Branch of Jehovah be glorious, and the earth shall be blessed.<a name=215:11></a> He who smites binds up the wounds by introducing the Messiah, and by Him blessing the earth.<a name=215:12></a> The remnant will be holy when the cleansing of Jerusalem shall have been accomplished by the judgment and the fire of Jehovah.<a name=215:13></a> Jerusalem shall be protected and glorified by the manifestation of Jehovah's presence, like the tabernacle in the wilderness.<a name=215:14></a> Such is the form in which the introduction to this prophecy is presented with much force and clearness.<a name=215:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		After this the Spirit of God begins to plead with the people, taking two distinct grounds -- namely, that which God had done for His people, and the coming of Jehovah in the Person of Christ in glory.<a name=215:16></a> Had the people made a suitable return to the care which Jehovah had lavished upon them?<a name=215:17></a> Were they in a condition to receive Jehovah in their midst?<a name=215:18></a> Chapter 5 takes up the first question, which addresses itself to the responsibility of the people, in view of the care and the government of God.<a name=215:19></a> What could He have done for His vine that He had not done?<a name=215:20></a> It has produced Him but wild grapes.<a name=215:21></a> He makes known the consequences of this according to His righteous government.<a name=215:22></a> His hedge, the protection with which He had surrounded it, shall be taken away, and it shall be left a prey to the ravages of the heathen.<a name=215:23></a> God, in pleading with Israel, shews them their sins in detail.<a name=215:24></a> Then His hand is stretched forth against His people, and terrible judgments fall upon them.<a name=215:25></a> Nevertheless, "His anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it was in the counsels of God that His presence should be established in glory in the midst of His people, and this will be accomplished in Christ at the end of the age.<a name=216:6></a> Hence the testimony of the progress of the judgments is interrupted after the first general statement, and in chapter 6 the prophet sees this glory.<a name=216:7></a> Yet its first effect is judicial, and operates to blind and condemn them.<a name=216:8></a> The previous judgment (chapter 5) had been in respect of the breaking of the law and the despising of the word of the Holy One of Israel.<a name=216:9></a> But with enmity against Christ and His rejection comes judicial blindness and the separation of a remnant.<a name=216:10></a> That it is the glory of Christ is taught us in chapter 12 of John's Gospel.<a name=216:11></a> The prophet feels at once the incompatibility of the people's condition with the manifestation of this glory.<a name=216:12></a> Unclean lips cannot celebrate it.<a name=216:13></a> But a live coal from the altar cleanses his own lips, and he consecrates himself to Jehovah's message; and to that which concerns the glory of Christ.<a name=216:14></a> The heart of the people is made fat until there is entire desolation.<a name=216:15></a> Nevertheless there shall be a remnant, a holy seed, which shall be like the sap of a tree that has lost its leaves.<a name=216:16></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:216">footnote</a></i>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then in these last chapters the judgment of the people under two aspects: first, that of God's government (in this point of view the people, being altogether guilty, are given up to the Gentiles); secondly, in view of the glory of Jehovah's presence at His coming according to His purposes of grace (for this the people were unfit).<a name=216:17></a> But here, as the purposes

		But this requires further development; and it is given in a remarkable manner in the next prophecy, comprised in chapters 7, 8, 9 to the end of verse 7.<a name=217:14></a> Certain promises were attached to the family of David, in which -- as we saw when examining the Books of Samuel -- God had renewed the hopes of Israel, when the links between Himself and the people were broken by the taking of the ark, and He had forsaken His place at Shiloh.<a name=217:15></a> Now the house of David, the last sustainment of the people in responsibility, has also failed in faithfulness.<a name=217:16></a> Ahaz has forsaken Jehovah, and set up the altar of a strange god in the temple of Jehovah.<a name=217:17></a> In chapter 7 the Spirit of God directs the prophet to the king, and addresses him.<a name=217:18></a> Isaiah was to go and meet him, with Shear-jashub his son -- a symbolical child whose name signifies "the remnant shall return".<a name=217:19></a> But the Lord seeks first, as He did with respect to the people in chapter 1, to encourage this branch of David to act in faith, and thus to glorify God.<a name=217:20></a> He announces to the king that the designs of Rezin and Pekah shall come to nought, and even proposes to him to ask a sign.<a name=217:21></a> But Ahaz is too far from the Lord to avail himself of this, though he replies with forms of piety.<a name=217:22></a> And again, as He had done with respect to the people, Jehovah declares that which shall happen to the family of David, and to the people under their rule.<a name=217:23></a> The two points of this prophetic announcement are -- the gift of Immanuel,

		From verse 7 of chapter 63 we have the reasoning of the Spirit of prophecy in the mouth of the remnant, or perhaps that of the prophet, putting himself in that position.<a name=239:1></a> And in chapters 65, 66 we find Jehovah's answer.<a name=239:2></a> Nothing can be more affecting than the way in which the Spirit lends Himself to the expression of all the feelings of a faithful Israelite's heart; or rather in which He gives a form to the sentiments of an afflicted but trusting heart, recalling past kindnesses, overwhelmed by the present distress, acknowledging the hardheartedness and rebellion of which they had been guilty, but appealing to the unchangeable faithfulness of God's love against the judicial blinding and hardening which the people are under.<a name=239:3></a> If Abraham acknowledged them not, God was their Father.<a name=239:4></a> Where was His strength, His tenderness.<a name=239:5></a> His mercies?<a name=239:6></a> Were they restrained?<a name=239:7></a> Faith recognises through all things the link between the people and God; it acknowledges that God prepares for those that wait on Him things beyond man's conception(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:239">footnote</a></i>) -- that He meets those who walk uprightly; and it confesses that the state of Israel is quite different -- that they are sinners, not even seeking His face.<a name=239:8></a> But the affliction of His people, the disastrous condition into which sin had brought them, is to faith a plea with God.<a name=239:9></a> Whatever had happened, the people were to faith as the clay, and Jehovah the potter.<a name=239:10></a> They were His people; their cities, the cities of Jehovah.<a name=239:11></a> The house in which their fathers had worshipped was burnt up, and all was laid waste.<a name=239:12></a>

		Chapter 66 speaks of the judgment that introduces it, and consequently gives us more historical details.<a name=240:11></a> The temple is rebuilt in Jerusalem (verse 6), but Jehovah does not own it, man alone being concerned in its building; neither does He acknowledge the sacrifices offered in it.<a name=240:12></a> He looks to the meek and contrite spirit.<a name=240:13></a> There were some who mocked at the hopes of these, and said mockingly, "Let Jehovah display his glory"; but He will appear to their confusion, and for the blessing of those who waited for Him.<a name=240:14></a> Zion shall suddenly be as the mother of a people, blessed in Jehovah and comforted.<a name=240:15></a> The remnant is thus distinguished in these two chapters in the most explicit manner.<a name=240:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There remains a general remark to be made here.<a name=241:14></a> The sinful condition thus judged existed in the days of the prophet.<a name=241:15></a> The patience of God bore with it, but the principle that brought in judgment was there (witness chapter 6).<a name=241:16></a> Until the rejection of Christ, and in a certain sense until the reception of Antichrist coming in his own name, the evil is not fully consummated, nor the final judgment executed.<a name=241:17></a> But already in Ahaz the occasion had been given for pronouncing it.<a name=241:18></a> Thus, the occasion being in this manner given, the whole condition of Israel, the grace that received the Gentiles, the nothingness of forms and ceremonies -- in a word, all the great moral principles of truth are laid down in this part of the prophecy; and we see Stephen, Paul, the Lord Himself, making use of passages that speak of these principles, applying them to the times in which they lived: the Lord, to the hardened state of the people; Stephen, to the unprofitableness of an already judged system; Paul, to the Jews' state of condemnation, and to the manifestation of grace to the Gentiles.<a name=241:19></a> What remains is the accomplishment of the great result, in which these things

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah has a different character from that of Isaiah.<a name=243:1></a> It does not contain the same development of the counsels of God respecting this earth that Isaiah does.<a name=243:2></a> It is we, that we are told many things in it concerning the nations; but it is principally composed of testimony addressed immediately to the conscience of the people, on the subject of their moral condition at the time the prophet speaks, and with an eye to the judgment with which they were threatened.<a name=243:3></a> Judah had forsaken Jehovah; for their repentance under Josiah was but a fair appearance, and under the kings that succeeded him their degradation was complete.<a name=243:4></a> The prophet's heart was overwhelmed with grief, because of his love for the people; at the same time that he was filled with a deep sense of their relationship with the Lord.<a name=243:5></a> The sense of this produced a continual conflict in his soul between the thought of the value of the people as the people of God, and a holy jealousy for the glory of God and His rights over His people -- rights which they were trampling under foot.<a name=243:6></a> This was an incurable wound to his heart.<a name=243:7></a> He had pleaded for the people, he had stood in the breach for them before Jehovah; but he saw that it was all in vain: the people rejected God and the testimony that He sent them.<a name=243:8></a> God Himself would no longer hearken to prayer made for Israel.<a name=243:9></a> Jeremiah prophesies under this impression: a sorrowful task, indeed, and one which made the prophet truly a man of sorrow.<a name=243:10></a> And although he could always say that, if the people repented, they would be received in grace, he well knew that the people had even no thought of repenting.<a name=243:11></a> Two things sustained him in this painful service: (for what could be more painful than to announce judgment for their iniquities, to a people beloved of God?<a name=243:12></a>) first of all, the energy of the Spirit of God, which filled his heart and compelled him to announce the judgment of God, in spite of contradiction and persecution; and then the revelation of the people's final blessing according to the unchangeable counsels of God.<a name=243:13></a> After this brief notice of the spirit of the Book of Jeremiah, the proofs and details of which we shall find in going through his prophecies, let us now examine these in succession.<a name=243:14></a>

		There can be nothing more striking in the way of deep affliction than that of the prophet.<a name=244:14></a> He is distressed; his heart is broken.<a name=244:15></a> One sees too that God has made choice of a naturally feeble heart, easily cast down and discouraged (even while filling it with His own strength), in order that the anguish, the complaints, the distress of soul, the indignation of a weak heart that resents oppression while unable to throw it off or overcome it, being all poured out before Him, should bear testimony against the people whose inveterate wickedness called for His vengeance.<a name=244:16></a> The affliction of Christ, whose Spirit wrought that of Jeremiah, was infinitely deeper; but His perfect communion with His Father caused all the anguish, that in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it was equally becoming that the outpouring of heart of the faithful, who needed this sympathy, should be expressed by the Holy Ghost.<a name=245:10></a> It is not that there was no weakness in the heart that poured itself out; but if the Spirit lays it open, it is evident that He must express it as it is; otherwise it were useless and false.<a name=245:11></a> Consequently Jeremiah enters much more personally into his prophecies than any other prophet.<a name=245:12></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:245">footnote</a></i>) He represents the people in their true position before God -- such as God could recognise, as being before Him in this character -- in order to see whether, receiving from God that which applied to this position, and expressing the sentiments inspired by such a position, it was possible to reach the conscience and win the heart of the people; always remembering that these sentiments were expressed according to the Spirit, and accompanied by the most direct and positive prophecies of that which God would bring upon the people.<a name=245:13></a> It is to be observed also, that a great part of that which was written was not addressed in the first instance to the people, but to God.<a name=245:14></a> This position of Jeremiah's, as the representative before God of the true interests of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But these points will be better understood by examining the passages which bring them into notice.<a name=246:2></a> The period during which Jeremiah prophesied was of considerable length, and embraced the whole time of Israel's decline, from the year after that in which Josiah began to cleanse Jerusalem and all the land, until the final destruction of Jerusalem by the army of the Chaldeans; and even a little while after in Egypt, a period of more than forty years -- a period throughout of distress and anguish.<a name=246:3></a> For although Josiah was a godly king, the reformation of the people was only an outward one, as we shall see.<a name=246:4></a> So that the anguish of one who saw with God was so much the greater on account of this appearance of piety.<a name=246:5></a> "And Jehovah was not turned away from his fierce anger, because of the sins of Manasseh".<a name=246:6></a> Nevertheless the prophet distinguishes between the two periods, that is, the reign of Josiah, and that of his successors.<a name=246:7></a>

		Excepting in chapters 21 - 24 there are no dates for the first twenty-four chapters.<a name=246:8></a> It is probable that they were mostly given under Josiah's reign.<a name=246:9></a> They contain moral arguments, the expression of the prophet's sorrow of heart, and solemn warnings of the coming invasion from the north.<a name=246:10></a> The four chapters I have specified have no chronological order, and are probably composed of prophecies given at different periods.<a name=246:11></a> They contain the judgment of the different branches of the house of David successively, as well as that of the false prophets who deceived the people.<a name=246:12></a> They end by declaring the fate of the captives in Babylon, and of those that remained with Zedekiah in Jerusalem -- the two very different from each other.<a name=246:13></a>

		Chapter 26 begins this series of details with a prophecy of the commencement of Jehoiakim's reign.<a name=258:3></a> The people are warned, as being already in sin, that if they repent, they shall escape.<a name=258:4></a> We have constantly seen this character attached to the prophecies of Jeremiah, as though God said, "To-day, if ye will hear my voice".<a name=258:5></a> Circumstances rendered this appeal urgent, for in fact, if Israel did not repent, the house of Jehovah was to be like Shiloh.<a name=258:6></a> We find that of which God had warned the prophet.<a name=258:7></a> They strive against him; but, as Jehovah had promised, they gain no advantage over him.<a name=258:8></a> We see that it is the ecclesiastical party that excite the people against the testimony which God bears to them by the mouth of the prophet.<a name=258:9></a> But God turns the heart of the princes and of the people towards him.<a name=258:10></a> There were some also who regarded the ways of Jehovah.<a name=258:11></a> Their intelligence did not go far, but sufficiently so for deliverance; they feared God.<a name=258:12></a> We may remark here, that conscience laid hold of the word of God in its immediate application.<a name=258:13></a> No doubt the evil would go on increasing, and, when ripe, the judgment would be accomplished (for God does not strike before iniquity has come to its height), and then the prophecy would be fulfilled.<a name=258:14></a> But conscience, under the influence of the word, takes knowledge of principles which are judged by it, even when all is not yet ripe for judgment; and as yet consequently the judgment is not executed (verse 18, 19).<a name=258:15></a>

		Let us now observe the place which, as Creator of the earth, of man and beast, God gives to the king of Babylon.<a name=259:3></a> God has given the nations, and even the beasts of the field, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar for a certain time.<a name=259:4></a> God establishes the central and universal power, and the nation that refuses to submit to it would be in rebellion against Himself, and should be consumed.<a name=259:5></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:38">Daniel  2:38</a>, which adds the fowls of the heaven to his dominion.<a name=259:6></a> All on earth was subjected to this king of the earth -- the imperial head taken from among the Gentiles.<a name=259:7></a> It was a government appointed of God, who had forsaken Jerusalem, and would no longer protect her unless she submitted to this government.<a name=259:8></a> It appears that the kings of the surrounding countries were plotting with Zedekiah to throw off the yoke of the king of Babylon, and that the mission of their ambassadors was the occasion on which this prophecy was given, God declaring that He would have all submit to this yoke, for it was He Himself that imposed it.<a name=259:9></a>

		This fact -- that God has committed power in this world to a man -- is very remarkable.<a name=259:10></a> In the case of Israel man had been tried on the ground of obedience to God, and had not been able to possess the blessing that should have resulted from it.<a name=259:11></a> Now God abandons this direct government of the world (while still the sovereign Lord above); and, casting off Israel whom He had chosen out from the nations, grouping the latter around the elect people and His own throne in Israel, He subjects the world to one head, and committing power unto man, He places him under a new trial, to prove whether he will own the God who gave him power, and make those happy who are subjected to him, when he can do whatever he will in this world.<a name=259:12></a>

		Chapter 33 repeats with ample and rich abundance the testimony to these blessings, and dwells particularly on the presence of the Messiah; it announces that the branch of righteousness shall grow up unto David, executing judgment and righteousness in the land.<a name=262:15></a> Judah shall be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell safely.<a name=262:16></a> Her name shall be "Jehovah our Righteousness".<a name=262:17></a> David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel (not merely Judah), nor the tribe of Levi a priest.<a name=262:18></a> The Lord's covenant with the heavens and the earth shall fail, before this covenant with David shall be broken.<a name=262:19></a> However deeply sunk in despair the people might be, the Lord would never cast off Jacob, or His servant David, but would cause their captivity to return and would have mercy on them.<a name=262:20></a> The reader will remark how complete this revelation of deliverance is in its objects: first Judah, who was then particularly in question, then all Israel,

		I recapitulate here the principles of this book on account of their importance.<a name=268:2></a> The empire of Babylon, in consequence of the unfaithfulness of the house of David, was established by God Himself, and entrusted with the government of the world.<a name=268:3></a> But Babylon not only oppressed Israel, but set up idolatry, and corrupted the world.<a name=268:4></a> He who should have been a worshipper of the true God, and an instrument of His power, established, as far as he could, the influence of the enemy.<a name=268:5></a> God has judged him.<a name=268:6></a> The empire which God Himself established has been entirely overthrown.<a name=268:7></a> This judgment was executed against the pride of man, and against idolatry.<a name=268:8></a> At the same time it was the deliverance of Israel.<a name=268:9></a> This last consideration gave rise to a declaration on God's part of what Israel was to Him, and what it shall be in the last days.<a name=268:10></a> But the subject treated of is the Babylon of that day.<a name=268:11></a> Since then God has permitted other powers to exist, governing the world with universal dominion, until the final accomplishment of all His purposes.<a name=268:12></a> These empires have subsisted according to His will, have been raised up or cast down as He saw good.<a name=268:13></a> But neither of them has held precisely the same place as Babylon.<a name=268:14></a> None of them have been formally established in the place of Israel, nor has the destruction of any of them been the occasion of Israel's restoration.<a name=268:15></a> The word of prophecy assures us that at the end of the days, the judgment of the last empire will have this effect.<a name=268:16></a> The judgment of Babylon has, in a manner, foreshadowed it; as its moral character commenced the sad history of these monarchies, and served as a model to them in many respects as to the evil that should be developed until the end.<a name=268:17></a> But to understand the fundamental principles of this history, and the dealings of God, the place which this first empire held in these dealings must be clearly and distinctly kept in mind.<a name=268:18></a> Besides the immense fact of the substitution of empire in man's hand, for the immediate exercise of God's government on the earth, the diligent testimony which God sent, and the warnings to king after king, to people and to priests, is very striking in this book, the patience of God's love and interest.<a name=268:19></a>

		THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lamentations of Jeremiah -- a touching expression of the interest which God feels in the afflictions which His people undergo on account of their sins -- will not require much explanation as to the general meaning of the book.<a name=269:1></a> A few remarks may be useful, to shew the true character of this book, and its connection with the dealings of God, as revealed to us elsewhere.<a name=269:2></a> The first interesting point -- to which I have already alluded -- is that the affliction of His people does not escape the eye of God.<a name=269:3></a> He is afflicted in their affliction: His Spirit takes knowledge of it; and, acting in the heart of those whose mouth He uses, gives expression to the feelings He has produced there.<a name=269:4></a> Thus Christ wept over the hard-heartedness of Jerusalem, and invited its inhabitants to do so likewise.<a name=269:5></a> And here also His Spirit not only reproves and reveals things to come; He gives a form to the grief of those who love what God loves, and furnishes the expression of it Himself.<a name=269:6></a> There is nothing more affecting than the sentiments produced in the heart by the conviction that the subject of affliction is beloved of God, that He loves that which He is obliged to smite, and is obliged to smite that which He loves.<a name=269:7></a> The prophet, while laying open the affliction of Jerusalem, acknowledges that the sin of the people had caused it.<a name=269:8></a> Could that diminish the sorrow of his heart?<a name=269:9></a> If on the one hand it was a consolation, on the other it humbled and made him hide his face.<a name=269:10></a> The pride of the enemy, and their joy in seeing the affliction of the beloved of God, give occasion to sue for compassion on behalf of the afflicted, and judgment on the malice of the enemy.<a name=269:11></a> At the end of chapter 1, after full confession that it was Judah's sin that had brought the evil upon them, and that Jehovah was righteous, the people call on the eye of Jehovah to look on their sorrow, and judge those by whose wickedness they were punished.<a name=269:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second chapter is a very deep and touching appeal.<a name=269:13></a> The desolation of Jerusalem is looked at as Jehovah's own work, on what was His own, and not as that of the enemy.<a name=269:14></a> Never had there been such sorrow.<a name=269:15></a> Not only had He polluted the kingdom and its princes, and had been as an enemy against Jerusalem, and all that was goodly in it, but He had cast down

		His altar, abhorred His sanctuary.<a name=270:1></a> He no longer respected what He had Himself set up.<a name=270:2></a> Only we must remember that it was when the relationships of Jehovah with His people depended, however long God's patience, on the faithfulness of the people's obedience to Jehovah, on the old covenant.<a name=270:3></a> But this consideration gives room for appealing to Himself.<a name=270:4></a> Still it is a solemn thing when Jehovah is forced to reject that which He acknowledges to be His own.<a name=270:5></a> But it must be so if the association of His name is only a means of falsifying the testimony of what He is (verse 6, 7).<a name=270:6></a> And this brings before us the amazingly important principle contained in the ministry of Jeremiah, not merely the substitution of Babylon and the Gentile empire for Jerusalem and God's government in Israel, but the setting this last aside in itself, the ground of God's relationship with man where it subsisted, as that which could not subsist when put to the test.<a name=270:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 we find the language of faith, of sorrowing faith, of the Spirit of Christ in the remnant, on the occasion of the judgment of Jerusalem in which God had dwelt.<a name=270:8></a> Before, the prophet (or the Spirit of Christ in him) spoke in the name of Jerusalem, deploring her sufferings and confessing her sin, while appealing to Jehovah against her enemies, relating what He had done in forsaking His sanctuary, and (from verse 11 of chapter 2) expressing the depth of her affliction at the sight of the evil.<a name=270:9></a> But in chapter 3 he places himself in the midst of the evil to express the sentiments of the Spirit of Christ; not, it is true, in an absolute manner, according to the perfection of Christ Himself, but as acting in the heart of the prophet (as is generally the case in Jeremiah), expressing his personal distress -- a distress produced by the Spirit, but clothed in the feelings of the prophet's own heart -- to bring out that which practically was going on in the heart of a faithful Israelite, the reality of that which was most elevated in that day of anguish and affliction, in which alas!<a name=270:10></a> there was no more hope from the people's side than from that of the enemies who attacked them, and in which the heart of the faithful suffered without hope of remedy, yet much more on account of a people who hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah, than on account of enemies raised up in judgment.<a name=270:11></a> What has Christ not suffered!<a name=270:12></a> That which His Spirit produces in the midst of human weakness, He has Himself undergone and felt in its full extent; only that He was perfect in all that His heart went through in His affliction.<a name=270:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 the prophet expresses then in his own person, by the Spirit of Christ, all that he felt as sharing the affliction of Israel, and being at the same time the object of their enmity -- a position remarkably analogous to that of Christ.<a name=271:1></a> What suffering can be like that of one who shares the suffering of God's people without being able to turn away the evil, because they refuse to hear God's message -- like that of one who bears this affliction on his heart with the feeling that, if this foolish people would but have hearkened, the wrath of God should have been turned away?<a name=271:2></a> It was the lamentation of Christ Himself, "Oh, if thou hadst known", etc.<a name=271:3></a> In the main Jeremiah partook of the same feelings.<a name=271:4></a> But we see him more as being of the people, and participating in his own person in the consequences of the evil, seeing himself under these consequences with the people, because they had rejected his testimony.<a name=271:5></a> This may be said of the Lord at the close of His life, or on the cross.<a name=271:6></a> But we see that this sentiment, a little known in the case of Job, takes here the form of a personal prayer, complaining of personal suffering.<a name=271:7></a> Jeremiah suffers for the testimony, and for the rejection of the testimony.<a name=271:8></a> The first nineteen verses of chapter 3 contain the expression of this state.<a name=271:9></a> It is altogether the spirit of the remnant; and, with the exception of the sentiment I have just mentioned, it is that expressed in many of the Psalms.<a name=271:10></a> Into it all indeed, if we go on to the cross,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:271">footnote</a></i>) Christ Himself entered.<a name=271:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet speaks as having borne in his own heart the deep grief of that which Jehovah had brought upon Jerusalem; but feeling it as one who knew God to be his God, so that he could experience what it was to be the object of the wrath of God.<a name=271:12></a> He suffered with Jerusalem, and he suffered for Jerusalem.<a name=271:13></a> But the truth of this relation with Jehovah, while making him feel the affliction more deeply, sustained him also (verse 22).<a name=271:14></a> He begins to feel that, after all, it is better to have to do with Jehovah, although, in another point of view, this made it all the more painful.<a name=271:15></a> He feels that it is good to be afflicted, and to wait upon Jehovah who smites: for He will not cast off for ever.<a name=271:16></a> He does not afflict willingly, but from necessity.<a name=271:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet calls to mind the affliction of Jerusalem, and, remembering the way which he had been succoured himself, he makes use of the kindness he had experienced to confirm his assurance that God would shew the same kindness to the people.<a name=272:5></a> But with respect to the proud and careless who reject the truth, their enmity against God, manifesting itself in their enmity against those who were the bearers of His word, he asks for the judgment of God upon them.<a name=272:6></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:272">footnote</a></i>) Thus relieved in spirit, and his heart filled with the sentiment that, since the evil came from Jehovah, that which gave so much depth to the sorrow was also a comfort to the heart, he can return to the affliction

		It is right to be troubled, and, as it were, overwhelmed, at God's breaking, not perhaps the relationship, but His present connection with that which was the object of His favour, that which bore the name and the testimony of God.<a name=273:4></a> Christ felt this for Himself, though in Him distress went much farther: "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?<a name=273:5></a> Father, save me from this hour".<a name=273:6></a> Only in Christ all is perfect; and if He feels in perfection the profound distress of the object of God's love becoming the object of His judgment, a feeling of unparalleled grief, seeing it at the same time according to the perfection of God's ways, He can say, "For this cause came I unto this hour; Father, glorify thy name!<a name=273:7></a>" He was Himself the necessary object of all God's affection, and consequently (if the judgment was to glorify God) the object also of a perfect judgment, that is, of a complete forsaking on God's part.<a name=273:8></a> That which is dreadful in this thought is, that the change of relative position was absolute and perfect in His case according to the very perfection of the relationship.<a name=273:9></a> He suffered the forsaking of God, instead of enjoying infinite favour which He knew.<a name=273:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There was something similar in the case of Jerusalem; and Jeremiah, feeling by the Spirit of Christ the preciousness of this relationship, and entering into it as sharing it, he suffers with that which was thus judged of God.<a name=273:11></a> Only, although moved by the Spirit of Christ, he must find the equilibrium of his thoughts, he must seek Jehovah to bring Him into the affliction, amidst all his personal grief, and the true but human workings of a heart that was shaken and cast down by the circumstances.<a name=273:12></a> He attached himself to Jerusalem, as resting on her position before God, and not solely and absolutely for God, and as God Himself, as did our blessed Lord.<a name=273:13></a> There was

		an object between his soul and God (an object beloved also by God), and it was not loved absolutely in God, and with the affection of God, and hence the affliction had to reach this object, he being in it and of it, reach his heart in this place -- and then God draw it to Himself, so that he may look at all from Jehovah's view of it.<a name=274:1></a> But Christ was Himself absolutely in the place, for God's glory and the salvation of others.<a name=274:2></a> The judged thing from which He was infinitely far, even as man, he was to be before God.<a name=274:3></a> Ever perfect, He learned to the absolute fulness what it was to be this before God, and glorified God there.<a name=274:4></a> But this, though we know it true, none can fathom.<a name=274:5></a> There was in Jeremiah the right foundation, and he finds Jehovah, first of all in spite of the affliction, but soon in the affliction itself, and he recovers himself immediately, not from the affliction, but in the affliction, by the power of God.<a name=274:6></a> Christ can say, "How often would I have gathered", etc.<a name=274:7></a> This was the affection of God.<a name=274:8></a> Jeremiah confesses sin, and ought to confess it, as himself in the place, though a testimony of God in it.<a name=274:9></a> But this thought changes so far the character of the feeling (see chapter 1: 19, 20).<a name=274:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ sought for nothing as a resource, as if self were concerned in it.<a name=274:11></a> His affliction was unmixed and absolute to Himself alone, more profound (for who could share it?<a name=274:12></a>) but perfect as being His alone.<a name=274:13></a> Thus, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, when it is Himself personally (for this Gospel sets the old vine aside as rejected), He cannot desire that the hour of God's forsaking should come; He ought to fear and be troubled, and He was therefore heard.<a name=274:14></a> But it is between God and Himself alone.<a name=274:15></a> No other thought comes in between -- it is wholly with God.<a name=274:16></a> Alas!<a name=274:17></a> had it been possible, all was lost.<a name=274:18></a> But no; it is the absolute submission of the perfect man, who seeks (and seeks nothing else) that the name of God may be glorified according to God's perfection; that at all cost to Himself God's name may be glorified.<a name=274:19></a> Not now as God, who must necessarily maintain its glory, but as one who submits to everything, who sacrifices Himself, in order that God may glorify His name.<a name=274:20></a> For this cause He has been supremely glorified as man -- a glorious mystery, in which the glory of God will shine forth throughout eternity.<a name=274:21></a>

		It is important to remark one point in this series of prophecies, which commences with the judgment of Jerusalem, the centre of the former system of nations.<a name=298:5></a> They are executed with the object of making them all know Jehovah: only in Israel's case there is, besides this, the understanding and the special verification of prophecy.<a name=298:6></a> See chapter 24: 24 - 27, Israel; chapter 25: 5, 7, 11, Ammon and Moab; verses 15 - 17, especial vengeance on the Philistines; chapter 26, Tyre; chapter 28: 22, Sidon; chapter 29: 19, Egypt; as also chapters 30: 26; 32: 15.<a name=298:7></a> With respect to Edom (chapter 25: 14), it is only said that Edom shall know the vengeance of Jehovah by means of Israel -- a further proof that in certain respects this prophecy extends to the last days.<a name=298:8></a> These prophecies, then, furnish us in general with the manifestation of Jehovah's power, so as to make Him known to all by the judgments which He executed; already partially realised in the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar, but to be fully accomplished by-and-by in favour of Israel.<a name=298:9></a>

		In chapter 33, in view of these judgments, which put His people on entirely new ground (for they were judged as Loammi, with the nations, and this is why the prophecy can look on to the last days, although the judgments had been but partial) -- in view then of these judgments, God establishes an entirely new principle, namely, individual conduct as the ground of the dealings of God, in contrast with the consequences of national sin (verse 10, 11).<a name=299:12></a> Thus the door was still fully open to individual repentance founded on a testimony that applied individually, whatever the national judgment might be.<a name=299:13></a> The end to which the judgment applies is in contrast with the effect to be produced by it on the individual, and that in order to confirm the principles.<a name=299:14></a> Faith would not be shewn now by reckoning on the promises to Israel, or on the intervention of God in behalf of His people as in possession of His promises, for the people were judged; and the very thing that would have been faith, had it been the time of the promises, and that hereafter also will be faith, is but hardness of heart in the time of judgment (verse 24).<a name=299:15></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51:2">Isaiah  51:2</a>, a passage often entirely misapplied.<a name=299:16></a> The little remnant in the latter days may trust in a God who had called out one man alone and had multiplied him; but such a thought on the part of the people, when God was cutting off the multitude of them because of their iniquities, would only cause the judgment to be more keenly felt.<a name=299:17></a> In this way of judgment on the iniquities of which

		We have observed that the prophet sees everything in a point of view connected with Israel.<a name=307:3></a> Thus the remembrance of redemption, the passover, the basis of all, and the enjoyment of rest celebrated at the feast of the tabernacles, will characterise the position of Israel before God.<a name=307:4></a> The two feasts are celebrated in the recognition of the full value of the burnt offering presented to God.<a name=307:5></a> Another circumstance which distinguishes the worship of this millennial day is, that the two feasts which are types of that period are marked out in the worship -- the Sabbath, and the new moon, rest and re-establishment, Israel appearing anew in the world.<a name=307:6></a> The inner gate on the side of the east was open on that day, and the Prince worshipped at the very threshold of the gate and the people before the gate (chapter 46).<a name=307:7></a> The other days it was shut.<a name=307:8></a> They stood thus before Jehovah in the consciousness of the rest which God had given to Israel and of His grace in again manifesting His people in the light.<a name=307:9></a> Nevertheless it still remains true that neither the people nor the Prince entered within.<a name=307:10></a> Those who are the most blessed on the earth in that day of blessing will never have that access into God's presence which we have, by the Spirit, through the veil.<a name=307:11></a> Pentecost belongs to, and links itself with, the rending of the veil; and gives us to walk in all liberty in the light, as God Himself is in the light, having entered into the holy place by the new and living way which He has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, His flesh.<a name=307:12></a>

		DANIEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Book of Ezekiel we have seen the government of God on earth fully developed in connection with Israel; whether in condemning the sin which occasioned the judgment of that people, or in their restoration under the authority of Christ, the Branch that should spring from the house of David, and who, in the book of that prophet, bears even the name of David, as the true "beloved" of God, the description of the temple, with its whole organisation, being given at the end.<a name=309:1></a> In this development we have found Nebuchadnezzar, the head of the Gentiles, introduced as Jehovah's servant (chapters 29: 20; 30: 24) for the judgment of sinful Israel, who were rebellious and even apostate, worshipping false gods.<a name=309:2></a> God had made Israel the centre of a system of nations, peoples, and languages, that had arisen in consequence of the judgment on Babel, and existed before God independently of each other.<a name=309:3></a> The nation of Israel was doubtless very distinct from all that surrounded it, whether as a people to whom the true God was known, or as having in their midst the temple and the throne of God; but, whatever the contrast might be between the condition of Israel as a nation, and that of the other nations, still Israel formed a part of that system of nations before God (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:8">Deuteronomy  32:8</a>).<a name=309:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In executing the judgment of God on Israel Nebuchadnezzar set aside this whole system at once, and took its place in the absolute and universal dominion which he had received from God.<a name=309:5></a> It is of this order of things and of its consequences -- of this dominion of the head of the Gentiles, and of the Gentile kings, in the successive phases that characterised their history -- that the Book of Daniel treats, bringing into notice a remnant of Israel, in the midst of this system, and subject to this dominion.<a name=309:6></a> The king of Judah having been given up into the hands of the head of the Gentiles, the royal seed is found in the same position.<a name=309:7></a> The remnant becomes the especial object of the thoughts of God revealed by His Spirit in this book.<a name=309:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides the testimony rendered to Jehovah by the fact of the faithfulness of the remnant in the midst of the idolatrous Gentiles, two important things characterise their history as developed in this book.<a name=309:9></a> The first is that the Spirit of prophecy and of understanding in the ways of God is found in this

		remnant.<a name=310:1></a> We have seen this raised up in Samuel, when all Israel had failed, and subsist through their whole history under the shadow of royalty.<a name=310:2></a> The Spirit of prophecy now again becomes the link of the people with God, and the only resting-place for their faith, amid the ruin which the just judgment of God had brought upon them.<a name=310:3></a> The second circumstance that characterises the dealings of God with regard to this remnant is, that, preserved by God through all the misfortunes into which the sins of the people had cast them, this remnant will assuredly share the portion which God bestows on His people according to His government and according to the faithfulness of His promises.<a name=310:4></a> We find these in the first and last chapters of the Book we are considering.<a name=310:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This Book is divided into two parts, which are easily distinguished.<a name=310:6></a> The first ends with chapter 6, and the second with the close of the Book, the first and last chapters having nevertheless a separate character, as an introduction and a conclusion, respectively making known the position of the remnant, to whom, as we have said, the testimony of God was confided at the beginning and at the end.<a name=310:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two great divisions have also a distinct character.<a name=310:8></a> The first sets before us the picture of the dominion of the Gentiles, and the different positions it would assume before God according to the human pride which would be its animating principle.<a name=310:9></a> This picture contains historical features which plainly indicate the spirit that will animate the ruling power in its different phases; and then the judgment of God.<a name=310:10></a> This division is not composed of direct revelations to Daniel, except for the purpose of recalling Nebuchadnezzar's dream.<a name=310:11></a> It is the heads of the Gentiles that are presented.<a name=310:12></a> It is the external and general history of the monarchies that were to succeed each other, or the different and successive features that would characterise them, and their final judgment, and the substitution of the kingdom of Christ; and especially, the course and judgment of the one which God had Himself established, and which represents all the others, as being invested with this character of divine appointment.<a name=310:13></a> The others did but inherit providentially the throne which God had committed to the first.<a name=310:14></a> It was a question between God and Israel that gave this monarchy its supremacy.<a name=310:15></a> It is the spirit of presumptuous idolatry, and of blasphemy against the God of Israel that leads to its destruction.<a name=310:16></a> Chapter 6 does not give the iniquity of the king,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second part of the Book, which consists of communications made by God to Daniel himself, exhibits the character of the heads of the Gentiles in relation to the earth, and their conduct towards those who shall acknowledge God; and at last the establishment of the divine kingdom in the Person of the Son of man -- a kingdom possessed by the saints.<a name=311:3></a> The details of God's dealings with His people at the end are given in the last chapter.<a name=311:4></a> We may also remark that chapter 7 gives essentially the history of the western power, chapter 8 that of the eastern -- the two horns.<a name=311:5></a> Chapter 9, although especially regarding Jerusalem and the people -- the moral centre of these questions, is connected on that very account with the western power that invaded them.<a name=311:6></a> From chapter 10 to the end of chapter 11 we are again in the east, closing in with the judgment of the nations there, and the establishment of the remnant of Israel in blessing.<a name=311:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now examine these chapters consecutively.<a name=311:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1 sets before us the royalty of Judah, formerly established by God over His people in the person of David, falling under the power of Nebuchadnezzar; and the king, Jehovah's anointed, given up by Jehovah into the hands of the head of the Gentiles, on whom God now bestowed dominion.<a name=311:9></a> That which was announced by Isaiah (chapter 39: 7) falls upon the children of the royal seed; but God watches over them and brings them into favour with those that kept them.<a name=311:10></a> This was especially the case with respect to Daniel; The two characteristics of the faithful remnant in captivity are prominently marked in this chapter: -- firstly, faithful to the will of God, although at a distance from His temple, they do not defile themselves among the Gentiles; secondly, their prayer being granted, understanding is given them, as we see in chapter 2 in Daniel's case, even the knowledge of that which God alone can reveal, as well as His purpose in that revelation.<a name=311:11></a> They alone possess this understanding, a token of divine favour and the fruit of their faithfulness through grace.<a name=311:12></a> This is the case with Daniel in particular, whose faith and earnest fidelity marks out the path of faith for his companions.<a name=311:13></a> This did not interfere with their subjection to the Gentiles, whose power
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was the ordinance of God for the time being.<a name=312:1></a> But this is a most important element: the place of true knowledge, of intelligence of the divine mind, what is called the secret of the Lord, in the days of Babylonish corruption and power, is the thorough keeping oneself undefiled by the smallest contact with what it gives, with the meat with which it would feed us.<a name=312:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, we see in the second chapter the mighty king of the Gentiles made the depositary of the history of the Gentiles, and of God's entire plan, as the recipient of these divine communications; yet in such a manner as to exhibit Daniel, the captive child of Israel, the faithful one who kept himself separate in Babylon as the one whom the Lord acknowledged, and who enjoyed His favour.<a name=312:3></a> But the details of this chapter, as a general picture of Gentile power, beginning with the dominion bestowed on Nebuchadnezzar, must be considered more attentively.<a name=312:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may first observe that the Gentile kingdoms are seen as a whole.<a name=312:5></a> It is neither historical succession nor moral features with respect to God and man, but the kingdoms all together forming, as it were, a personage before God, the man of the earth in the eye of God -- glorious and terrible in his public splendour in the eyes of men.<a name=312:6></a> Four imperial powers were to succeed each other, as the great head of which God had set up Nebuchadnezzar himself.<a name=312:7></a> There should be in certain respects a progressive deterioration; and at length the God of heaven would raise up another power that would execute judgment on that which still existed, and cause the image to disappear from off the earth, setting up in its place a kingdom that should never be overthrown.<a name=312:8></a> In the progressive decline in principle and character of imperial power there would be no diminution of material strength.<a name=312:9></a> Iron, that breaks in pieces and crushes all things, characterises the fourth power.<a name=312:10></a> The peculiar excellency of the head of gold appears to me to consist in its having received authority immediately from God Himself.<a name=312:11></a> In fact the absolute authority of the first power was founded on the gift of the God of heaven; the others succeeded by providential principles.<a name=312:12></a> But God, known as supreme, bestowing authority on the head, replacing His own authority on the earth by that of the head of the Gentiles, was not the immediate source of authority to the others.<a name=312:13></a> Babylon was the authority established of God.<a name=312:14></a> And therefore we found in Ezekiel (and the same thing is seen elsewhere) that the judgment of Babylon is connected

	<div class="paragraph">
		with the restoration of Israel and of the throne of God.<a name=313:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, nevertheless, that God does not here present Himself as God of earth, but of heaven.<a name=313:2></a> In Israel He was God of the earth.<a name=313:3></a> He will be so again at the restitution of all things.<a name=313:4></a> Here He acts in sovereignty as God of heaven, setting up man, in a certain sense, in His place on the earth (see verse 37, 38).<a name=313:5></a> Although more limited, it is a dominion characterised by the same features as that of Adam.<a name=313:6></a> It differs in that men are placed under his power; it is more limited, for the sea is not included in his sovereignty, but it reaches to every place where the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven exist.<a name=313:7></a> Human strength is found at the end of its history; but the subsisting power is much more remote from the ancient relationship of God with the world.<a name=313:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mixture of iron and of potter's clay is a change wrought in the primitive character of the imperial Roman power -- another element is introduced into it; the character remains in part, but another element is added.<a name=313:9></a> The energetic will of man is not there in an absolute manner.<a name=313:10></a> It is the introduction into the imperial Roman power of an element distinct from that which constituted its imperial strength, namely, the will of man devoid of conscience -- military and popular power concentrated in one individual without conscience.<a name=313:11></a> There are two causes here of weakness -- division and the want of coherence between the elements.<a name=313:12></a> The kingdom (verse 41) shall be divided, and (verse 42) it shall be partly strong and partly brittle.<a name=313:13></a> The "seed of men" is, I think, something outside of that which characterises the proper strength of the kingdom.<a name=313:14></a> But these two elements will never combine.<a name=313:15></a> It appears to me that the Barbaric or Teutonic element is probably here pointed out as added to that which originally constituted the Roman empire.<a name=313:16></a> The fact of a subdivision is seen in verse 43.<a name=313:17></a> It is then announced that, in the days of these last kings, He who rules from heaven will set up a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and that shall never pass into other hands.<a name=313:18></a> This is properly the only kingdom that, on God's part, takes the place of the kingdom of Babylon.<a name=313:19></a> The God of heaven had established Nebuchadnezzar in his kingdom, and had given him power, and strength, and glory, making all men subject to him.<a name=313:20></a> Doubtless the three others had followed, according to the will of Him who orders all things.<a name=313:21></a> But it is only with respect to the kingdom of verse 44, that it is once more said, "the God of heaven shall set up a

		kingdom".<a name=314:1></a> The character, and some leading features in the history, of the last four of the kingdoms are given.<a name=314:2></a> Nothing but the existence of the two preceding ones is stated, except the inferiority of the latter of the two to the first.<a name=314:3></a> So that the Spirit of God gives us the divine establishment of the first, the character of the fourth, and the divine establishment of the fifth or final kingdom.<a name=314:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will now observe the manner in which this last kingdom is established; and we see that it is accomplished by means of a judicial and destructive act which reduces the image to powder, bringing about its complete dissolution, so that no traces of it are left (verse 34, 35).<a name=314:5></a> The instrument of this destruction was not formed by the wisdom or the schemes of man.<a name=314:6></a> It is "cut out without hands".<a name=314:7></a> It does not act by a moral influence that changes the character of the object on which it acts.<a name=314:8></a> It destroys that object by force.<a name=314:9></a> It is God who establishes it and gives it that force.<a name=314:10></a> The stone does not gradually increase in size to displace the image.<a name=314:11></a> Before it extends itself, it destroys the image.<a name=314:12></a> When it has become great -- it is not merely a right given by God over men, it fills the whole earth -- it is the exalted seat of a universal authority.<a name=314:13></a> It is on the last form of power, exhibited in the image, that the stone falls with destructive force -- when the empire is divided and is partly strong and partly weak on account of the elements of which its members are composed.<a name=314:14></a> We may observe, that it is not God destroying the image in another way to establish the kingdom.<a name=314:15></a> The kingdom which He is establishing smites the feet of the image as its first act.<a name=314:16></a> It is the outward and general history of that which, by God's appointment, took the place of His throne and His government in Jerusalem, and which had gradually degenerated in its public character with respect to God, and which at length comes to its end by the judgment executed by the kingdom established of God without human agency.<a name=314:17></a> The kingdom of Christ, which falls on the last form of the monarchy formerly established by God, destroys the whole form of its existence, and itself fills the world.<a name=314:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have nothing particular to say on the four monarchies.<a name=314:19></a> We find Babylon, Persia, and Greece named in the book, as being already known to the Jews, and the Romans introduced by the name which their territory bore, the coasts of Chittim; so that I receive, without further question, the four great empires ordinarily recognised by every one as pointed out in

		The effect of the communication, which proves that God is with the remnant who alone understand His mind, is that the haughty Gentile acknowledges the God of Israel as supreme in heaven and on earth.<a name=315:3></a> That which characterises the remnant here is that God reveals to them His mind.<a name=315:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After this general picture, we have, historically, the characteristic features of these empires, marking the condition into which they fall, through their departure from God -- primarily and principally Babylon.<a name=315:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 we have the first characteristic feature of man invested with imperial power, but whose heart is afar from God -- a distance augmented by the very possession of power.<a name=315:6></a> He will have a god of his own, a god dependent on the will of man; and, in this case, dependent on the depositary of the imperial power.<a name=315:7></a> This is man's wisdom.<a name=315:8></a> The religious instincts of men are gratified in connection with the supreme power; and the influences of religion are exercised in binding all the members of the empire in one blended mass around the head, by the strongest bond, without any appearance of authority.<a name=315:9></a> For the religious wants of man are thus connected with his own will; and his will is unconsciously subject to the centre of power.<a name=315:10></a> Otherwise religion, the most powerful motive of the heart, becomes a dissolvent in the empire.<a name=315:11></a> But the will of man cannot make a true god; and consequently Nebuchadnezzar, although he had confessed that there was none like the God of the Jews, forsakes Him and makes a god for himself.<a name=315:12></a> The Gentile government rejects God, the source of its power; and the true God is only acknowledged by a faithful and suffering remnant.<a name=315:13></a> The empire is idolatrous.<a name=315:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the first great feature that characterises the dominion of Babylon.<a name=315:15></a> But the faithfulness that opposes this wise system which binds the most powerful motive of the whole people to the will of their head, uniting them in worship around that which he presents to them -- faithfulness like this touches the mainspring of the whole movement.<a name=315:16></a> The idol is not God at all; and, however powerful man may be, he cannot create a god.<a name=315:17></a> The man of faith, subject indeed to the king, as we have seen, because appointed of God, is not subject to the false god which the king sets up, denying the true God who gave him his authority, and who is still acknowledged by the man of faith.<a name=315:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may observe that faith and obedience are as absolute as the will of the king.<a name=316:5></a> Nothing can be finer and more calm than the answer of the three believers.<a name=316:6></a> God is able to deliver, and He will deliver; but, happen what may, they will not forsake Him.<a name=316:7></a> The king in his fury defies God.<a name=316:8></a> "Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?<a name=316:9></a>" God allows him to take his own way.<a name=316:10></a> The effect of his headlong rage is that the instruments of his vengeance are destroyed by the fierce flames prepared for the faithful Hebrews.<a name=316:11></a> The latter are cast into the furnace, and (outwardly) the king's will is accomplished.<a name=316:12></a> But this is only to manifest more brightly the power and the faithfulness of God, who comes, even into the midst of the fire, to prove the interest He takes in the fidelity of His servants.<a name=316:13></a> The effect, to them, of the fire is that their bands are consumed, and that they have His presence whose form is like the Son of God, even in the eyes of the king who denied His almighty power.<a name=316:14></a> The result is a decree forbidding the whole world to speak against the God of the Jews, the glory of that weak and captive people.<a name=316:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark here that the remnant are characterised by their faithfulness and obedience.<a name=316:16></a> They manifest their faithfulness by refusing to have any god but their own God: no concession -- it would be to deny Him.<a name=316:17></a> For, to acknowledge the true God, He alone must be acknowledged.<a name=316:18></a> Truth is but the full revelation of Him and can only recognise itself.<a name=316:19></a> To put itself on a level with falsehood would be saying it was not truth.<a name=316:20></a>

		In chapter 5 the iniquity of the head of the Gentiles with respect to the God of Israel reaches the highest point, and assumes that character of insolence and contempt which is but the effort of weakness to conceal itself.<a name=320:7></a> In the midst of the orgies of a great feast to his lords and courtiers Belshazzar causes the vessels of the temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken away from Jerusalem, to be brought, that he and his guests might drink therein; and he praises the gods of gold and of silver and of stone.<a name=320:8></a> The madness of the king puts the question between the false gods and Jehovah the God of Israel.<a name=320:9></a> Jehovah decides the question that very night by the destruction of the king and of all his glory.<a name=320:10></a> The warning which God gives him is interpreted by Daniel.<a name=320:11></a> But, although subject to the king, Daniel does not treat him with the same respect that he had for Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=320:12></a> Belshazzar had taken the place of an insolent enemy to Jehovah, and Daniel answers him according to God's revelations of his doom, and to the ostentatious manifestation which the king made of his iniquity, magnifying his own gods and insulting Jehovah.<a name=320:13></a> Accordingly the warning was no longer remedial and left no room for repentance.<a name=320:14></a> It announced judgment; and the very annunciation sufficed to destroy all the insolence of the impious king.<a name=320:15></a> For he had neglected the warning given him by the history of Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=320:16></a>

		This narrative gives us the last character of the iniquity of the sovereign power of the Gentiles, in opposition to the God of Israel, and the judgment which falls in consequence upon the monarchy of which Babylon was the head, and to which Babylon had given its own character.<a name=321:1></a> For, whatever may have been the longsuffering of God, and His dealings in other respects towards the monarchy of the Gentiles, as the power to which He committed authority in the world, all was already lost for these empires, even in the days of Babylon.<a name=321:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another form of iniquity appears besides that of Babylon (chapter 6).<a name=321:3></a> Cyrus, personally, had better thoughts; and God, from whom they came, made use of him for the temporary re-establishment of His people, in order that the Messiah should come and present Himself to them -- the last trial of His beloved people.<a name=321:4></a> It is not Cyrus, therefore, whom we find here the instrument of the iniquity which sought to destroy Daniel -- of that human will which can never endure faithfulness to God.<a name=321:5></a> Here it is not idolatry, nor is it insult offered to Jehovah, but the exaltation of man himself, who would shut out all idea of God, who would have no God.<a name=321:6></a> This is one of the features that characterise the depths of the human heart.<a name=321:7></a>

		Man in general is well pleased with a god who will help him to satisfy his passions and his desires -- a god who suits his purpose for the unity of his empire and the consolidation of his power.<a name=321:8></a> The religious part of man's nature is satisfied with gods of this kind, and worships them willingly, though he who establishes them imperially may do it only politically.<a name=321:9></a> Poor world!<a name=321:10></a> the true God suits neither their conscience nor their lusts.<a name=321:11></a> The enemy of our souls is well-pleased to cultivate in this manner the religiousness of our nature.<a name=321:12></a> False religion sets up gods that correspond to the desires of the natural heart, whatever they may be; but which never call into communion and never act upon the conscience.<a name=321:13></a> They may impose ceremonies and observances, for these suit man; but they can never bring an awakened conscience into relationship with themselves.<a name=321:14></a> That which man fears, and that which man desires, is the sphere of their influence.<a name=321:15></a> They produce nothing in the heart beyond the action of natural joys and fears.<a name=321:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The contest being with God Himself, the question with men is decided with more carelessness and less passion as to them.<a name=322:6></a> Passion allies itself less with the pride than with the will of man.<a name=322:7></a> Man, whatever his position, is the slave of those who pay him the tribute of their flattery.<a name=322:8></a> Self-will is more its own master.<a name=322:9></a> In this case, deceived by his vanity, the king finds himself bound by laws, apparently instituted to guard his subjects from his caprices, under colour of attributing the character of immutability to his will and to his wisdom -- a character that belongs to God alone.<a name=322:10></a> Daniel is cast into the lions' den.<a name=322:11></a> God preserves him.<a name=322:12></a> He will do the same for the remnant of Israel at the end of the age.<a name=322:13></a> The judgment, which the enemies of Israel sought to bring upon those who were faithful among that people, is executed upon themselves.<a name=322:14></a> But the effect of this judgment extends farther than in the former cases.<a name=322:15></a> Nebuchadnezzar forbade any evil being spoken of the God of Israel, and He extolled the King of heaven by whom he had been humbled.<a name=322:16></a> But Darius commands that in every place the God of Daniel and of Israel should be acknowledged, the only living God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and who had indeed delivered the man that trusted in Him.<a name=322:17></a> Historically it appears that Darius had some feelings of respect for God and for Daniel's piety.<a name=322:18></a> It was not his God, but the God of Daniel: still he honours Him, and even calls Him the living God.<a name=322:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that idolatry, impiety, the pride that exalts itself above everything, are the characteristics of the great empires which Daniel sets before us, and the causes of their judgment.<a name=322:20></a> The judgment results in owning the God of the Jews as the living and delivering God and the Most High that ruleth in the kingdom of men.<a name=322:21></a> The same features will be found in the last days.<a name=322:22></a> This terminates the first part of the book.<a name=322:23></a>

		It will be remarked that there is no question at all here of the assembly, except in such general terms as must apply to any saints whatever on the earth who looked up higher.<a name=327:8></a> It is well also to observe, that it is not the saints (as has been thought) who are given into the hand of the little horn, but the forms of the Jewish religion.<a name=327:9></a> God may will and permit, for the good of the saints, that there should be persecution; but He never gives up His saints to their enemies.<a name=327:10></a> He could not do it.<a name=327:11></a> He cannot leave and forsake His own.<a name=327:12></a> In a word, whatever may be the general principles capable of application during the course of the ages, this prophecy, as an especial and definite revelation, refers, like the whole Book, to the earth, of which the assembly is not, and to the Jews, with respect to whom God exercises His government on the earth.<a name=327:13></a>

		THE MINOR PROPHETS: INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before entering on the study of the minor prophets, I will avail myself of the opportunity they afford to make a few remarks on the prophetic writings in general, pointing out the subjects of which they treat.<a name=346:1></a> We may divide these books into four principal classes according to the subjects on which they speak -- subjects often connected with their dates.<a name=346:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1st.<a name=346:3></a> Those which speak of the great crisis of the capture of Jerusalem, and its consequences.<a name=346:4></a> These are Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel -- all the greater prophets excepting Isaiah.<a name=346:5></a> I place the book of Daniel in this class, though his chief subject be the consequences under Gentile rule, till the Lord come; because, in fact, that event changed the government of the world, setting aside (in judgment) the elect people; and, while speaking of the Gentiles, he does so in connection with the substitution of the Gentile monarchy for that of God in Israel, and in view of that people's destiny.<a name=346:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2nd.<a name=346:7></a> Those which speak of the judgment of the Gentiles as such.<a name=346:8></a> These are Jonah, Nahum, Obadiah.<a name=346:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3rd.<a name=346:10></a> Those which speak of the entire fall of Israel, and of the destiny that already threatened Judah, such as Isaiah, Hosea, Amos, Micah.<a name=346:11></a> They announced a penal judgment on the people, while unfolding with more or less extent the dealings of God in grace at the end.<a name=346:12></a> With the exception of Amos, who prophesied in the reign of Uzziah, earlier than the other three, they belong to the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (this last king forming an epoch in these prophecies, the Assyrian having overthrown the kingdom of Israel during the reign of Hezekiah, and threatened Jerusalem).<a name=346:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, we have Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who prophesied after the captivity: the first two for the encouragement of the people; the last to bear witness to the failure of the Jews who had returned from captivity, and to announce the testimony and the judgment of the last days, which should separate the remnant from the wicked around them.<a name=346:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not spoken of Joel and Habakkuk, because these two prophets have each a peculiar character, not applying to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=347>[Page 347]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		judgment of the Gentiles, like Nahum and Obadiah, and having no date to indicate a moral import founded on the condition of Israel.<a name=347:1></a> They both point out, in an especial manner, the judgments of the last days.<a name=347:2></a> Joel speaks of a particular invasion of the land, and of the judgment of the nations, which is fulfilled at the same period, in connection with the blessing of Israel.<a name=347:3></a> The Spirit in Habakkuk, whilst availing Himself of the occasion of a particular judgment, brings out the spiritual affections and the exercises of heart produced by the sight of the evil, and of the consequent judgment, and shews the condition of a soul taught of God in view of these things.<a name=347:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find thus in the prophets (taking a moral view of their subjects), first, the judgment of the people in general, the house of David being spared for a time, God raising up Hezekiah; and on this occasion the true Son of David is announced.<a name=347:5></a> This is contained in Hosea, Amos, Isaiah, and Micah.<a name=347:6></a> Secondly the judgment of Jerusalem, and the substitution of the Gentile monarchy, the people of God being entirely set aside; Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel; the last discussing all the great principles of relationship with God, and the destiny of all Israel as a land and nation.<a name=347:7></a> Thirdly, the judgment of the world -- Jonah, Nahum, and Obadiah.<a name=347:8></a> Fourthly, the desolation of the last days, by the northern army, and the judgment of the nations; followed by the temporal blessing of Israel, and, in the Spirit, of all flesh.<a name=347:9></a> This is Joel.<a name=347:10></a> Fifthly, the chastisement of God's people by the successful violence of the man to whom God allows power for this purpose.<a name=347:11></a> The spirit of the prophet, overwhelmed by the evil which he beholds in the people, and yet, still more so when they are oppressed by their haughty enemies, understands that the just shall live by faith; and that this oppression was needed to chastise the evil, and to allow the pride of man to reach that height of iniquity which leads to the judgment that annihilates his pride for ever.<a name=347:12></a> This is Habakkuk.<a name=347:13></a> The last chapter is the expression of the sentiments produced by this instruction -- the desires, the recollections, and the confidence of faith; a faith that rests on God Himself, in the midst of all those exercises of heart to which the history of His people gives birth in the faithful.<a name=347:14></a> Precious consolation, when we think of all that invests itself with the name of God!<a name=347:15></a> We next find, sixthly, that which appertains to the special circumstances of the Jews, who have been brought back to Jerusalem in view of the coming of Christ, and the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=348>[Page 348]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		consequences of that coming, as well as of the people's own responsibility with respect to the circumstances in which they already stood: -- Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.<a name=348:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There remain still some details to be pointed out.<a name=348:2></a> Jonah sets before us, in a very striking manner, the patient goodness of God towards a world of proud and careless sinners; and that in contrast with the impatience of the man to whom the oracles of God are committed, to see them accomplished for his self-satisfaction, even though it were by the execution of the judgment which grace would set aside on the humiliation of those who were its objects.<a name=348:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nahum however, shews us, that this judgment must in the end be executed, and that a long suffering -- the only result of which is to glorify God -- would at length give place to a judgment that should definitely and for ever put an end to all that exalted itself against God.<a name=348:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Obadiah reveals to us, not this general and public pride of the world, but the hatred to God's people which is especially seen in those who were outwardly connected with them, and who, according to the flesh, claimed a right to the inheritance of the firstborn.<a name=348:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The notice which God gives us in these prophets of His relationship with the world, and of the manner in which He looks upon it, is full of interest.<a name=348:6></a> Jonah presents the force of that expression in Peter, "a faithful Creator".<a name=348:7></a> In Isaiah we may have remarked the rich development of the ways of God in reference to Christ, and with Israel; and the connection of these things, both with each other, and with the judgment of the world.<a name=348:8></a> The purposes of God in government are largely opened in that book.<a name=348:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The three other great prophets instruct us in the vast importance of that crisis in the history of the whole world -- that critical moment when Jehovah ceased to govern it in the midst of His people, and removed the seat of His power into the midst of the Gentiles, and placed that power in the hands of men.<a name=348:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Amos and Hosea give us some precious light on the moral government of God; they furnish the reader of the Bible with striking pictures of the state of things -- the facts, which were the procuring cause of the judgment that God inflicted; not only the facts which resulted from God's dealings, but the conduct that gave rise to those dealings with His people.<a name=348:11></a> This exposure of their conduct is full of humbling interest.<a name=348:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first three chapters compose the first part, or the revelations of God's purposes with respect to Israel.<a name=352:2></a> From the outset Israel is treated as being in a state of rebellion against God The prophet was to unite himself to a corrupt woman (a prophetic type, I doubt not), whose conduct was the expression of that of the people.<a name=352:3></a> The son to whom she gives birth is a sign, by means of the name which the prophet is to give him, of the judgment of God on the house of Jehu, and on the kingdom of Israel, which should cease to exist.<a name=352:4></a> In fact, after the extinction of Jehu's family, although there were several kings, all was confusion in the kingdom of Israel -- the kingdom was lost.<a name=352:5></a> It is evident, that, although the zeal of Jehu was energetic in extirpating idolatry, so that in His outward government God could sanction and reward it (and, as testimony, must needs do so), yet the motives that governed him were far from pure.<a name=352:6></a> God, therefore, while in His public government blessing Jehu, shews here, where He reveals His thoughts and His real estimate of the work, that He judges righteously and holily; and that that which man brings in of ambition, of cruelty, and even of that false zeal which is but hypocrisy, concealing the gratification of its own will under the name of zeal for Jehovah -- all, in a word, which is of self, is not hidden from His eyes, and meets with its just reward, and so much the more from its being masked under the great name of Jehovah.<a name=352:7></a>

		God, having thus briefly but clearly pronounced the judgment of the people, immediately announces, with equal clearness, His sovereign grace towards them.<a name=353:2></a> "Nevertheless", saith He, by the mouth of the prophet, "the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered".<a name=353:3></a> But this grace opens the door to others besides the Jews.<a name=353:4></a> "In the place where it was said, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the sons of the living God".<a name=353:5></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:353">footnote</a></i>) The application of this passage to the Gentiles is stated by the apostle in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:24">Romans  9:24</a> - 26; where he quotes the end of chapter 2 in our prophet, as expressing grace towards the Jews, and the verse we are now considering towards the Gentiles: while Peter (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:10">1 Peter  2:10</a>), who speaks only to converted Jews, quotes the end of chapter 2 only.<a name=353:6></a> There is no doubt that the Jews will come in, according to this principle in the last days; but the Holy Ghost expresses Himself here -- as He has done in a multitude of passages quoted by the apostle -- so as to adapt Himself to the admission of the Gentiles, when the time, foreseen of God, should come.<a name=353:7></a> But here He goes farther, and announces the return of the children of Judah and of the ten tribes, reunited, and subject to one head, in the great day of the seed of God.<a name=353:8></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:353">footnote</a></i>) It is said, "they shall come up out of the land"; and this has been supposed to mean their return from a foreign land; but I have an idea that it is rather that they all come up as one people in their solemn feasts.<a name=353:9></a>

		Nothing also exhibits more fully the prolonged and marvellous patience of the love of God.<a name=360:2></a> It is the special object of this prophecy to set forth the moral condition of the people which led to the sentence of Lo-ruhamah, and then to that of Lo-ammi, unfolded in the summary of God's ways with the people given in chapters 1 to 3 -- the relationship that exists between the moral dealings of God and His unchangeable counsels -- the connection between these counsels and the affections according to which God accomplishes them -- the ingratitude of man in his behaviour with respect to these affections -- the longsuffering which the love of God causes Him to exercise towards His ungrateful people -- at last, that withdrawal on God's part which left His people a prey to their own corruption, and to the snares of the enemy.<a name=360:3></a> The result is, that the condition of His people obliges God to bring the Judgment upon them which their sin called for, when all the warnings of God by His messengers had been unavailing.<a name=360:4></a> But this gives place to the accomplishment of the counsels of God, who brings His people to repentance, after having long given them up to the fruits of their own doings, and thus enables them to enjoy the effects of His counsels.<a name=360:5></a>

		AMOS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophecy of Amos is one of those that speak of the moral condition of the people, and especially of Israel, who, as we have already seen in the historical books, represents more particularly the people as such; while Judah was but as an appanage of the house of David, although containing always a remnant of the people.<a name=371:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This prophecy, which does not extend so far down in the history of Israel as that of Hosea, is less fervent than the latter; sin is not pursued with that consuming fire of jealousy and of moral revenge, which characterises the burning and broken style of the prophet Hosea.<a name=371:2></a> Nothing, doubtless, can be more decided against evil than Amos; but, although very simple, he speaks, as it were, from higher ground.<a name=371:3></a> In Hosea we see the anguish of heart produced by the Holy Ghost, in a man who could not endure evil in the people whom he loved as being the people of God; while in Amos there is more of the calmness of God's own judgment.<a name=371:4></a> There is much less detail with respect to sin.<a name=371:5></a> Certain prominent transgressions of a special character are pointed out, and the most complete and absolute judgment is proclaimed.<a name=371:6></a> In the outset Jehovah, proclaiming His own rights from the place of His own throne, roars from Zion and utters His voice from Jerusalem.<a name=371:7></a> Afterwards, quite at the end, the restoration of the house of David and of Israel likewise is announced.<a name=371:8></a> We may remark that, before the judgment of Israel and Judah is declared, that also of the surrounding nations is pronounced; and this, on account of their hostile and cruel behaviour to the people of Israel, and on account of that also which was essentially cruel in them, and opposed even to the sentiments of humanity; for God takes cognizance of all these things.<a name=371:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With respect to Judah, Jehovah especially points out their contempt of the law and disobedience of His commandments.<a name=372:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Israel the sin specified has a character more independent of the law (the reason of which is easily understood, if we consider the condition of that people), and connected with that departure from the fear of God, which allows man to give way to the selfishness of his own heart, and to oppress those whom God regards.<a name=372:7></a> They sell the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes.<a name=372:8></a> They care not for the sufferings of the poor; but even at the altar -- supposed, at least, to be that of Jehovah -- they lie down upon garments pledged through poverty, and make merry with the fines inflicted for transgressions.<a name=372:9></a> Nevertheless God had brought them up out of Egypt, had destroyed their enemies to put them in possession of their lands, and had given them the tokens of an especial relationship with Himself, whether by persons set apart for Himself, or by those whom He had sent as messengers to them; but they had caused the former to defile themselves, and had commanded the latter not to prophesy in the name of Jehovah.<a name=372:10></a> The heart of God was crushed, as it were, by their sins; and His judgment should overtake them.<a name=372:11></a> The charge of despising the poor is often repeated in this prophecy (chapter 2: 7; 4: 1; 5: 11; 8: 6); and this in special connection with Israel.<a name=372:12></a>

		After having specified each one of the nations that were found on the territory promised to Abraham, God addresses Judah and Israel together -- the whole family whom He had brought up from Egypt.<a name=372:13></a> These only had Jehovah known of all the families of the earth; therefore would He punish them for their iniquities: a solemn but very simple principle.<a name=372:14></a> If we are in the place of testimony -- of testimony to God -- it is

		Chapter 8 renews the declaration, that the end of Israel was come on account of their iniquity.<a name=375:18></a> God would no longer pass it over.<a name=375:19></a> The prophet announces likewise the distress the people should come into from being deprived of all guidance from Jehovah.<a name=375:20></a> They who trusted in the vanities that Israel had set up for themselves should fall, and never rise again.<a name=375:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 9 presents Jehovah Himself as directing the judgment in such a manner that Israel should in no wise escape it, God treating them as He would the nations that were strangers to Him, as the Philistines or the Syrians, whom, in His providence, He had brought from other lands.<a name=375:22></a> Nevertheless God did not forget Israel.<a name=375:23></a> He executed the judgment Himself, so that, while Israel should be sifted among all the nations, not one grain should be lost.<a name=375:24></a> The wicked who did not believe in the judgment should be overtaken by it.<a name=375:25></a>

		In general, then, this prophet sets before us, not great public events in the government of God, but the ways of God with His people, in view of their moral condition; the ten tribes, or the kingdom of Israel, being looked at as representing all Israel as a responsible nation, the link of their condition at that time with their original position (when, through the grace and power of Jehovah, they had come up out of Egypt), being the golden calves of Sinai and of Bethel.<a name=376:8></a>

		Two principles, then, on which in fact the testimony of God may be rendered, are unfolded in this prophecy.<a name=381:3></a> First of all, man is called to render this testimony as a mark of faithfulness to God, for which he is responsible.<a name=381:4></a> This is the position in which we have already seen that Israel was placed.<a name=381:5></a> Their whole history is before us in confirmation of this thought.<a name=381:6></a> Blessed by God with nearness to Himself, Israel should have been a witness to the whole world of what the only true God was.<a name=381:7></a> But, wholly incapable of apprehending His grace towards the Gentiles (although the house of Jehovah was at all times the house of prayer for all nations), Israel failed even in maintaining their own faithfulness, and consequently therefore in that which was the only means of making the world, as such, to understand the true character of God.<a name=381:8></a> Instead therefore of being made a blessing to others, they only involved them in the divine judgments that were to fall upon themselves.<a name=381:9></a> This is the picture which Jonah sets before us in his own history at his first receiving the message of God.<a name=381:10></a> The same thing will take place at the end of the age.<a name=381:11></a> Israel, unfaithful to God amid the billows of this world, insensible through their blind unbelief to the judgment which is ready to swallow them up, will drag into the results of their own sin all the other nations; and then the intervention of God will bring the latter also to acknowledge His power and His glory.<a name=381:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us here remark, that the principle we are speaking of is always true.<a name=381:13></a> If those to whom God in His grace has committed a testimony, do not employ this testimony in behalf of others according to the grace that bestowed it, they will soon become unfaithful in their own walk before God.<a name=381:14></a> If they truly acknowledged God, they would feel bound to make known His name, to impart this blessing to others.<a name=381:15></a> If they do not own His glory and His grace, they will assuredly be unable to maintain their own walk before Him.<a name=381:16></a> God, who is full of grace, being our only strength, it cannot be otherwise.<a name=381:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first picture, then, that is set before us is that of a man called to be God's witness in the midst of a proud and corrupt world, which follows its own will, without regarding the

		authority or the holiness of God.<a name=382:1></a> But this man is not sufficiently near to God to enter into the spirit of His holy and loving ways; and therefore, knowing that He is gracious, shrinks from the task of representing such a God before the world.<a name=382:2></a> To invest himself with God's name for his own honour, Jonah, the Jew, would not refuse.<a name=382:3></a> But to bear the burden necessary to the maintenance of the testimony of such a God, so gracious, so longsuffering, as well as holy, this was too hard a thing for the proud and impatient heart of a man who desired to have his own will carried out in judgment, if the others would not obey it in holiness.<a name=382:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, that although Jonah ought to have lifted up his voice against Nineveh, it is from the presence of Jehovah he fled, not from the carnal opposition of the city.<a name=382:5></a> Christ, our blessed Lord, is the only One who accomplished the task of which we speak.<a name=382:6></a> He is the faithful witness.<a name=382:7></a> We may compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>, in which He speaks of the manner in which He undertook and accomplished it -- He who dwelt in a glory that placed Him so entirely above such a position, that sovereign grace alone could bring Him down into it -- a glory however which alone made Him capable of undertaking and accomplishing it, in spite of all the difficulties which the enmity of man put in His way.<a name=382:8></a> And great as His glory was, He accomplished the undertaken task of service as a duty in the humility of obedience, and that even unto death.<a name=382:9></a> See in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:1">Psalm  40:1</a>, 2 how far He went, and how -- sheltering Himself from nothing -- He puts His trust in God.<a name=382:10></a> He becomes man to accomplish this task (verse 6 - 8).<a name=382:11></a> He performs it faithfully (verse 9, 10), not concealing the truth and righteousness of Jehovah from the congregation of Israel.<a name=382:12></a> In verse 11 and following verses, under the deep pressure of the position He was in from man's iniquity and His taking up the cause of His people, He commits Himself to the tender mercies of Jehovah, praying (after having rendered testimony with a perfect patience) for judgment on His enemies, the enemies of God's testimony.<a name=382:13></a> For it is the time, under the Jewish economy, of judgment.<a name=382:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen that the judgments which fall upon the unfaithful witness, being at length acknowledged by himself, are the means through which the name of Jehovah becomes known and worshipped among the Gentiles.<a name=382:15></a> Here begins the second picture of the testimony -- the complete and entire rejection of the witness considered as the depositary of the first message.<a name=382:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, blessed be God!<a name=383:10></a> Christ went down into death; and, as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, so also the Son of man went down into the heart of the earth for the same period of time.<a name=383:11></a> But who could prevent His rising again?<a name=383:12></a> It was death here that was without strength, and not man.<a name=383:13></a> Death combated with One who had the power of life; and whether we consider the power of God, from whom Christ had merited resurrection, or the Person of the faithful witness Himself, it was not possible that He could be holden in the bands of Sheol.<a name=383:14></a> He is not only the faithful witness, but the firstborn from the dead.<a name=383:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now the second testimony begins.<a name=383:16></a> All that Israel could have been, all that belonged to man as responsible in himself, as far as testimony was concerned, has failed for ever.<a name=383:17></a> Christ Himself, the faithful One, has been rejected.<a name=383:18></a> Israel, consequently as the vessel of God's testimony in the flesh, is set aside.<a name=383:19></a> It is the risen One only, who can now bear testimony; and, we may add, bear it even to Israel, who is now become the object of mercy, instead of becoming the vessel of promise and of testimony.<a name=383:20></a> But this makes God return, so to speak, into His own character of lovingkindness.<a name=383:21></a> If Israel cannot, as a righteous one, be the vessel of the testimony of righteousness (and even, as a sinner, has rejected it), God returns to His own gracious character, as a faithful Creator; from which, moreover, in the depth of His own being, He never departed, although He put man to the proof, by bringing him into relationship with Himself, under every possible advantage, to see whether he could be a witness of righteousness -- of God on

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is God's controversy with Jonah at the end.<a name=384:11></a> He would refuse God the right of shewing mercy to His helpless creatures, and insist upon His rigorous execution of the sentence upon the Gentile world without even leaving space for repentance.<a name=384:12></a> God answers him, not at first by unfolding the counsels of His grace, but by appealing to the rights of His sovereign goodness, to His nature, to His own character.<a name=384:13></a> Nineveh has hearkened to God.<a name=384:14></a> Now, if God threatens, it is in order that man may turn from his iniquity and be spared.<a name=384:15></a> Why else should He warn the sinner?<a name=384:16></a> Why not leave him to ripen unwarned for judgment?<a name=384:17></a> But these are not the ways of God.<a name=384:18></a>

		It is sweet, after all, to see Jonah's docility in the end to the voice of God, manifested by the existence of this book, in which the Spirit uses him to exhibit what is in the heart of man, as the vessel of God's testimony, and (in contrast with the prophet, who honestly confesses all his faults) the kindness of God, to which Jonah could not elevate himself, and to which he could not submit.<a name=387:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark, that the case of Jonah is used in the New Testament in two ways, which must not be confounded together: as a testimony in the world, by the word of God -- a service with which the Lord compares His own: and afterwards as in the belly of the fish -- a circumstance used by the Lord as a figure of the time during which He lay in the grave.<a name=387:3></a> Jonah, by his preaching, was a sign to the Ninevites, even as the Lord was to the Jews, harder of hearing and of heart than those pagans who were afar from God.<a name=387:4></a> Jonah was also (in that which happened to him in consequence of his refusal to bear testimony) a type of that which befell Jesus when He bore the penalty of the people's sin, and when, being raised from the dead, He became the testimony of grace, and at the same time the occasion of judgment to those who had rejected Him.<a name=387:5></a> We have seen in his history that Jonah is a remarkable moral figure of Israel -- at least of Israel's conduct.<a name=387:6></a>

		The people, moved by the fear of Jehovah, hearkened to the words of His servant the prophet.<a name=411:15></a> But another difficulty stands in the way of faith; the painful inferiority of all that can be accomplished by the remnant of His people, when God brings them back from captivity.<a name=411:16></a> They can do nothing in comparison with the former manifestation of His glory in the midst of His people.<a name=411:17></a> The effect of the people's fall and of the captivity they had suffered is felt in everything.<a name=411:18></a> God cannot identify His glory with an authority different from His own, exercised over His people (and which must needs be so) as the result of His righteous judgment, of His government on earth.<a name=411:19></a> He may lift them up -- may restore them, because He loves them; but it is no longer the same thing.<a name=411:20></a> He cannot re-establish that direct connection which brings with it the manifestation of His power and glory.<a name=411:21></a> That relationship had ended in the judgment.<a name=411:22></a> The consciousness of this inferiority tends to weaken faith.<a name=411:23></a>

		ZECHARIAH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Zechariah is more occupied than either of the other two post-captivity prophets with the Gentile kingdoms under whose yoke the Jews were placed, and with the establishment in its perfection of the glorious system that was to accompany the presence of the Messiah; and, on the other hand, with the rejection of that Messiah by the remnant who had returned from captivity; with the state of misery and unbelief in which the people would be left, and by which they would at length be openly characterised; and, finally, with the last attacks of the enemies of Jehovah upon Israel, and especially those directed against Jerusalem.<a name=416:1></a> He announces the destruction of these enemies by the judgment of God, and the glory and holiness of the people after their deliverance by the arm of Jehovah, who should thenceforth reign and be glorified in all the earth.<a name=416:2></a> It is the complete history of Israel, and of the Gentiles in relationship with Israel, from the captivity to the end, as far as connected with Jerusalem, the restoration of which especially occupies the prophet.<a name=416:3></a> For if the house was the primary object in Haggai, Jerusalem is the central point in Zechariah; although in the course of the prophecy the temple, and still more the Messiah, have the most prominent place in the scene.<a name=416:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The date of Zechariah's prophecy is nearly the same as that of the prophecies of Haggai.<a name=416:5></a> There are two in Zechariah, besides that of the introduction; in Haggai, four.<a name=416:6></a> The first date in Zechariah is only a month or two before the last two in Haggai, which were given on the same day.<a name=416:7></a> At the date of the second prophecy in Zechariah (chapter 7) the temple was not finished as a whole, but sufficiently so to serve as a place of worship, although the dedication had not yet been celebrated.<a name=416:8></a>

		Chapter 1.<a name=416:9></a> The Spirit of God begins with an exhortation, founded on the proofs that the history of the people supplied of the manner in which the word of the prophets had taken hold of them.<a name=416:10></a> Jehovah's displeasure, of which these prophets had not failed to warn the people, had borne its fruit; but God was now taking knowledge of the conduct of the Gentiles, to whom He had committed the place of power, and who, being at ease themselves, did not care for the misery and ruin of God's people.<a name=416:11></a>

		Such, then, is the import of the first part of this prophecy: the judgment already accomplished displaying the virtue of Jehovah's word; God returning to Jerusalem with mercies and consolation, moved with jealousy for her, and sorely displeased with the nations that were at ease while she was in ruins.<a name=417:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The restoration of Jerusalem is described in chapter 2 in a very remarkable manner, which throws much light on the connection, already spoken of, between the return from the Babylonish captivity wrought by Cyrus, the servant, the righteous man from the east, and the deliverance to be granted by the manifestation of the Messiah.<a name=418:6></a> First of all, the full and entire restoration of Jerusalem is announced, Jehovah Himself being her safeguard, and securing prosperity and peace to her inhabitants, Himself, her glory, dwelling in the midst of her.<a name=418:7></a> We can easily understand what an encouragement such a promise, and such an interest on the part of Jehovah in Jerusalem, would be to them in their then state, even if the accomplishment were not then brought about.<a name=418:8></a>

		Jehovah calls to the people, and bids them come forth from the land of the north, an expression used for Chaldea, for they had been scattered to the four winds.<a name=418:9></a> The Babylonish captivity was the real sentence of Lo-ammi, as the return thence (Babylon being judged) was the earnest of a better deliverance from that which, in the last days, will represent Babylon.<a name=418:10></a> Zion is delivered, from her captivity in Babylon.<a name=418:11></a> But if, up to a certain point, this took place by means of Cyrus, it was by no means the full accomplishment of God's purposes.<a name=418:12></a> They were continuously, and yet are, subject to the heathen image and superscription.<a name=418:13></a> And, in a more special manner, the Jews will again be in subjection to that which bears the character of Babylon, and will be delivered from it; but it will be in those days when Jehovah shall manifest Himself in a glory that will admit of no resistance to His will.<a name=418:14></a> After the glory He will send to the nations that have spoiled Israel.<a name=418:15></a> The glory of Jehovah shall appear, and the enemies of His people shall be

		Chapter 5 shews us the other side of the picture, that is to say, the judgment of the wicked in Israel in the last days.<a name=423:2></a> The prophet sees an immense roll filled with a curse for the wicked, for those that sin against their neighbour and against the name of Jehovah, to cut off both them and their houses.<a name=423:3></a>

		In chapter 6 we are shewn the government of God in the four monarchies, but neither as immediate government on God's part nor merely that of human government.<a name=423:8></a> We have seen power committed to man in the person of Nebuchadnezzar, and that he had failed therein.<a name=423:9></a> But it was not the will of God immediately to resume the reins of government in the earth, neither to leave the earth to the wickedness and the will of man without any providential bridle, without any government.<a name=423:10></a> He controls them, not by acting directly, so as to maintain the testimony of His character and His ways, but by means of instruments whom He employs, the result of whose activity is according to His will.<a name=423:11></a> The only wise God can do this, for He knows all things and directs all things to the accomplishment of His purposes.<a name=423:12></a> This is the reason that we see all sorts of things morally in disagreement with His ways in government, which yet succeed: a chaos as to the present, but the issue of which will furnish a clue, that will make manifest a wisdom even more profound and admirable than that which was displayed in His own immediate government in Israel, perfect as this was in its place.<a name=423:13></a> It is that universal providence, which, in its results, satisfies the moral exigencies of the nature of God; while in the intermediate course of things free scope is left to the active energies of man's will.<a name=423:14></a>

		The full result is given in verses 9 - 15 in which the Branch is looked at as born and growing up in the place of His earthly glory, building the temple of Jehovah, bearing the glory, ruling upon His throne, a priest upon His throne, the true Melchisedec, maintaining for the earth the enjoyment of perfect peace -- the "counsel of peace" with Jehovah.<a name=424:9></a> This counsel of peace is maintained between Jehovah and the Branch (compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#85">Psalm  85</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>).<a name=424:10></a> Therefore should they come from far to build in the temple of Jehovah; and the testimony of prophecy should be made good by its fulfilment.<a name=424:11></a>

		Again we see the two elements which link the events and the dealings of God in the prophet's day, with the glorious circumstances of the last days.<a name=424:12></a> First, the overthrow of Babylon has already executed the judgment on the first oppressors of Jerusalem who led her captive.<a name=424:13></a> The whole system is thus judged in principle; as in the New Testament it is said of the adversary, "Now is the prince of this world judged".<a name=424:14></a> And then, the fulfilment of the promise is attached to the obedience of the remnant (verse 15).<a name=424:15></a> This continues with respect to Israel unto the end (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>, and even <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>and 4).<a name=424:16></a> But meantime the fulness of the Gentiles must come in independently of this on other grounds.<a name=424:17></a> At the end Israel, obedient (that is

	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark that in Zechariah (Babylon being already judged) we have neither man invested with the government, nor the moral character of the empires presented under the form of an image or that of beasts; but the government of God hidden, providential, but real, in connection with these empires.<a name=425:2></a> This is an element of much importance, if we would understand the whole system existing from the time of Nebuchadnezzar, and the return from captivity, until the end, when Christ shall reign in righteousness.<a name=425:3></a> The first part of the prophecy closes with the end of chapter 6.<a name=425:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophecy, from chapter 7 to the end of the book, has for its special object the introduction of the Messiah in Israel, with the consequences of His rejection.<a name=425:5></a> The same principles of responsibility and blessing, which we have already seen established with respect to the remnant on their return from Babylon, are found again here.<a name=425:6></a> The prophecy begins by calling to mind the insincerity of their lamentations and humiliation during the seventy years' captivity, and the example set them by the hardness of the people's heart, before that sorrowful period, which led to their dispersion among all the nations, the pleasant land being made desolate.<a name=425:7></a> But now Jehovah's love for Zion, His chosen city, excited His jealousy and His wrath against those who oppressed her.<a name=425:8></a> He was returned unto Zion, and she should be blessed as a city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah should be His holy mountain.<a name=425:9></a> Jerusalem should be abundantly blessed, her streets full of inhabitants, and her old men full of days.<a name=425:10></a> God would bring back His people from all the countries in which they had been scattered and captive.<a name=425:11></a> From the day in which His people had turned to Him and laid the foundation of the temple, blessing should flow as a river, even as misery and judgment had done before.<a name=425:12></a> The Jews who had returned from Babylon were placed under conditions of truth and uprightness for the enjoyment of these blessings (verse 16, 17).<a name=425:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides this, Jehovah declares, unconditionally, that their fast days should be joyful feasts, and that men should come from all nations to worship Jehovah at Jerusalem, and should take hold of the skirt of a Jew, knowing that God was with that people.<a name=425:14></a> Here are, then, the moral consequences of disobedience,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this last thought introduces many consequences and important events.<a name=426:2></a> The first two consequences are, that Israel should be put in possession of the whole territory which God had given them.<a name=426:3></a> Enemies from without would come, but Jehovah Himself would defend His house; and the result of this direct intervention would be, that no oppressor should pass through them any more.<a name=426:4></a> Jehovah Himself had already looked into this matter.<a name=426:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this immediate intervention of Jehovah, who encamps about His house (it is the defence of the city against the last attack of the Assyrians, which we have found more than once in the prophets), necessarily introduces the Messiah, in view of the events of the last days.<a name=426:8></a> Verse 9 speaks of this.<a name=426:9></a> It presents the Messiah in His personal character as King Messiah, but in a twofold aspect.<a name=426:10></a> And this is the reason why, in the New Testament, that portion only is quoted which relates to Jehovah's first coming.<a name=426:11></a> The King of Zion comes unto her.<a name=426:12></a> He is just, and brings in Himself power and salvation.<a name=426:13></a> This is the general idea, that which Zion needed, and which shall be accomplished in the last days.<a name=426:14></a> The Holy Ghost adds to this the personal character of the Lord, the spirit in which He presented Himself to Israel -- lowly and riding upon an ass.<a name=426:15></a> We all know the fulfilment of this at His first coming.<a name=426:16></a>

		Nevertheless, in spite of her pride and her confederacy with evil, Jerusalem shall be taken in the last days.<a name=431:2></a> We have seen, when studying the other prophets, that this will be the case; and then afterwards, when again besieged, Jehovah will intervene for the destruction of these enemies.<a name=431:3></a> This is very distinctly announced here.<a name=431:4></a> The nations shall be assembled by Jehovah; the city shall be taken and the houses rifled, and half the people led captive.<a name=431:5></a> Jehovah will then come forth against those nations, as we read in chapter 12 (compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#66">Isaiah  66</a>and <a href="../bible/Micah.htm#4">Micah  4</a>).<a name=431:6></a> He comes in the Person of Christ to the Mount of Olives, whence He ascended.<a name=431:7></a> The Mount of Olives cleaves in the midst, forming a great valley, spreading terror among the people who are there.<a name=431:8></a> But if Jehovah identifies Himself thus, so to speak, with the meek and lowly Jesus formerly on the earth, in order that the identity of the Saviour and Jehovah should be clearly acknowledged, it is not the less true that He will come from heaven in all His glory (as He Himself predicted, as well as the prophets beginning with Enoch).<a name=431:9></a> The heavenly saints will accompany Him in His public manifestation to the eyes of an astonished world.<a name=431:10></a> Marvellous glory for those that are His, with whom He will manifest Himself before all the wicked!<a name=431:11></a> For here it is Jehovah's public coming to the earth, as the righteous Judge, making war upon all that rebel against Him.<a name=431:12></a>

		MALACHI
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophecy of Malachi deals with the people brought back from the captivity of Babylon, and is most important as shewing the moral condition of the people consequent upon their return.<a name=433:1></a> Its last verses evidently close the testimony of Jehovah to the people, till the coming of him who should prepare the way of Jehovah, in a word, till John the Baptist.<a name=433:2></a> The law and the prophets were until John, and Malachi is professedly, and from the nature of his testimony, the last.<a name=433:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great moral principle unfolded in the book, is the insensibility of the people to that which Jehovah was for them, and to their own iniquity with respect to Jehovah -- their want of reverence for God, their despisal of Jehovah.<a name=433:4></a> Alas!<a name=433:5></a> this insensibility had reached such a point that, when the very actions that proved their contempt were laid before their consciences, they saw no harm in them.<a name=433:6></a> Nevertheless this did not alter the purposes and counsels of God, although it brought judgment on those who were guilty of it (see chapter 1: 2, 6; 2: 14; 3: 7, 13).<a name=433:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Malachi also distinguishes the remnant and that which characterised them, while proclaiming the punishment of the wicked, and the call of God to those who had ears to hear to bring them back to repentance -- a ministry which would restore moral order in the hearts of parents and children -- that relationship, from the maintenance and exercise of which, all earthly peaceful order according to God flows; and that order is what God is considering here.<a name=433:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the commencement of the prophecy Jehovah sets forth His love to Israel, slighted alas!<a name=433:9></a> by an ungrateful people, yet proved by their election from the beginning.<a name=433:10></a> Even while exhibiting the sad ingratitude of the people, Jehovah adheres to His own thoughts toward them.<a name=433:11></a> He will bless Israel, and He will judge Edom, in spite of the pride of the latter.<a name=433:12></a>

		The sin of Israel, and their offensive indifference in the service of their God, is shewn (verse 6 - 10).<a name=433:13></a> This gives occasion to another expression of grace -- the revelation of the name of Jehovah among all nations.<a name=433:14></a> Thus, the election of Israel, and mercy towards the Gentiles, are established amidst, and even on occasion of, the sin of the restored people.<a name=433:15></a> Verses 12 - 14

		In the midst of the pride of the wicked in their apparent success, the remnant are distinguished as being drawn together by their common spiritual wants and feelings, founded on the fear of Jehovah which governed them all.<a name=434:14></a> In their affliction they spake often one to another of these things;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#44:434">footnote</a></i>) and Jehovah hearkened and heard and wrote it down in His book.<a name=434:15></a> And they shall be His in the day when He maketh up His jewels.<a name=434:16></a> After this they should discern between the righteous and the wicked, between those that served God and those that served Him not.<a name=434:17></a> For the day was coming which should burn as an

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be remarked here, that all is in connection with the authority of Jehovah and His dispensations towards Israel, and with the conduct of Israel, as a nation, towards their God.<a name=435:5></a> That which belongs to the first coming of Christ, and its consequences to Israel, is not brought in here.<a name=435:6></a> John the Baptist is presented as the forerunner of Jehovah, who without doubt is Christ Himself, but who here comes as the Angel of the covenant, coming suddenly to His temple, and trying everything in Israel by fire and by His judgment, in order that the offering of Judah may be pleasant to Jehovah as in the days of old.<a name=435:7></a> The transgressions here spoken of are those of the people brought back from Babylon against Jehovah.<a name=435:8></a> The Gentiles, and their empire, are not seen here.<a name=435:9></a> All takes place between Israel only and Jehovah, the God of their fathers, as in former days between the people loved of God and Jehovah who loved them.<a name=435:10></a> A strange god is that which Jehovah will not endure.<a name=435:11></a> It is Levi, with whom His covenant had been; it was the priests, whose lips should have kept the true knowledge of Jehovah.<a name=435:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is even no king here spoken of; except that Jehovah, whose name is terrible among the heathen, is their king.<a name=435:13></a> Finally the people (Israel) are commanded to return to the law of Moses given at Horeb for all Israel.<a name=435:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have here Jehovah's unchangeable love for the people whom He gathered to Himself at Horeb, His controversy with them on account of their sins, the marking out of a faithful remnant, and the sending of a messenger before the execution of the judgment.<a name=435:15></a> Israel is looked at nationally, in their own relationship with Jehovah, as returned from captivity and awaiting the judgment of their God, who sends His messenger to forewarn them.<a name=435:16></a>

		The longsuffering of God towards Israel had been great; for, when they had rejected His Son, He sent them -- through the intercession of that same well-beloved Saviour on the cross -- the message by the mouth of Peter, that, if they repented, the Christ whom they had slain would return.<a name=436:3></a> But their leaders were more than deaf to this grace on the part of God, and their house still remains empty and desolate.<a name=436:4></a>

		At the time of the end, Elias -- whose mission was to call back an apostate Israel who had forsaken Jehovah to own Him in truth, and that, by the sovereign grace of God, although in connection with the law, and that Mount Horeb, whither he went to lay down the burden of his prophetic office, when rendered useless by the unbelief of the people -- Elias shall effectually accomplish his mission before the great and terrible day of Jehovah; in order that the curse of God may not fall upon the land of His delight in that day when He will definitively execute His judgments.<a name=436:5></a> It is on this account that John the Baptist is spoken of as being Elias, if Israel could receive it; for he answered to verse 1 of chapter 3, whilst, at the same time, he said he was not Elias; for in fact he did not at all fulfil verses 5, 6 of chapter 4 (compare <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:17">Luke  1:17</a>, 76).<a name=436:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophecy speaks to the conscience of those who lived at the time it was delivered (chapter 3: 10); and passes on -- shewing that at the end of those times Israel would be put on trial by the mission of grace -- to the last days, in which God would display His unchangeable love for His people, and His righteous judgment against evil, by separating a remnant unto Himself for blessing, and by executing judgment on the rebellious.<a name=436:7></a>

		Zechariah takes up two points: first the empires of the heathen and God's providential ways with Israel -- the times of the Gentiles -- Jerusalem is owned, but judged of God and stamped as Babylonish in its true character; but at the end the Branch, the Lord Jesus, sets crowns instead of fasting for the faithful -- Babylon being already judged -- and strangers should come and build in the temple of the Lord.<a name=437:3></a>

		From chapter 7 to the end, it is the relation of Israel with Christ, and His rejection and its consequences in the last judgment of Jerusalem; but for all that Jehovah, as we have often seen, would judge definitively all the nations assembled against her.<a name=437:4></a> The remnant would be brought to repentance, and Jerusalem be holiness to the Lord, nor should strangers defile it.<a name=437:5></a>

		Finally we have Malachi shewing us, the state the Jews soon got into, slighting all that was agreeable to God, and indifferent and insensible to their violating every righteous feeling; the practical separation of those that feared the Lord, and the coming of the Lord in judgment and deliverance: meanwhile their recall to the authority of the law, and the coming of Elias before the great and terrible day of the Lord, to turn their hearts in grace into the way of peace.<a name=437:6></a>
