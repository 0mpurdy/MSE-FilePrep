		1  Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the assembly which [is] in thine house.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  I thank my God, always making mention of thee at my prayers,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  hearing of thy love and the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  in such sort that thy participation in the faith should become operative in the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in us towards Christ [Jesus].<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  For we have great thankfulness and encouragement through thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to enjoin thee what is fitting,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  for love's sake I rather exhort, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  I exhort thee for <i>my</i> child, whom I have begotten in [my] bonds, Onesimus,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  once unserviceable to thee, but now serviceable to thee and to me:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  whom I have sent back to thee: [but do <i>thou</i> receive] him, that is, <i>my</i> bowels:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  whom <i>I</i> was desirous of keeping with myself, that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  but I have wished to do nothing without thy mind, that thy good might not be as of necessity but of willingness:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  for perhaps for this reason he has been separated [from thee] for a time, that thou mightest possess him fully for ever;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  not any longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, a beloved brother, specially to me, and how much rather to thee, both in [the] flesh and in [the] Lord?<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  If therefore thou holdest me to be a partner [with thee], receive him as me;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  but if he have wronged thee anything or owe anything [to thee], put this to my account.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  <i>I</i> Paul have written [it] with mine own hand; <i>I</i> will repay [it]: that I say not to thee that thou owest even thine own self also to me.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  Yea, brother, <i>I</i> would have profit of <i>thee</i> in [the] Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  Being confident of thine obedience, I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I hope that I shall be granted to you through your prayers.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  Epaphras salutes thee, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workmen.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.<a name=1:13></a>
