		1  The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Beloved, I desire that in all things thou shouldest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospers.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For I rejoiced exceedingly when [the] brethren came and bore testimony to thy [holding fast the] truth, even as <i>thou</i> walkest in truth.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  I have no greater joy than these things that I hear of my children walking in the truth.<a name=1:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Beloved, thou doest faithfully [in] whatever thou mayest have wrought towards the brethren and that strangers,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  (who have witnessed of thy love before [the] assembly,) in setting forward whom on their journey worthily of God, thou wilt do well;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  for for the name have they gone forth, taking nothing of those of the nations.<a name=1:5></a>

		8  <i>We</i> therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow-workers with the truth.<a name=1:6></a>

		9  I wrote something to the assembly; but Diotrephes, who loves to have the first place among them, receives us not.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with wicked words; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brethren; and those who would he prevents, and casts [them] out of the assembly.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good.<a name=1:9></a> He that does good is of God.<a name=1:10></a> He that does evil has not seen God.<a name=1:11></a>

		12  Demetrius has witness borne to him by all, and by the truth itself; and <i>we</i> also bear witness, and thou knowest that our witness is true.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  I had many things to write to thee, but I will not with ink and pen write to thee;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  but I hope soon to see thee, and we will speak mouth to mouth.<a name=1:13></a> Peace [be] to thee.<a name=1:14></a> The friends greet thee.<a name=1:15></a> Greet the friends by name.<a name=1:16></a>
