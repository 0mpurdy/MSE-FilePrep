		1  Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  -- my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  -- then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil.<a name=1:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		11  discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve thee:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that speaketh froward things;

	<div class="paragraph">
		13  [from those] who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of evil;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their course:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  -- for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead;

	<div class="paragraph">
		19  none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:

		20  -- that thou mayest walk in the way of the good, and keep the paths of the righteous.<a name=2:5></a>
