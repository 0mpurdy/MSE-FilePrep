		1  Paul, apostle, not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God [the] Father who raised him from among [the] dead,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Grace to you, and peace, from God [the] Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  to whom [be] glory to the ages of ages.<a name=1:2></a> Amen.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  I wonder that ye thus quickly change, from him that called you in Christ's grace, to a different gospel,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  which is not another [one]; but there are some that trouble you, and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  But if even <i>we</i> or an angel out of heaven announce as glad tidings to you [anything] besides what we have announced as glad tidings to you, let him be accursed.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  As we have said before, now also again I say, If any one announce to you as glad tidings [anything] besides what ye have received, let him be accursed.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For do I now seek to satisfy men or God?<a name=1:7></a> or do I seek to please men?<a name=1:8></a> If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  But I let you know, brethren, [as to] the glad tidings which were announced by me, that they are not according to man.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  For neither did I receive them from man, neither was I taught [them], but by revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For ye have heard [what was] my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  and advanced in Judaism beyond many [my] contemporaries in my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my fathers.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  But when God, who set me apart [even] from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [who were] apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  but I saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother of the Lord.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea which [are] in Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he ravaged:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  and they glorified God in me.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Then after a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with [me];
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  and I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations, but privately to those conspicuous [among them], lest in any way I run or had run in vain;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  (but neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised;)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  and [it was] on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat -- whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  (for he that wrought in Peter for [the] apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles,)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas [the] right hands of fellowship, that <i>we</i> [should go] to the nations, and <i>they</i> to the circumcision;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  only that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to [the] face, because he was to be condemned:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  for before that certain came from James, he ate with [those of] the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those of [the] circumcision;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before all, If <i>thou</i>, being a Jew, livest as the nations and not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of [the] nations,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of works of law [nor] but by the faith of Jesus Christ, <i>we</i> also have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on the principle of [the] faith of Christ; and not of works of law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be justified.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have been found sinners, then [is] Christ minister of sin?<a name=2:6></a> Far be the thought.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  For if the things I have thrown down, these I build again, I constitute myself a transgressor.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  For <i>I</i>, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, <i>I</i>, but Christ lives in me; but [in] that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness [is] by law, then Christ has died for nothing.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  O senseless Galatians, who has bewitched you; to whom, as before your very eyes, Jesus Christ has been portrayed, crucified [among you]?<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  This only I wish to learn of you, Have ye received the Spirit on the principle of works of law, or of [the] report of faith?<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Are ye so senseless?<a name=3:3></a> having begun in Spirit, are ye going to be made perfect in flesh?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Have ye suffered so many things in vain, if indeed also in vain?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, [is it] on the principle of works of law, or of [the] report of faith?<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Know then that they that are on the principle of faith, these are Abraham's sons;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  and the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations on the principle of faith, announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham: In thee all the nations shall be blessed.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  So that they who are on the principle of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For as many as are on the principle of works of law are under curse.<a name=3:10></a> For it is written, Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which [are] written in the book of the law to do them;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  but that by law no one is justified with God [is] evident, because The just shall live on the principle of faith;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  but the law is not on the principle of faith; but, He that shall have done these things shall live by them.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed [is] every one hanged upon a tree,)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Brethren, (I speak according to man,) even man's confirmed covenant no one sets aside, or adds other dispositions to.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  But to Abraham were the promises addressed, and to his seed: he does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed; which is Christ.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Now I say this, A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which took place four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  For if the inheritance [be] on the principle of law, [it is] no longer on the principle of promise; but God gave it in grace to Abraham by promise.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  Why then the law?<a name=3:17></a> It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the seed came to whom the promise was made, ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  But a mediator is not of one, but God is one.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  [Is] then the law against the promises of God?<a name=3:20></a> Far be the thought.<a name=3:21></a> For if a law had been given able to quicken, then indeed righteousness were on the principle of law;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  but the scripture has shut up all things under sin, that the promise, on the principle of faith of Jesus Christ, should be given to those that believe.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  But before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up to faith [which was] about to be revealed.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  So that the law has been our tutor up to Christ, that we might be justified on the principle of faith.<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  But, faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  for ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ.<a name=3:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  but if <i>ye</i> [are] of Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Now I say, As long as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  but he is under guardians and stewards until the period fixed by the father.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the principles of the world;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  So thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  But then indeed, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  but now, knowing God, but rather being known by God, how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly principles to which ye desire to be again anew in bondage?<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Ye observe days and months and times and years.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  I am afraid of you, lest indeed I have laboured in vain as to you.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  Be as <i>I</i> [am], for <i>I</i> also [am] as <i>ye</i>, brethren, I beseech you: ye have not at all wronged me.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  But ye know that in weakness of the flesh I announced the glad tidings to you at the first;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  and my temptation, which [was] in my flesh, ye did not slight nor reject with contempt; but ye received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  What then [was] your blessedness?<a name=4:10></a> for I bear you witness that, if possible, plucking out your own eyes ye would have given [them] to me.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you?<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  They are not rightly zealous after you, but desire to shut you out [from us], that ye may be zealous after them.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  But [it is] right to be zealous at all times in what is right, and not only when I am present with you -- 
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  my children, of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  and I should wish to be present with you now, and change my voice, for I am perplexed as to you.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  Tell me, ye who are desirous of being under law, do ye not listen to the law?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one of the maid servant, and one of the free woman.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  But he [that was] of the maid servant was born according to flesh, and he [that was] of the free woman through the promise.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  Which things have an allegorical sense; for these are two covenants: one from mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, which is Hagar.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her children;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her that has a husband.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  But <i>ye</i>, brethren, after the pattern of Isaac, are children of promise.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to Spirit, so also [it is] now.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  But what says the scripture?<a name=4:23></a> Cast out the maid servant and her son; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  So then, brethren, we are not maid servant's children, but [children] of the free woman.<a name=4:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And I witness again to every man [who is] circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated [from him], as many as are justified by law; ye have fallen from grace.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For we, by [the] Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Ye ran well; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the truth?<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  The persuasibleness [is] not of him that calls you.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  A little leaven leavens the whole lump.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  <i>I</i> have confidence as to you in [the] Lord, that ye will have no other mind; and he that is troubling you shall bear the guilt [of it], whosoever he may be.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  But <i>I</i>, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted?<a name=5:11></a> Then the scandal of the cross has been done away.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For <i>ye</i> have been called to liberty, brethren; only [do] not [turn] liberty into an opportunity to the flesh, but by love serve one another.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  but if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye are not consumed one of another.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  But I say, Walk in [the] Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil flesh's lust.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  but if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under law.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, disputes, schools of opinion,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revels, and things like these; as to which I tell you beforehand, even as I also have said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit God's kingdom.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  meekness, self-control: against such things there is no law.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  But they that [are] of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.<a name=5:20></a>

		25  If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.<a name=5:21></a>
