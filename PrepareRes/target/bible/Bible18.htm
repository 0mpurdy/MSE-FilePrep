		1  There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and this man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and abstained from evil.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And his substance was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; and this man was greater than all the children of the east.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And his sons went and made a feast in the house of each one on his day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And it was so, when the days of the feasting were gone about, that Job sent and hallowed them; and he rose up early in the morning, and offered up burnt-offerings [according to] the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.<a name=1:5></a> Thus did Job continually.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah; and Satan came also among them.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou?<a name=1:8></a> And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil?<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?<a name=1:12></a> Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is spread abroad in the land.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath, [and see] if he will not curse thee to thy face!<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand; only upon himself put not forth thy hand.<a name=1:15></a> So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  and [they of] Sheba fell [upon them] and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and behold, there came a great wind from over the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they died; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.<a name=1:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  and he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  In all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed anything unseemly to God.<a name=1:23></a>

		1  And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them to present himself before Jehovah.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And Jehovah said to Satan, From whence comest thou?<a name=2:2></a> And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil?<a name=2:4></a> and still he remaineth firm in his integrity, though thou movedst me against him, to swallow him up without cause.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  but put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, [and see] if he will not curse thee to thy face!<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah; and he smote Job with a grievous botch from the sole of his foot unto his crown.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And he took a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat among the ashes.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And his wife said to him, Dost thou still remain firm in thine integrity?<a name=2:10></a> curse God and die.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh.<a name=2:12></a> We have also received good from God, and should we not receive evil?<a name=2:13></a> In all this Job did not sin with his lips.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And three friends of Job heard of all this evil that was come upon him.<a name=2:15></a> And they came each one from his place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to condole with him and to comfort him.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice and wept.<a name=2:17></a> And they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward the heavens.<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; and none spoke a word to him; for they saw that [his] anguish was very great.<a name=2:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		1  After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And Job answered and said,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that said, There is a man child conceived.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  That day -- let it be darkness, let not +God care for it from above, neither let light shine upon it:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it; let clouds dwell upon it; let darkeners of the day terrify it.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  That night -- let gloom seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful sound come therein;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse Leviathan;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it wait for light, and have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the dawn:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, and hid not trouble from mine eyes.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Wherefore did I not die from the womb, -- come forth from the belly and expire?<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  Why did the knees meet me?<a name=3:7></a> and wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build desolate places for themselves,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that have not seen the light.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>

		3  Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands;
