		1  Paul, [a] called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to [those] sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word [of doctrine], and all knowledge,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  who shall also confirm you to [the] end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  God [is] faithful, by whom ye have been called into [the] fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of [the house of] Chloe, that there are strifes among you.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  But I speak of this, that each of you says, <i>I</i> am of Paul, and <i>I</i> of Apollos, and <i>I</i> of Cephas, and <i>I</i> of Christ.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Is the Christ divided?<a name=1:7></a> has Paul been crucified for you?<a name=1:8></a> or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  Where [is the] wise?<a name=1:15></a> where scribe?<a name=1:16></a> where disputer of this world?<a name=1:17></a> has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  but <i>we</i> preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God's power and God's wisdom.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.<a name=1:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born.<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, [and] things that are not, that he may annul the things that are;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  so that no flesh should boast before God.<a name=1:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  But of him are <i>ye</i> in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in [the] Lord.<a name=1:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And <i>I</i>, when I came to you, brethren, came not in excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  For I did not judge [it well] to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and <i>him</i> crucified.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And <i>I</i> was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of [the] Spirit and of power;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in God's power.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to nought.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  But we speak God's wisdom in [a] mystery, that hidden [wisdom] which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  but according as it is written, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  but God has revealed to us by [his] Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him?<a name=2:6></a> thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  But <i>we</i> have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which [is] of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual [things] by spiritual [means].<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  But [the] natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know [them] because they are spiritually discerned;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  but the spiritual discerns all things, and <i>he</i> is discerned of no one.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, who shall instruct him?<a name=2:10></a> But <i>we</i> have the mind of Christ.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And <i>I</i>, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  for ye are yet carnal.<a name=3:2></a> For whereas [there are] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  For when one says, <i>I</i> am of Paul, and another, <i>I</i> of Apollos, are ye not men?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Who then is Apollos, and who Paul?<a name=3:5></a> Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  <i>I</i> have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  For we are God's fellow-workmen; ye are God's husbandry, God's building.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it.<a name=3:11></a> But let each see how he builds upon it.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  If the work of any one which he has built upon [the foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but <i>he</i> shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  If any one corrupt the temple of God, <i>him</i> shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are <i>ye</i>.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  and <i>ye</i> [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of [the] mysteries of God.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man's day.<a name=4:3></a> Nor do I even examine myself.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  So that do not judge anything before [the] time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have [his] praise from God.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us the [lesson of] not [letting your thoughts go] above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for [such a] one against another.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  For who makes thee to differ?<a name=4:8></a> and what hast thou which thou hast not received?<a name=4:9></a> but if also thou hast received, why boastest thou as not receiving?<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that <i>we</i> also might reign with you.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death.<a name=4:12></a> For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  <i>We</i> [are] fools for Christ's sake, but <i>ye</i> prudent in Christ: <i>we</i> weak, but <i>ye</i> strong: <i>ye</i> glorious, but <i>we</i> in dishonour.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  and labour, working with our own hands.<a name=4:15></a> Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer [it];
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  insulted, we entreat: we are become as [the] offscouring of the world, [the] refuse of all, until now.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Not [as] chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you].<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus <i>I</i> have begotten you through the glad tidings.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways [as] they [are] in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  But some have been puffed up, as if I were not coming to you;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  but I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, but the power.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  What will ye?<a name=4:23></a> that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and [in] a spirit of meekness?<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>

		2  And <i>ye</i> are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned, in order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out of the midst of you.<a name=5:2></a>

		3  For <i>I</i>, [as] absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present,

		6  Your boasting [is] not good.<a name=5:4></a> Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened.<a name=5:6></a> For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed;

		9  I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with fornicators;

		35  But some one will say, How are the dead raised?<a name=15:32></a> and with what body do they come?<a name=15:33></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		36  Fool; what <i>thou</i> sowest is not quickened unless it die.<a name=15:34></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		37  And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain: it may be of wheat, or some one of the rest:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		38  and God gives to it a body as he has pleased, and to each of the seeds its own body.<a name=15:35></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		40  And [there are] heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but different is the glory of the heavenly, different that of the earthly:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		41  one [the] sun's glory, and another [the] moon's glory, and another [the] stars' glory; for star differs from star in glory.<a name=15:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		42  Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead.<a name=15:38></a> It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.<a name=15:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		43  It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory.<a name=15:40></a> It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.<a name=15:41></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		44  It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body: if there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [one].<a name=15:42></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		45  Thus also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit.<a name=15:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		46  But that which is spiritual [was] not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		47  the first man out of [the] earth, made of dust; the second man, out of heaven.<a name=15:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		48  Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and such as the heavenly [one], such also the heavenly [ones].<a name=15:45></a>

		50  But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom, nor does corruption inherit incorruptibility.<a name=15:47></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		51  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		52  in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and <i>we</i> shall be changed.<a name=15:48></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		53  For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality.<a name=15:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		54  But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word written: Death has been swallowed up in victory.<a name=15:50></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		55  Where, O death, [is] thy sting?<a name=15:51></a> where, O death, thy victory?<a name=15:52></a>
