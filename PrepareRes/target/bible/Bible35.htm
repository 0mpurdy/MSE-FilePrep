		2  Jehovah, how long shall I cry and thou wilt not hear?<a name=1:2></a> I cry out unto thee, Violence!<a name=1:3></a> and thou dost not save.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Why dost thou cause me to see iniquity, and lookest thou upon grievance?<a name=1:5></a> For spoiling and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Therefore the law is powerless, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked encompasseth the righteous; therefore judgment goeth forth perverted.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  See ye among the nations, and behold, and wonder marvellously; for [I] work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be declared [to you].<a name=1:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And their horses are swifter than the leopards, and are more agile than the evening wolves; and their horsemen prance proudly, and their horsemen come from afar: they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  They come all of them for violence: the crowd of their faces is forwards, and they gather captives as the sand.<a name=1:12></a>

		11  Then will his mind change, and he will pass on, and become guilty: this his power is become his +god.<a name=1:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		13  [Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on mischief: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, [and] keepest silence when the wicked swalloweth up a [man] more righteous than he?<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; for by them his portion is become fat, and his meat dainty.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Shall he therefore empty his net, and not spare to slay the nations continually?<a name=1:21></a>

		2  And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision, and engrave it upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but it hasteth to the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; for it will surely come, it will not delay.<a name=2:3></a>

		8  Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the rest of the peoples shall plunder thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence [done] to the land, to the city, and all that dwell therein.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Woe to him that getteth iniquitous gain to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the grasp of evil!<a name=2:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Thou art filled with shame instead of glory; drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of Jehovah's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and a shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For the violence [done] to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of beasts which made them afraid; because of men's blood, and for the violence [done] to the land, to the city, and all that dwell therein.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it?<a name=2:20></a> the molten image, and the teacher of falsehood, that the maker of his work dependeth thereon, to make dumb idols?<a name=2:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Was Jehovah wrathful with the rivers?<a name=3:11></a> Was thine anger against the rivers?<a name=3:12></a> Was thy rage against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Thy chariots of salvation?<a name=3:13></a>

		11  The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows which shot forth, -- At the shining of thy glittering spear.<a name=3:18></a>
