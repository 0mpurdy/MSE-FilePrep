	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines.<a name=2:8></a>

		12  I write to you, children, because [your] sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.<a name=2:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And the world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity.<a name=2:20></a>

		18  Little children, it is [the] last hour, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is [the] last hour.<a name=2:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		19  They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us.<a name=2:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And <i>ye</i> have [the] unction from the holy [one], and ye know all things.<a name=2:23></a>

		22  Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?<a name=2:25></a> <i>He</i> is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.<a name=2:26></a>

		23  Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.<a name=2:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		24  As for <i>you</i> let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, <i>ye</i> also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.<a name=2:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And this is the promise which <i>he</i> has promised us, life eternal.<a name=2:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		26  These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray:

		27  and <i>yourselves</i>, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you, and ye have not need that any one should teach you; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him.<a name=2:30></a>

		28  And now, children, abide in him, that if he be manifested we may have boldness, and not be put to shame from before him at his coming.<a name=2:31></a>

		1  See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called [the] children of God.<a name=3:1></a> For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not.<a name=3:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<a name=3:3></a>

		4  Every one that practises sin practises also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.<a name=3:5></a>

		8  He that practises sin is of the devil; for from [the] beginning the devil sins.<a name=3:9></a> To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.<a name=3:11></a>

		10  In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil.<a name=3:12></a> Whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God, and he who does not love his brother.<a name=3:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		11  For this is the message which ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:

		12  not as Cain was of the wicked one, and slew his brother; and on account of what slew he him?<a name=3:14></a> because his works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous.<a name=3:15></a>

		14  <i>We</i> know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren.<a name=3:17></a> He who does not love [his] brother abides in death.<a name=3:18></a>

		17  But whoso may have the world's substance, and see his brother having need, and shut up his bowels from him, how abides the love of God in him?<a name=3:21></a>

		18  Children, let us not love with word, nor with tongue, but in deed and in truth.<a name=3:22></a>
