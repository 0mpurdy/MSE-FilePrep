		16  and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David [were] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, that is, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of [the] Holy Spirit.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  But Joseph, her husband, being [a] righteous [man], and unwilling to expose her publicly, purposed to have put her away secretly;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to [thee] Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of [the] Holy Spirit.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for <i>he</i> shall save his people from their sins.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord, through the prophet, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us.<a name=1:9></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  But Joseph, having awoke up from his sleep, did as the angel of [the] Lord had enjoined him, and took to [him] his wife,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.<a name=1:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, behold magi from the east arrived at Jerusalem, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Where is the king of the Jews that has been born?<a name=2:1></a> for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  But Herod the king having heard [of it], was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  and, assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written through the prophet:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And <i>thou</i> Bethlehem, land of Juda, art in no wise the least among the governors of Juda; for out of thee shall go forth a leader who shall shepherd my people Israel.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Then Herod, having secretly called the magi, inquired of them accurately the time of the star that was appearing;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  and having sent them to Bethlehem, said, Go, search out accurately concerning the child, and when ye shall have found [him] bring me back word, so that <i>I</i> also may come and do him homage.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And they having heard the king went their way; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother, and falling down did him homage.<a name=2:8></a> And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And being divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Now, they having departed, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take to [thee] the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And, having arisen, he took to [him] the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And he was there until the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, was greatly enraged; and sent and slew all the boys which [were] in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time which he had accurately inquired from the magi.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  A voice has been heard in Rama, weeping, and great lamentation: Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  But Herod having died, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  Arise, take to [thee] the little child and its mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they who sought the life of the little child are dead.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And he arose and took to [him] the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  but having heard that 'Archelaus reigns over Judaea, instead of Herod his father,' he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazaraene.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Now in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, saying, Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of [the] Lord, make straight his paths.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And John himself had his garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  and were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  <i>I</i> indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear; <i>he</i> shall baptise you with [the] Holy Spirit and fire;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  whose winnowing fan [is] in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor, and shall gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  but John urgently forbad him, saying, <i>I</i> have need to be baptised of thee; and comest <i>thou</i> to me?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  But Jesus answering said to him, Suffer [it] now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.<a name=3:11></a> Then he suffers him.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  and behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Then Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he hungered.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And the tempter coming up to him said, If thou be Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Then the devil takes him to the holy city, and sets him upon the edge of the temple,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  and says to him, If thou be Son of God cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee, and on [their] hands shall they bear thee, lest in anywise thou strike thy foot against a stone.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Jesus said to him, It is again written, Thou shalt not tempt [the] Lord thy God.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain, and shews him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  and says to him, All these things will I give thee if, falling down, thou wilt do me homage.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Then says Jesus to him, Get thee away, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt do homage to [the] Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Then the devil leaves him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  But having heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  and having left Nazareth, he went and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the sea-side in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Land of Zabulon and land of Nepthalim, way of [the] sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  -- the people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in [the] country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  From that time began Jesus to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And they, having left their trawl-nets, immediately followed him.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And going on thence he saw other two brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their trawl-nets, and he called them;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  and they, having left the ship and their father, immediately followed him.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And [Jesus] went round the whole [of] Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And his fame went out into the whole [of] Syria, and they brought to him all that were ill, suffering under various diseases and pains, and those possessed by demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And great crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and beyond the Jordan.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  and, having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Blessed [are] the poor in spirit, for <i>theirs</i> is the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		12  Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for thus have they persecuted the prophets who were before you.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  <i>Ye</i> are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have become insipid, wherewith shall it be salted?<a name=5:11></a> It is no longer fit for anything but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men.<a name=5:12></a>

		14  <i>Ye</i> are the light of the world: a city situated on the top of a mountain cannot be hid.<a name=5:13></a>

		19  Whosoever then shall do away with one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever shall practise and teach [them], <i>he</i> shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  For I say unto you, that unless your righteousness surpass [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=5:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow:

	<div class="paragraph">
		4  and as he sowed, some [grains] fell along the way, and the birds came and devoured them;

	<div class="paragraph">
		6  but when the sun rose they were burned up, and because of not having [any] root were dried up;

	<div class="paragraph">
		9  He that has ears, let him hear.<a name=13:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And the disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?<a name=13:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given;

	<div class="paragraph">
		12  for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be caused to be in abundance; but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.<a name=13:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.<a name=13:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		16  But blessed are <i>your</i> eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear;

	<div class="paragraph">

		19  From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [it], the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart: this is he that is sown by the wayside.<a name=13:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		20  But he that is sown on the rocky places -- this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,

	<div class="paragraph">
		21  but has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended.<a name=13:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  And he that is sown among the thorns -- this is he who hears the word, and the anxious care of this life, and the deceit of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.<a name=13:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		23  But he that is sown upon the good ground -- this is he who hears and understands the word, who bears fruit also, and produces, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.<a name=13:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away.<a name=13:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also.<a name=13:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field?<a name=13:16></a> whence then has it darnel?<a name=13:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this.<a name=13:18></a> And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]?<a name=13:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it.<a name=13:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary.<a name=13:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and sowed in his field;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.<a name=13:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened.<a name=13:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world's foundation.<a name=13:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		36  Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field.<a name=13:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		37  But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		38  and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one];
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		39  and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels.<a name=13:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		40  As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age.<a name=13:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		41  The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		42  and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<a name=13:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		43  Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=13:29></a> He that has ears, let him hear.<a name=13:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		44  The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field.<a name=13:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		45  Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		46  and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it.<a name=13:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		47  Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		48  which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out.<a name=13:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		49  Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just,

		52  And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [that is] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.<a name=13:37></a>

		54  And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this [man] this wisdom and these works of power?<a name=13:39></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And from that time he sought a good opportunity that he might deliver him up.<a name=26:13></a>

		17  Now on the first [day] of [the feast of] unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?<a name=26:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And he said, Go into the city unto such a one, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near, I will keep the passover in thy house with my disciples.<a name=26:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover.<a name=26:16></a>

		20  And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve.<a name=26:17></a>

		21  And as they were eating he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.<a name=26:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him, each of them, Is it <i>I</i>, Lord?<a name=26:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  But he answering said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, <i>he</i> it is who shall deliver me up.<a name=26:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  The Son of man goes indeed, according as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; it were good for that man if he had not been born.<a name=26:21></a>

		25  And Judas, who delivered him up, answering said, Is it <i>I</i>, Rabbi?<a name=26:22></a> He says to him, <i>Thou</i> hast said.<a name=26:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken [the] bread and blessed, broke [it] and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<a name=26:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  And having taken [the] cup and given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.<a name=26:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  For this is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins.<a name=26:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		30  And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.<a name=26:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  Then saith Jesus to them, All <i>ye</i> shall be offended in me during this night.<a name=26:29></a> For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.<a name=26:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  But after that I shall be risen, I will go before you to Galilee.<a name=26:31></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that during this night, before [the] cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<a name=26:33></a>

		35  Peter says to him, If I should needs die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee.<a name=26:34></a> Likewise said all the disciples also.<a name=26:35></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		36  Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here until I go away and pray yonder.<a name=26:36></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		39  And going forward a little he fell upon his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as <i>I</i> will, but as <i>thou</i> [wilt].<a name=26:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		40  And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me?<a name=26:40></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		41  Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] ready, but the flesh weak.<a name=26:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		42  Again going away a second time he prayed saying, My Father, if this cannot pass [from me] unless I drink it, thy will be done.<a name=26:42></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		43  And coming he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.<a name=26:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		44  And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.<a name=26:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		45  Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, Sleep on now and take your rest; behold, the hour has drawn nigh, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.<a name=26:45></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		46  Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh.<a name=26:46></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		47  And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people.<a name=26:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		48  Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is: seize him.<a name=26:48></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		49  And immediately coming up to Jesus he said, Hail, Rabbi, and covered him with kisses.<a name=26:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		50  But Jesus said to him, [My] friend, for what purpose art thou come?<a name=26:50></a> Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him.<a name=26:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		51  And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear.<a name=26:52></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		52  Then saith Jesus to him, Return thy sword to its place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword.<a name=26:53></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		53  Or thinkest thou that I cannot now call upon my Father, and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels?<a name=26:54></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		54  How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?<a name=26:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		55  In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me?<a name=26:56></a> I sat daily [with you] teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.<a name=26:57></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		56  But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled.<a name=26:58></a> Then all the disciples left him and fled.<a name=26:59></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		57  Now they that had seized Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.<a name=26:60></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		58  And Peter followed him at a distance, even to the palace of the high priest, and entering in sat with the officers to see the end.<a name=26:61></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		59  And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.<a name=26:62></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		60  And they found none, though many false witnesses came forward.<a name=26:63></a> But at the last two false witnesses came forward
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		61  and said, <i>He</i> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it.<a name=26:64></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		62  And the high priest standing up said to him, Answerest thou nothing?<a name=26:65></a> What do these witness against thee?<a name=26:66></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		63  But Jesus was silent.<a name=26:67></a> And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if <i>thou</i> art the Christ the Son of God.<a name=26:68></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		64  Jesus says to him, <i>Thou</i> hast said.<a name=26:69></a> Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.<a name=26:70></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		65  Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed: what need have we any more of witnesses?<a name=26:71></a> behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy.<a name=26:72></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		66  What think ye?<a name=26:73></a> And they answering said, He is liable to the penalty of death.<a name=26:74></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		67  Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and some struck him with the palms of their hand,

	<div class="paragraph">
		68  saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, Who is it who struck thee?<a name=26:75></a>
	</div>

		70  But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what thou sayest.<a name=26:77></a>

		71  And when he had gone out into the entrance, another [maid] saw him, and says to those there, This [man] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean.<a name=26:78></a>

		73  And after a little, those who stood [there], coming to [him], said to Peter, Truly <i>thou</i> too art of them, for also thy speech makes thee manifest.<a name=26:80></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		75  And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said [to him], Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.<a name=26:83></a> And he went forth without, and wept bitterly.<a name=26:84></a>

		27  Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus with [them] to the praetorium, gathered against him the whole band,

		33  And having come to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a skull,

	<div class="paragraph">
		41  [And] in like manner the chief priests also, mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		49  But the rest said, Let be; let us see if Elias comes to save him.<a name=27:52></a>
