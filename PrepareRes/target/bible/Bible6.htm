		1  And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' attendant, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Moses my servant is dead; and now, rise up, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land which I give unto them, to the children of Israel.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread have I given to you, as I said unto Moses.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river, the river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, to the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.<a name=1:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		5  None shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee; I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.<a name=1:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn unto their fathers to give them.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Only be strong and very courageous, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded thee.<a name=1:6></a> Turn not from it to the right or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  This book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth; and thou shalt meditate upon it day and night, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou have good success in thy ways, and then shalt thou prosper.<a name=1:8></a>

		10  And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Go through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves victuals, for in three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, that ye may enter in to take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh spoke Joshua, saying,

	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall abide in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan, but ye, all the valiant men, shall go over in array before your brethren and help them,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  until Jehovah give your brethren rest as to you, and they also take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth them; then shall ye return into the land of your possession and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sun-rising.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us will we do, and whither thou shalt send us will we go.<a name=1:14></a>

		1  And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two spies secretly, saying, Go, see the land, even Jericho.<a name=2:1></a> And they went, and came into a harlot's house, named Rahab, and they lay down there.<a name=2:2></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way, after they came out of Egypt, [them] had they not circumcised.<a name=5:5></a>
