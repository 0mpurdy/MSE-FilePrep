		2  in [the] hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  but has manifested in its own due season his word, in [the] proclamation with which <i>I</i> have been entrusted, according to [the] commandment of our Saviour God;
	</div>

		6  if any one be free from all charge [against him], husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of excess or unruly.<a name=1:2></a>

		8  but hospitable, a lover of goodness, discreet, just, pious, temperate,

		13  This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,

		7  in all things affording thyself as a pattern of good works; in teaching uncorruptedness, gravity,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  a sound word, not to be condemned; that he who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us:

		11  For the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  teaching us that, having denied impiety and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and justly, and piously in the present course of things,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;

		2  to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, [to be] mild, shewing all meekness towards all men.<a name=3:1></a>

		3  For we were once ourselves also without intelligence, disobedient, wandering in error, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another.<a name=3:2></a>

		4  But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  not on the principle of works which [have been done] in righteousness which <i>we</i> had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through [the] washing of regeneration and renewal of [the] Holy Spirit,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  that, having been justified by <i>his</i> grace, we should become heirs according to [the] hope of eternal life.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  The word [is] faithful, and I desire that thou insist strenuously on these things, that they who have believed God may take care to pay diligent attention to good works.<a name=3:4></a> These things are good and profitable to men.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  But foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and contentions about the law, shun; for they are unprofitable and vain.<a name=3:6></a>

		10  An heretical man after a first and second admonition have done with,

	<div class="paragraph">
		14  and let ours also learn to apply themselves to good works for necessary wants, that they may not be unfruitful.<a name=3:9></a>
