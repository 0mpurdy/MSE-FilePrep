		2  I have loved you, saith Jehovah; but ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?<a name=1:2></a> Was not Esau Jacob's brother?<a name=1:3></a> saith Jehovah, and I loved Jacob,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  and I hated Esau; and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  If Edom say, We are broken down, but we will build again the ruined places, -- thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and [men] shall call them the territory of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.<a name=1:5></a>

		6  A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour?<a name=1:7></a> and if I be a master, where is my fear?<a name=1:8></a> saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, priests, that despise my name.<a name=1:9></a> But ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee?<a name=1:11></a> In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.<a name=1:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?<a name=1:13></a> And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?<a name=1:14></a> Present it now unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee?<a name=1:15></a> or will he accept thy person?<a name=1:16></a> saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us.<a name=1:18></a> This hath been of your hand: will he accept any of your persons?<a name=1:19></a> saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=1:20></a>

		10  Who is there among you that would even shut the doors?<a name=1:21></a> and ye would not kindle [fire] on mine altar for nothing.<a name=1:22></a> I have no delight in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an oblation at your hand.<a name=1:23></a>

		13  And ye say, Behold, what a weariness!<a name=1:26></a> And ye have puffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and ye bring [that which was] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the oblation: should I accept this of your hand?<a name=1:27></a> saith Jehovah.<a name=1:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Yea, cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the nations.<a name=1:29></a>

		1  And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  If ye do not hear, and if ye do not lay [it] to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will even send the curse among you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have already cursed them, because ye do not lay [it] to heart.<a name=2:2></a>

		4  And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled before my name.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people, because ye have not kept my ways, but have respect of persons in [administering] the law.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Have we not all one father?<a name=2:10></a> Hath not one God created us?<a name=2:11></a> Why do we deal unfaithfully every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Judah hath dealt unfaithfully, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the sanctuary of Jehovah which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange God.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob the man that doeth this, him that calleth and him that answereth; and him that offereth an oblation unto Jehovah of hosts.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And further ye do this: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the oblation any more, nor receiveth [it] with satisfaction at your hand.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Yet ye say, Wherefore?<a name=2:16></a> Because Jehovah hath been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt unfaithfully: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And did not one make [them]?<a name=2:18></a> and the remnant of the Spirit was his.<a name=2:19></a> And wherefore the one?<a name=2:20></a> He sought a seed of God.<a name=2:21></a> Take heed then to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  (for I hate putting away, saith Jehovah the God of Israel;) and he covereth with violence his garment, saith Jehovah of hosts: take heed then to your spirit, that ye deal not unfaithfully.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words, and ye say, Wherein have we wearied [him]?<a name=2:23></a> In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?<a name=2:24></a>

		1  Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  But who shall endure the day of his coming?<a name=3:2></a> and who shall stand when he appeareth?<a name=3:3></a> For he will be like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' lye.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hired servant in [his] wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his right], and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>

		6  For I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes, and have not kept them.<a name=3:9></a> Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=3:10></a> But ye say, Wherein shall we return?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Will a man rob God?<a name=3:12></a> But ye rob me.<a name=3:13></a> And ye say, Wherein do we rob thee?<a name=3:14></a> [In] tithes and heave-offerings.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Ye are cursed with a curse; and me ye rob, [even] this whole nation.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=3:19></a>

		13  Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but ye say, What have we been speaking against thee?<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And now we hold the proud for happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and they escape.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed [it], and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.<a name=3:25></a>
