		2  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  according as he has chosen us in him before [the] world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  to [the] praise of [the] glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  which he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  for [the] administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  in whom we have also obtained an inheritance, being marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  that we should be to [the] praise of his glory who have pre-trusted in the Christ:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  in whom <i>ye</i> also [have trusted], having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  who is [the] earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to [the] praise of his glory.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Wherefore <i>I</i> also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which [is] in you, and the love which [ye have] towards all the saints,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention [of you] at my prayers,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you [the] spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, [and] what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  [in] which he wrought in the Christ [in] raising him from among [the] dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies,

	<div class="paragraph">
		21  above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  and has put all things under his feet, and gave him [to be] head over all things to the assembly,

	<div class="paragraph">
		23  which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all:

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  and <i>you</i>, being dead in your offences and sins -- 
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  in which ye once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  among whom <i>we</i> also all once had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh, doing what the flesh and the thoughts willed to do, and were children, by nature, of wrath, even as the rest:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  but God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  (we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us with the Christ, (ye are saved by grace,)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  and has raised [us] up together, and has made [us] sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  that he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  For ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  not on the principle of works, that no one might boast.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has before prepared that we should walk in them.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Wherefore remember that <i>ye</i>, once nations in [the] flesh, who [are] called uncircumcision by that called circumcision in [the] flesh done with the hand;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  that ye were at that time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  but now in Christ Jesus <i>ye</i> who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For <i>he</i> is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of enclosure,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  having annulled the enmity in his flesh, the law of commandments in ordinances, that he might form the two in himself into one new man, making peace;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  and might reconcile both in one body to God by the cross, having by it slain the enmity;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  and, coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who [were] afar off, and [the glad tidings of] peace to those [who were] nigh.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  in whom all [the] building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord;

		1  For this reason <i>I</i> Paul, prisoner of the Christ Jesus for you nations,

	<div class="paragraph">
		2  (if indeed ye have heard of the administration of the grace of God which has been given to me towards you,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  that by revelation the mystery has been made known to me, (according as I have written before briefly,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  which in other generations has not been made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in [the power of the] Spirit,

	<div class="paragraph">
		6  that [they who are of] the nations should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of [his] promise in Christ Jesus by the glad tidings;

		8  To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ,

		9  and to enlighten all [with the knowledge of] what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God, who has created all things,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God,

		11  according to [the] purpose of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,

		13  Wherefore I beseech [you] not to faint through my tribulations for you, which is your glory.<a name=3:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For this reason I bow my knees to the Father [of our Lord Jesus Christ],
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  of whom every family in [the] heavens and on earth is named,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man;

	<div class="paragraph">
		17  that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love,

	<div class="paragraph">
		18  in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what [is] the breadth and length and depth and height;

	<div class="paragraph">
		20  But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think, according to the power which works in us,

		1  <i>I</i>, the prisoner in [the] Lord, exhort you therefore to walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye have been called,

	</div>

		10  He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things;

		11  and <i>he</i> has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers,

		12  for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to [the] work of [the] ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ;

		15  but, holding the truth in love, we may grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ:

		16  from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to [the] working in [its] measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  This I say therefore, and testify in [the] Lord, that ye should no longer walk as [the rest of] the nations walk in [the] vanity of their mind,

	<div class="paragraph">
		18  being darkened in understanding, estranged from the life of God by reason of the ignorance which is in them, by reason of the hardness of their hearts,

		20  But <i>ye</i> have not thus learnt the Christ,

		31  Let all bitterness, and heat of passion, and wrath, and clamour, and injurious language, be removed from you, with all malice;

		3  But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled lust, let it not be even named among you, as it becomes saints;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For this ye are [well] informed of, knowing that no fornicator, or unclean person, or person of unbridled lust, who is an idolater, has inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God.<a name=5:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,

	<div class="paragraph">
		21  submitting yourselves to one another in [the] fear of Christ.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  Wives, [submit yourselves] to your own husbands, as to the Lord,

	<div class="paragraph">
		24  But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything.<a name=5:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		25  Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it,

	</div>

		28  So ought men also to love their own wives as their own bodies: he that loves his own wife loves himself.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly:
