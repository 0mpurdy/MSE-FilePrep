		1  And it came to pass after the death of Joshua that the children of Israel asked Jehovah, saying, Which of us shall go up against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot; and Simeon went with him.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote them in Bezek, ten thousand men.<a name=1:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy kings, with their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gleaned under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me.<a name=1:7></a> And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.<a name=1:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And she said to him, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water.<a name=1:17></a> And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.<a name=1:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And Jehovah was with Judah; and he took possession of the hill-country, for he did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And they gave to Caleb Hebron, as Moses had said; and he dispossessed from thence the three sons of Anak.<a name=1:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And he shewed them how to enter into the city.<a name=1:28></a> And they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.<a name=1:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		27  And Manasseh did not dispossess Beth-shean and its dependent villages, nor Taanach and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages; and the Canaanites would dwell in that land.<a name=1:31></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  Naphtali did not dispossess the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; and he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.<a name=1:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country, for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley.<a name=1:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  And the Amorites would dwell on mount Heres, in Ajalon and in Shaalbim; but the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, and they became tributaries.<a name=1:38></a>

		1  And the Angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you; and as for you,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not hearkened unto my voice.<a name=2:1></a> Why have ye done this?<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be [scourges] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And it came to pass, when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice and wept.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And Joshua dismissed the people, and the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had seen all the great works of Jehovah, which he had done for Israel.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten years old.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Heres, in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the mountain of Gaash.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, which knew not Jehovah, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baals.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked Jehovah to anger.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about; and they could not any longer stand before their enemies.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Whithersoever they went out the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had said, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them; and they were greatly distressed.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And Jehovah raised up judges, and they saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  But they did not even hearken to their judges, for they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves to them; they turned quickly out of the way that their fathers had walked in, obeying the commandments of Jehovah; they did not so.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented Jehovah because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them.<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And it came to pass when the judge died, that they turned back and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them: they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel; and he said, Because this nation hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and hath not hearkened unto my voice,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  I also will not henceforth dispossess from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without dispossessing them hastily, neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.<a name=2:21></a>

		1  And these are the nations that Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, all that had not known all the wars of Canaan;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  only that the generations of the children of Israel might know war by learning it, at the least those who before had known nothing thereof:

	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites: Hittites and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites;

	<div class="paragraph">
		6  and they took their daughters as wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgot Jehovah their God, and served the Baals and the Asherahs.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah gave Chushan-rishathaim king of Syria into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And the land had rest forty years; and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they did evil in the sight of Jehovah.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek and went and smote Israel, and they took possession of the city of palm-trees.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, and Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a man left-handed.<a name=3:12></a> And by him the children of Israel sent a gift to Eglon king of Moab.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And Ehud made him a sword having two edges, it was of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right hip.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And he brought the gift to Eglon king of Moab; now Eglon was a very fat man.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And it came to pass when he had ended offering the gift, he sent away the people that had borne the gift.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  But he turned from the graven images that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word unto thee, O king.<a name=3:17></a> And he said, Be silent!<a name=3:18></a> And all that stood by him went out from him.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And Ehud came to him; now he was sitting in the cool upper-chamber, which was for him alone.<a name=3:20></a> And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee.<a name=3:21></a> And he arose from the seat.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  Then Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right hip, and thrust it into his belly;

	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And Ehud went out into the portico, and shut the doors of the upper-chamber upon him, and bolted them.<a name=3:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And when he was gone out, the servants of the [king] came and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper-chamber were bolted.<a name=3:25></a> And they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the summer chamber.<a name=3:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And they waited till they were ashamed; and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper-chamber, and they took the key, and opened [them], and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.<a name=3:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And Ehud had escaped while they lingered, and passed beyond the graven images, and escaped to Seirah.<a name=3:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		28  And he said to them, Follow after me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.<a name=3:30></a> And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan toward Moab, and suffered no one to pass over.<a name=3:31></a>
