		1  And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him and magnified him exceedingly.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the princes of all Israel, the chief fathers;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  and Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place at Gibeon; for there was God's tent of meeting which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the [place] that David had prepared for it; for he had spread a tent for it at Jerusalem.<a name=1:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And the brazen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And Solomon offered there upon the brazen altar before Jehovah which was at the tent of meeting; and he offered up a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shewn unto David my father great loving-kindness, and hast made me king in his stead.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Now, Jehovah Elohim, let thy word unto David my father be firm; for thou hast made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy great people?<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  wisdom and knowledge are granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches and wealth and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall any after thee have the like.<a name=1:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Then Solomon came back [from] the high place at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and reigned over Israel.<a name=1:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And the exportation of horses that Solomon had was from Egypt: a caravan of the king's merchants fetched a drove [of horses], at a price.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And they fetched up and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so they brought [them] by their means, for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria.<a name=1:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Behold, I build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God to dedicate it to him, to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual arrangement [of the shewbread], and for the morning and evening burnt-offerings [and] on the sabbaths and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God.<a name=2:4></a> This is [an ordinance] for ever to Israel.<a name=2:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And now send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple and crimson and blue, and experienced in carving, besides the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And Huram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loved his people, he made thee king over them.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And Huram said, Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, that made the heavens and the earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, who will build a house for Jehovah and a house for his kingdom.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And he began to build on the second of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.<a name=3:2></a>

		3  And this was Solomon's foundation for the construction of the house of God.<a name=3:3></a> The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And the porch which was in front was twenty cubits in length, in front of the house broadways, and the height was a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.<a name=3:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And he covered the house, the beams, the threshold, and its walls, and its doors with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And he made the house of the most holy place, the length of which was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he covered it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And he made chains [as] in the oracle, and he put them on the top of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.<a name=3:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And under it was the similitude of oxen, encompassing it round about, ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about, two rows of oxen, cast when it was cast.<a name=4:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		4  It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim like the work of the brim of a cup, with lily-blossoms; in capacity it held three thousand baths.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And he made ten lavers, and put five on the right and five on the left, to wash in them: they rinsed in them what they prepared for the burnt-offering; and the sea was for the priests to wash in.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance respecting them, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left.<a name=4:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls.<a name=4:12></a> So Huram ended doing the work that he made for king Solomon in the house of God:

	<div class="paragraph">
		12  two pillars, and the globes and the capitals on the top of the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;

	<div class="paragraph">
		13  and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And he made the bases, and he made the lavers on the bases;

	<div class="paragraph">
		15  one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their instruments did Huram Abiv make king Solomon for the house of Jehovah, of bright brass.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And Solomon made all these vessels in great number; for the weight of the brass was not ascertained.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And Solomon made all the vessels that were [in] the house of God: the golden altar; and the tables whereon was the shewbread;

	<div class="paragraph">
		20  and the candlesticks with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold (it was perfect gold);

	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.<a name=5:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And king Solomon, and all the assembly of Israel, that were assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim;

		9  And the staves were long, so that the ends of the staves were seen outside the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without.<a name=5:9></a> And there they are to this day.<a name=5:10></a>

		11  And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place (for all the priests that were present were hallowed without observing the courses;

	<div class="paragraph">
		12  and the Levites the singers, all they of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, clad in byssus, with cymbals and lutes and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets),

	<div class="paragraph">
		13  -- it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever; that then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud,
