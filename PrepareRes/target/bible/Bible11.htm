		5  And thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and upon his sandals that were on his feet.<a name=2:2></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And now I ask one petition of thee; refuse me not.<a name=2:16></a> And she said to him, Speak.<a name=2:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		32  And Jehovah shall requite the blood which he shed upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, without my father David's knowledge: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.<a name=2:39></a>
