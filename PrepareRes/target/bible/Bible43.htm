		1  In [the] beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<a name=1:1></a>

		2  <i>He</i> was in the beginning with God.<a name=1:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		6  There was a man sent from God, his name John.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him.<a name=1:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		8  <i>He</i> was not the light, but that he might witness concerning the light.<a name=1:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		9  The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  He was in the world, and the world had [its] being through him, and the world knew him not.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  He came to his own, and his own received him not;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  but as many as received him, to them gave he [the] right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  (John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me;)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		18  No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared [him].<a name=1:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou?<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And they asked him, What then?<a name=1:17></a> Art thou Elias?<a name=1:18></a> And he says, I am not.<a name=1:19></a> Art thou the prophet?<a name=1:20></a> And he answered, No.<a name=1:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  They said therefore to him, Who art thou?<a name=1:22></a> that we may give an answer to those who sent us.<a name=1:23></a> What sayest thou of thyself?<a name=1:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.<a name=1:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And they were sent from among the Pharisees.<a name=1:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?<a name=1:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  John answered them saying, I baptise with water.<a name=1:28></a> In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.<a name=1:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.<a name=1:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.<a name=1:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he <i>was</i> before me;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.<a name=1:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.<a name=1:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, <i>he</i> said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the] Holy Spirit.<a name=1:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.<a name=1:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples.<a name=1:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		36  And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.<a name=1:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		37  And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.<a name=1:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		38  But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye?<a name=1:39></a> And <i>they</i> said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?<a name=1:40></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		39  He says to them, Come and see.<a name=1:41></a> They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day.<a name=1:42></a> It was about the tenth hour.<a name=1:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		40  Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard [this] from John and followed him.<a name=1:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		41  He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ).<a name=1:45></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		42  And he led him to Jesus.<a name=1:46></a> Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone).<a name=1:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		43  On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me.<a name=1:48></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		44  And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.<a name=1:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		45  Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.<a name=1:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		46  And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth?<a name=1:51></a> Philip says to him, Come and see.<a name=1:52></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		47  Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.<a name=1:53></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		48  Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me?<a name=1:54></a> Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.<a name=1:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		49  Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.<a name=1:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		50  Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou?<a name=1:57></a> Thou shalt see greater things than these.<a name=1:58></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		51  And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.<a name=1:59></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And wine being deficient, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Jesus says to her, What have I to do with thee, woman?<a name=2:4></a> mine hour has not yet come.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  His mother says to the servants, Whatever he may say to you, do.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews, holding two or three measures each.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Jesus says to them, Fill the water-vessels with water.<a name=2:8></a> And they filled them up to the brim.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry [it] to the feast-master.<a name=2:10></a> And they carried [it].<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine (and knew not whence it was, but the servants knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the bridegroom,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and when [men] have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine till now.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  and, having made a scourge of cords, he cast [them] all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the change of the money-changers, and overturned the tables,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  and said to the sellers of doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  [And] his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house devours me.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things?<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days?<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  But <i>he</i> spoke of the temple of his body.<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  When therefore he was raised from among [the] dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And when he was in Jerusalem, at the passover, at the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all [men],
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man.<a name=2:24></a>

		1  But there was a man from among the Pharisees, his name Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born being old?<a name=3:3></a> can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Do not wonder that I said to thee, It is needful that <i>ye</i> should be born anew.<a name=3:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		8  The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Jesus answered and said to him, Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things!<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness.<a name=3:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		12  If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  that every one who believes on him may [not perish, but] have life eternal.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  He that believes on him is not judged: but he that believes not has been already judged, because he has not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light; for their works were evil.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  but he that practises the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he abode with them and baptised.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And John also was baptising in Aenon, near Salim, because there was a great deal of water there; and they came to [him] and were baptised:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  for John was not yet cast into prison.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  There was therefore a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, he baptises, and all come to him.<a name=3:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		27  John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven.<a name=3:24></a>

		1  When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptises more disciples than John

		43  But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee,

		7  The infirm [man] answered him, Sir, I have not a man, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool; but while I am coming another descends before me.<a name=5:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch and walk.<a name=5:9></a>

		10  The Jews therefore said to the healed [man], It is sabbath, it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch.<a name=5:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		14  After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art become well: sin no more, that something worse do not happen to thee.<a name=5:15></a>

		15  The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.<a name=5:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		18  For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only violated the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing: for whatever things <i>he</i> does, these things also the Son does in like manner.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does; and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may wonder.<a name=5:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		21  For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [them], thus the Son also quickens whom he will:

	<div class="paragraph">
		22  for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son;

		26  For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		37  And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness concerning me.<a name=5:35></a> Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor have seen his shape,
