		1  Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  as it is written in [Isaiah] the prophet, Behold, <i>I</i> send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of [the] Lord, make his paths straight.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  There came John baptising in the wilderness, and preaching [the] baptism of repentance for remission of sins.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And there went out to him all the district of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptised by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And John was clothed in camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And he preached, saying, There comes he that is mightier than I after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and unloose.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  <i>I</i> indeed have baptised you with water, but <i>he</i> shall baptise you with [the] Holy Spirit.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And it came to pass in those days [that] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John at the Jordan.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And straightway going up from the water, he saw the heavens parting asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And there came a voice out of the heavens: <i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And immediately the Spirit drives him out into the wilderness.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of God,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  and saying, The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe in the glad tidings.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, [Simon's] brother, casting out a net in the sea, for they were fishers.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  and straightway leaving their trawl-nets they followed him.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And going on thence a little, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, and these [were] in the ship repairing the trawl-nets;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  and straightway he called them; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, they went away after him.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And they go into Capernaum.<a name=1:17></a> And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And there was in their synagogue a man [possessed] by an unclean spirit, and he cried out
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  saying, Eh!<a name=1:20></a> what have we to do with thee, Jesus, Nazarene?<a name=1:21></a> Art thou come to destroy us?<a name=1:22></a> I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God.<a name=1:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.<a name=1:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And the unclean spirit, having torn him, and uttered a cry with a loud voice, came out of him.<a name=1:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  And all were amazed, so that they questioned together among themselves, saying, What is this?<a name=1:26></a> what new doctrine is this?<a name=1:27></a> for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.<a name=1:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee around.<a name=1:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  And straightway going out of the synagogue, they came with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew.<a name=1:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  And the mother-in-law of Simon lay in a fever.<a name=1:31></a> And straightway they speak to him about her.<a name=1:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  And he went up to [her] and raised her up, having taken her by the hand, and straightway the fever left her, and she served them.<a name=1:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  But evening being come, when the sun had gone down, they brought to him all that were suffering, and those possessed by demons;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  and the whole city was gathered together at the door.<a name=1:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  And he healed many suffering from various diseases; and he cast out many demons, and did not suffer the demons to speak because they knew him.<a name=1:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  And rising in the morning long before day, he went out and went away into a desert place, and there prayed.<a name=1:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		36  And Simon and those with him went after him:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		37  and having found him, they say to him, All seek thee.<a name=1:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		38  And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns, that I may preach there also, for for this purpose am I come forth.<a name=1:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		39  And he was preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.<a name=1:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		40  And there comes to him a leper, beseeching him, and falling on his knees to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.<a name=1:40></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		41  But Jesus, moved with compassion, having stretched out his hand, touched him, and says to him, I will, be thou cleansed.<a name=1:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		42  And as he spoke straightway the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.<a name=1:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		43  And having sharply charged him, he straightway sent him away,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		44  and says to him, See thou say nothing to any one, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained, for a testimony to them.<a name=1:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		45  But he, having gone forth, began to proclaim [it] much, and to spread the matter abroad, so that he could no longer enter openly into the city, but was without in desert places, and they came to him from every side.<a name=1:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And he entered again into Capernaum after [several] days, and it was reported that he was at [the] house;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  and straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And there come to him [men] bringing a paralytic, borne by four;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  and, not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having dug [it] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  But Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven [thee].<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  But certain of the scribes were there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Why does this [man] thus speak?<a name=2:4></a> he blasphemes.<a name=2:5></a> Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven [thee]; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk?<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And he rose up straightway, and, having taken up his couch, went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And he went out again by the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And passing by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and says to him, Follow me.<a name=2:12></a> And he rose up and followed him.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers, said to his disciples, Why [is it] that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners?<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And Jesus having heard [it] says to them, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill.<a name=2:16></a> I have not come to call righteous [men], but sinners.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and [the disciples] of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?<a name=2:19></a> As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then shall they fast in that day.<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment: otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old [stuff], and there is a worse rent.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine is to be put into new skins.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And <i>he</i> said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, <i>he</i> and those with him,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  And he said to them, The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also.<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was there a man having his hand dried up.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And he says to the man who had his hand dried up, Rise up [and come] into the midst.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And he says to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?<a name=3:4></a> But they were silent.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And looking round upon them with anger, distressed at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand.<a name=3:6></a> And he stretched [it] out, and his hand was restored.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan; and they of around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what things he did, came to him.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And he spoke to his disciples, in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon him.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For he healed many, so that they beset him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried saying, <i>Thou</i> art the Son of God.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And he rebuked them much, that they might not make him manifest.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  and to have power [to heal diseases, and] to cast out demons.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And he gave to Simon the surname of Peter;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he gave them the surname of Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and Judas Iscariote, who also delivered him up.<a name=3:16></a> And they come to [the] house.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And again a crowd comes together, so that they cannot even eat bread.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And his relatives having heard [of it] went out to lay hold on him, for they said, He is out of his mind.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out demons.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And having called them to [him], he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And if a kingdom has become divided against itself, that kingdom cannot subsist.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And if a house has become divided against itself, that house cannot subsist.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And if Satan rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot subsist, but has an end.<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  But no one can, having entered into his house, plunder the goods of the strong [man] unless he first bind the strong [man], and then he will plunder his house.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  Verily I say unto you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and all the injurious speeches [with] which they may speak injuriously;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  but whosoever shall speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit, to eternity has no forgiveness; but lies under the guilt of an everlasting sin;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  -- because they said, He has an unclean spirit.<a name=3:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  And his brethren and his mother come, and standing without sent to him calling him.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  And a crowd sat around him.<a name=3:28></a> And they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren seek thee without.<a name=3:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?<a name=3:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  for whosoever shall do the will of God, <i>he</i> is my brother, and sister, and mother.<a name=3:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And again he began to teach by the sea.<a name=4:1></a> And a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that going on board ship he sat in the sea, and all the crowd were close to the sea on the land.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And he taught them many things in parables.<a name=4:3></a> And he said to them in his doctrine,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And it came to pass as he sowed, one fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And another fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprung up out [of the ground] because it had no depth of earth;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  and when the sun arose it was burnt up, and because of its not having any root, it withered.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And another fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and bore, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And he said, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And when he was alone, those about him with the twelve asked him [as to] the parables.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And he said to them, To you is given [to know] the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them who are without, all things are done in parables,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  that beholding they may behold and not see, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest it may be, they should be converted and they should be forgiven.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable?<a name=4:12></a> and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables?<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  The sower sows the word:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown, and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And these are they in like manner who are sown upon the rocky places, who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  and they have no root in themselves, but are for a time: then, tribulation arising, or persecution on account of the word, immediately they are offended.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And others are they who are sown among the thorns: these are they who have heard the word,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and the cares of life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And these are they who have been sown on the good ground, such as hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit; one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred [fold].<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And he said to them, Does the lamp come that it should be put under the bushel or under the couch?<a name=4:18></a> [Is it] not that it should be set upon the lamp-stand?<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest; nor does any secret thing take place, but that it should come to light.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear; with what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you; and there shall be [more] added to you.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  For whosoever has, to him shall be given; and he who has not, even what he has shall be taken from him.<a name=4:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth,
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		42  And when it was already evening, since it was [the] preparation, that is, [the day] before a sabbath,

		43  Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable councillor, who also himself was awaiting the kingdom of God, coming, emboldened himself and went in to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.<a name=15:44></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		47  And Mary of Magdala and Mary the [mother] of Joses saw where he was put.<a name=15:48></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And very early on the first [day] of the week they come to the sepulchre, the sun having risen.<a name=16:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And they said to one another, Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?<a name=16:3></a>

		5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were amazed and alarmed;

	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Now when he had risen very early, the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons.<a name=16:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country;

	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And he said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation.<a name=16:16></a>
