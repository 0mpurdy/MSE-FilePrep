		1  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], on the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  On the fifth of the month, (it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass, out of the midst of the fire.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Also out of the midst thereof, the likeness of four living creatures.<a name=1:4></a> And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled as the look of burnished brass.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And their faces and their wings were parted above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And they went every one straight forward: whither the Spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, as the appearance of torches: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright; and out of the fire went forth lightning.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And I looked at the living creatures, and behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, toward their four faces.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  The appearance of the wheels and their work was as the look of a chrysolite; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not when they went.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  Whithersoever the Spirit was to go, they went, thither would [their] spirit go; and the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  When those went, they went; and when those stood, they stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  And there was the likeness of an expanse over the heads of the living creature, as the look of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.<a name=1:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies.<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, a tumultuous noise, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  and there was a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads.<a name=1:23></a> When they stood, they let down their wings.<a name=1:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.<a name=1:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  And I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the appearance of fire, within it round about; from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.<a name=1:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.<a name=1:27></a> This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah.<a name=1:28></a> And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.<a name=1:29></a>
