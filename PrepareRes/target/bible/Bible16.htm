		1  The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.<a name=1:1></a> And it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the fortress,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah.<a name=1:2></a> And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And they said to me, Those who remain, that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned with fire.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat and wept, and mourned for days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of the heavens,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  and said, I beseech thee, Jehovah, God of the heavens, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and keep his commandments.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.<a name=1:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		7  We have acted very perversely against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances that thou commandedst thy servant Moses.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.<a name=1:8></a>

		1  And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that] wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king.<a name=2:1></a> Now, I had never been sad in his presence.<a name=2:2></a>
