		1  Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, according to promise of life, the [life] which [is] in Christ Jesus,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  to Timotheus, [my] beloved child: grace, mercy, peace, from God [the] Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  I am thankful to God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers with pure conscience, how unceasingly I have the remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  earnestly desiring to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  calling to mind the unfeigned faith which [has been] in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  For which cause I put thee in mind to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise discretion.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but suffer evil along with the glad tidings, according to the power of God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  who has saved us, and has called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to [his] own purpose and grace, which [was] given to us in Christ Jesus before [the] ages of time,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  but has been made manifest now by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  to which <i>I</i> have been appointed a herald and apostle and teacher of [the] nations.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Have an outline of sound words, which [words] thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which [are] in Christ Jesus.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Thou knowest this, that all who [are] in Asia, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes, have turned away from me.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he has often refreshed me, and has not been ashamed of my chain;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  but being in Rome sought me out very diligently, and found [me] -- 
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  the Lord grant to him to find mercy from [the] Lord in that day -- and how much service he rendered in Ephesus <i>thou</i> knowest best.<a name=1:10></a>

		1  Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which [is] in Christ Jesus.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  No one going as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who has enlisted him as a soldier.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And if also any one contend [in the games], he is not crowned unless he contend lawfully.<a name=2:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		6  The husbandman must labour before partaking of the fruits.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Remember Jesus Christ raised from among [the] dead, of [the] seed of David, according to my glad tidings,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evil-doer: but the word of God is not bound.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that <i>they</i> also may obtain the salvation which [is] in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  The word [is] faithful; for if we have died together with [him], we shall also live together;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  if we endure, we shall also reign together; if we deny, <i>he</i> also will deny us;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  if we are unfaithful, <i>he</i> abides faithful, for he cannot deny himself.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Of these things put in remembrance, testifying earnestly before the Lord not to have disputes of words, profitable for nothing, to the subversion of the hearers.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God, a workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line the word of truth.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  But profane, vain babblings shun, for they will advance to greater impiety,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  and their word will spread as a gangrene; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  [men] who as to the truth have gone astray, saying that the resurrection has taken place already; and overthrow the faith of some.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  Yet the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, [The] Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of [the] Lord withdraw from iniquity.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, [in separating himself from them], he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  But foolish and senseless questionings avoid, knowing that they beget contentions.<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And a bondman of [the] Lord ought not to contend, but be gentle towards all; apt to teach; forbearing;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  in meekness setting right those who oppose, if God perhaps may sometime give them repentance to acknowledgment of [the] truth,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  and that they may awake up out of the snare of the devil, [who are] taken by him, for <i>his</i> will.<a name=2:19></a>

		1  But this know, that in [the] last days difficult times shall be there;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  having a form of piety but denying the power of it: and from these turn away.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  For of these are they who are getting into houses, and leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various lusts,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  always learning, and never able to come to [the] knowledge of [the] truth.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, found worthless as regards the faith.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  But <i>thou</i> hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  persecutions, sufferings: what [sufferings] happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured; and the Lord delivered me out of all.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in evil, leading and being led astray.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  But <i>thou</i>, abide in those things which thou hast learned, and [of which] thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them];
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which [is] in Christ Jesus.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Every scripture [is] divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;
	</div>

		3  For the time shall be when they will not bear sound teaching; but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers, having an itching ear;

		9  Use diligence to come to me quickly;
