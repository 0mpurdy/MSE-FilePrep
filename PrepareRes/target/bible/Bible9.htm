	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh.<a name=1:3></a> And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of Jehovah, were there.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And it came to pass on the day that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  but to Hannah he used to give a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And her adversary provoked her much also, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And [as] he did so year by year, as often as she went up to the house of Jehovah, she provoked her thus; and she wept and did not eat.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?<a name=1:8></a> and why eatest thou not?<a name=1:9></a> and why is thy heart grieved?<a name=1:10></a> Am not I better to thee than ten sons?<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; (now Eli the priest sat upon the seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah;)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  and she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept much.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And it came to pass as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; and Eli thought she was drunken.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken?<a name=1:16></a> put away thy wine from thee.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before Jehovah.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Take not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition which thou hast asked of him.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And she said, Let thy bondwoman find grace in thy sight.<a name=1:21></a> And the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more [as before].<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah.<a name=1:23></a> And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.<a name=1:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, [saying,] Because I have asked him of Jehovah.<a name=1:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And Elkanah her husband, and all his house, went up to sacrifice to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow.<a name=1:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, [I will wait] until the child is weaned; then will I bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.<a name=1:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in thy sight: abide until thou hast weaned him; only, may Jehovah fulfil his word.<a name=1:28></a> And the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.<a name=1:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And she took him up with her when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah to Shiloh; and the boy was young.<a name=1:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And they slaughtered the bullock, and brought the boy to Eli.<a name=1:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here to pray to Jehovah.<a name=1:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  For this boy I prayed; and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him.<a name=1:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  And also I have lent him to Jehovah: all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah.<a name=1:34></a> And he worshipped Jehovah there.<a name=1:35></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth is opened wide over mine enemies; for I rejoice in thy salvation.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee, neither is there any rock like our God.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Do not multiply your words of pride, let not vain-glory come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  The bow of the mighty is broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are [so] no more: Even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, To set [him] among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  He keepeth the feet of his saints, but the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; in the heavens will he thunder upon them.<a name=2:9></a> Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.<a name=2:11></a> And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not Jehovah.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And the priests' custom with the people was, when any man sacrificed a sacrifice, the priest's servant came, when the flesh was cooked, with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up.<a name=2:14></a> So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Even before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee, but raw.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  If the man said to him, They will immediately burn the fat entire, then take as thy soul desires; he would say [to him], No, but thou shalt give [it] now; and if not, I will take [it] by force.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for men despised the offering of Jehovah.<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to Jehovah.<a name=2:21></a> And they went to their own home.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  So Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters.<a name=2:23></a> And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah.<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  And Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they lay with the women that served at the entrance of the tent of meeting.<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And he said to them, Why do ye such things?<a name=2:26></a> for I hear of your evil deeds from all this people.<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah's people transgress.<a name=2:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  If one man sin against another, God will judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall intreat for him?<a name=2:29></a> But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was minded to slay them.<a name=2:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men.<a name=2:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt, in Pharaoh's house,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear the ephod before me?<a name=2:32></a> and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.<a name=2:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  Wherefore do ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon mine oblation which I have commanded [in my] habitation?<a name=2:34></a> And thou honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the primest of all the oblations of Israel my people.<a name=2:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  Wherefore Jehovah the God of Israel saith, I said indeed, Thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever.<a name=2:36></a> But now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.<a name=2:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  Behold, days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.<a name=2:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  And thou shalt see an oppressor [in my] habitation, amidst all the good that shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.<a name=2:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  And the man of thine [whom] I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to cause thine eyes to fail and to grieve thy soul; and all the increase of thy house shall die in their vigour.<a name=2:40></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  And this shall be the sign to thee, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them.<a name=2:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, [who] shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed continually.<a name=2:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		36  And it shall come to pass [that] every one that is left of thy house shall come to crouch to him for a small piece of silver and for a cake of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.<a name=2:43></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli.<a name=3:1></a> And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not frequent.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And it came to pass at that time, when Eli lay in his place (now his eyes began to grow dim, he could not see),
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  that Jehovah called to Samuel.<a name=3:3></a> And he said, Here am I.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.<a name=3:5></a> And he said, I did not call: lie down again.<a name=3:6></a> And he went and lay down.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  And Jehovah called again, Samuel!<a name=3:8></a> And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.<a name=3:9></a> And he said, I did not call, my son: lie down again.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And Jehovah called again the third time, Samuel!<a name=3:12></a> And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.<a name=3:13></a> And Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heareth.<a name=3:15></a> So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel!<a name=3:17></a> And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant heareth.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin and make an end.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah.<a name=3:23></a> And Samuel feared to declare the vision to Eli.<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.<a name=3:25></a> And he said, Here am I.<a name=3:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And he said, What is the word that he has spoken to thee?<a name=3:27></a> I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee.<a name=3:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him.<a name=3:29></a> And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what is good in his sight.<a name=3:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.<a name=3:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.<a name=3:32></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.<a name=3:33></a>

		1  And what Samuel had said happened to all Israel.<a name=4:1></a> And Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and the battle spread, and Israel was routed before the Philistines; and they slew in battle array in the field about four thousand men.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And the people came into the camp; and the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines?<a name=4:4></a> Let us fetch ourselves the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth between the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there by the ark of the covenant of God.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And it came to pass when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, that all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth shook.<a name=4:7></a>

		6  And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, and said, What is the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?<a name=4:8></a> And they understood that the ark of Jehovah had come into the camp.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp.<a name=4:10></a> And they said, Woe unto us!<a name=4:11></a> for there has not been such a thing heretofore.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  Woe unto us!<a name=4:13></a> who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods?<a name=4:14></a> these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.<a name=4:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Shew yourselves valiant and be men, ye Philistines, that ye may not have to be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been servants to you: be men, and fight.<a name=4:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And the Philistines fought, and Israel was routed, and they fled every man to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.<a name=4:17></a>

		11  And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.<a name=4:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And when he came, behold, Eli was sitting upon the seat by the way-side watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God.<a name=4:20></a> And the man came to tell it in the city, and all the city cried out.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And Eli heard the noise of the crying, and said, What is the noise of this tumult?<a name=4:22></a> And the man came hastily, and told Eli.<a name=4:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see.<a name=4:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And the messenger answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.<a name=4:27></a>

		19  And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.<a name=4:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And as she was dying, the women that stood by her said, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son.<a name=4:31></a> But she did not answer, neither did she take it to heart.<a name=4:32></a>
