		1  In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by the prophet Haggai unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,

	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that Jehovah's house should be built.<a name=1:1></a>

		4  Is it time for you that ye should dwell in your wainscoted houses, while this house lieth waste?<a name=1:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And now thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.<a name=1:3></a>

		9  Ye looked for much, and behold it was little; and when ye brought it home, I blew upon it.<a name=1:7></a> Wherefore?<a name=1:8></a> saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=1:9></a> Because of my house that lieth waste, whilst ye run every man to his own house.<a name=1:10></a>

		12  And Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, according as Jehovah their God had sent him, and the people feared before Jehovah.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,

	<div class="paragraph">
		4  But now be strong, Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=2:4></a>

		10  On the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests [concerning] the law, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food -- shall it become holy?<a name=2:9></a> And the priests answered and said, No.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And Haggai said, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, is it become unclean?<a name=2:11></a> And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah, and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.<a name=2:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And now, I pray you, consider from this day and onward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah,

	<div class="paragraph">
		16  -- before those [days] were, when one came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were but ten; when one came to the vat to draw out fifty press-measures, there were but twenty.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; and ye [turned] not to me, saith Jehovah.<a name=2:15></a>

		18  Consider, I pray you, from this day and onward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month], from the day that the foundation of Jehovah's temple was laid, consider [it].<a name=2:16></a>

		19  Is the seed yet in the barn?<a name=2:17></a> yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth: from this day will I bless [you].<a name=2:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And the word of Jehovah came the second time unto Haggai on the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying,

		23  In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, saith Jehovah, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=2:20></a>
