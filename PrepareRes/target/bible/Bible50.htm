	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with [the] overseers and ministers;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  grace to you, and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication for you all with joy,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  because of your fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  as it is righteous for me to think this as to you all, because ye have <i>me</i> in your hearts, and that both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my grace.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  For God is my witness how I long after you all in [the] bowels of Christ Jesus.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which [is] by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  But I would have you know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  so that my bonds have become manifest [as being] in Christ in all the praetorium and to all others;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  and that the most of the brethren, trusting in [the] Lord through my bonds, dare more abundantly to speak the word of God fearlessly.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Some indeed also for envy and strife, but some also for good will, preach the Christ.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  These indeed out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the glad tidings;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  but those out of contention, announce the Christ, not purely, supposing to arouse tribulation for my bonds.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  What is it then?<a name=1:8></a> at any rate, in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and [the] supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  For for me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth the while: and what I shall choose I cannot tell.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  But I am pressed by both, having the desire for departure and being with Christ, [for] [it is] very much better,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  but remaining in the flesh [is] more necessary for your sakes;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  and having confidence of this, I know that I shall remain and abide along with you all, for your progress and joy in faith;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through me by my presence again with you.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent, I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear of in me.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  If then [there be] any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of [the] Spirit, if any bowels and compassions,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  fulfil my joy, that ye may think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking one thing;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  [let] nothing [be] in the spirit of strife or vain glory, but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  regarding not each his own [qualities], but each those of others also.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For let this mind be in you which [was] also in Christ Jesus;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in [the] likeness of men;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and [that the] death of [the] cross.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal [beings],
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord to God [the] Father's glory.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to [his] good pleasure.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Do all things without murmurings and reasonings,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in [the] world,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  holding forth [the] word of life, so as to be a boast for me in Christ's day, that I have not run in vain nor laboured in vain.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  In like manner do <i>ye</i> also rejoice, and rejoice with me.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  But I hope in [the] Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly, that <i>I</i> also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  For all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see how it goes with me:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  but I trust in [the] Lord that I myself also shall soon come;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  since he had a longing desire after you all, and was distressed because ye had heard that he was sick;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  for he was also sick close to death, but God had mercy on him, and not indeed on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that seeing him ye might again rejoice, and that <i>I</i> might be the less sorrowful.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  Receive him therefore in [the] Lord with all joy, and hold such in honour;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  because for the sake of the work he drew near even to death, venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in your ministration toward me.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  For the rest, my brethren, rejoice in [the] Lord: to write the same things to you, to me [is] not irksome, and for you safe.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  See to dogs, see to evil workmen, see to the concision.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For <i>we</i> are the circumcision, who worship by [the] Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Though <i>I</i> have [my] trust even in flesh; if any other think to trust in flesh, <i>I</i> rather:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  as to circumcision, [I received it] the eighth day; of [the] race of Israel, of [the] tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews; as to [the] law, a Pharisee;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  as to zeal, persecuting the assembly; as to righteousness which [is] in [the] law, found blameless;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  but what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  and that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which [would be] on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which [is] of God through faith,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among [the] dead.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  Not that I have already obtained [the prize], or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession [of it], seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ [Jesus].<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Brethren, <i>I</i> do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing -- forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  I pursue, [looking] towards [the] goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  As many therefore as [are] perfect, let us be thus minded; and if ye are any otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  But whereto we have attained, [let us] walk in the same steps.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Be imitators [all] together of me, brethren, and fix your eyes on those walking thus as you have us for a model;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  (for many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they [are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is] the belly, and [their] glory in their shame, who mind earthly things:)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  for <i>our</i> commonwealth has its existence in [the] heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ [as] Saviour,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of [the] power which he has even to subdue all things to himself.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  So that, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand fast in [the] Lord, beloved.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in [the] Lord;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  yea, I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist them, who have contended along with me in the glad tidings, with Clement also, and my other fellow-labourers, whose names [are] in [the] book of life.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Rejoice in [the] Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Let your gentleness be known of all men.<a name=4:4></a> The Lord [is] near.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things [are] true, whatsoever things [are] noble, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] amiable, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue and if any praise, think on these things.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  But I rejoiced in [the] Lord greatly, that now however at length ye have revived your thinking of me, though surely ye did also think [of me], but lacked opportunity.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Not that I speak as regards privation, for as to me <i>I</i> have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound.<a name=4:11></a> In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  I have strength for all things in him that gives me power.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  But ye have done well in taking part in my affliction.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And know also <i>ye</i>, O Philippians, that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated [anything] to me in [the] way of giving and receiving save <i>ye</i> alone;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my need.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Not that I seek gift, but I seek fruit abounding to your account.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  But I have all things in full supply and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  But to our God and Father [be] glory to the ages of ages.<a name=4:19></a> Amen.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  Salute every saint in Christ Jesus.<a name=4:21></a> The brethren who [are] with me salute you.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  All the saints salute you, and specially those of the household of Caesar.<a name=4:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.<a name=4:24></a> Amen.<a name=4:25></a>
