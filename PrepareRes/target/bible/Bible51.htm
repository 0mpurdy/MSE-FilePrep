		1  Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus, by God's will, and Timotheus the brother,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which [are] in Colosse.<a name=1:1></a> Grace to you and peace from God our Father [and Lord Jesus Christ].<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ continually [when] praying for you,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have towards all the saints,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  on account of the hope which [is] laid up for you in the heavens; of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the glad tidings,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  which are come to you, as [they are] in all the world, [and] are bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the day ye heard [them] and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-bondman, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  who has also manifested to us your love in [the] Spirit.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  For this reason <i>we</i> also, from the day we heard [of your faith and love], do not cease praying and asking for you, to the end that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  [so as] to walk worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by the true knowledge of God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated [us] into the kingdom of the Son of his love:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  who is image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  because by him were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities: all things have been created by him and for him.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And <i>he</i> is before all, and all things subsist together by him.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And <i>he</i> is the head of the body, the assembly; who is [the] beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that <i>he</i> might have the first place in all things:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  for in him all the fulness [of the Godhead] was pleased to dwell,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  and by him to reconcile all things to itself, having made peace by the blood of his cross -- by him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And you, who once were alienated and enemies in mind by wicked works, yet now has it reconciled
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  in the body of his flesh through death; to present you holy and unblamable and irreproachable before it,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  if indeed ye abide in the faith founded and firm, and not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings, which ye have heard, which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which [is] under heaven, of which <i>I</i> Paul became minister.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  of which <i>I</i> became minister, according to the dispensation of God which [is] given me towards you to complete the word of God,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  the mystery which [has been] hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  whom <i>we</i> announce, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  Whereunto also I toil, combating according to his working, which works in me in power.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  For I would have you know what combat I have for you, and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in flesh;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  to the end that their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to [the] full knowledge of the mystery of God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And I say this to the end that no one may delude you by persuasive speech.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For if indeed in the flesh I am absent, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  As therefore ye have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in him,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  rooted and built up in him, and assured in the faith, even as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  See that there be no one who shall lead <i>you</i> away as a prey through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the teaching of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and authority,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  in whom also ye have been circumcised with circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised with [him] through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And you, being dead in offences and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has quickened together with him, having forgiven us all the offences;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which [stood out] against us, which was contrary to us, he has taken it also out of the way, having nailed it to the cross;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  having spoiled principalities and authorities, he made a show of them publicly, leading them in triumph by it.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Let none therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in matter of feast, or new moon, or sabbaths,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize, doing his own will in humility and worship of angels, entering into things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and not holding fast the head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as [if] alive in [the] world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances?<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  (things which are all for destruction in the using [of them]:) according to the injunctions and teachings of men,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  (which have indeed an appearance of wisdom in voluntary worship, and humility, and harsh treatment of the body, not in a certain honour,) to [the] satisfaction of the flesh.<a name=2:11></a>

		1  If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things [which are] above, where the Christ is, sitting at [the] right hand of God:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  have your mind on the things [that are] above, not on the things [that are] on the earth;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>

		4  When the Christ is manifested who [is] our life, then shall <i>ye</i> also be manifested with him in glory.<a name=3:2></a>

		9  Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his deeds,

		12  Put on therefore, as [the] elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;
