	<div class="paragraph">
		21  And I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent of her fornication.<a name=2:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  But to you I say, the rest who [are] in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden;
