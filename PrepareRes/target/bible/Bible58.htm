	<div class="paragraph">
		1  God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  at the end of these days has spoken to us in [the person of the] Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  who being [the] effulgence of his glory and [the] expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made [by himself] the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For to which of the angels said he ever, <i>Thou</i> art my Son: this day have <i>I</i> begotten thee?<a name=1:2></a> and again, <i>I</i> will be to him for father, and <i>he</i> shall be to me for son?<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  and again, when he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship him.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  And as to the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  but as to the Son, Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age, and a sceptre of uprightness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  And, <i>Thou</i> in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  They shall perish, but <i>thou</i> continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  and as a covering shalt thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but <i>thou</i> art the Same, and thy years shall not fail.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  But as to which of the angels said he ever, Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet?<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things [we have] heard, lest in any way we should slip away.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  how shall <i>we</i> escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken [of] by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  God bearing, besides, witness with [them] to [it], both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of [the] Holy Spirit, according to his will?<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  but one has testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest him?<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Thou hast made him some little inferior to the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, [and hast set him over the works of thy hands;]
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  thou hast subjected all things under his feet.<a name=2:4></a> For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject to him.<a name=2:5></a> But now we see not yet all things subjected to <i>him</i>,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  but we see Jesus, who [was] made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste death for every thing.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified [are] all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in [the] midst of [the] assembly will I sing thy praises.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And again, I will trust in him.<a name=2:9></a> And again, Behold, I and the children which God has given me.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  For he does not indeed take hold of angels [by the hand], but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of [the] heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For <i>he</i> has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things [is] God.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And Moses indeed [was] faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are <i>we</i>, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  where your fathers tempted [me], by proving [me], and saw my works forty years.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and <i>they</i> have not known my ways;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from [the] living God.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  in that it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  (for who was it, who, having heard, provoked?<a name=3:9></a> but [was it] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And with whom was he wroth forty years?<a name=3:11></a> [Was it] not with those who had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who had not hearkened to the word?<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And we see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief;)
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed [of it].<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit <i>them</i>, not being mixed with faith in those who heard.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from [the] foundation of [the] world.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  For he has said somewhere of the seventh [day] thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  again he determines a certain day, saying, in David, 'To-day,' after so long a time; (according as it has been said before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For he that has entered into his rest, he also has rested from his works, as God did from his own.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  For the word of God [is] living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to [the] division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of [the] heart.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things [are] naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, <i>Thou</i> art my Son, <i>I</i> have to-day begotten thee.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Even as also in another [place] he says, <i>Thou</i> [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  addressed by God [as] high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to be interpreted in speaking [of it], since ye are become dull in hearing.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that [one] should teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, [and] not of solid food.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For every one that partakes of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  of [the] doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of [the] dead, and of eternal judgment;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  and this will we do if God permit.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  and have tasted the good word of God, and [the] works of power of [the] age to come,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves [as they do] the Son of God, and making a show of [him].<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end [is] to be burned.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having ministered to the saints, and [still] ministering.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  But we desire earnestly that each one of you shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For God, having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  and thus, having had long patience, he got the promise.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  that by two unchangeable things, in which [it was] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Now consider how great this [personage] was, to whom [even] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And here dying men receive tithes; but there [one] of whom the witness is that he lives;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with <i>it</i>, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron?<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  For, the priesthood being changed, there takes place of necessity a change of law also.<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For he, of whom these things are said, belongs to a different tribe, of which no one has [ever] been attached to the service of the altar.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For it is borne witness, <i>Thou</i> art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  (for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  (for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], <i>Thou</i> [art] priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  but he, because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  who has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then [for] those of the people; for this he did once for all [in] having offered up himself.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [is] after the law, a Son perfected for ever.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking [is], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  (who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told [when] about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.<a name=8:3></a>)
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		3  but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which [were] the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;

	<div class="paragraph">

		6  Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services;

	<div class="paragraph">
		7  but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [its] standing;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  the which [is] an image for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices, unable to perfect as to conscience him that worshipped, are offered,

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the [holy of] holies, having found an eternal redemption.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship [the] living God?<a name=9:5></a>

		15  And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.<a name=9:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  For every commandment having been spoken according to [the] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,

	<div class="paragraph">
		20  saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you.<a name=9:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  [It was] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  since he had [then] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world.<a name=9:13></a> But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for [the] putting away of sin by his sacrifice.<a name=9:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment;

	<div class="paragraph">
		28  thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation.<a name=9:15></a>

		11  And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.<a name=10:10></a>

		12  But <i>he</i>, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at [the] right hand of God,

		13  waiting from henceforth until his enemies be set [for the] footstool of his feet.<a name=10:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>

		15  And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [of it]; for after what was said:

		16  This [is] the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith [the] Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings;

		17  and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more.<a name=10:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  But where there [is] remission of these, [there is] no longer a sacrifice for sin.<a name=10:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the [holy of] holies by the blood of Jesus,

	<div class="paragraph">
		20  the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  and [having] a great priest over the house of God,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water.<a name=10:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		23  Let us hold fast the confession of the hope unwavering, (for he [is] faithful who has promised;)

	<div class="paragraph">
		26  For where we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains any sacrifice for sins,

		31  [It is] a fearful thing falling into [the] hands of [the] living God.<a name=10:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		33  on the one hand, when ye were made a spectacle both in reproaches and afflictions; and on the other, when ye became partakers with those who were passing through them.<a name=10:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		34  For ye both sympathised with prisoners and accepted with joy the plunder of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better substance, and an abiding one.<a name=10:22></a>
