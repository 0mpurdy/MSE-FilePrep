		1  These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain, opposite to Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.<a name=1:1></a>

		3  And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that Jehovah had given him in command to them;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth [and] at Edrei.<a name=1:3></a>

		5  On this side the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to unfold this law, saying,

		6  Jehovah our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have stayed long enough in this mountain.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the neighbouring places in the plain, in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south, and by the seaside, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.<a name=1:5></a>

		8  Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.<a name=1:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you as he hath said unto you!<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  How can I myself alone sustain your wear, and your burden, and your strife?<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Provide you wise and understanding and known men, according to your tribes, that I may make them your chiefs.<a name=1:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		14  And ye answered me, and said, The thing that thou hast spoken is good [for us] to do.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  So I took the chiefs of your tribes, wise men and known, and made them chiefs over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers for your tribes.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and him also that sojourneth with him.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  Ye shall not respect persons in judgment: ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's; and the matter that is too hard for you shall ye bring to me, that I may hear it.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And I commanded you at that time all the things that ye should do.<a name=1:16></a>

		19  And we departed from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw, on the way to the mountain of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth us.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  And ye came near to me all of you, and said, We will send men before us, who shall examine the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and of the cities to which we shall come.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And the matter was good in mine eyes; and I took twelve men of you, one man for a tribe.<a name=1:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  And they took of the fruit of the land in their hand, and brought it down unto us, and brought us answer, and said, The land is good that Jehovah our God hath given us.<a name=1:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  But ye would not go up, and rebelled against the word of Jehovah your God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.<a name=1:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  Whither shall we go up?<a name=1:25></a> Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, [They are] a people greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.<a name=1:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  And I said unto you, Be not afraid, neither fear them;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;

	<div class="paragraph">
		31  and in the wilderness where thou hast seen that Jehovah thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came to this place.<a name=1:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  But In this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  who went in the way before you, to search you out a place for your encamping, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.<a name=1:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  None among these men, this evil generation, shall in any wise see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers!<a name=1:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		36  Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.<a name=1:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		37  Also Jehovah was angry with me on your account, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.<a name=1:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		38  Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.<a name=1:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		39  And your little ones, of whom ye said, They shall be a prey, and your children, who this day know neither good nor evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.<a name=1:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		40  But ye, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.<a name=1:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		41  -- And ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God hath commanded us.<a name=1:35></a> And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and ye would go presumptuously up the hill.<a name=1:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		42  And Jehovah said to me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.<a name=1:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		43  And I spoke unto you, but ye would not hear, and ye rebelled against the word of Jehovah, and acted presumptuously, and went up the hill.<a name=1:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		44  And the Amorite that dwelt on that hill came out against you, and chased you, like as bees do, and cut you in pieces in Seir, as far as Hormah.<a name=1:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		45  And ye returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah would not listen to your voice, nor give ear unto you.<a name=1:40></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		46  And ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode [there].<a name=1:41></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		1  And we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as Jehovah had said unto me; and we went round mount Seir many days.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And Jehovah spoke to me, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Ye have gone round this mountain long enough: turn you northward.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And command the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you; and ye shall be very guarded:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  attack them not; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot-breadth; for I have given mount Seir as a possession unto Esau.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Ye shall buy of them food for money, that ye may eat; and water shall ye also buy of them for money, that ye may drink;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand.<a name=2:4></a> He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years hath Jehovah thy God been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by the plain, by Elath, and by Ezion-geber, and we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And Jehovah said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither engage with them in battle; for I will not give thee of their land a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given Ar as a possession.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  (The Emim dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  They also are reckoned as giants like the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And in Seir dwelt the Horites in times past; and the children of Esau dispossessed them, and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of their possession, which Jehovah gave to them.<a name=2:10></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Now rise up, and pass over the torrent Zered.<a name=2:11></a> And we passed over the torrent Zered.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  Now the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we had come over the torrent Zered, were thirty-eight years; until the whole generation of the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah had sworn unto them.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed, having died off from among the people,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  that Jehovah spoke to me, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  Thou art to pass this day over the border of Moab, [which is] Ar,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and come near over against the children of Ammon; thou shalt not distress them nor attack them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given it as a possession.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  (That also is reckoned a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in time past, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim; and Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their stead;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  as he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, from before whom he destroyed the Horites; and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their stead, even to this day.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And the Avvites who dwelt in the hamlets as far as Gazah -- the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.<a name=2:17></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon.<a name=2:18></a> Behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land: begin, take possession, and engage with him in battle.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples under the whole heaven; who will hear report of thee, and will tremble, and quake because of thee.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon the king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  Let me pass through thy land: by the highway alone will I go; I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  Thou shalt sell me food for money that I may eat; and thou shalt give me water for money that I may drink; I will only pass through on my feet,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  -- as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, -- until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obdurate, that he might give him into thy hand, as it is this day.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I begin to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin, take possession, that thou mayest possess his land.<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  And Sihon came out against us for battle, he and all his people, to Jahaz.<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		33  But Jehovah our God gave him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and his whole people.<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		34  And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, men, and women, and little ones: we let none escape.<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  Only the cattle we took as booty for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.<a name=2:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		36  From Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the ravine even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: Jehovah our God delivered all before us.<a name=2:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		37  Only thou didst not approach the land of the children of Ammon, the whole border of the river Jabbok, nor the cities of the mountain, nor to whatsoever Jehovah our God had forbidden us.<a name=2:30></a>

		1  And we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  And Jehovah said to me, Fear him not; for into thy hand have I given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And Jehovah our God gave into our hand Og the king of Bashan also, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  And we took all his cities at that time: there was not a town which we took not from them, sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns very many.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		7  But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves.<a name=3:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		8  And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites, that were on this side the Jordan, from the river Arnon to mount Hermon

	<div class="paragraph">
		9  (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir):

		11  For only Og the king of Bashan remained of the residue of giants: behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon?<a name=3:9></a> its length was nine cubits, and its breadth four cubits, after the cubit of a man.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And this land we took in possession at that time.<a name=3:11></a> From Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and the half of mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh.<a name=3:12></a> (The whole region of Argob, even all Bashan, is called a land of giants.<a name=3:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  And I gave Gilead to Machir.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon, the middle of the ravine and its border, as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;

		17  the plain also, and the Jordan, and [its] border from Chinnereth as far as the sea of the plain, the salt sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.<a name=3:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given you this land to take possession of it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all [who are] combatants.<a name=3:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
