	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of every kind of fruit;

	<div class="paragraph">
		8  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the children of men, a wife and concubines.<a name=2:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		9  And I became great, and increased more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		11  Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that it had cost me to do [them]; and behold, all was vanity and pursuit of the wind, and there was no profit under the sun.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what shall the man [do] that cometh after the king?<a name=2:12></a> -- that which hath already been done.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  And I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as light excelleth darkness.<a name=2:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		14  The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness; but I myself also perceived that one event happeneth to them all.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>

		15  And I said in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool so will it happen even to me; and why was I then so wise?<a name=2:16></a> Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  For there shall be no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; because everything is already forgotten in the days which come.<a name=2:18></a> And how dieth the wise even as the fool?<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And I hated life; for the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and pursuit of the wind.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  And I hated all my labour wherewith I had been toiling under the sun, because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.<a name=2:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		19  And who knoweth whether he will be a wise [man] or a fool?<a name=2:22></a> yet shall he have rule over all my labour at which I have laboured, and wherein I have been wise under the sun.<a name=2:23></a> This also is vanity.<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  Then I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour wherewith I had laboured under the sun.<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  For there is a man whose labour hath been with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill, and who leaveth it to a man that hath not laboured therein, to be his portion.<a name=2:26></a> This also is vanity and a great evil.<a name=2:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  For all his days are sorrows, and his travail vexation: even in the night his heart taketh no rest.<a name=2:29></a> This also is vanity.<a name=2:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  There is nothing good for man, but that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour.<a name=2:31></a> This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.<a name=2:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  For who can eat, or who be eager, more than I?<a name=2:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  For he giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good in God's sight.<a name=2:34></a> This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind.<a name=2:35></a>
