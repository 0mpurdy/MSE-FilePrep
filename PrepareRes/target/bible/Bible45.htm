		1  Paul, bondman of Jesus Christ, [a] called apostle, separated to God's glad tidings,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  (which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings,)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  marked out Son of God in power, according to [the] Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of [the] dead) Jesus Christ our Lord;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  by whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name, for obedience of faith among all the nations,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  among whom are <i>ye</i> also [the] called of Jesus Christ:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [our] Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  always beseeching at my prayers, if any way now at least I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  that is, to have mutual comfort among you, each by the faith [which is] in the other, both yours and mine.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often proposed to come to you, (and have been hindered until the present time,) that I might have some fruit among you too, even as among the other nations also.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and unintelligent:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  so, as far as depends on me, am I ready to announce the glad tidings to you also who [are] in Rome.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes, both to Jew first and to Greek:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith: according as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  Because what is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested [it] to them,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  -- for from [the] world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity, -- so as to render them inexcusable.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  Because, knowing God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into [the] likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  Wherefore God gave them up [also] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  who changed the truth of God into falsehood, and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created [it], who is blessed for ever.<a name=1:11></a> Amen.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  And according as they did not think good to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  back-biters, hateful to God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  void of understanding, faithless, without natural affection, unmerciful;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		32  who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only practise them, but have fellow delight in those who do [them].<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one who judgest, for in that in which thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who do such things.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and practisest them [thyself], that <i>thou</i> shalt escape the judgment of God?<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath, in [the] day of wrath and revelation of [the] righteous judgment of God,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  who shall render to each according to his works:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  to them who, in patient continuance of good works, seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility, life eternal.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [there shall be] wrath and indignation,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  but glory and honour and peace to every one that works good, both to Jew first and to Greek:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  for there is no acceptance of persons with God.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  For as many as have sinned without law shall perish also without law; and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  (for not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For when [those of the] nations, which have no law, practise by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing themselves between themselves;)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  in [the] day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my glad tidings, by Jesus Christ.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  But if <i>thou</i> art named a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  and knowest the will, and discerningly approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of those who [are] in darkness,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  thou then that teachest another, dost thou not teach thyself?<a name=2:9></a> thou that preachest not to steal, dost thou steal?<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  thou that sayest [man should] not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery?<a name=2:11></a> thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  thou who boastest in law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God?<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  For the name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, according as it is written.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep [the] law; but if thou be a law-transgressor, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  If therefore the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  and uncircumcision by nature, fulfilling the law, judge thee, who, with letter and circumcision, [art] a law-transgressor?<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  For he is not a Jew who [is] one outwardly, neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  but he [is] a Jew [who is so] inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  What then [is] the superiority of the Jew?<a name=3:1></a> or what the profit of circumcision?<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  Much every way: and first, indeed, that to them were entrusted the oracles of God.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For what?<a name=3:4></a> if some have not believed, shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Far be the thought: but let God be true, and every man false; according as it is written, So that thou shouldest be justified in thy words, and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  But if our unrighteousness commend God's righteousness, what shall we say?<a name=3:7></a> Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath?<a name=3:8></a> I speak according to man.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Far be the thought: since how shall God judge the world?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  For if the truth of God, in my lie, has more abounded to his glory, why yet am <i>I</i> also judged as a sinner?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  and not, according as we are injuriously charged, and according as some affirm that we say, Let us practise evil things, that good ones may come?<a name=3:12></a> whose judgment is just.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  What then?<a name=3:14></a> are we better?<a name=3:15></a> No, in no wise: for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  according as it is written, There is not a righteous [man], not even one;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  there is not the [man] that understands, there is not one that seeks after God.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  All have gone out of the way, they have together become unprofitable; there is not one that practises goodness, there is not so much as one:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; asps' poison [is] under their lips:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  swift their feet to shed blood;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  ruin and misery [are] in their ways,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  and way of peace they have not known:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  there is no fear of God before their eyes.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  Now we know that whatever the things the law says, it speaks to those under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  Wherefore by works of law no flesh shall be justified before him; for by law [is] knowledge of sin.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  But now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which [is] in Christ Jesus;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of [the] faith of Jesus.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  Where then [is] boasting?<a name=3:21></a> It has been excluded.<a name=3:22></a> By what law?<a name=3:23></a> of works?<a name=3:24></a> Nay, but by law of faith;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  for we reckon that a man is justified by faith, without works of law.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  Is [God] the God of Jews only?<a name=3:26></a> is he not of [the] nations also?<a name=3:27></a> Yea, of nations also:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  since indeed [it is] one God who shall justify [the] circumcision on the principle of faith, and uncircumcision by faith.<a name=3:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		31  Do we then make void law by faith?<a name=3:29></a> Far be the thought: [no,] but we establish law.<a name=3:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  What shall we say then that Abraham our father according to flesh has found?<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  For if Abraham has been justified on the principle of works, he has whereof to boast: but not before God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  for what does the scripture say?<a name=4:2></a> And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but of debt:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  but to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Blessed [they] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  blessed [the] man to whom [the] Lord shall not at all reckon sin.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  [Does] this blessedness then [rest] on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision?<a name=4:6></a> For we say that faith has been reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  How then has it been reckoned?<a name=4:8></a> when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?<a name=4:9></a> Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And he received [the] sign of circumcision [as] seal of the righteousness of faith which [he had] being in uncircumcision, that he might be [the] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  and father of circumcision, not only to those who are of [the] circumcision, but to those also who walk in the steps of the faith, during uncircumcision, of our father Abraham.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  For [it was] not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of [the] world, but by righteousness of faith.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For if they which [are] of law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the promise made of no effect.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  For law works wrath; but where no law is neither [is there] transgression.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  Therefore [it is] on the principle of faith, that [it might be] according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which [is] of the law, but to that also which [is] of Abraham's faith, who is father of us all,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  (according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things which be not as being;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  and not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadening of Sarah's womb,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief; but found strength in faith, giving glory to God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to do;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  wherefore also it was reckoned to him as righteousness.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  but on ours also, to whom, believing on him who has raised from among [the] dead Jesus our Lord,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification, it will be reckoned.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1  Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2  by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  And not only [that], but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  and endurance, experience; and experience, hope;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  and hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by [the] Holy Spirit which has been given to us:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  for we being still without strength, in [the] due time Christ has died for [the] ungodly.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  For scarcely for [the] just [man] will one die, for perhaps for [the] good [man] some one might also dare to die;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  but God commends <i>his</i> love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  Much rather therefore, having been now justified in [the power of] his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in [the power of] his life.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  And not only [that], but [we are] making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  For this [cause], even as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; and thus death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  (for until law sin was in [the] world; but sin is not put to account when there is no law;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  but death reigned from Adam until Moses, even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is [the] figure of him to come.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  But [shall] not the act of favour [be] as the offence?<a name=5:8></a> For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which [is] by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  And [shall] not as by one that has sinned [be] the gift?<a name=5:10></a> For the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the act of favour, of many offences unto justification.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ:)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  so then as [it was] by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  But law came in, in order that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  in order that, even as sin has reigned in [the power of] death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>

		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		3  Are you ignorant that we, as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death?<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among [the] dead by the glory of the Father, so <i>we</i> also should walk in newness of life.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For if we are become identified with [him] in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of [his] resurrection;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6  knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin.<a name=6:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  For when ye were bondmen of sin ye were free from righteousness.<a name=6:23></a>

		1  Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to those knowing law,) that law rules over a man as long as he lives?<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  so then, the husband being alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she be to another man; but if the husband should die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, though she be to another man.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, which [were] by the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit to death;

		7  What shall we say then?<a name=7:5></a> [is] the law sin?<a name=7:6></a> Far be the thought.<a name=7:7></a> But I had not known sin, unless by law: for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust;

	<div class="paragraph">
		8  but sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, wrought in me every lust; for without law sin [was] dead.<a name=7:8></a>

		11  for sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].<a name=7:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		13  Did then that which is good become death to me?<a name=7:12></a> Far be the thought.<a name=7:13></a> But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me by that which is good; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  For we know that the law is spiritual: but <i>I</i> am fleshly, sold under sin.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  For that which I do, I do not own: for not what I will, this I do; but what I hate, this I practise.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  But if what I do not will, this I practise, I consent to the law that [it is] right.<a name=7:17></a>

		22  For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man:

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3  For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4  in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5  For they that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; and they that are according to Spirit, the things of the Spirit.<a name=8:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		6  For the mind of the flesh [is] death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7  Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8  and they that are in flesh cannot please God.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		9  But <i>ye</i> are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ <i>he</i> is not of him:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		10  but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		11  But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		12  So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		13  for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		14  for as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		15  For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		16  The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		17  And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him].<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		18  For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed to us.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		19  For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		20  for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		21  that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		22  For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		23  And not only [that], but even <i>we</i> ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is] the redemption of our body.<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		24  For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what any one sees, why does he also hope?<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		25  But if what we see not we hope, we expect in patience.<a name=8:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		26  And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered.<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		27  But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God.<a name=8:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		28  But we <i>do</i> know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose.<a name=8:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		29  Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be [the] firstborn among many brethren.<a name=8:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		30  But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified.<a name=8:23></a>

		34  who is he that condemns?<a name=8:28></a> [It is] Christ who has died, but rather has been [also] raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us.<a name=8:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		35  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=8:30></a> tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?<a name=8:31></a>
