		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> My thought was that we might see in these chapters 11 to 20, what corresponds with the movements of the ark, as having the passage of the Jordan in view.<a name=1:4></a> The ark had moved from the outset (after it had been constructed) in leading the way in the wilderness, and in finding resting places for the people.<a name=1:5></a> It had moved to indicate the way for the people through the wilderness, as we learn from <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>.<a name=1:6></a> But as we are brought to the end of the journey towards the passage of the Jordan there are peculiar stipulations; particularly that the people were to follow about 2,000 cubits behind.<a name=1:7></a> They remained three days at the Jordan before passing over, preparing victuals and sanctifying themselves.<a name=1:8></a> It was said, "For ye have not passed this way heretofore".<a name=1:9></a> <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#3:4">Joshua  3:4</a>.<a name=1:10></a> It was on my mind that the consideration of the later chapters in John's gospel with that in view would enable us to follow the movements of the Lord as actuated by love for His people, so that we might be brought into correspondence with Him as following at a distance of 2,000 cubits behind; for the instruction that He gives had in view that the disciples should be brought into correspondence with Him.<a name=1:11></a> It is only thus that the glory is a known thing amongst us, and shines amongst us.<a name=1:12></a> There is really no testimony according to God apart from that -- the shining of the glory.<a name=1:13></a> We cannot but be impressed with the prominence given to glory in this connection.<a name=1:14></a> The Person who was about to move was Himself glorious, and the movements, and all that accompanied the movements, involved the shining out of His glory.<a name=1:15></a>

		In chapter 10 we see that His service to the nation is ended.<a name=2:1></a> He is definitely rejected, not only by the leaders of the people but by the Jews.<a name=2:2></a> You will observe the recurrence of the word "Jews" in chapter 10.<a name=2:3></a> The Jews surrounded Him in Solomon's porch; they had taken definite account of what He was amongst them and what He had done; then they challenged Him, and He meets their challenge by calling attention to His works and what He was amongst them, with the result that they took up stones to stone Him.<a name=2:4></a> The Jews as such thus committed themselves to His definite rejection, so at the close of that chapter He goes over the Jordan to the place where John baptised at the first and abode there -- not yet with His disciples, as He did later (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:54">John  11:54</a>), but He abode there; He is alone.<a name=2:5></a> It is from that point that He proposes to go back into Judaea, which had already declared itself in murderous opposition, so that He is now definitely facing death.<a name=2:6></a> Jerusalem and Judaea were to be the scene of it, and hence this movement has a known murderous hostility in view.<a name=2:7></a> He is going to meet death, but He is not here entering as a victim.<a name=2:8></a> He is entering it by way of challenge.<a name=2:9></a> He is not the Victim here at all; chapter 10 shows that He is free.<a name=2:10></a> He says, "I lay down my life that I may take it again.<a name=2:11></a> No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself.<a name=2:12></a> I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again".<a name=2:13></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:17">John  10:17</a>.<a name=2:14></a> He had received this commandment of His Father.<a name=2:15></a> It was a movement of His own, a movement involving His meeting death and His disposing of it.<a name=2:16></a> But in moving to meet death to dispose of it, what comes up first is a loved one.<a name=2:17></a> He says, "Let us go to <i>him</i>".<a name=2:18></a> He thinks of the saints.<a name=2:19></a> He goes in His personal dignity and power, for the point was that God should be glorified, and that the Son of God should be glorified.<a name=2:20></a> He was entering the domain of death.<a name=2:21></a> He does it of Himself,

		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> The ark going into Jordan does not present the victim.<a name=3:12></a> It is not a type of the victim, but of the power of God and the glory of God.<a name=3:13></a> John presents a divine Person dealing with death, and that is not the thought of a victim, and hence it is --"What ailed thee, O sea, that thou fleddest, and thou Jordan that thou wast driven back?<a name=3:14></a>" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#114:5">Psalm  114:5</a>.<a name=3:15></a> It is the presence of the Lord as the power of God.<a name=3:16></a> Chapter 10 shows that all that power is available for the sheep; that power is supreme right through.<a name=3:17></a> "No one shall seize them out of my hand".<a name=3:18></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:28">John  10:28</a>.<a name=3:19></a> But now, there is one in death; that is what we get in this chapter.<a name=3:20></a> There was a certain man sick, Lazarus of Bethany.<a name=3:21></a> Death was about to lay claim to this loved one, and hence the Lord enters the field to overthrow this power.<a name=3:22></a> We get His feelings in regard of death in John more than we get elsewhere.<a name=3:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God; it involves the power of God; God's Son marked out in power by resurrection of the dead.<a name=5:1></a> The gospel is concerning His Son, and it brings into the soul the knowledge of God -- the knowledge of God in power; but the Son is the power of God, and so the gospel is about Him.<a name=5:2></a> In the working out of the details in Romans there must be righteousness as a basis, but nevertheless it is the gospel of God concerning His Son, which, as received into the soul, carries with it the germ of all that follows; so that in Colossians one has come to it -- "in which ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=5:3></a> It is a faith position, and it is only in the light of the power of God seen thus that we can undertake to follow.<a name=5:4></a>

		I have it before me on this occasion to speak about spiritual dignity, the dignity which God intends to mark His people, both severally and collectively.<a name=84:1></a> With this in view, I hope to call attention to the anointing, particularly of that vessel spoken of in the passage in 1 Corinthians as "the Christ".<a name=84:2></a> "So also", it says, "is the Christ" -- referring to the saints as baptised in the power of one Spirit into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, and as having all been given to drink of one Spirit.<a name=84:3></a> That is what I have in view.<a name=84:4></a> The idea of this dignity is not what you might call new.<a name=84:5></a> It is not one of the things that a scribe discipled in the kingdom of the heavens would bring forth as new; but it is one of the things that, although old, retains its freshness, and is applicable now as when it was first mentioned.<a name=84:6></a>

		You will all remember how Jacob had the idea as God appeared to him in that remarkable dream of his, in which he saw a ladder reaching up into heaven, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it; when he awoke he said, "Surely God is in this place, and I knew it not".<a name=84:7></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:16">Genesis  28:16</a>.<a name=84:8></a> He got a conception of the character that belonged to that place where God was; and so he takes the stone and sets it up for a pillar, and pours oil upon it, as if to express the initial conception he had of the dignity of that place -- God's house.<a name=84:9></a> God did not forget that, nor would He have Jacob forget it.<a name=84:10></a> It was the beginning, as one might say, of his spiritual history in the house of God.<a name=84:11></a> A very small beginning indeed, and yet morally a very great beginning.<a name=84:12></a> How he got the idea of anointing I am not prepared to say, but he was the

		And so, beloved brethren, I wish to show from these four anointings in the gospels, that we have an expansion of Jacob's act.<a name=85:11></a> I desire to show that these women represent a fourfold conception of Christ as here in this world on behalf of God.<a name=85:12></a> He was the Anointed of God in a fourfold way; and the blending of these four conceptions, I hope to show, is that which, as in the assembly, qualifies it to be anointed; for God will not now anoint a vessel like Saul, where the moral conditions are not in agreement with the anointing.<a name=85:13></a> In his case, David respected the oil, but deplored and suffered from the sad disparity between the vessel and the oil upon it.<a name=85:14></a> God will never again anoint a vessel out of keeping with His holy oil.<a name=85:15></a> He needs not, beloved friends, for in His beloved Son undertaking to do His will, emptying Himself, as we are told, taking a servant's form, becoming flesh, He has got One wholly according to His own thought.<a name=85:16></a> "This is my beloved Son, in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew we have the divine thought in government presented in Christ; in Mark we have set forth in Him the divine thought in prophetic service; in Luke in Christ as anointed, it is the vessel for the presentation of grace to man; and in John the Son is presented -- One great enough in His own Person, being the Son, to reveal God, and to make the love of God known in this world.<a name=86:9></a> Now all these facts were known to God in anointing Christ at His baptism, but these women (as I may speak of them, although in three of the gospels it may be only one, but I speak of them as three, inasmuch as there are no names given except in John) these women came to conceive of these divine thoughts as presented in the ministry of Christ.<a name=86:10></a> What God knew divinely, they learnt to discover in their measure by experience, by coming into the benefit and under the influence of the ministry of Christ; so that the woman who anointed the Lord in Matthew virtually says, He is the One to govern.<a name=86:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can be in his place in the house of God, according to God, without a right conception of government, and that conception can only be seen

		in Christ; we have to learn it in Him.<a name=87:1></a> And as we learn it in Matthew, all other claimants to the place of rule are dismissed from our minds; not that we do not observe the indirect government of God at the present time in this world, we are thankful for those in authority, and we pray for them as we are enjoined; but they do not correspond with our ideal.<a name=87:2></a> As having come under the influence of Christ, having become, as Paul says, "legitimately subject to Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:21">1 Corinthians  9:21</a> we say in effect, There is no other ruler; the government is on His shoulder, He alone is fit to exercise it, and we anoint Him.<a name=87:3></a> Our ideal is there; we are in agreement with God -- He has anointed the King, and we have come under His rule.<a name=87:4></a> He has taught us to judge ourselves, to rule our own spirits, and no one can rule in the house of God who cannot rule his own spirit.<a name=87:5></a> The one who rules his own spirit is greater than he, it says, who takes a city; and no one can do that who has not come under the rule of Christ, who has not taken His yoke upon him and learned from Him.<a name=87:6></a> As thus taught, we have our conception of rule, and we express it as this woman did; she anointed Him on the head.<a name=87:7></a> With divine intelligence she recognised His official glory -- God's King.<a name=87:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so with Mark -- you will understand that I do not at all purpose to make comparisons of these records, interesting as that is -- Mark records what is almost identical with Matthew; he says of the woman, however, "she hath done what she could".<a name=87:9></a> What a suggestion there is in that!<a name=87:10></a> You may say, I am not called to serve; you may have in your mind that the service of God rests with a few who are specially gifted; but the statement that the Lord makes of this woman should come home to everyone, old and young.<a name=87:11></a> "She has done what she could".<a name=87:12></a> How about that, dear brethren?<a name=87:13></a> How many things there are that we <i>can</i> do, and we leave them undone!<a name=87:14></a>

		It is a question of what you <i>can</i> do, for God is not an "austere man", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19:21">Luke  19:21</a>.<a name=88:1></a> He does not expect nor exact beyond our ability; as He says elsewhere, "What thy hand finds to do, do it with thy might".<a name=88:2></a> <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#9:10">Ecclesiastes  9:10</a>.<a name=88:3></a> And I need not remind you of how much there is to be done.<a name=88:4></a> But what this woman did had direct reference to Christ, and it expressed her appreciation of the divine Servant; it expressed her conception of the service of God rightly rendered; as recorded in the earlier part of Mark, "He hath done all things well".<a name=88:5></a> <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#7:37">Mark  7:37</a> That was her conception.<a name=88:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in John 12 we have again anointing on the feet.<a name=89:4></a> It is not now appreciation of Him in government, or in service, or even in grace, although one cannot eliminate these, but the point is that He <i>loved</i> Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.<a name=89:5></a> It is a question, dear brethren, of love.<a name=89:6></a> "Hereby we have known love".<a name=89:7></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a> Mary had come to know love.<a name=89:8></a> It is not said of her, as was said of the woman in Luke, that she loved much; it is rather that <i>Christ loved her</i>.<a name=89:9></a> Divine love had come to her in the Son of God.<a name=89:10></a> He was on the way to give a full expression of it to God, and to man, and indeed to the whole universe.<a name=89:11></a> He was on the way; there were six days yet ahead of Him.<a name=89:12></a> But she expressed her conception of what was there; a murderous condition existed outside, but she had the box.<a name=89:13></a> Through His frequent visits to Bethany, He had proved to her the depths of the love that was in His heart, for God Himself had come down.<a name=89:14></a> With John it is "God so loved"; it is the revelation of Himself, and that by One who as we are told is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=89:15></a> Think of being visited, dear brethren, and that frequently, and in the most intimate way, by One who is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=89:16></a> Think of the infinite springs of affection that were present on the occasions of these visits.<a name=89:17></a> We are not told, as I said, as to her love earlier, but we are told that Jesus loved her; He loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.<a name=89:18></a> He had been at the tomb, where Lazarus lay in death; He had groaned at that tomb; He had wept at that tomb; He had called Lazarus by name out of it, and now He is in that circle, what we may call a circle of glory, for it is the circle where the light of the glory of the

		Now when the apostle wrote to the Corinthians they were very undignified, for they were allowing man in the flesh.<a name=90:6></a> They were allowing their Sauls, whom God had rejected; men of parts, maybe men of means, men of local Corinthian importance were obtaining recognition amongst them on account of these things.<a name=90:7></a> They were correspondingly undignified; they were out of accord with this wonderful blend of which I have spoken.<a name=90:8></a> And so the apostle brings in, not what existed amongst them, but what existed elsewhere.<a name=90:9></a> He refers to the human body, and he says by way of comparison, even as it has many members, so also is the Christ.<a name=90:10></a> He does, I admit, say later on that "Ye are Christ's body", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:27">1 Corinthians  12:27</a> but it was characteristic and not absolute.<a name=90:11></a> Here we have "the Christ" -- the most dignified body of persons ever known on the earth.<a name=90:12></a> The patriarchs had been anointed, as I said; Aaron had been anointed as priest, David as king, and Elisha as prophet; but there never had been a body of persons linked up, from all nations, Jews and Gentiles, as he says, into one body.<a name=90:13></a> For "in the power of one Spirit", he says, "we have all been baptised (not <i>ye</i> all, but <i>we</i> all) into one body".<a name=90:14></a> It is really an Ephesian company of brethren that he is referring to, not a Corinthian company.<a name=90:15></a> It is a company such as the epistle to the Ephesians contemplates -- Jews and Greeks, who had all been baptised in the power of one Spirit into one

		J.T.<a name=113:1></a> I thought we might proceed with the chapter in Matthew and perhaps touch a little on Luke and John, linking it all up together.<a name=113:2></a> What we have had can easily be linked up with the teaching of this chapter, for all must converge on the assembly; the different features of the gospels must necessarily converge there.<a name=113:3></a> We might touch on Luke and John.<a name=113:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God coming in in His rights in grace in Luke has all men in view.<a name=113:5></a> The preaching was to begin at Jerusalem, but to extend to all.<a name=113:6></a> In His rights in government as set forth in Matthew's gospel, He did not begin at Jerusalem, He began in Galilee.<a name=113:7></a> What we may not do in government we may do in grace, so the Lord directed that the preaching should begin at Jerusalem, but that the apostles should wait the promise of the Spirit from the Father; then the Lord is parted from them as He is blessing them and is carried up into heaven, and they worship; Him and return to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.<a name=113:8></a> That is, they are there in the full sense of grace.<a name=113:9></a> It was God's right to take up that attitude towards the guilty city.<a name=113:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=113:11></a>H.<a name=113:12></a> Would you say in that way that grace is operative now in Luke to deliver individuals from the governmental position?<a name=113:13></a> In Acts 2 we read, "The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved".<a name=113:14></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:47">Acts  2:47</a> I suppose, saved from that position?<a name=113:15></a>

		The wise men had begun the thing by coming to the house and falling down and worshipping Him, and in bringing out of their treasures gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and presenting them.<a name=138:1></a> They did not do that from experience; they did it instinctively as having light.<a name=138:2></a> The King was before them.<a name=138:3></a> The King had not entered on His administration, but He was to them the King; but at the end of the gospel the woman recognised it by anointing His head, and the Lord says, "Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her".<a name=138:4></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:13">Matthew  26:13</a>.<a name=138:5></a> It was to come down with the gospel, reminding us of what that woman did.<a name=138:6></a> She had a true estimate of the kind of vessel that was suitable for this great administration.<a name=138:7></a>

		Now the wise men had set out the idea in recognising the King, but this woman had come to it by observation, by experience.<a name=138:8></a> I think that the consideration of the occurrences throughout the gospel would enable us to see the rightness of her act, which was also in the house -- in the house of Simon the leper.<a name=138:9></a> The Lord, for instance, begins in the house of Peter, and Peter's wife's mother is sick of a fever.<a name=138:10></a> He touches her, and the fever left her and she arose and served Him; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:14">Matthew  8:14</a>, 15.<a name=138:11></a> Then He is in the house of Matthew the publican and sits down with publicans and sinners; that is, the company there would bring Him into reproach; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#9:10">Matthew  9:10</a>.<a name=138:12></a> One must accept that -- that those whom God brings in are of God's selection, and may bring us under reproach.<a name=138:13></a> And so on right through; you get Jairus's daughter in the house.<a name=138:14></a> The Lord comes into the house and there are flute players there and people making a noise.<a name=138:15></a> That is not suitable to the house; administration in the house cannot be carried on under such conditions -- things that appeal to men's senses.<a name=138:16></a> So He puts them all out and He takes certain

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The anointing by the woman in Simon the leper's house serves as an indication of what those who love the Lord may come to by appreciating Him as presented in this gospel.<a name=147:3></a> Evidently she anoints Him in relation to the feature of the truth presented in the gospel; and inasmuch as it is in the house it seems a fitting response to what the Holy Spirit presents in the ministry of the Lord, for the idea of a householder is prominent in this gospel.<a name=147:4></a> The institution of the Lord's supper following in this chapter, and being also in the house, indicates, I think, that those who partake should know what householding denotes spiritually.<a name=147:5></a> It says in the Psalms, "He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#113:9">Psalm  113:9</a>, and I think this gospel teaches us how to keep house spiritually so that in result there should be a generation according to God.<a name=147:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=147:7></a>H.<a name=147:8></a> Would you say a word as to how this gospel in general bears on the thought of keeping house?<a name=147:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=147:10></a> You will agree that government has a great deal to do with housekeeping.<a name=147:11></a> We have the idea of householding here, as we have already mentioned, also in chapter 13, and then again in chapter 20, where the householder is brought in in connection with service; and later still in chapter 21, the same idea is again introduced.<a name=147:12></a> It is a feature of the truth that perhaps the Lord would emphasise, if there is to be further gathering.<a name=147:13></a> It is said in the prophet that those who joined themselves to the Lord God.<a name=147:14></a>

		who took hold of His covenant, and kept His sabbaths, should be made joyful in His house of prayer; He would accept their sacrifices and their burnt offerings, and then it is added, "The Lord God which gathereth .<a name=148:1></a>.<a name=148:2></a>.<a name=148:3></a> .<a name=148:4></a>.<a name=148:5></a>saith, Yet will I gather others besides those that are gathered", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#56:8">Isaiah  56:8</a>.<a name=148:6></a> I thought perhaps the Lord might help us on that line because there are many being gathered, but in order that others may be gathered, God looks for house conditions, and it is quite evident that house conditions are largely dependent on the government of the house -- on the rule that is there.<a name=148:7></a>

		In the anointing here the woman's name is not given, nor is it given in Mark, and yet the memorial of her is to be kept, so that it is not so much the person herself, inasmuch as her name is not given, but rather what she represents, and in these two gospels the memorial of her is to be continued.<a name=148:8></a> Evidently it cannot be continued unless there are present the principles that she recognised, for she anointed the head.<a name=148:9></a> The head was anointed in both gospels.<a name=148:10></a> Matthew refers to the administration of the Lord.<a name=148:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=149:14></a> The anointing signified that she appreciated the Person through whom the principle of rule came in.<a name=149:15></a> This woman would be a good housekeeper; she represents the result of the teaching.<a name=149:16></a> She committed herself to Him, and the memorial of her throughout the dispensation is intended to maintain the principle of rule, so that the memorial precedes the Lord's supper, hence 1 Corinthians was written to assert the rights of the Lord in connection with His supper.<a name=149:17></a>

		Luke has the house in view, but it is rather that it should be full; all things are ready, but there is nothing about the king's discrimination.<a name=150:1></a> Matthew carries the thought of government right to the end, so we see in chapter 25 the completion of it in regard of the nations -- the goats go away into everlasting punishment and the righteous into life eternal.<a name=150:2></a> He pursues the thought of rule to its final end.<a name=150:3></a> Luke is more concerned about bringing in souls; God would have His house full.<a name=150:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=155:3></a> Well, quite.<a name=155:4></a> The kings of Israel and Judah were each on his throne in the open space; it was a show day, and Micah was sent for to prophesy concerning the Syrians, and he says, "I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him", <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#22:19">1 Kings  22:19</a> and that really is Matthew.<a name=155:5></a> The prophet was put into prison for his testimony, but he was in the light of the position.<a name=155:6></a> The government of God goes on, but what is to be observed in regard to the present position of Christ in heaven involves that all the dispositions of God in connection with the nations have reference to the testimony.<a name=155:7></a> There is no other concern with God now.<a name=155:8></a> There is the gospel and there is the assembly, and these are the chief interests of God today, and all His dispositions on the earth (and He is in supreme control of everything) have the furtherance of the testimony in view.<a name=155:9></a> Evil is allowed to go on, and it is coming to a head, but it is allowed on God's terms, within the divine limitations, as I think these parables show.<a name=155:10></a> The kingdom of the heavens implies that God is in supreme control of things and that He carries them to an issue.<a name=155:11></a> Hence we see in the parables in chapter 22 not only the destruction of Jerusalem, but that the one unsuited to the marriage scene is cast out into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth; that is, what is unsuitable in Christendom is dealt with finally.<a name=155:12></a> The parables pursue things to their final issue, so the more we understand Matthew the more stayed and restful we can be, knowing that everything reaches its final issue under God's hand.<a name=155:13></a>

		THE LORD'S COMING IN AND GOING OUT

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=162:1></a> Some of us have been noticing the reference made by Peter, when speaking in the upper room, as to the Lord coming in and going out among them: "All the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us".<a name=162:2></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>.<a name=162:3></a> We were noting that, and that the qualification of a nominee for the vacant apostleship was that such an one had assembled with the others during that time: "It is necessary therefore that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>,22.<a name=162:4></a> It occurred to me that the Lord in the house from that point of view becomes peculiarly interesting, for the coming in and going out would apply to His being in the house; and in connection with that, the unfolding of what is spoken outside is in the house.<a name=162:5></a> I think it would be of interest for us to look at this subject, connecting it with the house of God, where only His coming in and going out are to be known now.<a name=162:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=162:7></a> Have you in your mind such a meeting as this, as well as at the Supper?<a name=162:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=162:9></a> Well, the house of God is a general thought; it is that over which the Lord is as having built it.<a name=162:10></a> He is Son over it, and He is a great Priest over it.<a name=162:11></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=163:1></a> Quite so.<a name=163:2></a> To apprehend these movements one has to understand the house and to be in it intelligently, which is wholly a spiritual matter.<a name=163:3></a> Whilst the saints are said to be the house of God in a provisional way, yet it is a spiritual house, and it has to be apprehended spiritually; one has to begin at the foundation, and take account of the material, as well as of the architecture.<a name=163:4></a> I refer to it particularly as corresponding with what the disciples had in the days of His flesh and after He rose from the dead, for the period was from the time of His baptism until He ascended.<a name=163:5></a> It says, "beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us".<a name=163:6></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:22">Acts  1:22</a>.<a name=163:7></a> The house today is that which corresponds with what they had when the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them between these two events.<a name=163:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=163:12></a> The Lord has the door open to come in here; He has arranged for that.<a name=163:13></a> It ties in the fact that He said, "The world seeth me no more; but ye see me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:19">John  14:19</a>.<a name=163:14></a> It is a spiritual matter.<a name=163:15></a> Judas wanted to know how it was that He would manifest Himself to them and not to the world, and the Lord began in His explanation with love.<a name=163:16></a> "If a man love me".<a name=163:17></a> The door is left open in that way so that He comes in and goes out; that is, He is free.<a name=163:18></a> It depends on the Holy Spirit being here in the assembly.<a name=163:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=179:6></a> I think the judging in those places represents some divine principle which the Lord would enforce.<a name=179:7></a> The first thing to see is that Samuel went in circuit.<a name=179:8></a> Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah was his circuit, and in those places he judged Israel all the days of his life.<a name=179:9></a> Notwithstanding that a king had been asked for and granted, Samuel retained his service in Israel all the days of his life.<a name=179:10></a> That fact is typical of the Lord's present, patient service to His people, even though the many have selected a king, that which is in agreement with the nations around, in other words, are bound up with the present clerical system -- that which involves the rejection of the Lord in this light -- not a murderous rejection, for they were not intending to put Samuel to death, but they rejected him.<a name=179:11></a> Samuel said, "God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#12:23">1 Samuel  12:23</a> so the testimony in regard of him is, he continued to judge Israel in these places all the days of his life.<a name=179:12></a> It meant he continued to judge Israel even while Saul reigned.<a name=179:13></a> Notwithstanding that the mass of the people of God today have selected that which is in agreement with the nations -- the clerical system is really in agreement with national religious customs -- the Lord continues to serve, and intends to do so.<a name=179:14></a> The Lord is continuing to judge His people everywhere; every denomination comes under His eye, and He carries on, and maintains His judicial attitude towards them.<a name=179:15></a> His judgment is according to certain principles; He does not accommodate His judgment to them.<a name=179:16></a> In Bethel He would judge in the light of the house of

		J.T.<a name=180:4></a> Mizpah is not so clear, but apparently has reference to the covenant, which is an outward witness, a witness between two, a witness between Laban and Jacob; and evidently the Spirit of God takes up the town with this name in Samuel, and gives it a place of prominence.<a name=180:5></a> The kingdom was renewed there, or set up there.<a name=180:6></a> It was there, too, that God gave the victory to His people, when by the command of Samuel they were gathered together there, and drew water and poured it out before the Lord and fasted in humble acknowledgement of their weakness and inability to meet the Philistines.<a name=180:7></a> It would stand for the faithfulness of God: "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us".<a name=180:8></a> He never relinquishes His love for His people.<a name=180:9></a> The Lord's supper would be the sign of that to us; the unchanging love of Christ is witnessed there; He is "the same yesterday, and today, and for ever".<a name=180:10></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:8">Hebrews  13:8</a>.<a name=180:11></a> In His own house you come to a more immediate sphere, the sphere of His direct affections; and judgment carried on there would mean that the family relationships would be adjusted.<a name=180:12></a> I think that is what is going on now.<a name=180:13></a> The Lord would remove all that hinders the reality of our place as brethren, so that we should not be using the word without having the character of the thing.<a name=180:14></a>

		I have it before me to speak about subjection, having in view that we may see how that in subjection to Christ we may adorn the house of God.<a name=192:1></a> In the epistles which speak of the house of God we find references to adornment.<a name=192:2></a> In 1 Timothy, in Titus, and in 1 Peter from which I have read, the Holy Spirit refers to adornment, and the references show that it should appear in those who are subject.<a name=192:3></a> In 1 Timothy women are to learn in silence in all subjection, and their adornment is not to be that which the world employs, but that which becomes those making profession of the fear of God -- good works.<a name=192:4></a> Special consideration is paid by the Spirit to those who, as in the government of God, are in the place of subjection.<a name=192:5></a> I do not refer to the subject for the sisters alone, but rather to bring out the thought that adornment in the house of God is dependent on subjection to Christ.<a name=192:6></a>

		I have in mind to speak about intimacy, first as with the Lord, and then spiritual intimacy with one another.<a name=202:1></a> I may say at the outset that what underlies this intimacy is love -- a known love.<a name=202:2></a> John speaks not only of what may have been heard of by way of testimony, but of a known love.<a name=202:3></a> He speaks of love first as known objectively, as he says, "because he has laid down his life for us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>); but if that knowledge is to be maintained, it must be by the Spirit; hence John in his epistle brings in the Spirit, saying, "Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:13">1 John  4:13</a>.<a name=202:4></a> The Canticles correspond somewhat with John's first epistle; it treats of love, but not what I would call a known love.<a name=202:5></a> It would be impossible to understand what might be called the emotional, or poetical books of the Old Testament except as we understand love.<a name=202:6></a> As reading them, we are enabled, through having love by the Spirit, to fill out, so to speak, the blanks.<a name=202:7></a> The most casual reader of the Canticles will observe a certain uneasiness in the feminine speaker; settled peace through redemption was not known, and the Holy Spirit was not given.<a name=202:8></a> The state of many a believer at the present time corresponds; love is known to exist in Christ, but through ignorance and carelessness it is not known as in union with Christ.<a name=202:9></a> No one really can know love in continuity except as in union, and when I use that word it is not as having any special light upon it beyond that it involves the possession of the Spirit, which is really elementary; the possession of the Spirit underlies union.<a name=202:10></a>

		There is in Romans the idea of a descending love and there is also the idea of an ascending love.<a name=203:1></a> It is in the maintenance of these two thoughts in power in the soul that union is understood and love known as a permanent possession.<a name=203:2></a> If the ascent does not correspond with the descent, something has intervened, for, to use a simple figure, water always rises to its own level; hence the love of God that is shed abroad in the heart of the believer by the Spirit is intended to return to its source.<a name=203:3></a> In Romans 5 it is seen in its descent; it is a pure, holy, untainted, and untaintable stream; it comes in there on the line of the administration of the Lord; it is His glory to bring it into our hearts, and so it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.<a name=203:4></a> I refer to that particularly because God notifies us, as it were, at the outset as to the incoming of love that it is brought in by the Holy Spirit and shed abroad in our hearts.<a name=203:5></a> Having it in the heart we look at everything that seems to be adverse in this world as in our favour: "tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us".<a name=203:6></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:4">Romans  5:4</a>,5.<a name=203:7></a>

		little hold of the divine idea of the trees of the Lord -- of men divinely satisfied and built up after Christ, the apostle has to refer to what he might have kept secret, but which, indeed, should have been known to them in a moral way -- for he had been amongst them eighteen months or more -- that is, to "a man in Christ" whom <i>he</i> knew.<a name=215:1></a> Morally he should have been known amongst <i>them</i> but their measure was according to man in the flesh; "these", he says, "measuring themselves by themselves .<a name=215:2></a>.<a name=215:3></a>.<a name=215:4></a> are not wise" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:12">2 Corinthians  10:12</a>); that was the standard they had.<a name=215:5></a> Paul's standard was different from that.<a name=215:6></a> He apprehended Christ as a Man before God, a Man who spoke to him out of heaven in the Hebrew language, saying, "I am Jesus" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:5">Acts  9:5</a>; he laid hold of the divine thought in Christ as He is, so he says, "Henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:16">2 Corinthians  5:16</a>.<a name=215:7></a> It was Christ in another sphere, in another condition.<a name=215:8></a> Then later he says, "I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago .<a name=215:9></a>.<a name=215:10></a>.<a name=215:11></a> caught up to the third heaven", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:2">2 Corinthians  12:2</a>.<a name=215:12></a> Was ever such a tree in paradise?<a name=215:13></a>

		Well, that is how the matter stood, but I want to show you the mutual features which the Holy Spirit interweaves here between Paul's departure from Ephesus, having finished his work there, and his return and sending for the elders.<a name=237:1></a> I want to show you how the Holy Spirit weaves into it all the features of the assembly.<a name=237:2></a> You will notice there were with the apostle certain ones at Troas, "Sopater son of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:4">Acts  20:4</a>.<a name=237:3></a> These represented, as you will observe, not only different countries and localities but even different continents.<a name=237:4></a> Now one of the most baneful sentiments that can arise in the assembly is local and national feelings, and I have no doubt the Holy Spirit introduces these brothers so that we might see how perfectly united in spirit and how entirely free from all such feelings they were.<a name=237:5></a> If the national feeling is cherished you cannot have development.<a name=237:6></a> The house of God becomes stifled by the existence of these feelings; it is not that we cease to be Christians, but we cease to recognise the house of God in its universal character.<a name=237:7></a> It is never viewed in any other way than universal.<a name=237:8></a> It is <i>never</i> limited to a local company or nation.<a name=237:9></a>

		In conclusion there is one other thought I would add.<a name=240:17></a> The next thing after they are come together to break bread is that Paul is mentioned.<a name=240:18></a> It says, "Paul" (verse 7).<a name=240:19></a> I have been speaking of the mutual side, that Paul was included in the <i>we</i>, but what is to be continued is to be entirely governed by Paul's ministry.<a name=240:20></a> Peter and John are not to be neglected, but here Paul stands out before our souls.<a name=240:21></a> Paul represents Christ in a peculiar way.<a name=240:22></a> He had a special place, as the Lord says: "He is an elect vessel unto me", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>.<a name=240:23></a> So we read, "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread, <i>Paul</i> discoursed to them", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:7">Acts  20:7</a>.<a name=240:24></a> He discourses and then he breaks bread and then he talks.<a name=240:25></a> Two words are used here, the first in verse 7 is <i>discoursed</i>, the second in verse 11 is <i>conversed</i>.<a name=240:26></a> I only refer to that because discourse is connected

		and stands out as a governing principle as we break bread.<a name=241:1></a> Conversation followed because it gave opportunity for the expression of any exercises that may have arisen during the discourse.<a name=241:2></a> The Lord looks for that.<a name=241:3></a> If there are any exercises produced by the discourse He will meet them when they converse.<a name=241:4></a> The word 'talked' or 'spoken' in verse 11 has a conversational significance.<a name=241:5></a> It is not a connected discourse.<a name=241:6></a> We find in Matthew 13, that the Lord went into the house, and it says His disciples came to Him.<a name=241:7></a> He places Himself where they could come to Him and ask Him questions.<a name=241:8></a> And they came and asked, and He opened up things to them.<a name=241:9></a> Here it came after they had broken bread.<a name=241:10></a> "When he therefore was come up again and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:11">Acts  20:11</a>.<a name=241:11></a> It was a typical occasion.<a name=241:12></a> There was opportunity in the conversation for inquiry, so that there could be no difficulty.<a name=241:13></a> The Lord looks for us to come to Him; "His disciples came to him", and coming to Him all difficulties are solved.<a name=241:14></a> He is ready to answer, and I have no doubt that such a conversational state of things ensued on that occasion after Paul had broken bread.<a name=241:15></a> One's desire is to occupy our attention with the assembly, to see it as it was, so that we can move in the light of it now.<a name=241:16></a> Unless we see it as it was, we shall not understand the present.<a name=241:17></a> We have to see it as it has been, and what it shall be.<a name=241:18></a> The Scriptures are definite as to what has been and what shall be.<a name=241:19></a> What is hazy is what is <i>now</i>.<a name=241:20></a> We need to be in the light of what has been and what shall be, so as to be in the light of what is present.<a name=241:21></a> There is the light of the former glory and of the latter glory, and they converge in the present position, and in that light we can have understanding of what is becoming to Christ in a day of brokenness.<a name=241:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=243:6></a> The assembly as developed at Corinth answered to the tabernacle in the wilderness, whereas the assembly as established at Ephesus had the land in view.<a name=243:7></a> As you will observe in verse 11, Paul remained at Corinth one year and six months, teaching among them the word <i>of God</i>, but in verse 10 of the next chapter we read, "This took place for two years, so that all that inhabited Asia heard the word of the <i>Lord</i>".<a name=243:8></a> Then in verse 20 it says, "Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and prevailed".<a name=243:9></a> That, I think, has reference to the conquest of the land, for it goes on to say in verse 11, "God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body and put upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits went out".<a name=243:10></a> Then I think we have, in these Jewish exorcists and the seven sons of Sceva, a reference to the seven-fold power of evil against the testimony, which the conquest of the land brought out.<a name=243:11></a> Everything went down at Ephesus before the Lord.<a name=243:12></a> No power could lift up its head against the testimony there, so that the assembly was established there in complete superiority to the power of Satan.<a name=243:13></a> But the overthrow of the enemy is not so much in view in chapter 18; it is rather to establish what is capable of <i>going through</i>.<a name=243:14></a> The word of God, conveying the thoughts of God, is therefore more in evidence.<a name=243:15></a>

		I have in mind to speak about holiness, a subject which one approaches with much diffidence, but it is so essential that one is encouraged to touch upon it for the Lord's sake.<a name=289:2></a> It is but little known, notwithstanding that it is a subject as extensively dealt with in Scripture as any other, and it is particularly in evidence in the way the Spirit of God is designated in those portions which treat of grace.<a name=289:3></a> It will be found by comparison that the evangelist Luke, who presents grace in Christ, employs the designation "Holy Spirit" when referring to the Spirit of God more than others; not that John and the other gospel writers have not holiness in view, for John has the seraphim in mind, as I hope to show, but Luke speaks of the <i>Holy</i> Spirit much more frequently than John.<a name=289:4></a> John treats of the Spirit of God, but refers to Him as the Spirit, or as the Spirit of truth, presenting the truth, as He does from the side of divine sovereignty -- from the side of life.<a name=289:5></a> He has ever in view to bring in life -- living creatures.<a name=289:6></a> The life introduced thus is holy, essentially holy: "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a>, the Lord said to Nicodemus.<a name=289:7></a> The truth is presented in relation to the Holy One, as John says recording Peter's confession, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:69">John  6:69</a>.<a name=289:8></a>

		Christ comes in by way of life according to John, and in connection with life, for in Him was life and it was a <i>holy</i> life; whereas as presented by Luke He comes in on the line of grace, and the tendency is, in receiving grace, in approaching God as set forth in that gospel, to overlook the thought that He is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is noteworthy in this connection that Paul at the very outset in his presentation of the gospel emphasises the same feature -- the grace that has come to us in One who had been marked by holiness.<a name=290:6></a> It has come to us by way of holiness.<a name=290:7></a> Of old the cherubim guarded the way of the tree of life.<a name=290:8></a> The cherubim represent the will and government of God, for He will not have persons alive before Him who are not holy.<a name=290:9></a> That Adam should have partaken of the tree of life as he was would have been a disaster, an unspeakable disaster, but Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his <i>holy</i> myriads", <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#1:14">Jude  1:14</a>.<a name=290:10></a> How those holy myriads are produced it remained for Scripture to tell, but Enoch, who evidently was alone in walking with God on earth, is led to see that he is not to be alone for ever.<a name=290:11></a> The Lord is to have myriads.<a name=290:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God was not to be limited to one man: He valued an Enoch then as He values one today, for in the love of His heart He looked for company.<a name=290:13></a> Enoch walked <i>with</i> God, and, I repeat, God valued that; indeed He valued Enoch so much that He told him before He took him to heaven that he pleased Him.<a name=290:14></a> There is hardly a thought in the Old Testament more touching than that God should have graciously communicated to this man before He took him out of a world where only corruption prevailed, where men did evil every day, and grieved Him every day, that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so now we have the Lord as the holy One.<a name=291:6></a> Enoch and all other saints were holy, but <i>Jesus</i> was "<i>the</i> holy one of God".<a name=291:7></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:69">John  6:69</a>.<a name=291:8></a> As He came into this world we have the testimony by Luke, "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>.<a name=291:9></a> How precious He was to God as born into the world, and God claimed Him thus.<a name=291:10></a> He was infinitely holy, I need hardly say, from the outset, <i>absolutely</i> free from all taint.<a name=291:11></a> The Spirit of God in Luke surrounds the scene, as it were, with a holy atmosphere, angels attending, and "that holy thing", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>, as the Spirit of God designates the Babe, claimed as the Son of God.<a name=291:12></a> So we have holiness in the mind of God associated with Christ from the very outset.<a name=291:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If one looks at the passage in the opening of Luke's gospel, one is impressed by the recurrence of the word 'holy' especially as regards the Spirit.<a name=291:14></a> The divine ideal was coming into the world, One who could hold Himself absolutely free from the corruption that obtained there.<a name=291:15></a> So, too, the holy myriads will be in correspondence with Him.<a name=291:16></a> God is to surround Christ with myriads, but they are to be holy.<a name=291:17></a> As the Lord was bearing the judgment on the cross, meeting the wrath of God as regards sin and sins, He said, "Thou art holy".<a name=291:18></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:3">Psalm  22:3</a>.<a name=291:19></a> He maintained there in His holy soul and in His utterance what was due to God.<a name=291:20></a> He was not only meeting righteousness.<a name=291:21></a> God <i>was</i> righteous, but He was more than righteous, He was holy, and holy as inhabiting the praises of Israel.<a name=291:22></a> Wonderful thought!<a name=291:23></a> that God should inhabit, not heaven, but the praises of Israel, and in inhabiting these He was holy.<a name=291:24></a> So in that dark hour that stands alone, Christ is making known to us that if God is

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, as we were saying, the apostle Paul, in opening his great gospel epistle, refers to the Spirit of holiness, "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead".<a name=292:2></a> One has no difficulty in including His own resurrection in that passage, but it refers doubtless to the resurrection of others.<a name=292:3></a> It comes down to ourselves in a very touching way, for it involves that our resurrection shall be of that Spirit.<a name=292:4></a> We shall be raised absolutely free from taint of sin, and shall come out in glory in entire suitability, and in entire correspondence with Him who is to come with the holy myriads.<a name=292:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the question is as to the state of our souls now, there is no question as to what we shall be.<a name=292:6></a> This epistle, which is a fundamental epistle, introduces the element of holiness at the very outset, and Jesus testified to it as He died, "bearing our sins in his own body on the tree", for the epistle tells us that God sent His own Son "in likeness of flesh of sin" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a> -- it is a remarkable expression -- and yet He was infinitely holy, and could say as sin-bearer, "Thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel".<a name=292:7></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:3">Psalm  22:3</a>.<a name=292:8></a> So in that gospel which is to lay the foundation of Christianity in souls the apostle introduces the thought at once that the Lord Jesus was "marked out" -- not made -- "Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness".<a name=292:9></a> Thus we have the element of holiness, the germ of it, for the gospel received into the believer's soul carries the germ of everything with it; every feature is there to be developed.<a name=292:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=310:1></a> I thought this passage in John would bring the subject of the counsels of God before us in a concise way as they are in view in this gospel -- these verses being a sort of epitome of what John has to unfold.<a name=310:2></a> He reaches the family thought immediately.<a name=310:3></a> It will be observed that he places the right of being the children of God on the ground of our reception of Christ and our believing on His name.<a name=310:4></a> We are not exactly regarded as born into the family; the question of birth comes in as <i>fitting</i> us for the position, but the position itself is on the ground of the reception of Christ.<a name=310:5></a>

		The passage in Proverbs came into my mind because I think that book has a great place in the education of the family.<a name=310:6></a> As we shall see, the right to be the children of God is necessarily come to, under the tuition of the Lord.<a name=310:7></a> I think that the Son of the Father's love, into whose kingdom we are thus brought, is typified in Solomon.<a name=310:8></a> There is an intimate relation between the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love and the family; the one, I think, merges into the other, but the tuition is of relatively equal importance with the position.<a name=310:9></a> If we are to have the right to be God's children, a right which He gives us, we must come under the tuition of the Lord, not exactly as the Lord, but as the Son of the Father's love.<a name=310:10></a> There is authority in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love, but it is hardly the authority of the kingdom, it is the rule of the <i>Son</i>.<a name=310:11></a> Hence Proverbs, in the early chapters particularly, abounds with parental references and terms, for, whilst He is the Son of the Father's love, yet He takes up a parental place towards us: we come under

		I have in mind to speak of the Holy Spirit as here to bring about immediate, intimate, family relationships and the affections suited to them.<a name=327:1></a> We are called into God's immediate family -- that is our greatest blessing.<a name=327:2></a> In the pattern of the house given to David by the Spirit, we read of upper chambers and of inner chambers; the upper chambers suggestive of that family dignity which is to mark the people of God, and the inner chambers speaking of that intimacy and nearness to God and to Christ which also belongs to the people of God.<a name=327:3></a> Every family in heaven and on earth is named of the Father and has part in the scheme of glory, but meanwhile He is working to bring about a family which is in the greatest possible nearness to Himself as having the Spirit of His Son, to whom also belong the "upper chambers", as indicated in the Lord's message through Mary to His brethren after He was risen, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".<a name=327:4></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=327:5></a> The disciples had been prepared for this by the Lord; the relationships and the affections suited to them had been in view in the various manifestations of His glory they had witnessed in His life on earth.<a name=327:6></a> In chapter 2 we read, "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory".<a name=327:7></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:11">John  2:11</a>.<a name=327:8></a> That was the beginning, and so we have a succession in John's record calculated to prepare their hearts for the place designed for them in the counsels of God.<a name=327:9></a> The Lord said to Nicodemus, "No one has gone up into heaven save he who came down out of heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven".<a name=327:10></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a>.<a name=327:11></a> And again to the Jews, "What and if ye

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in this connection I want to speak of the Spirit in His service in the kingdom and in the house, the assembly, and in His service in the family.<a name=328:11></a> The relation of the Holy Spirit in the kingdom is a wide subject, but I only touch upon one feature of it which affects the family.<a name=328:12></a> It is one thing to be in the kingdom, and another to be in the house of God, and still another to be in the family.<a name=328:13></a> There are intimate relations in all these concentric circles into which we have come.<a name=328:14></a> If we think of David, that man after God's own heart, a remarkable king, yet he could not build the house.<a name=328:15></a> As to himself he had to confess, "my house is not so with God".<a name=328:16></a> <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:5">2 Samuel  23:5</a>.<a name=328:17></a> He was no success as a family man, great as he was in the kingdom.<a name=328:18></a> We have to distinguish and not stop short in the kingdom, but press forward to the truth of the house.<a name=328:19></a> Solomon built Him an house; He had also his own house.<a name=328:20></a> I connect the thought of the family with that.<a name=328:21></a> We read of Joseph as having a house, Samuel too, to which he returned, and where also he

	<div class="paragraph">
		judged Israel.<a name=329:1></a> So there is that which corresponds to this thought now, that which is the immediate sphere of God and of Christ, the family thought, and the Holy Spirit is here that the saints might be in immediate, intimate relation to God as their Father.<a name=329:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then there is the service of the kingdom.<a name=329:3></a> Romans gives the doctrine of it, not indeed doctrine cast in iron moulds, or set forth in creeds, but as Moses said, "My doctrine shall drop as rain, my speech flow down as dew, as small rain upon the tender herb, and as showers on the grass".<a name=329:4></a> <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:2">Deuteronomy  32:2</a>.<a name=329:5></a> That is what Romans is, it is doctrine that comes down.<a name=329:6></a> We cannot be right without doctrine, it is like the banks to a river, it keeps the mind in proper channels.<a name=329:7></a> So then the kingdom is the sphere where the will of God is dominant, and where the Spirit operates, and there it is that the doctrine comes down from heaven itself with refreshing power.<a name=329:8></a> In the kingdom the doctrine is distilled like the dew.<a name=329:9></a> We come into it through our Lord Jesus Christ, everything reaches us that way.<a name=329:10></a> Tribulation existing, it becomes our servant; instead of outward deliverance from evil, we are made inwardly greater than the evil; we overcome evil with good.<a name=329:11></a> That is the triumph of God!<a name=329:12></a> This kingdom levies tribute from the very evil elements it has to do with, and calls them into service for good.<a name=329:13></a> So "tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us".<a name=329:14></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:3">Romans  5:3</a> - 5.<a name=329:15></a> The action of the Spirit under the Lord -- for it is a feature of the kingdom -- is to shed the love of God abroad in our hearts.<a name=329:16></a> The Lord is the Lord of glory, and He is bringing in authoritatively the love of God.<a name=329:17></a> We are indeed vessels of mercy, fitted for glory; and now the Lord is insisting on the glory being introduced, the love of God filling the vessel.<a name=329:18></a> We are to be filled with the glory of the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=330>[Page 330]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		love of God.<a name=330:1></a> Is the Lord allowing us to be in this scene empty and inactive?<a name=330:2></a> No, the Lord is the Lord of glory; He is over the glory, it is under His hand.<a name=330:3></a> Glory has shone out in the death of Jesus, it is where the love of God shone out, and it has shone in our hearts.<a name=330:4></a> That really brings us to the ministry of the new covenant, for we are to be active in spiritual life.<a name=330:5></a> The letter kills, the Spirit gives life, and we read, "the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=330:6></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:17">2 Corinthians  3:17</a>.<a name=330:7></a> So the Lord brings in the Holy Spirit into our hearts, and He sheds the love of God abroad there, and we are thus in the kingdom, not in name only, but in power.<a name=330:8></a> The heart is subdued by the love of God; we bow.<a name=330:9></a> There are many other things connected with the kingdom, but the feature I would press at this time is that the Lord brings into our hearts by the Spirit the holy love of God.<a name=330:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we are fit for the assembly.<a name=330:11></a> No one is rightly in the assembly who is not filled with the glory.<a name=330:12></a> It is a wonderful service that the Lord is carrying on for us in filling us with the glory, fitting us for our place in the assembly, as having the love of God in our hearts by the Spirit.<a name=330:13></a> That is the effect of coming under the Lord's administration in the kingdom; the Spirit has gained a footing in our hearts -- a dwelling there; we are filled with the glory.<a name=330:14></a> As dwelling there, He ornaments the saints, but He works from the interior; He begins with the heart.<a name=330:15></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#23:26">Proverbs  23:26</a> "Son, give me thy heart".<a name=330:16></a> He takes possession of your heart, and He reads your heart, "He who searches the heart knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God".<a name=330:17></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:27">Romans  8:27</a>.<a name=330:18></a> What a wonderful sphere of operation is the heart of the Christian!<a name=330:19></a> Well, the kingdom produces that, and when your heart is secured, you are ripe for the assembly.<a name=330:20></a> The kingdom contributes to the house.<a name=330:21></a> I think that these holy gatherings --
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=331>[Page 331]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		holy convocations, they are called in Scripture, which are, thank God, becoming more and more general -- are intended to forward the house operations of the Spirit.<a name=331:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I speak of the house service of the Spirit, I refer to what is general or universal, but the Holy Spirit operates also locally.<a name=331:2></a> Indeed, so pronounced was the local feature in the early days, that the apostle in referring to his journey to Jerusalem <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:23">Acts  20:23</a> says that "the Holy Spirit witnesses to me in <i>every</i> city that bonds and afflictions await me".<a name=331:3></a> But then He operates house-wise, generally.<a name=331:4></a> The Lord is looking for the reproduction of Himself: you must have all the saints for the reproduction of Christ: "So also is the Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>: That means the saints put together, not in a local way but in a general way, an Ephesian way, Jews and Greeks merged in one whole.<a name=331:5></a> "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body .<a name=331:6></a>.<a name=331:7></a>.<a name=331:8></a> and have been all made to drink into one Spirit", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a> that does not refer to the Corinthian company, but is really based on the truth of Ephesians which speaks of the whole assembly, and it is there that the Spirit of God operates house-wise for the reproduction of Christ.<a name=331:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So these gatherings which afford opportunities for saints to come together from various places, even from different continents, give evidence of the operations of the Spirit in the house.<a name=331:10></a> We have thus what corresponds to Troas (Acts 20), where the house of God comes into view as set up by Paul.<a name=331:11></a> There were certain brothers of note spoken of who accompanied him in his journey, the first mentioned is a Berean.<a name=331:12></a> He was a brother who would remind them of the importance of all Scripture; you must have the whole book, for "every scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable".<a name=331:13></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=331:14></a> A Berean is one who would have searched the Scriptures diligently.<a name=331:15></a>

		Then there were two brothers from Derbe; they would add their quota of spiritual experience and observation.<a name=332:1></a> There were two from Thessalonica, lovely brothers they, for the Spirit of God wrote of them, "brethren, beloved of God".<a name=332:2></a> I do not know of a more distinguishing title than that, "brethren, beloved of God", and doubtless they were that as dwelling together in unity according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:1">Psalm  133:1</a>, found in freshness and vigour as the result of the administration of the great apostle among them.<a name=332:3></a> That is what Thessalonica yielded, this assembly in God the Father, these brethren beloved of God.<a name=332:4></a> How delightfully they would contribute at this Conference!<a name=332:5></a> What interchange of thought there would be as they sat down with the other brethren thus gathered!<a name=332:6></a> Then, further, there were two from Asia, where the "word of the Lord had prevailed".<a name=332:7></a> There were none from Corinth specified, for the Spirit of God would name such as would contribute house-wisely and spiritually to the Ephesians.<a name=332:8></a> These two brothers from Asia would speak of that mighty work of God through the energy of the Spirit in the great apostle which brought down every feature of the world.<a name=332:9></a> If any young Christian present like Eutychus, had spoken of some novel he might have been reading, or of some other item of worldly interest, such men would have rebuked him; they would have told him of the books that had been burnt at Ephesus.<a name=332:10></a> Depend upon it that a fall like that of Eutychus had been preceded by a history of departure.<a name=332:11></a> There are books which eat into the soul like a canker.<a name=332:12></a> Young people are often undermined spiritually by what they read, but these brothers would tell of the mighty energy of the Spirit in the teaching of the apostle which had brought down all these things, undermining the world of books, so that they burnt them.<a name=332:13></a> Just as in the days of Joshua, the city of Kirjath-sepher, the city of books, had been destroyed.<a name=332:14></a>

		These gatherings represent the work of God elsewhere; because we are all of one Spirit we are one body.<a name=333:2></a> In the power of the one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit.<a name=333:3></a> It does not say "ye all", but "<i>we</i> all", he is referring to the house.<a name=333:4></a> So there is liberty now in the Spirit for His gracious administration -- spiritual manifestations are unhindered.<a name=333:5></a> Whether it be in the Western hemisphere, or the Eastern, whether here or there, "all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will".<a name=333:6></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:11">1 Corinthians  12:11</a>.<a name=333:7></a> We are united in common feelings, sympathetic interests, so that we walk about Zion, we count the towers thereof, we consider her bulwarks; we are interested in all that God is doing wherever it is -- it is all God's work.<a name=333:8></a> Now it is for us to look into our hearts and see if we are in accord with that, because aside from these features we shall not reach the special family privileges which the Spirit is bringing about at this time.<a name=333:9></a>

		Now to turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>.<a name=333:10></a> "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God".<a name=333:11></a> Think of the dignity of being led by the Spirit of God.<a name=333:12></a> There are four things we are told which are "stately in going", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:29">Proverbs  30:29</a> - 31, the lion, the horse, the he-goat, and a king.<a name=333:13></a> They represent what is spiritually stately and comely; they are entirely free from selfish personal pride, aims and objects.<a name=333:14></a> A lion does not turn aside for any, it says.<a name=333:15></a> The Spirit is here to maintain the testimony, to reprove the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment.<a name=333:16></a> Peter was bold as a lion when he stood up and accused the Jews of the murder of Christ.<a name=333:17></a> He is not afraid as he says "the originator of life ye slew", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:15">Acts  3:15</a>, for he was indwelt by the Spirit of God, and led by Him he is bold as a lion.<a name=333:18></a>

		At our afternoon reading we left off with the subject of prayer; and it is before me after much consideration to resume that subject this evening.<a name=380:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:18">Ephesians  6:18</a>, the saints are enjoined to pray "at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit" -- a fitting end to an epistle that unfolds the whole purpose of God; for the more light vouchsafed, the more sense there is, in those who value it, of the need for prayer, especially in the light of the statement that God "is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think".<a name=380:2></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:20">Ephesians  3:20</a>.<a name=380:3></a> This is a great incentive to prayer.<a name=380:4></a>

		Now in introducing so important and practical a subject, one would refer to the fact that the beginning of the great work of God in Europe was marked by prayer, as if the instinct were present that tremendous opposition stood in the way of its progress in that part of the world, hence the need is expressed in prayer.<a name=380:5></a> First, the man of Macedonia beseeches that extraordinary vessel of the light of God from heaven to come over.<a name=380:6></a> It was an urgent prayer to come over and help, then arriving at Philippi, Paul and those with him found a place of prayer, perhaps the first formal prayer meeting mentioned, not that collective prayer is not found earlier, but here we get a <i>place</i> for it.<a name=380:7></a> The apostle and his company are led to that spot, and in connection with it they find engaged in commerce, a woman of Thyatira, whose heart the Lord opened so that she attended to the things spoken by Paul.<a name=380:8></a> Light came into her soul, and having been baptised, she besought Paul to come into her house.<a name=380:9></a>

		I refer to this because prayer lay at the root of the great work of God that spread into Europe, and eventually into this country, and it is doubtless the thought of God that the end should be as the beginning.<a name=381:10></a> The testimony obviously remained in Europe, and at the outgoings of Europe.<a name=381:11></a> There, in the ways of God, it has stood and will stand; and it is with that thought before me that at the end there should be a people characterised by prayer.<a name=381:12></a>

		In Luke 11 the reference is to what is <i>local</i>, and again we have prayer.<a name=388:1></a> What I have said so far is general, but when you come to chapter 11, it is preceded (as already before us today) by the Lord's appointing seventy others also, and Bending them "two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come".<a name=388:2></a> So that now we are in the presence of truth that refers to a local company.<a name=388:3></a> If you are not exercised about your local company, you have no part in "the angel" of that locality.<a name=388:4></a> You will find that as you progress in the truth, you take up your local responsibility.<a name=388:5></a> One hopes that every person here has a sense of responsibility, for unless you take up the sense of obligation you are of little moral worth.<a name=388:6></a> The absence of moral obligation paves the way for the building up of clericalism and has led to the handing over of religious affairs to a committee of men.<a name=388:7></a> Here the Lord is praying, and <i>one</i> of His disciples said to Him: "Lord, teach us to pray".<a name=388:8></a> It is as if our local brethren need to be taught how to pray.<a name=388:9></a> As they pray, they will find abundance of local furnishings, which are really heavenly furnishings.<a name=388:10></a> The prayer has in view the bringing out of heaven into your locality what you know to be there.<a name=388:11></a>
