		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> We may be helped in enquiry into this epistle in the light of God's government and service at the present time, for there has been much pressure.<a name=1:3></a> The apostle has in mind that the persons addressed were in like circumstances, contrary circumstances to what they might have wished or expected.<a name=1:4></a> The government of God lies in that, that circumstances are different from what we may expect.<a name=1:5></a> This epistle teaches us that the circumstances according to the will of God are perfect, and to be accepted.<a name=1:6></a> In the acceptance of them God does His best for us, that is from His point of view, which we would all recognise to be the best.<a name=1:7></a> The persons addressed are regarded as of the dispersion.<a name=1:8></a> Some other will than their own had acted; they were dispersed.<a name=1:9></a> But whatever the will was that was immediately acting, the point is to bow to the will of God.<a name=1:10></a> God being behind the circumstances has something in view.<a name=1:11></a> His best, what His love designs for us.<a name=1:12></a> In Jeremiah's time some were similarly dispersed, and Jeremiah wrote to them to stay where they were, and to multiply, and not to be diminished (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#29:6">Jeremiah  29:6</a>, 7).<a name=1:13></a> It requires faith to stay in these circumstances, but as a result we see how God does His best for us.<a name=1:14></a> They are in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia.<a name=1:15></a> James speaks of the twelve tribes of the dispersion, but there the condition is more general.<a name=1:16></a> When conditions are more general they are easier to accept, even if they are adverse.<a name=1:17></a> But here it is more acute; but they are "elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ".<a name=1:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What has pressed itself upon me, dear brethren, is the thought of sonship, not so much in the sense in which we usually speak of it, as in the last verse read where we are alluded to as sons of God, but rather to dwell on sonship of certain institutions or principles or qualities of God, in which the word or idea is somewhat figurative, the idea of sonship.<a name=9:1></a> But nevertheless the idea is there, and it is to make the things alluded to practical, and in so far as may be, experimental.<a name=9:2></a> Hence you have in the gospels, among other references, sons of the kingdom, sons of peace, and here in John, sons of light.<a name=9:3></a> Doubtless most of us have taken notice of these expressions and profited by them, but I am sure that they will bear further attention or enquiry on our part, because we are all prone to be theoretic, and terms which are intended by the Spirit of God to be always pungent, both in our minds and in our words, are apt to become crystallised and meaningless.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So these references which I have made convey what is most practical.<a name=9:5></a> First, sons of the kingdom, in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, as you will remember, are spoken of by the Lord as sown.<a name=9:6></a> You will recall that in that chapter there are something like seven parables, the first referring to the sower of seed, but the seed is called the word of the kingdom, the <i>word</i> of it.<a name=9:7></a> That is what is presented in ministry; the idea or thought of the kingdom conveyed intelligently in spiritual power by ministry alludes to the testimony of the Lord as Son of Man, and that of His apostles -- the word.<a name=9:8></a> Then we have another parable, usually called the parable of the tares or darnel, in which the seed is persons, not simply words -- an important distinction.<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of the kingdom is sown and there are different growths, some permanent and many others of no value; but the parable of the tares implies that persons are sown.<a name=10:1></a> In other words, to be simple, an evangelist goes into a town and preaches the gospel and gets a convert.<a name=10:2></a> That is one operation of God, and that convert is sown in the place, otherwise there will be no representation of the kingdom.<a name=10:3></a> The word of the kingdom enters his heart and enlightens him, and he becomes a believer, as in Matthew, in the testimony of the heavens, the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=10:4></a> Now he is sown himself in the place, not as the word of the kingdom but as a son of it; that is the word used.<a name=10:5></a> The good seed are the sons of the kingdom.<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I refer to that initially, because that is so important if we are to have representatives of the truth, valuable representatives of the truth in localities.<a name=10:7></a> We must not only have the word presented, but the sons of the kingdom set up there; they are sown, so to say.<a name=10:8></a> Now that would mean that they take root in the soil, in the divinely-prepared soil, and they bear fruit.<a name=10:9></a> As sons of the kingdom they would be persons who have some knowledge of heaven; the light of heaven has shone into those that are delivered from the earth.<a name=10:10></a> They cease to be politicians; they cease to be material for this world; they are secured for God's world, but for the moment they are set in the place as sons of the kingdom.<a name=10:11></a> They are set down in the power of it, so that as they walk in the street, as they do their business, as they keep their house, and so forth, they set out the thing in the place.<a name=10:12></a> Another thing that comes out in him or her is that he or she is a son of the Highest, according to Luke.<a name=10:13></a> According to Matthew he or she is a son of his Father, not simply of his Father, but of his Father who is in the heavens.<a name=10:14></a> That is to say, there is a heavenly touch with him.<a name=10:15></a> Luke says, "the highest", which is great moral elevation.<a name=10:16></a> That man

		So that the first sign is that He manifested His glory.<a name=14:6></a> What is the effect?<a name=14:7></a> The effect is that the disciples, already believing, believed on Him.<a name=14:8></a> That is another thing John has in view, true believers in Christ.<a name=14:9></a> So in the verse I read, "While ye have the light, believe in the light".<a name=14:10></a> Believe in the light.<a name=14:11></a> Now the light, whatever it may be, whatever comes from God is to be believed, and let no one turn a blind eye.<a name=14:12></a> I was going to say a deaf ear, but it is a question of the light to the eye.<a name=14:13></a> It is a serious matter to turn a blind eye to divine light so that you do not see.<a name=14:14></a> A person says, 'I do not see it'; that is, you are blind or you are wilful.<a name=14:15></a> The first thing you get in this gospel in regard of the Spirit is that John saw Him, "I saw the Spirit", he says, "descending and .<a name=14:16></a>.<a name=14:17></a>.<a name=14:18></a> it abode".<a name=14:19></a> That is the point.<a name=14:20></a> Indeed, He that sent him to baptise told him, "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=14:21></a> Hence the importance, dear brethren, I do urge with feeling, to keep your eye open, your spiritual eye, and keep it single.<a name=14:22></a> Matthew says that the lamp of the body is the eye, and if thine eye be single, or simple, thy whole body is full of light, full.<a name=14:23></a> A very remarkable figure that!<a name=14:24></a> You know there is not one bit of darkness when the eye is single, but if thine eye be evil thy whole body is darkness, thy whole body.<a name=14:25></a> You may profess to be a believer on Christ and in fellowship, even pretending to be defending the truth and

		Well now, John, as I said, is stressing the idea of believing whatever is presented as light from God, while they have it; it may pass away.<a name=15:11></a> Immediately after the Lord said these things He hid Himself from them.<a name=15:12></a> How solemn that the Lord should hide Himself!<a name=15:13></a> He hid Himself, and then the Holy Spirit begins to speak about the announcement from Isaiah that they could not believe.<a name=15:14></a> A most terrible thing!<a name=15:15></a> If the light is refused, judicial darkness sets in.<a name=15:16></a> Isaiah says, "Who hath believed our report?<a name=15:17></a>".<a name=15:18></a> The evangelist goes on to it, "Lord, who hath believed our report?<a name=15:19></a>".<a name=15:20></a> What a word that is for our hearts!<a name=15:21></a> A report!<a name=15:22></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>the Person of Jesus is set before us in such a beautiful way, and the Spirit of God says, "Who hath believed our report?<a name=15:23></a>".<a name=15:24></a> Then it says that they could not believe because He had blinded their eyes.<a name=15:25></a> Isaiah said it again.<a name=15:26></a> The second word is a solemn word.<a name=15:27></a> So that we cannot trifle with God and the truth.<a name=15:28></a> Judicial blindness sets in.<a name=15:29></a> Isaiah says again that they could not believe, for He had blinded their eyes that they should not believe.<a name=15:30></a> That is a solemn thing.<a name=15:31></a> I am only speaking of what is stated and to emphasise what John says, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light".<a name=15:32></a> In the Authorised Version

		Well now, to make the thing simpler, I may illustrate from John's gospel sons of the light.<a name=16:8></a> The first one I would bring forward is the well known woman of Samaria.<a name=16:9></a> She is a son of the light in regard of her body.<a name=16:10></a> She left her water-pot as has been often remarked.<a name=16:11></a> She brought it to the well to fill it up and carry it back, but she did not do that.<a name=16:12></a> After Jesus had talked with her, her soul became illuminated.<a name=16:13></a> She had met the Son of God and she left her water-pot.<a name=16:14></a> He had been talking to her about living water and what it shall be in a person that believes; one who had drunk of it shall never thirst again, and it shall be in him a well of water.<a name=16:15></a> That was light to her soul in regard of her body, and she left her water-pot and went away to the city, and there were results.<a name=16:16></a> She spoke to the men and they were affected.<a name=16:17></a> She was a son of light in the place.<a name=16:18></a> Now that is a very simple thought.<a name=16:19></a> It is, as I may say, the initial idea of being a son of light, that one understands the importance of one's body.<a name=16:20></a> The epistle to the Romans points out to us how the gospel affects one so that his body is presented a living sacrifice to God, and that means purified inwardly to make room for the living water.<a name=16:21></a> That is the inward thing involving all

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=41:1></a> This book ends with the tabernacle as the residence of the divine glory and movement consequent; all is linked with obedience, things being done as divinely directed, great stress being laid on this in the closing chapters.<a name=41:2></a> So it seemed as if we would be helped to trace the thought of subjection, obedience to the word of God, to see how the glory links on with us as thus subject.<a name=41:3></a> We are said to be sanctified "unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ"; so the standard is high, and in order that we should reach it, it is necessary to begin at the beginning of the instructions which we may link with the verse in chapter 12.<a name=41:4></a> It is to be remarked, too, that Exodus is ministerial.<a name=41:5></a> Obedience, of course, is found in Genesis, but the ministerial side is not stressed there, but it is in Exodus, and the great minister himself, Moses, is subjected to much in the way of discipline to bring him to the attitude of subjection to the will of God.<a name=41:6></a> What appears at once in the exercise of his ministerial service is that the people were affected.<a name=41:7></a> First, in chapter 4: 28, it is said that: "Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent him, and all the signs that he had commanded him".<a name=41:8></a> They are affected by the ministry of Moses and Aaron, and then in chapter 12: 21 - 28, we have an epitome of the instructions Jehovah gave Moses as to the passover.<a name=41:9></a> Instead of giving them verbatim he epitomises -- the principle of ministry, abridgment and presenting things briefly -- and then we are told that they worshipped.<a name=41:10></a> "And the people bowed their heads and worshipped.<a name=41:11></a> And the children of Israel went away, and did as

		J.T.<a name=74:19></a> Well, it is not easy to say much as to it here.<a name=74:20></a> When we come to the New Testament, it is the glory in the face of Jesus.<a name=74:21></a> It is where it is most attractive.<a name=74:22></a> It is like a jewel set in a perfect setting; it is in the face of Jesus.<a name=74:23></a> "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit".<a name=74:24></a> In chapter 4 it is the glory of God in the face of Jesus, shining in our hearts (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>).<a name=74:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=75:5></a> I think that is right.<a name=75:6></a> The whole chapter is shrouded with glory, before the minister begins to speak.<a name=75:7></a> They saw his face as the face of an angel; that is, heavenly glory; and then he begins to speak of glory, "the God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham"; and he pursues the line right down and "looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God and Jesus", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>.<a name=75:8></a> He does not say exactly what he sees but puts it into his own language, "I behold the heavens opened, and the son of man standing at the right hand of God"; but he saw more than he spoke of.<a name=75:9></a> That is the true ministerial instinct.<a name=75:10></a> He says what is needed, but it is full of the idea of glory.<a name=75:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=75:17></a> I think that this book of Exodus is the book of glory, in the sense of sacrificial glory; because sacrificial glory is what is in mind, God coming out in Christ in Exodus, and on the mount of transfiguration which we have in Luke.<a name=75:18></a> That is what they had in mind when they spoke of the Lord's decease or exodus that He should accomplish at Jerusalem; it was sacrificial glory.<a name=75:19></a> He was to go out of the body and Stephen is a reflection of that; it enters into the ministry of Paul.<a name=75:20></a> The ministry of Paul is peculiarly a ministry of glory.<a name=75:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=131:9></a>M.<a name=131:10></a> I was thinking in that connection, the great desire amongst the saints to know this inner thing, this wonderful matter about the Spirit of sonship.<a name=131:11></a> The very fact that the Lord is calling attention to these outward things to rid us of human ideas, should in itself be an encouragement that our spirits should not faint in any way about it, do you not think?<a name=131:12></a>

		I have in mind to speak of hindrances -- hindrances by God, hindrances by Satan, hindrances by the brethren, and hindrances, as each of us may say, by oneself.<a name=150:1></a> Hindrances by God are negative, that is as might be expected; they are in view of dealing with what would interfere with His operations.<a name=150:2></a> Satan is bent on hindering God's work, and God operates to hinder him, to prevent satanic obstacles being effective against God's work.<a name=150:3></a> The word 'withholdeth' and the word 'let' in the verses read in 2 Thessalonians should be rendered 'restrains'.<a name=150:4></a> God could easily destroy anyone who interferes with His work at any time, but the word is not destruction, but restraint.<a name=150:5></a> God allows evil, whilst restraining it.<a name=150:6></a> This is often used by sceptical minds to malign God.<a name=150:7></a> Why allow these things?<a name=150:8></a> Why does God not interfere?<a name=150:9></a> Why does He not only restrain, but destroy?<a name=150:10></a> Scepticism plays a part on these lines, and we are to be on our guard for, though believers, we may be sceptical, and on account of this we should seek to know God better.<a name=150:11></a> If there is any tendency to scepticism, the antidote is to know God.<a name=150:12></a> He says, "Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me".<a name=150:13></a> As we know Him we shall understand that what He permits, He permits wisely.<a name=150:14></a> He has permitted the very existence of sin in His universe.<a name=150:15></a> Scepticism says, Why?<a name=150:16></a> and maligns Him, questioning even the existence of God; but faith believes that God is, "He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him".<a name=150:17></a> He rewards His people, and the greatest reward is the increased knowledge of Himself.<a name=150:18></a> As the knowledge of Himself increases, so scepticism is displaced, for

	<div class="paragraph">
		The superiority of christianity is before us in these scriptures, viewed in contrast to general conditions and worked out in relative values.<a name=160:1></a> Scripture abounds with comparisons, and all is to bring out the greatness of christianity.<a name=160:2></a> With this in view we may consider the Lord's remarks about John the baptist, who, though not equal to those who form the assembly, serves to illustrate what is in mind.<a name=160:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At this time John was rather under a cloud, but the Lord would not allow this to discredit him, and took occasion of it to bring out his worth.<a name=160:4></a> So he says, as John's disciples left, "What went ye out into the wilderness to see?<a name=160:5></a> .<a name=160:6></a>.<a name=160:7></a>.<a name=160:8></a> Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he".<a name=160:9></a> John's greatness only serves to enlarge the greatness of christianity, and the Lord calls attention to it.<a name=160:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The end of the chapter shows how the superiority of christianity shines out in the Lord Jesus, though He is incomparable in His own Person.<a name=160:11></a> In the greatest pressure He is able to answer and say, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes", and so He becomes a refuge for all of us who are under pressure as we learn the truth set forth in Him.<a name=160:12></a>

		"full of grace and truth".<a name=167:1></a> This chapter is to deliver us from legalists and to introduce us to <i>greater</i> things.<a name=167:2></a> Romans brings out that we are "vessels of mercy .<a name=167:3></a>.<a name=167:4></a>.<a name=167:5></a> prepared for glory", so that mercy introduces us into the best and greatest thoughts of God.<a name=167:6></a> The instructions here are especially meant to deliver us from legal systems, and in this connection Christ is spoken of as God's Servant: "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight.<a name=167:7></a> I will put my Spirit upon him .<a name=167:8></a>.<a name=167:9></a>.<a name=167:10></a>".<a name=167:11></a> He is effectuating all this for the pleasure of God and the first thing is that He is Lord of the sabbath and, having brought it in, He can dispose of it.<a name=167:12></a>

		As Lord of the sabbath Christ has authority over all that is legal.<a name=167:13></a> People may assume that they can go on in their legal ways, but the Lord is supreme in that: "Are we stronger than he?<a name=167:14></a>".<a name=167:15></a> We have withdrawn from what is iniquitous, following the injunction: "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".<a name=167:16></a> The Lord has still to say to these legal systems around, though we have to leave them.<a name=167:17></a> We judge them morally, but they are to be judged actually and the Lord has authority to deal with it all.<a name=167:18></a> The religious systems of christendom have largely taken on judaism and the Lord will deal with it finally, but here He is going on in grace.<a name=167:19></a>

		In keeping with the thought of relative values, in verse 12 a man is compared with a sheep.<a name=167:20></a> Human life is of very little account nowadays, but the Lord is here calling attention to the value of a man, not a Jew, but a <i>man</i>.<a name=167:21></a> Presently the Jew will come into his place and we read that ten men will take hold of a Jew, but now it is a question of men.<a name=167:22></a> "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>.<a name=167:23></a> The salvation and blessing of men are in view.<a name=167:24></a>

		The sin against the Holy Spirit is a dispensational matter, and there is no forgiveness for it.<a name=169:5></a> The greatness of the new dispensation is seen in the place the Holy Spirit has in it, hence there is no hope for one who speaks against Him, as we see here and in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:29">Hebrews  10:29</a>: "Who hath trodden under foot the Son of God .<a name=169:6></a>.<a name=169:7></a>.<a name=169:8></a> and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace".<a name=169:9></a> One often wonders about things that are happening in christendom today; virtually the Son of God is trodden under foot and there is the sin against the Holy Spirit.<a name=169:10></a> It is said of Babylon in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11">Revelation  11</a>"Where also our Lord was crucified"; in principle He is crucified afresh.<a name=169:11></a>

		The old economy is not only judged, but it is shown to be inferior, even at its very best, to what we have in christianity.<a name=169:12></a> So here the Lord alludes to what is "greater than Jonas", and "greater than Solomon" (verses 41, 42).<a name=169:13></a> It alludes to the personnel of the assembly: if a man, as such, is greater than a sheep, how much greater he is as coming to Christ!<a name=169:14></a> Here man as in Christ is in view according to the new order of things, for all other men are valueless.<a name=169:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4">Exodus  4</a>Moses cast his rod on the ground and it became a serpent, showing how man came under the power of Satan.<a name=169:16></a> But Jehovah said: "Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail.<a name=169:17></a> And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand", indicating that man should become usable

		There has been a danger of trying to take up the truth of the assembly as in chapters 16 and 18 without the underlying moral state, involving the question of good and evil.<a name=170:3></a> Adam was told not to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but he did, and raised the whole moral question.<a name=170:4></a> God would not reinstate him as he was before, but only on moral lines.<a name=170:5></a> Adam understood this in some measure; hence he called his wife Eve.<a name=170:6></a> He had named her Ishshah before, indicating that she was taken out of him as God made him; now she is Eve, "the mother of all living", for the seed of the woman was to bruise Satan's head.<a name=170:7></a> She could only be that on the ground of sacrifice.<a name=170:8></a>

		That which is "greater than the temple", "greater than Jonas", and "greater than Solomon" is what is secured in Christ morally.<a name=170:9></a> The Jews wanted a sign, though Christ Himself was a sign before their eyes, raising the dead, healing the sick and so on.<a name=170:10></a> So the only sign for them now is the sign of Jonas; the Lord Jesus was to die, involving that man, with all attaching to him, is condemned.<a name=170:11></a> The Spirit of God has been opening up that sign ever since -- the meaning of the death of Christ.<a name=170:12></a> The whole race of man after the flesh has gone down, and a new generation come to light on moral lines: "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother" (verse 50).<a name=170:13></a>

		We have examples of prophetic ministry in the Old Testament where it appears in relation to what is immediately current to correct some evil, as in the case of Rehoboam.<a name=198:1></a> The king of Egypt came up with a mighty army to attack him, and the prophet appeared to point out the cause of the attack; it was corrective.<a name=198:2></a> The king and his princes humbled themselves, and there was a certain relief granted, a measure of it.<a name=198:3></a> And then in the case of Asa, there was an attack with a great number, a million men from Ethiopia, and no prophet appeared to point out an evil; it was an attack to bring out what was of God.<a name=198:4></a> God may allow the enemy to attack us to correct an evil, and to point out the evil so that we might judge it.<a name=198:5></a> Then again, He may allow the enemy to attack us, as evident today in certain parts, to bring out what is of Himself, for He loves to bring it out to show how it stands.<a name=198:6></a> It is fragrant to Him, the work of God in His people standing up against an attack, maintaining what is of God in the presence of it.<a name=198:7></a> In the case of Asa, there was no prophetic word before the attack, but there was after, after a great victory granted over the attack of a million men.<a name=198:8></a> Asa knew what to say to God.<a name=198:9></a> He spoke to God of Himself, and God helped and gave a wonderful victory.<a name=198:10></a> And then the prophet appeared to him in view of another attack, to prepare, to buttress the position against it.<a name=198:11></a> So it is clear that prophetic ministry may have these two features.<a name=198:12></a>

		I wish to speak of Christ as presented in the threefold way indicated.<a name=238:1></a> He is, of course, presented in many other connections in the Scriptures besides these.<a name=238:2></a> He is indeed the theme of all Scripture; and, no doubt, the best exposition of that was by Himself when He walked along the highway to Emmaus with two erring disciples.<a name=238:3></a> He began, we are told, "from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:27">Luke  24:27</a>.<a name=238:4></a> The exposition thus made is not recorded, but the Spirit of God ever since has been engaged in unfolding Christ in the Scriptures to His people; and it is to the end that He should become attractive to, and loved by, His people.<a name=238:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A touching instance of His presentation of Himself to us is in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, where, we are told, "He presented himself living, after he had suffered".<a name=238:6></a> The presentation would stress the idea of life as in a risen Man.<a name=238:7></a> Life has a great place in the Scriptures first as vegetable, then in fishes, birds, land animals, and also in man, but it is finally presented in Christ, who is risen from among the dead.<a name=238:8></a> Never was life seen before like that.<a name=238:9></a> Others had indeed been raised from the dead, but not into a new condition.<a name=238:10></a> He was risen into a new condition of life, a condition which is to prevail and continue, and into which we are as christians brought now by faith, as we shall be soon in actuality.<a name=238:11></a> For we are not only to be conformed to the image of Christ, but to the image of His body of glory -- not only a risen Christ, but a glorified Christ, the greatest thought of all.<a name=238:12></a>

		still he says, "Behold the man!<a name=239:1></a>" to the Jews.<a name=239:2></a> This affords an opportunity of speaking of Pilate as representing government.<a name=239:3></a> Matthew stresses that and calls him "governor".<a name=239:4></a> John mentions certain things about Pilate which are not in the other gospels.<a name=239:5></a> John tells us, too, that Pilate was minded to release Jesus.<a name=239:6></a> He represents government as seen in the four monarchies of Daniel.<a name=239:7></a> These four monarchies do not include all government, for it was first committed to Noah.<a name=239:8></a> Magisterial responsibility was put on him, and that enlarged with Nimrod into a kingdom; the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, the great Assyrian monarchy.<a name=239:9></a> Other monarchies, such as the Egyptian, existed before the appointment by God of what are called the four governments, kingdoms, extending from the time of Nebuchadnezzar down to the end of this dispensation, down to the introduction of the rule of Christ.<a name=239:10></a> These monarchies are seen in the book of Daniel as existing one after the other until a stone should be cut out without hands and should break them in pieces, fill the whole earth, and remain for ever; that is the rule of Christ, for which we are waiting.<a name=239:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not that "the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ", as the A.<a name=239:12></a>V.<a name=239:13></a> reads in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11:15">Revelation  11:15</a>, but rather that "the kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come"; it is a kingdom of itself.<a name=239:14></a> It is a kingdom, unique, cut out without hands, that is, a <i>divine</i> kingdom, and it breaks in pieces the others, and then fills the whole earth itself and continues for ever.<a name=239:15></a> We love the thought of that: "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come".<a name=239:16></a> That kingdom takes form; the whole creation awaits it and longs for it.<a name=239:17></a>

		Now I want to show how the Lord Himself came directly into relation with the fourth monarchy, the Roman, and how this idea that is set out in Pilate has come down to us, that the monarch presents Christ to his people.<a name=241:7></a> He presented Christ: "Behold the man!<a name=241:8></a> .<a name=241:9></a>.<a name=241:10></a>.<a name=241:11></a> I find no fault in him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#19:6">John  19:6</a>.<a name=241:12></a> He was not against Christ; as a matter of fact Pilate was right abstractly.<a name=241:13></a> As a governor he had a right judgment of Christ, but he was just a governor and a politician.<a name=241:14></a> A mere politician has to give way to the popular wish, as we see in Herod, who wished to please the Jews and put John the baptist in prison.<a name=241:15></a> But then they may present Christ to us, too, for the governor of the world became a christian in Constantine.<a name=241:16></a> But what kind of a garment would he put on the Lord Jesus?<a name=241:17></a> Constantine presided at some of the christian councils, and became an honoured christian.<a name=241:18></a> You say, That is wonderful, the king is converted!<a name=241:19></a> But is he converted?<a name=241:20></a> It is an open question whether Constantine was converted, but then, if he presents Christ to us, what will be the Christ he presents?<a name=241:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=265:6></a> It would mean there was light in Seth's naming his son as he did.<a name=265:7></a> We are told of Cain in the same chapter: "And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch.<a name=265:8></a> And he built a city; and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch" (verse 17).<a name=265:9></a> There is no idea in his mind that his son was going to die, but in Seth's mind there was that idea.<a name=265:10></a> He was not going to build on his son after the flesh.<a name=265:11></a> Something else must happen or he would go into oblivion, and therefore, there is light; because what preceded all that was that there had been the sacrifice and sin-offering, which, indeed, had already been alluded to by Jehovah to Cain; and Seth had that idea, that there was a remedy.<a name=265:12></a> He could well afford to say, My son is going to die, because life is now brought in.<a name=265:13></a> My mother's name is 'Life'.<a name=265:14></a> That was the deduction that developed in his mind and made him, what I would call, a believer, although Seth is not included in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>, but still you can see the mention here would indicate that, because the whole family is taken up in the next chapter, and we have the word 'book': "This is the book of Adam's generations.<a name=265:15></a> In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him.<a name=265:16></a> Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created" (verses 1, 2).<a name=265:17></a> That is, they are all set up again; no more Cain; he is out of it.<a name=265:18></a> God is going on with His own family, and that is chapter 5, into which Enoch comes and indicates the full thought of what is before us now; the full thought of life -- that he goes up to heaven.<a name=265:19></a> God took him because He liked him.<a name=265:20></a>

		Cornelius did not think of a big meeting, nor did the visitation he received by the angel suggest to him anything of the kind.<a name=328:4></a> Clearly it was a question of quality, and the angel came on account of that; for the angel says to Cornelius, "Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:4">Acts  10:4</a>.<a name=328:5></a> Think of that from a man who you can hardly say had heard the gospel yet.<a name=328:6></a> "Have gone up", the angel says, "Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up".<a name=328:7></a> The angel would speak from the standpoint of heaven.<a name=328:8></a> How conversant angels are with matters of this kind!<a name=328:9></a> For they are all cognisant of repentance; there is much joy in their presence on account of that.<a name=328:10></a> The transactions in heaven indeed become wonderfully interesting in that way, everyday matters.<a name=328:11></a> Heaven, I suppose, is more active than any place on earth.<a name=328:12></a> We cannot say how many angels there are, but there are a great many, and they speak feelingly, too, "Thy prayers and thine alms", the angel says.<a name=328:13></a> Let us not forget the alms!<a name=328:14></a> Apparently, they should go together, prayers and alms.<a name=328:15></a> They "have gone up for a memorial before God".<a name=328:16></a> So that we have remarkable history alluded to in view of the context of the chapter, what underlies these meetings really, or ought to underlie these meetings, history

		Well, I mention all this, but wish to dwell on verse 33 that I read; what is heaven thinking about now?<a name=329:3></a> The heavenly messenger moved out to this man, so that, dear brethren, we are reminded in this chapter which treats of the gospel going out among the nations and being received among the nations, what it really was, what an assembly was, man having secret history with God, and certain fragrance, as I may say, before God as a memorial, and God saying, This must be kept before Me; it is treasured up here.<a name=329:4></a> The angel knew that.<a name=329:5></a> No doubt he was charged with his message, but he knew apparently about this great matter that was taking place above, for he appears to speak from that standpoint -- "have gone up".<a name=329:6></a> The prayers and alms are properly balanced, for if I pray for people, the next thing is, Can I help them myself?<a name=329:7></a> God can help them, of course, but can I do anything to help them?<a name=329:8></a> Of course, I cannot do much better than pray for a person, but then the alms are not prayers; they are substantial things that I have got, that Cornelius had; I mean the means of alms, for soldiers usually do not have large pay, but clearly he had the means of alms-giving and used them, for a man is accepted according to what he has, not according to what he has not, it may measure a small amount or a large amount; so that both the prayers and alms went up and were regarded there as a memorial.<a name=329:9></a> Think of all the history of the testimony from the beginning, everything carried down in that history, and know it is something that must be, not simply going up to a place in heaven, but that it must have a place in heaven, a memorial before God which must stand.<a name=329:10></a> I hardly know of anything so suggestive of spiritual history,

		and how one becomes known in heaven and so known and so valued that a memorial is there; hence the results show that this remarkable product of the work of God so far should be properly instructed and have the right teaching, the teaching he needed; and so for this, the teacher must be prepared.<a name=330:1></a> Great indeed as Peter was as a teacher, he had to be specially prepared for this matter.<a name=330:2></a> This was important in heaven that the assembly is to reflect the mind of heaven, and this teacher must be there, and he must be there as having come under peculiar divine instruction.<a name=330:3></a> He is already in a trance, a highly spiritual man, and then we are told what he saw, and how the Spirit of God takes him in hand.<a name=330:4></a> It says in verse 17, "And as Peter doubted in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold also the men who were sent by Cornelius, having sought out the house of Simon, stood at the gate, and having called someone, they inquired if Simon who was surnamed Peter was lodged there.<a name=330:5></a> But as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him .<a name=330:6></a>.<a name=330:7></a>.<a name=330:8></a>", that is, the Holy Spirit comes into this matter, so as to be sure there is to be no miscarriage at all of heaven's mind.<a name=330:9></a> The angel is engaged in it, the vision is engaged in it, and now the Spirit of God Himself is engaged in it, "The Spirit said to him, behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because <i>I</i> have sent them".<a name=330:10></a> That is an assuring position; there must be no interference with it.<a name=330:11></a> You can discern, dear brethren, that there is no other hand here, and so it should be with every meeting like this.<a name=330:12></a> For Satan is all ready to come.<a name=330:13></a> He came when the sons of God came up to present themselves.<a name=330:14></a> It is a question of state, and if there is a wrong state, he comes.<a name=330:15></a> Apparently there was none here, and so we are told that Cornelius waited for them, "And on the morrow they came to Caesarea.<a name=330:16></a> But Cornelius was looking

		Now, dear brethren, this is what one had in mind -- they were come together.<a name=331:11></a> We are told who they were.<a name=331:12></a> It is no question of age there; it was a question of persons known as "his kinsmen and his intimate friends".<a name=331:13></a> The matter is very important.<a name=331:14></a> We must all get the benefit of this.<a name=331:15></a> That would be in his mind, a full result -- and what a result, what a widespread result coming down to ourselves, this very night in this very city, this comes out.<a name=331:16></a> So without saying much more, Cornelius refers to what happened, "Four days ago I had been fasting unto this hour, and the ninth I was praying in my house".<a name=331:17></a> He did not know it, but undoubtedly that was the hour in which the Lord died on the cross; at least, when He said, "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=331:18></a>".<a name=331:19></a> Peter and John had gone up to the temple at that hour, the hour of prayer, and Cornelius was not behind in that.<a name=331:20></a> What material, dear brethren, we have in the persons in this chapter, and of course the point is a challenge to our hearts as to material and where we are as to these matters we are brought into and whether we are in the current of what we are brought into.<a name=331:21></a> So he says, "And lo, a man stood

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the question is, dear brethren, are we here for this purpose, thirsting for the word of God?<a name=332:7></a> Scripture speaks of thirsting for the word of God, and now the gentiles are coming into that.<a name=332:8></a> "Now therefore <i>we</i> are all present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God".<a name=332:9></a> It is not what you have learned, but the things that are specially commanded, because it is a special matter.<a name=332:10></a> It is not simply what they were saying at Jerusalem.<a name=332:11></a> It is a special matter, what is commanded for <i>this</i> time.<a name=332:12></a> You want to hear it all.<a name=332:13></a> So, dear brethren, that is what is in one's mind as to how we are here and why we come to this meeting, what is the underlying thought?<a name=332:14></a> If it is to break bread, we do that; if it is a care meeting, the apostles and elders come; but this time, it is a company in these remarkable circumstances and the leader here, for God uses leaders.<a name=332:15></a> That is a great principle with Him, and Cornelius was the man here, "Now therefore <i>we</i> are all present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God".<a name=332:16></a> Not before Peter.<a name=332:17></a> Only a little while before he fell down before Peter.<a name=332:18></a> He would not do that again.<a name=332:19></a> It is before God now, as the angel in Revelation says, Worship God.<a name=332:20></a> "We are all here before God", he says.<a name=332:21></a> He can speak for others, for his kinsmen and friends.<a name=332:22></a> Did he know them all personally?<a name=332:23></a> Apparently.<a name=332:24></a> We are all here, and here for one purpose.<a name=332:25></a> It is not a social matter this but to hear what is commanded.<a name=332:26></a> We are ready for that, "to hear all

		I am not going to follow the history, because all the preachers here have used these scriptures, but Job reached the point of recovery, the point of deliverance from captivity; because it is not only deliverance from one's own self, but captivity.<a name=336:25></a> That is a great leading feature of recovery with God; He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men.<a name=336:26></a> Deliverance from captivity would mean you come into the benefit of gift.<a name=336:27></a> In captivity it is the lash, but deliverance from captivity is that you come into the realm of gift, gifts to men, and that was what Job reached.<a name=336:28></a>

		Well, I go on now to Peter, to show how this matter of girding comes into individual history, because the Lord has that in mind in dealing with Peter, that he is to be a historical man.<a name=339:1></a> In the world there are men who fill history, fill the history books.<a name=339:2></a> In some cases we get their lives.<a name=339:3></a> Usually there is an attempt by the biographer to give a life-size history.<a name=339:4></a> Peter is intended to be a man of that kind that the Spirit of God can use to depict a life-history; and that life-history brings us back to the time of our birth and what immediately follows.<a name=339:5></a> The most interesting babe that we get in Scripture (I am not speaking of the Lord Jesus) is Solomon.<a name=339:6></a> He was said to be loved by Jehovah just when he was born.<a name=339:7></a> The young people here, I am sure, would like to have a reputation, a distinction like that, and to keep it up.<a name=339:8></a> There is no discrepancy in Solomon until he comes to the throne.<a name=339:9></a> Jehovah loved him.<a name=339:10></a> Well, you would say, I want to get the whole history of that man, a man that was loved so early.<a name=339:11></a> Well, the Lord, of course, gives us the history of that man; but when he was old he did not do so well as Peter, so I prefer to keep to Peter, I prefer to keep to a man that gets better and better, and does not drop out before he becomes old.<a name=339:12></a> And Peter serves in this matter of girding.<a name=339:13></a> The Lord says, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:18">John  21:18</a>.<a name=339:14></a> This is history, you know.<a name=339:15></a> How we see young people whose hearts are not fixed.<a name=339:16></a> I wonder if there are any young people here whose hearts are not fixed.<a name=339:17></a> Where shall I go tonight?<a name=339:18></a> Every evening brings up its problem, and my mind is not fixed, I have nothing certain before me.<a name=339:19></a> You may, as a last resort, say, I will go to the meeting tonight.<a name=339:20></a> Your heart is not fixed but you have to gird yourself according to the decision you have come to.<a name=339:21></a> Where shall I go?<a name=339:22></a> What shall I put on tonight?<a name=339:23></a> You have to attire in relation to your decision.<a name=339:24></a> But heaven is looking on.<a name=339:25></a>

		And so it is here that Jeremiah is taken up.<a name=345:8></a> If you look through the chapter you will be impressed by what I am saying, but in verse 17 Jehovah says to him, "Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I shall command thee".<a name=345:9></a> That is it; "All that I shall command thee".<a name=345:10></a> In our ministry meetings, and this meeting that I am seeking to serve in now, or whatever it be, it is a question of divine commandment.<a name=345:11></a> Christianity is divine commandment.<a name=345:12></a> Read John's writings especially in regard of this matter.<a name=345:13></a> It is a wonderful thing that the Lord says that even eternal life is a divine commandment.<a name=345:14></a> It is not only a promise, it is a commandment.<a name=345:15></a> It is a great thing that it is a promise, but it is a greater thing that it is a commandment, because it must go through.<a name=345:16></a> The whole power of God is behind it.<a name=345:17></a>

		Well now, Jeremiah was in this position.<a name=345:18></a> God says to him, "Be not dismayed at them, lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them".<a name=345:19></a> The servant is simply confounded before the audience unless he carries out the commandment.<a name=345:20></a> There is nothing that will do but the commandment.<a name=345:21></a> It is as if it were God Himself.<a name=345:22></a> His commandment is Himself in that sense.<a name=345:23></a> So that Jehovah says, Now you are a young man;

		So the apostle chooses his word clearly to indicate that he is dealing with the mental faculty of the believers.<a name=397:7></a> As I said, there are other things, such as conscience, such as heart, such as reins, and all the automatic organs, that are used to convey spiritual features to the believer.<a name=397:8></a> All of them have to be understood too.<a name=397:9></a> We are to learn to understand our make-up as to how the organs are affected spiritually and what the function of each is.<a name=397:10></a> So the apostle Peter is concerned for the moment about mental milk, pure mental milk of the word.<a name=397:11></a> That is, it is not strong meat yet that he is dealing with but milk, and it is mental milk "that by it ye may grow up to salvation".<a name=397:12></a> If we fail in the mental side we shall be imperfect, of very little use in the organism, the body of Christ, in the way of certain affections.<a name=397:13></a> We shall be of very little use in that great working system, the greatest thing that God has reserved from before the foundation of the world, to be used and developed down here.<a name=397:14></a> The Lord would have us to be concerned, so as to have our minds in order, so as to join in in this matter, this great organism, called 'the mystery'; that we should be capable of having part in it in its functioning capacity.<a name=397:15></a> It is called 'the Christ', one of the most remarkable things of the scriptures, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>, "So also is the Christ", referring to the body composed of us, or millions or more millions and

		I have in mind to speak about the results which accrue from exercises arising in the course of God's testimony here.<a name=410:1></a> The apostle James in his epistle alludes to the end reached in such exercises.<a name=410:2></a> He says, "Ye have heard of the endurance of Job, and seen the end of the Lord".<a name=410:3></a> The teaching in his epistle is very practical; among other things he alludes to knowledge amongst the brethren.<a name=410:4></a> He wrote, as we know, to the twelve tribes that were scattered and in doing so he referred to the patience of Job.<a name=410:5></a> The book of Job has its own peculiar importance in scripture as dealing with the work and testimony of God outside Israel but collateral with the testimony to Israel.<a name=410:6></a> It thus finds a place in the holy writings, and James alludes to it as being known.<a name=410:7></a> He says, "And seen the end of the Lord".<a name=410:8></a> The "end" in that book illustrates what I have before me, namely, the end which the Lord has in view in dealing with His people.<a name=410:9></a> That end is to be triumphant and blessed!<a name=410:10></a>

		So I began with Jude, a short epistle which is lighted up by this verse which refers to an antediluvian saint.<a name=411:5></a> This is not a casual, but a careful reference, embracing a particular exercise, and a result reached through it.<a name=411:6></a> What a history is involved in reaching the seventh from Adam, a remarkable line leading up to such a result!<a name=411:7></a> Chapter 4 gives us the line of Cain, but the most casual reader will notice the correspondence in it with the names in the line of faith, through Seth.<a name=411:8></a> Chapter 5 is called by the Spirit "The book of Adam's generations".<a name=411:9></a> Chapter 5 is the life line, and so the names given, save Methushelah's, are significant.<a name=411:10></a> His longevity is instructive for it points to God's longsuffering.<a name=411:11></a> We are through grace in the period of God's great longsuffering and patience.<a name=411:12></a> But the names of each of the others have a significance, Enoch's pre-eminently so.<a name=411:13></a> His name signifies tuition, education, learning, discipline or discipleship and I believe, has greater moral significance than the others, for it relates to the heavenly calling, and no saints are more distinguished than those who have part in that calling.<a name=411:14></a> Thus we obtain character and distinction through discipline, as it says, "My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:5">Hebrews  12:5</a>, 6.<a name=411:15></a>

		FOLLOWING THE LORD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It should have a great effect upon us to see others following the Lord.<a name=432:1></a> The gospel of John begins with the two disciples of John the baptist who followed Jesus, and ends with a devoted follower who could be trusted to continue in the path until the Lord comes.<a name=432:2></a> John the baptist was the one who set things in motion; he is not said to have followed Jesus himself, but he inspired others to follow, for "looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God"; and the two disciples left John and followed Jesus.<a name=432:3></a> They were impressed by John's testimony, which was so different from what could be said of every other man.<a name=432:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John the baptist may be likened to the setting sun, for he recognised that he had been eclipsed by Jesus when he said, "He must increase, but I must decrease"; he also said, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices in heart".<a name=432:5></a> He left the Sun high in the heavens, gladly going out of sight himself, that Christ might be magnified.<a name=432:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other gospels also refer to the thought of following, but there it is in connection with things that are left behind.<a name=432:7></a> Peter said, for instance, "<i>We</i> have left all things and have followed thee".<a name=432:8></a> The Lord did not say, What have you left?<a name=432:9></a> He will give you credit for what you have left; He can afford to do that.<a name=432:10></a> But in the gospel of John, nothing is said about anything that has been left; the Lord is presented in this gospel in such a way that nothing could possibly be of any account at all compared with Himself.<a name=432:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On another occasion we read of a man who said, without counting the cost, "Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest".<a name=433:8></a> How rash he was!<a name=433:9></a> The Lord tested him by setting before him what the path involved, and he did not pursue the matter; yet we find in the next chapter, in spite of the difficulties of the path, that Jesus had disciples who were prepared to follow Him.<a name=433:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Paul, once the Lord had secured him, became the greatest, most devoted follower of Jesus.<a name=433:11></a> There are only two people in the New Testament who speak of the Lord as "my Lord" -- Mary Magdalene is one, and Paul the other.<a name=433:12></a> Paul would be the strongest in upholding Him as "Lord of all"; but his acquaintance with Him personally had gone on until he was able to speak of Him in this intimate way, "my Lord".<a name=433:13></a>

		At the end of John's gospel, it is recorded that Peter, after turning round and seeing John following, enquired, "What shall this man do?<a name=433:14></a>".<a name=433:15></a> The Lord said, in effect, There is no need for you to be anxious about a follower: see to it that <i>you</i> follow; a follower can take care of himself!<a name=433:16></a> It is a very poor thing if we continually need to be looked after, though caring for one another is a very blessed thing, where would
