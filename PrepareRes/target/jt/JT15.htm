		This is pre-eminently the wilderness book.<a name=1:1></a> Indeed, its primary title was, In the Wilderness; and so in the opening of it we have Jehovah speaking to Moses "in the wilderness of Sinai".<a name=1:2></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1:1">Numbers  1:1</a>.<a name=1:3></a> Our position in it is thus assumed; and God reminds us at the very outset that He is thinking of us as there.<a name=1:4></a> He thinks of us in every position where we may be legitimately, as required by His will in this world.<a name=1:5></a> So in this book ( <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#33">Numbers  33</a>) we have the journeyings of the people and their encampments recorded, as if God would impress upon us that He follows all our movements with intense interest.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the wilderness, though a familiar word amongst us, is perhaps not so well understood as we may imagine, nor is it definitely accepted, as divinely presented to us.<a name=1:7></a> The idea of it appears in Exodus, God sending His message to Pharaoh to let His people go that they might serve Him in the wilderness.<a name=1:8></a> It may seem a matter of small moment that the words "in the wilderness" are added <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#5:1">Exodus  5:1</a>.<a name=1:9></a> It might seem to be enough to say to Pharaoh that God wished His people to serve Him, which indeed was the purport of His first great message, "Let my son go, that he may serve me" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:23">Exodus  4:23</a>; but afterwards stress is laid on the <i>place</i> of service, God was to be served in the wilderness.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Christendom today the nominal service of God is not carried on in the recognition of the world being a wilderness; it is carried on where there are abundant worldly resources.<a name=1:11></a> The world is taxed to provide the ways and means, whether it be the buildings, the salaries of the servants, the choirs, the furniture or what not, whereas God notified Pharaoh at the outset that the world cannot provide the means of

		divine service.<a name=2:1></a> He intimates plainly that it was to be carried on where there were no <i>visible</i> resources.<a name=2:2></a> In other words, that the world and its resources are wholly ignored, and all the provisions come from above.<a name=2:3></a> Hence you find that before the means and order of service are proposed, Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel are invited to go up to Jehovah; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>.<a name=2:4></a> The principle is that things have to come from thence.<a name=2:5></a> "And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.<a name=2:6></a> And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24:10">Exodus  24:10</a>, 11.<a name=2:7></a>

		They are there in God's realm, we may say, as "nobles" and they are there without fear.<a name=2:8></a> So that when in the next chapter He proposed to them to build Him a tabernacle, what is required is understood; at least, a general impression has been conveyed, though the details awaited instructions received by Moses during the forty days on the mount.<a name=2:9></a> Moses is detained, called up higher (verse 12), and there a pattern is unfolded to him, "a figurative representation of things in the heavens" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:23">Hebrews  9:23</a>.<a name=2:10></a> God is in no way dependent on this world for the means of His service.<a name=2:11></a> We are shut up to God and to heaven, so that divine thoughts may come into evidence.<a name=2:12></a> Who that knows God in any way does not prefer to have God's design for His place of worship, rather than those of the greatest ecclesiastical architect?<a name=2:13></a>

		A young believer begins to see that he has to do with God; and with God where there is no light and no material save as God Himself brings it in.<a name=2:14></a> I do not say the people did not have material, because they did; but spiritually it was from God, and the wilderness brought it out.<a name=2:15></a> Four hundred years before it was announced to Abraham that they should go

		out of Egypt with great substance.<a name=3:1></a> No believer is of any value in the assembly morally unless he has got some substance.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The exercises of coming from Egypt imply that I acquire substance; I do not come into the wilderness a pauper.<a name=3:3></a> I am there with a measure of substance, but God will order and direct as to the use of it.<a name=3:4></a> It is to fit into a divine scheme.<a name=3:5></a> Think of having something which God can use, according to a pattern which He has ever had in His mind!<a name=3:6></a> I should not like to be out of that; I should like to have something that God can use.<a name=3:7></a> "See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:5">Hebrews  8:5</a>.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the position in the wilderness with regard to the service of God, and I am concerned with it as set out in Numbers.<a name=3:9></a> Exodus gives us the tabernacle set up; Leviticus God dwelling in it, calling us to Him in His own abode -- a most touching thought, and everything is provided for in the priesthood.<a name=3:10></a> Numbers contemplates what has been set forth in these two books, so that we can face the world as contrary to us.<a name=3:11></a> Having the light of Exodus and of Leviticus, we are here in the wilderness not as individuals, but in relation to the tabernacle.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The wind is contrary" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14:24">Matthew  14:24</a> to that; as you will remember, in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>the Lord, having sent the multitudes away, and having compelled His disciples to go into a ship, was alone on the mountain praying, but the wind was contrary.<a name=3:13></a> That is the position.<a name=3:14></a> Let no one assume that the wind will change in this respect, it will always be a contrary wind.<a name=3:15></a> But Numbers is to prepare us for it, and to show the provision which has been made.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wanted to deal first of all with individual service.<a name=3:17></a> Moses is the great type of this; he is said to be a servant, and faithful in all God's house.<a name=3:18></a> There are those who are like specialists, but scripture
	</div>

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hardly countenances anything like that; the idea of service is to extend to <i>all</i> God's house.<a name=4:1></a> Each has his own gift, his own measure; but every truly commissioned servant will have the whole house in his mind.<a name=4:2></a> Even if he is not able to help actively he can pray, or she can pray.<a name=4:3></a> One may be bed-ridden or crippled, but he can embrace all the saints in his prayers and affections.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 10 contemplates the tabernacle set up and in movement and as movement begins the power of the "wind" is felt.<a name=4:5></a> And, alas!<a name=4:6></a> we find here in Moses, as often appearing in ourselves, a spirit of complaint.<a name=4:7></a> Not rebellion; I suppose the nearest point he reached to rebellion was when he called the people rebels.<a name=4:8></a> We are not far off rebellion when we say that the people of God are rebels.<a name=4:9></a> But in this chapter Moses is not saying that, he is telling Jehovah of the burden, the excess that is laid upon him, and that he had not "conceived all this people".<a name=4:10></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:12">Numbers  11:12</a>.<a name=4:11></a> That is to say, the complaint was against <i>God</i>, because He had as Moses thought, put upon him more than He should have done.<a name=4:12></a> Moses on that occasion saw the Israelites, every man in his tent door, weeping.<a name=4:13></a> They were the tears of murmurers, they were not tears of humiliation.<a name=4:14></a> So it is, beloved, that we are tested in the service of God in these circumstances.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show you that, although a man in this position, honoured of God, may for the moment fail, yet how graciously God stands by him These appearings embody the divine provision for these failures; that is to say, God came in in a visible way to meet the opposition.<a name=4:16></a> For us, of course, it is for faith, but nevertheless real, so that the servant should not lose ground.<a name=4:17></a> It is as sure as possible, if I begin to complain that there is too much upon me, and that I am not cared for, or considered enough, I shall lose ground with those whom I serve.<a name=4:18></a>

		Now the first appearing here is to maintain Moses

		at the full height of his service.<a name=5:1></a> God says, as it were, I will act according to your suggestion, but in doing it I will preserve your dignity, I will preserve you in honour.<a name=5:2></a> I speak thus, dear brethren, so that in service we may know what resources there are; how tenderly, how compassionately, the Master stands by His servant, even although he had brought the circumstances upon himself.<a name=5:3></a> So He says: <i>You</i> gather these seventy men.<a name=5:4></a> For God will never pass by His servant, save He is obliged to by permanent unbelief, or will.<a name=5:5></a> So He directs Moses to select the men who were to help him in his service, trusting him to know that they were reliable, really leaders of the people.<a name=5:6></a> What beautiful confidence Jehovah placed in His servant, although failing at this moment!<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, He says, Gather them to the tent door and I will come down and speak with <i>you</i>.<a name=5:8></a> And "I will take of the spirit which is upon you, and I will put it upon them".<a name=5:9></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:17">Numbers  11:17</a>.<a name=5:10></a> How Moses would feel that!<a name=5:11></a> It was as if God were saying, I have thought this matter out, and I have not put any weight upon you that you could not bear; so in adding others I am going to take from you and give to them.<a name=5:12></a> But I will speak to <i>you</i> in doing it, I will maintain your honour.<a name=5:13></a> And incidentally it would be an advantage to the people; for God turns even the failures of His servants to advantage.<a name=5:14></a> There are seventy-one personalities now in the service instead of one.<a name=5:15></a> The power is not increased; but the personality is increased, and that is something.<a name=5:16></a> Jethro had suggested that Moses should delegate his authority, which he did, but now he has got divine consent, and the power is actually transferred; so that we have seventy persons in addition to Moses with the same spirit or power that Moses had.<a name=5:17></a>

		Two of them prophesied even in the camp; <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:26">Numbers  11:26</a> - 28.<a name=5:18></a> Joshua says, "My lord Moses, forbid them", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:28">Numbers  11:28</a> as if he would restrict ministry to one man

		like many a young brother who would stand up for some selected leader, as we see at Corinth.<a name=6:1></a> Moses says to Joshua, "Enviest thou for my sake?<a name=6:2></a> Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets".<a name=6:3></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:29">Numbers  11:29</a>.<a name=6:4></a> What a beautiful spirit!<a name=6:5></a> one that should mark every servant of Christ.<a name=6:6></a> No one who serves in the spirit of Christ can detract from you, or from me.<a name=6:7></a> "Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them".<a name=6:8></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:29">Numbers  11:29</a>.<a name=6:9></a> What a camp Israel would have been if all had been like that!<a name=6:10></a> It was greatly enhanced by the fact that there were seventy more with the spirit that was upon Moses.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing is, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12">Numbers  12</a>, to see how God stands by His servants; and woe be to him who envies or traduces them.<a name=6:12></a> Miriam and Aaron were jealous of Moses.<a name=6:13></a> "Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses?<a name=6:14></a> hath he not spoken also by us?<a name=6:15></a>" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:2">Numbers  12:2</a>.<a name=6:16></a> Well, that was true, but why assert it?<a name=6:17></a> Moses was not saying anything different.<a name=6:18></a> Moses had just said, Would God that <i>all</i> the Lord's people were prophets.<a name=6:19></a> Think of the wickedness that would rival a man like that, that would impute to him such a wicked motive as arrogating to himself the whole service of God!<a name=6:20></a> He had no such thought.<a name=6:21></a> The service of God is never a one-man affair; it is a question of personality and increase of personality under Christ, but all in the power of God, all in the anointing.<a name=6:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in this chapter the seriousness of envying one whom God uses, one indeed whom God had honoured in such a signal manner as to come down and speak to him on several occasions at the tent door, and recently in the presence of those seventy men on the mountain.<a name=6:23></a> The Holy Spirit immediately says, "Now the man Moses was very meek".<a name=6:24></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:3">Numbers  12:3</a>.<a name=6:25></a> It is not the <i>servant</i> Moses -- we want to see the <i>man</i>.<a name=6:26></a> The man must underlie the servant; indeed, one is very loth ever to use the word "servant" in any official way.<a name=6:27></a> We want to see the man behind the service.<a name=6:28></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One is reminded of the greater than Moses, "the man Christ Jesus".<a name=7:9></a> <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>.<a name=7:10></a> Luke gives us the Man.<a name=7:11></a> We have to study Luke in order to understand Mark; in Luke it is the Man, but in Mark the Servant.<a name=7:12></a> Now here you see God takes this matter in hand and it is important to notice that He spoke "suddenly".<a name=7:13></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:4">Numbers  12:4</a>.<a name=7:14></a> We see here how God distinguishes between servant and servant "If there be a prophet among you, <i>I</i> the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.<a name=7:15></a> My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.<a name=7:16></a> With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?<a name=7:17></a>" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:6">Numbers  12:6</a> - 8.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is important instruction for us.<a name=7:19></a> It is very confirmatory to those who serve, but it is a solemn warning against rivalry or jealousy, and to opposition founded on jealousy against any servant of the Lord.<a name=7:20></a> It is so important a matter that the Lord comes down Himself.<a name=7:21></a> He shows that while there is great personality in the service, there are also distinctions of service and one is honoured more than others.<a name=7:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 14 we have another appearing.<a name=7:23></a> This is in relation to the gospel in its heavenly character, as alluded to in Hebrews.<a name=7:24></a> It is the gospel of the land of Canaan, the gospel that witnesses to heaven and the heavenly calling.<a name=7:25></a> The spies had brought back an

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a most serious matter, indeed Hebrews shows that it was the great turning-point, and that apostasy is in view, and dealt with from this point onwards.<a name=8:2></a> That is to say, it leads to the habit that has been observed from that very day until now, of taking on a lower line when God is emphasising the higher line.<a name=8:3></a> This is a great feature of opposition -- that when God emphasises certain features in a ministry it is opposed by certain of the people.<a name=8:4></a> Not that one accuses any, only that the warning should come home to every one of us, lest we take a lower line, or oppose what God is emphasising.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was hardness of heart in unbelief.<a name=8:6></a> This was to be a test; twelve men were sent up to bring back a report of the land; and there it was, the grapes of Eshcol told their own tale, and the twelve all witnessed to the wealth of the land.<a name=8:7></a> Then the enemy began to work, and only two out of the twelve stood their ground in connection with what God had emphasised.<a name=8:8></a> So Caleb stands up and witnesses to the good land, and to the power of God to bring His people in, because He had delight in them.<a name=8:9></a> How wonderful is this, the sense of God having delight in us, and because of that delight giving us the very best He has got, and exercising His power to bring us into it against all opposition!<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see what is at work -- opposition to that which God emphasises as the very best thing for us; indeed the people are about to stone these two faithful men, when the glory appears.<a name=8:11></a> "And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#14:10">Numbers  14:10</a>.<a name=8:12></a> We see now what is to be contended with; not two weak men like Caleb and Joshua, but God shining out in all His glory.<a name=8:13></a> No one need fear but that He will stand

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Following on this in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16">Numbers  16</a>we have the great rebellion.<a name=9:5></a> It is not now Miriam and Aaron in personal jealousy, but a general uprising against Moses and Aaron by the leading men of Israel.<a name=9:6></a> There were two hundred and fifty men, princes of the congregation -- a most powerful combination -- Korah leading.<a name=9:7></a> And so the glory appears; that is to say, God will stand by the whole position.<a name=9:8></a> It is not now simply a question of one servant or of two servants, but the whole position of Christianity, typically, is assailed in this chapter.<a name=9:9></a> "And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16:19">Numbers  16:19</a>.<a name=9:10></a> They are gathered together around the door of the tabernacle.<a name=9:11></a> It is an attack on the whole position, as I said; they have come up boldly to the door of the tabernacle.<a name=9:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This marks Christendom at the present time; there is an attack on the whole position -- Christ in heaven and the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=9:13></a> The "door of the tabernacle of the congregation" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16:19">Numbers  16:19</a> is where the attack is being made.<a name=9:14></a> Can it be met?<a name=9:15></a> It <i>is</i> being met -- it <i>has been</i> met -- by the glory.<a name=9:16></a> Can God be overcome?<a name=9:17></a> Never!<a name=9:18></a> It may mean martyrdom, it may mean separation, reduction, reproach, but the truth stands; it must stand.<a name=9:19></a> While Christ is in heaven, and the Holy Spirit is here, Christianity can never cease to exist.<a name=9:20></a> It stands, and we may stand courageously by it, for the glory stands by us: "And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked

	<div class="paragraph">
		The cloud <i>is covering the whole testimony</i>.<a name=10:2></a> Can we doubt that this applies at the present time?<a name=10:3></a> There is not a doubt that God has preserved the truth, the whole position of Christianity, implying that Christ is in heaven, with all power committed unto Him in heaven and on earth; and that the Holy Spirit is here and that the priesthood exists in virtue of the Holy Spirit being here; and that the church exists, and the glory covers it -- indeed that all is preserved.<a name=10:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me in closing to emphasise that we have the <i>whole</i> idea presented for us.<a name=10:5></a> If Satan cannot rob us of the whole, he will endeavour to rob us of a part, but the glory covered the <i>whole</i> tabernacle here.<a name=10:6></a> As I was saying elsewhere, the recovery of the Lords supper in our time (it had been in captivity, so to speak) introduces and maintains before us the whole thought.<a name=10:7></a>

		In regard to the kingdom we find the scriptures making much of the Man by whom it is administered.<a name=12:1></a> They make much of Christ, and the Old Testament affords us testimonies to Christ as King, and in all His relations; hence it helps in the understanding of the kingdom, if we consider the Man by whom it is administered.<a name=12:2></a> The idea necessarily proceeds from God, but He is pleased to exercise His power and authority in a Man.<a name=12:3></a> Scripture makes evident the value of the types, and of what marked them.<a name=12:4></a> David is pre-eminent in this way.<a name=12:5></a> The scriptures enlarge on what he was personally, and on what Moses was; the Spirit enlarges on their character, these being the two specially employed by God in administration.<a name=12:6></a>

		It might be stated concisely that the kingdom is the exercise of power in grace, and for this there must be a suited man.<a name=12:7></a> In the person of David a rallying point is afforded for those that needed help.<a name=12:8></a> David becomes a captain over them, and, in result, nothing is lost in spite of Saul's breakdown.<a name=12:9></a> David recovers all.<a name=12:10></a> These two features are prominent, protection for those in need, and formation (for the people become like David), and then the recovery of everything for God.<a name=12:11></a> We need help, but as that is afforded us, we learn there is a formative power behind it, and that brings in the moral greatness of the man.<a name=12:12></a> David was not officially king yet, it was a question of what was moral.<a name=12:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:4">Psalm  45:4</a> we read, "And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness arid righteousness".<a name=12:14></a> That gives the thought of the Man; He is very great and very meek.<a name=12:15></a> That state has to be brought about in us; one has to be ruled before one can rule.<a name=12:16></a> Rule in the main is influence, and this involves moral greatness.<a name=12:17></a> The

		In Moses you have divine authority more directly set forth.<a name=13:2></a> It is a question of God's authority directly communicated.<a name=13:3></a> So we get the thought of Moses' rod, the symbol of God's authority.<a name=13:4></a> Whilst divine influence was there it came out generally in ordering and arranging the people, so that they went out in rank, or military fashion; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#13:18">Exodus  13:18</a>.<a name=13:5></a> The kingdom is exercised in Exodus very much in a military way until after chapter 15, where Moses is king in the affections of the people.<a name=13:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>, he is said to be king in Jeshurun, referring, no doubt, to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#18">Exodus  18</a>.<a name=13:7></a> Generally speaking, however, what is military is in view.<a name=13:8></a> The people go out in harness, five in a rank, then Moses acts in regard to the Red Sea, typically against death; the rod is lifted up and death disposed of.<a name=13:9></a> Thus the Lord is celebrated in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:3">Exodus  15:3</a> in a military way, as a "man of war".<a name=13:10></a>

		David is also marked by this, but much more is said of his personality, what he was as raised up amongst men.<a name=13:11></a> "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:3">2 Samuel  23:3</a>.<a name=13:12></a> David is the typical king.<a name=13:13></a> In the Old Testament there is more said about him than perhaps about any other, beginning with his boyhood.<a name=13:14></a> His anointing in the midst of his brethren is one of the finest pictures in the Old Testament.<a name=13:15></a> That is the man to rule.<a name=13:16></a> Saul was anointed in a sort of private way by Samuel, and was given a heart afterwards to suit his position.<a name=13:17></a> God helped Saul so as to show that if there was anything in flesh qualified to help man God would give it all the opportunity possible.<a name=13:18></a> Saul is marked from the very outset as having failed to find the asses.<a name=13:19></a> One might pass over that as being a mere incident, but the fact is drawn attention to, in order to show that he was disqualified from the start.<a name=13:20></a> He set out to find the asses and failed, and so he returned fearing

		In reading these scriptures I wish to show how God would preserve freshness amongst us as His people.<a name=21:1></a> These scriptures afford the thought in bringing forward the heavenly city.<a name=21:2></a> It is seen at the beginning of the millennium from verse 9 to the end of chapter 21 and in chapter 22 and then one thousand years later, in chapter 21, verses 2 and 3, and still retaining its freshness.<a name=21:3></a> John says, "I saw the holy city new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of the heaven".<a name=21:4></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>.<a name=21:5></a> It suggests to us that it was what he had been labouring for.<a name=21:6></a> His ministry was inaugurating, and preserving freshness.<a name=21:7></a> He says, "I saw".<a name=21:8></a>

		Now I want to show this thought in the word, so that we might see how, that what it was at the beginning should mark the end, and if there is one thing that marks the end, it is freshness, as we see in this scripture.<a name=21:9></a> God began with that.<a name=21:10></a> You remember how that before man was formed in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, it is said "a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground".<a name=21:11></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:6">Genesis  2:6</a>.<a name=21:12></a> And then we have the record that God made man out of the dust of the earth; evidently watered earth, moist earth.<a name=21:13></a> Then in the same chapter we have what is more formal, man being formed and set up in the garden where things are to be maintained in freshness.<a name=21:14></a> It says a river went out of Eden to water the garden.<a name=21:15></a> We must remember that Genesis was written by Moses when the necessity for the truth contained in it was very apparent.<a name=21:16></a> We cannot be sure as to the exact date at which Moses wrote the book, but we can be sure of this, that he was a man who knew something about the meaning of water.<a name=21:17></a> He wrote about the age of the people, as you remember, in his well-known psalm (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90">Psalm  90</a>); he wrote about the allotted age

		Moses wrote Deuteronomy when he was one hundred and nineteen years old.<a name=22:4></a> There is not the slightest indication of any decay in that.<a name=22:5></a> He indeed at the very close blesses the people, and he blesses them in holy vigour as Moses the man of God, outlining the tribes, not according to the principles of decline, but according to the energy of the Spirit.<a name=22:6></a> Beginning with them he says, "Let Reuben live, and not die" <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:6">Deuteronomy  33:6</a> -- he had life before him.<a name=22:7></a> And so, according to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, he is not occupying us with mere physical things, but with spiritual things, spiritual suggestions.<a name=22:8></a> We have a watered earth not yet from heaven, for the mist arose from the earth to water the ground.<a name=22:9></a> Then again, a river went out of Eden to water the garden so that there might be freshness.<a name=22:10></a> For God intended to come into the garden, and did come into it, and in coming into it would look for that freshness.<a name=22:11></a>

		You will remember how that when the apostle in his labours visited Thessalonica he spent three sabbath days in preaching in the synagogue, and how that it is said that certain believed the word, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.<a name=37:4></a> The company, therefore, was made up of believing Jews and Greeks, among whom were some of the chief women.<a name=37:5></a> The apostle had to move on in his service, but he moved on with considerable concern as to the work at Thessalonica, lest he had laboured in vain, but the result of the visit of Timotheus brought to light that instead of his labour being in vain it had been a great success; not only had they believed savingly, but they had come to take account of each other in love.<a name=37:6></a> They had indeed taken form as an assembly, so that in writing to them he addresses them in that way.<a name=37:7></a> He addresses them as an assembly of Thessalonians, not a set of converts, but an assembly.<a name=37:8></a> They are addressed uniquely; there is no other company in the Scriptures addressed in this fashion, and it is because, as I understand it, that God would

		Now one would not suggest that every saint is not beloved of God, because <i>we are</i>.<a name=38:4></a> Love in God rises above our ways, even as in Corinthians when their ways were fleshly; God loved the Corinthians, but He had to write to them in a corrective way.<a name=38:5></a> In the Thessalonians there was that which was <i>lovable</i>, and the exercise with one is as to whether one is lovable.<a name=38:6></a> Love in God takes account of one, and sets itself upon one, even though unlovely in many respects, but this epistle indicates a state of loveliness in youthful Christians.<a name=38:7></a> That is, God in this letter lets us into His thoughts as to what He looks for in young believers, and one is free to address oneself to young believers.<a name=38:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that John in writing his first letter addresses himself to believers under three heads.<a name=38:9></a> The first set are called fathers, then he addresses young men, and then finally he addresses little children.<a name=38:10></a> The whole letter could be read by either set.<a name=38:11></a> I have no doubt the fathers could enjoy what was said to the little ones, and said to the young men, and thus the fathers would get more out of the letter than the little ones; but the little ones were not forgotten, and they are addressed as a class; and God has a great deal in the freshness and vigour that mark the young believer normally: He looks for it.<a name=38:12></a> If you have lost it through years, and grey hairs have come, He has not forgotten it; He says, "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness" <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:2">Jeremiah  2:2</a>.<a name=38:13></a>

		These young believers became models because they were patterned on a model.<a name=41:1></a> Who was the model?<a name=41:2></a> Paul was the model.<a name=41:3></a> "Ye became followers of us, and of the Lord".<a name=41:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:6">1 Thessalonians  1:6</a>.<a name=41:5></a> As they imitated the one through whom the light came, he passed them on to Christ.<a name=41:6></a> That is the principle of a model.<a name=41:7></a> This is important, dear brethren; it has to be taken up; God is graciously working, and young ones are getting light, and taking their stand with the saints; what about models for them?<a name=41:8></a> You say, Christ is the model; thank God He is, the Same yesterday, today, and for ever, but He is in heaven, and so the apostle says, "I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning".<a name=41:9></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:13">1 John  2:13</a>.<a name=41:10></a> To the little ones he says, "If <i>that</i> which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:24">1 John  2:24</a> etc.<a name=41:11></a>, but to the fathers it is, "<i>Him</i> that is from the beginning".<a name=41:12></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:13">1 John  2:13</a>.<a name=41:13></a> We are to be models as acquainted with Him; not simply with <i>that</i> which is from the beginning, but with <i>Him</i>.<a name=41:14></a> It is the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Himself as from the beginning that constitutes us models for others, and so the apostle calls attention to the fact that he regarded the Thessalonians as did a nurse her own children; that is to say, he exercised the skill of the nurse with the affections of the mother.<a name=41:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may be sure that this is necessary at the present time; the young are coming in (thank God for it!<a name=41:16></a>), but the great point is the model, and then he goes on to say that he was like a nursing father.<a name=41:17></a> There was in his service in those few weeks among them the instincts of the mother and the skill of the nurse, the maternal side; but there was also the paternal side, so that he says, "as a father his own children" we admonished every one of you <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:11">1 Thessalonians  2:11</a>.<a name=41:18></a> And then he says, You became imitators of <i>God</i>, and lastly of the <i>assemblies of God</i>.<a name=41:19></a>

		It is because there are so many non-catholics, because we are so sectional and so national.<a name=42:1></a> Now the Thessalonians were Greeks, most of them, and as Greeks naturally prejudiced against the Jews; but the evidence of life was so present with them that the normal effect of it was that they overcame their national instincts, and they became imitators "of the churches of God which <i>in Judaea</i> are in Christ Jesus".<a name=42:2></a> <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:14">1 Thessalonians  2:14</a>.<a name=42:3></a> They might have gone elsewhere for assemblies to pattern themselves on, but the apostle says, "Ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus".<a name=42:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:14">1 Thessalonians  2:14</a>.<a name=42:5></a> These assemblies were not established by Paul, they were established, doubtless, by the labours of the twelve, and there is not much evidence that the Thessalonians knew Peter and John and James, so there was all the more evidence of the power of life in that they overcame all feeling, national instincts, and so on, to pattern themselves on assemblies so far away as Judaea.<a name=42:6></a> There is in it the catholic principle which one feels is so important, because God in these days is calling attention to His house.<a name=42:7></a> The house of God naturally extends beyond all national boundaries, it includes all the saints, and the Thessalonians, young though they were, understood how to overcome rational or social prejudices, they patterned themselves on the assemblies of God; <i>God</i> was their link.<a name=42:8></a>

		The element of holiness is introduced, and I would remark on it for the young, because in our beginnings as believers our motives are apt to be very mixed; hence the importance of understanding holiness, so that we have the word in chapter 3, "The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in <i>holiness before God</i>, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints".<a name=42:9></a> <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:12">1 Thessalonians  3:12</a>,13.<a name=42:10></a> The element of holiness must be present, and this

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=43>[Page 43]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		leads me to say a word about the covenant, because as the people took their position before the mount in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>, the question of holiness necessarily arose.<a name=43:1></a> God was proposing to dwell, and if He is to dwell it must be according to His nature.<a name=43:2></a> Righteousness is present, and righteousness judges sin with authority; it faces the sin, and it deals with it.<a name=43:3></a> We have to learn that.<a name=43:4></a> It says, "The body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness".<a name=43:5></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>.<a name=43:6></a> There is no more important lesson you can learn than that you have the Holy Spirit in view of righteousness; in the power of His presence you must judge sin with authority.<a name=43:7></a>

		But then holiness repels it, <i>shrinks</i> from sin, it shrinks from evil, hence God sets up an enclosure in which He is to dwell, but He is to dwell there in holiness, in holy love; so the Lord Jesus is presented to us in the epistle to the Corinthians as bringing in the love of God to our hearts.<a name=43:8></a> The apostle says, God "hath .<a name=43:9></a>.<a name=43:10></a>.<a name=43:11></a> made us competent as ministers of the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit.<a name=43:12></a> For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens".<a name=43:13></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:6">2 Corinthians  3:6</a>.<a name=43:14></a> Then he says, "Now the Lord is the Spirit".<a name=43:15></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:17">2 Corinthians  3:17</a>.<a name=43:16></a> Now look, beloved, I would like you to understand that the Lord Jesus has not only made the love effective in dying, He has not only attested it in His death, but He makes it effective in our souls.<a name=43:17></a> One of the most precious services the Lord renders to us at the present time is to make the love of God effective in our souls.<a name=43:18></a> In dying He says, "Thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel".<a name=43:19></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:3">Psalm  22:3</a>.<a name=43:20></a> He did not forget that God was dealing in righteousness.<a name=43:21></a> He was dealing authoritatively in righteousness when Jesus died, but He was dealing in holiness, and the Lord recognised that.<a name=43:22></a> He says, "Thou art holy, thou that dwellest in the praises of Israel".<a name=43:23></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:3">Psalm  22:3</a>.<a name=43:24></a> He says that on the cross.<a name=43:25></a> How then is He to praise in the midst of the assembly, to praise such a God as that?<a name=43:26></a> How except by bringing

		It will be observed by those who read the Scriptures that the Holy Spirit emphasises the importance of spiritual intelligence throughout; indeed it is one of the great essentials of believers to be spiritually intelligent.<a name=70:1></a> The prophet Hosea (chapter 4: 6) speaks about God's people being destroyed "for lack of knowledge".<a name=70:2></a> <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#4:6">Hosea  4:6</a>.<a name=70:3></a> The same prophet having spoken of the resurrection of the saints, says, "<i>Then</i> shall we know", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:3">Hosea  6:3</a>.<a name=70:4></a> In that remark one is reminded of John's epistle, which treats in a large measure of this subject, in which he says, "We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding".<a name=70:5></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=70:6></a> The Son of God has abolished death.<a name=70:7></a> Indeed, that by which He was marked off here as the Son of God was the resurrection of the dead, and He has given to us an understanding "that we should know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=70:8></a> He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=70:9></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=70:10></a> One might say that there is there the combination of all knowledge, in so far as knowledge can be compassed by a finite being -- the knowledge of the true God in a Man, and the knowledge of eternal life in a Man.<a name=70:11></a> You recall how in that passage in Hosea the prophet says, "<i>Then</i> shall we know".<a name=70:12></a> <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:3">Hosea  6:3</a>.<a name=70:13></a> As raised up we see it.<a name=70:14></a> The saints come into the apprehension of the resurrection, for we are raised by faith.<a name=70:15></a> We are not literally raised, we are raised "<i>through the faith</i> of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=70:16></a> As risen, as in the light, by faith, of the resurrection, we begin to acquire the knowledge.<a name=70:17></a> "<i>Then</i> shall we know; we shall follow on to know the <i>Lord</i>", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:3">Hosea  6:3</a>.<a name=70:18></a>

		My exercise in regard of this meeting has been that something might come before its that would lead to a better, and more intelligent, and more spiritual use of our days.<a name=80:1></a> I believe that the Lord is about to come, and one is particularly concerned that the time remaining may not be, in any one of us, misspent.<a name=80:2></a> So I would call attention to the use of days -- days being allotted periods, each day calling for its own work.<a name=80:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, I believe, in the expression "Ancient of days", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:9">Daniel  7:9</a>, as applied to the Lord Jesus Christ, a suggestion as to the perfect way in which His days were used and filled up.<a name=80:4></a> Moses, by the Spirit of God, alludes to <i>years</i>, giving them a limit, but it is not really the number of years, but the number of days that one spends here which are our concern.<a name=80:5></a> The expression, "The ancient of days" would, I apprehend, refer to how the Lord used His.<a name=80:6></a> We have in the Old Testament references in regard of days that would indicate that God not only takes account of how years in general are spent, but how days are spent.<a name=80:7></a> According to Scripture there is no mourning at the burial of Abraham, for he was a man who is said to have died in a good old age, "old and full of days".<a name=80:8></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#25:8">Genesis  25:8</a>.<a name=80:9></a> These days were all taken account of by God.<a name=80:10></a> And so with Isaac and others, particularly Job, it is said that they were old at their death and full of days.<a name=80:11></a> Their lives were not a blank, they yielded something for God daily.<a name=80:12></a> In Jacob, as one marked by failure, we have the acknowledgement that the days of the years of his life were not as the days of the years of his father, they were few and they were evil.<a name=80:13></a> A humble admission which, alas, many, if not all of us, would be obliged to fully confirm as to ourselves, but then,

		In the prayer of Moses, the man of God, and it is well to listen to the prayers of a man of God, he says, "So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90:12">Psalm  90:12</a>.<a name=81:3></a> So with a wise heart we see that every day is precious and we use that day rightly, no part of it is to be lost, but we are to be here "redeeming the time".<a name=81:4></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:16">Ephesians  5:16</a>.<a name=81:5></a> The Lord would impress upon us to face things now.<a name=81:6></a> Scripture speaks of "from this day forward".<a name=81:7></a> When light comes into the soul the Lord would say, Thou shalt see greater things henceforward, that is, from now on thou shalt see; for day after day involves increased light.<a name=81:8></a> "The path of the just shineth more and more", it says, "unto a perfect day".<a name=81:9></a> <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:18">Proverbs  4:18</a>.<a name=81:10></a> What a prospect there is, what an incentive to resolve to use up our days rightly.<a name=81:11></a> If rightly used they will issue in something for God every day, and that something accumulates until at the end there is something of value that God knows how to measure.<a name=81:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>we see how days in this dispensation began; they began with the daily experience of Christ risen.<a name=81:13></a> I want you to consider that for a moment.<a name=81:14></a> Forty days spent one after another with Christ risen from the dead.<a name=81:15></a> Think of the experience they had, beginning with the first day of the week after He rose!<a name=81:16></a> Now I would ask you to take note of that, that this dispensation began with the daily experience of Christ risen.<a name=81:17></a> In regard of the saints of old, you will remember how God said, "This month shall be unto you a beginning of months" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:2">Exodus  12:2</a>.<a name=81:18></a> Whatever month it may have been on the calendar of those days, in the civil year, as we speak, it was the <i>first</i>

		month to them.<a name=82:1></a> So today each believer knows that whatever month in the civil year he comes to know God in Christ, that that is his first month.<a name=82:2></a> Presently he will give it a name, and so in Deuteronomy it is the month Abib, indicating that he has come to a spiritual beginning, he gives it a name.<a name=82:3></a> The more you refer to your beginning with God the more definite the first day will become in your mind, and in your heart, you will observe it in relation to God.<a name=82:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the passover was to be observed in the month Abib on the fifteenth day of that month.<a name=82:5></a> They were to take account of the first day of that month, and on the tenth day a lamb for a house was taken from the flock, and for four days abode in the house of each Israelite.<a name=82:6></a> Every inmate of the house would live, day by day, for four days with the innocent victim.<a name=82:7></a> These are the days in which spiritual history is made.<a name=82:8></a> If I do not make spiritual history today, a day is lost and it never occurs again.<a name=82:9></a> A lost day is never made up -- in the history of time it has gone.<a name=82:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now after the passover, having come into the land they were to offer a sheaf of firstfruits to God.<a name=82:11></a> It refers, beloved, to Christ presented in His own personal perfection to God, as risen from the dead.<a name=82:12></a> Many of us know that Christ has been delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification, but this refers to the saints so identified with Christ <i>risen</i>; see <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>.<a name=82:13></a> Wonderful thought!<a name=82:14></a> He is before God, presented and waved there, as if to occupy the divine eye.<a name=82:15></a> From that day forward they begin to count for fifty days.<a name=82:16></a> I see the saints forming the assembly beginning as to their daily experience with Christ risen from the dead.<a name=82:17></a> How many of us have spent one day with Christ risen?<a name=82:18></a> Romans is not risen with Christ.<a name=82:19></a> The Colossian saints are addressed as "risen with Christ by the faith of the operation of God, who raised him from the dead".<a name=82:20></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=82:21></a> You begin with that.<a name=82:22></a> One feels that that truth has but little

		And so they began to count the first day after this sheaf of firstfruits was presented to Jehovah.<a name=83:12></a> What a day it was, beloved, that first day!<a name=83:13></a> How much spiritual history entered into that day!<a name=83:14></a> I do not suppose that any of them failed to mark the fortieth day, which Luke calls "<i>That day</i> in the which he was taken up".<a name=83:15></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:2">Acts  1:2</a>.<a name=83:16></a> What a day that was to them.<a name=83:17></a> For the first day was full of spiritual history -- not public history, <i>spiritual</i> history.<a name=83:18></a> The affairs of Jerusalem doubtless went on as before; men bought and sold, as they always did, on that first day of the week in the city of Jerusalem.<a name=83:19></a> The occurrence of a few days before was a matter of past history, probably what they would call <i>legal</i> history, <i>criminal</i> history.<a name=83:20></a> There can be no doubt that in the criminal annals at Jerusalem it was recorded that a certain man was crucified on that day.<a name=83:21></a> And things went on as before, the matter had passed away.<a name=83:22></a> But, beloved, in the circle of those who knew Christ and loved Christ, that day was full of spiritual history, history that shall remain when the annals of this world are for ever gone.<a name=83:23></a> The Lord was up early on that day and a certain woman was up early.<a name=83:24></a> They were starting the day well.<a name=83:25></a> In the Old Testament we read of persons who undertook to do great things rising early to do

		Well, Jacob is about to die, and expresses these parental instincts, in view of leaving a family behind him.<a name=168:2></a> He says, "Gather yourselves together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:1">Genesis  49:1</a>.<a name=168:3></a> He would have them to know what should happen.<a name=168:4></a> They were to represent him, and in doing so to have a great place here; so he says, "I will tell you".<a name=168:5></a> Then he says moreover, "Assemble yourselves, and hear" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:2">Genesis  49:2</a>.<a name=168:6></a> That is to say, there is not only the evidence of the mind of God in the great patriarch, but the sons are to hearken to <i>Israel</i> -- it is the spiritual side -- their <i>father</i>.<a name=168:7></a> And then, at the end, it says, "All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, .<a name=168:8></a>.<a name=168:9></a>.<a name=168:10></a> and he blessed them: everyone according to his blessing".<a name=168:11></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:28">Genesis  49:28</a>.<a name=168:12></a> In other words, the tribes are set up fully endowed.<a name=168:13></a> And as Isaac, in an earlier day, had blessed Jacob, saying, "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field" -- the field representing rich soil whence income would be derived -- so Jacob, according to Isaac's blessing, was sustained by corn and wine; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27:27">Genesis  27:27</a>, 28.<a name=168:14></a> The tribes, in like manner, are richly endowed, and Deuteronomy takes that into account.<a name=168:15></a>

		Moses, the writer of the Pentateuch, was aware of all these things, and in reading those books we should always remember that it is a retrospective view, written by a man who had been forty years in the desert with God and the people; he looks back and records everything from that standpoint.<a name=168:16></a> It is only thus we can understand the Pentateuch aright, and so in referring to the family, he says, "Ye are sons of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#14:1">Deuteronomy  14:1</a>), not now the sons of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<a name=168:17></a> We read in chapter 26, that an Israelite is to come with his basket of firstfruits to Jehovah and say, "A perishing Aramaean was my father".<a name=168:18></a> <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#26:5">Deuteronomy  26:5</a>.<a name=168:19></a> There is nothing about that in

		Well now, the endowment is what will sustain us in our dignity, so the first thing is, what will your property bring in the first year, the third year, and the seventh year.<a name=169:4></a> In the seventh year you are so wealthy, spiritually, that you are able to "make a release".<a name=169:5></a> I can only briefly speak upon these three points, and would seek to enlist the interest of everyone here as setting out in his spiritual career.<a name=169:6></a>

		That career is composed of hours, days, weeks, months, years.<a name=169:7></a> You have to wait a year before you can make any definite reckoning as to your acquirements.<a name=169:8></a> You may think you have acquirements, but your brethren know differently.<a name=169:9></a> You may think you can speak well and attempt to preach, but you have to wait a year in order to make a definite reckoning.<a name=169:10></a> It is the tithe of the first <i>year</i>, not of the first quarter, or the first half year that you bring to Jehovah.<a name=169:11></a> The inheritance was divided amongst themselves, each man was to have an allotment according to his needs; and now what will you do with it?<a name=169:12></a> You must spend a year on it, and a year is a considerable time for a young person.<a name=169:13></a> Time passes swiftly with the old, but with the young it is not so swift and so you sow your seed in the Springtime, and you have to wait.<a name=169:14></a> "The earth bears fruit of itself", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:28">Mark  4:28</a> and you are cast on God for it.<a name=169:15></a> During all these months between the sowing and the reaping you are cast on Him.<a name=169:16></a> Many things may intervene: You have to watch the sky, to look out for weather and be continually on the alert, if you are to have a crop.<a name=169:17></a> You say you love God, that is like a crop growing.<a name=169:18></a>

		Now I have read the verses in Philemon because there is a striking correspondence between them and those in Deuteronomy already considered.<a name=173:4></a> The apostle Paul is the creditor and Philemon is the debtor.<a name=173:5></a> One need have no fear in having a creditor like Paul, because he is a wealthy man; he can write a substantial cheque, sign it with his own hand, and send it by the hand of one who was once a slave.<a name=173:6></a> He sends this cheque to his debtor, and says, Philemon, here is an opportunity for you: this young man left you, and is indebted to you, for he was your slave.<a name=173:7></a> In the meantime he has been converted; he is now my son, and is a great comfort to me.<a name=173:8></a> I would like to keep him, but I would do nothing without your mind, I therefore send him with this cheque, signed by my own hand.<a name=173:9></a> If he owes you anything, include that in it -- put it to my account but remember, you owe to me yourself also.<a name=173:10></a> What I wish to do is to establish brotherly relations between Onesimus and yourself.<a name=173:11></a>

		I have been thinking about service or ministry.<a name=175:1></a> You will remember how, in the epistle to the Ephesians, it is said that the Lord, as ascended into heaven, having led captivity captive, has given gifts unto men, "Some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers".<a name=175:2></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>.<a name=175:3></a> These were to be, as it is said, "for the work of the ministry".<a name=175:4></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:12">Ephesians  4:12</a>.<a name=175:5></a> You will see that the Lord has ever exercised wisdom and discrimination in the allotment of the gifts.<a name=175:6></a> Some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers.<a name=175:7></a> God is the "God of measure", and gifts are dealt out according to His measure.<a name=175:8></a> The apostle Paul refers to this in regard to his gift.<a name=175:9></a> He laboured according to the measure which God, who is the "God of measure", apportioned to him.<a name=175:10></a> Gifts were given according to the order in which they were required in the ministry; they were "for the work of the ministry".<a name=175:11></a> -
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my thought is to present, as the Lord may enable me, from these passages what is needful in ministry.<a name=175:12></a> I begin with John and work backwards, according to the order of the books.<a name=175:13></a> I begin with John because he is intended for the last days -- the last word, as it were, to us.<a name=175:14></a> We are to take up everything in the light of the last communication, and the gospel of John is, I believe, the last divine communication to the assembly -- later even than Revelation -- and it behoves us to view all that preceded in the light of this book.<a name=175:15></a> It throws light on all that preceded it.<a name=175:16></a> It is the gospel, as most of us know, of the Person of Christ, presented to us by one who was peculiarly loved by Christ, so much so that he is said to be "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=175:17></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:21">John  21:21</a>.<a name=175:18></a> He is thus a type,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=176>[Page 176]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for in these last days what counts specially is love.<a name=176:1></a> John says of himself that Jesus loved him, and there is abundant evidence that he loved Jesus.<a name=176:2></a> His love was reciprocal, and so he tells us (chapter 14) that he that has Christ's commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves Him.<a name=176:3></a> The test of love is in keeping the commandments.<a name=176:4></a> And then, again, when the Lord is questioned by Judas, not the Iscariote, as to how He would manifest Himself unto them and not unto the world, the answer is "If a man love me he will keep my words and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him".<a name=176:5></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:23">John  14:23</a>.<a name=176:6></a> The commandment is first, and then the word.<a name=176:7></a> The commandment separates me from all that is contrary to it.<a name=176:8></a> The "word" is his <i>mind</i>, so that in keeping His word, as loving Him, there are conditions for the divine dwelling.<a name=176:9></a> The Father and He would come and make their <i>abode</i> there.<a name=176:10></a> It is not merely a visit.<a name=176:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus you see how John signalises love in a day of general departure, such as this, from the commandment of the Lord.<a name=176:12></a> And so I bring it forward now in regard to service.<a name=176:13></a> He tells us that the Lord in commissioning the disciples -- breathed into them.<a name=176:14></a> This is preceded by the verse I have read to you in reference to His communication to Mary Magdalene, in whom there was responsive love.<a name=176:15></a> The Lord honours her by speaking to her of the wonderful relationship into which the disciples were to be given entrance.<a name=176:16></a> I refer to this so that we may see that service emanates from the family circle.<a name=176:17></a> Qualifications for it are not acquired in the seminaries or universities.<a name=176:18></a> They do not afford the education that ministry requires.<a name=176:19></a> What John would insist upon is the family circle -- that those who minister according to God are sent forth from the bosom of the family.<a name=176:20></a> The disciples are the brethren of Christ.<a name=176:21></a> The Lord had just said to Mary, "Go to my brethren" (not 'the brethren'

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My exercise is to call attention to the results for God in the recovery of His people.<a name=240:1></a> He has His own end in view, and He never relinquishes that end, however far we may wander.<a name=240:2></a> Whether viewed in a collective or an individual way God never relinquishes His thought in taking us up.<a name=240:3></a> In the language of the New Testament He Himself knows under all circumstances what He will do, and He will not in any way be thwarted, for He has got the means by Him of reaching His end.<a name=240:4></a> So I would seek to link up these scriptures as presenting four great features which God has reached in recovering His people from Babylon.<a name=240:5></a> He <i>has</i> reached, I do not merely say that He intended to reach these features, He <i>has</i> reached them.<a name=240:6></a> He began with the thought of having man as a companion on earth.<a name=240:7></a> He came into the garden of Eden with the thought of communing with Adam.<a name=240:8></a> There might have been a holy walk on that day for Adam.<a name=240:9></a> He walked there, we are told, in the cool of the day, for we shall always find that God considers for us; but Adam was not available to God.<a name=240:10></a> But God had His thought, and that was reached in the first great recovery after sin came in, for Enoch came in on the line of Seth, and Enoch walked with God.<a name=240:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next great recovery brought out another feature, showing how God could be on terms with the creation notwithstanding the presence of sin.<a name=240:12></a> Evil was in man's heart after the flood as before it, but God could be on favourable terms with the creation.<a name=240:13></a> In the recovery after the flood God is known as favourable toward all while the earth remaineth.<a name=240:14></a> Whatever man may do, God's attitude remains unchanged.<a name=240:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, thirdly, inasmuch as the great truth of the house of God had come out, and Jacob, to whom the light of it was vouchsafed, had departed from the land of Canaan, in the recovery, not only is the great truth of the house reasserted, but new features are added.<a name=241:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, fourthly, in the next great recovery we have brethren beloved.<a name=241:2></a> These four features of the truth have been reached by God in the great recovery in which it is our privilege as His people to have part at the present time, but, whilst they have been reached, our exercise should be as to their maintenance, that what we have come into as a heritage may not slip away from us or, we from it.<a name=241:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To begin with the first feature I mentioned: <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>and 4 record the incoming of sin and its ravages, but <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:25">Genesis  4:25</a>,26 suggests that the light of a new day had begun to dawn.<a name=241:4></a> Now whether we speak of the assembly as having departed from divine principles and got into the world, or whether we speak of a believer as having departed through sin from the path of faith and righteousness, the principle remains that there has to be the admission of sin, the acknowledgment of what the flesh is.<a name=241:5></a> Seth begat a son, and he called his name Enos, for he had come to recognise that man after the flesh, born under whatever circumstances he may be, is flesh; "That which is born of the flesh <i>is</i> flesh" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a>; no one can gainsay it, and there is no possibility of recovery unless it is fully, unreservedly, unqualifiedly admitted, and Seth had come to that.<a name=241:6></a> This son of mine, he says, is born to die; weak, frail, mortal man, what can <i>he</i> do?<a name=241:7></a> And then it says, "Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:26">Genesis  4:26</a>.<a name=241:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If man can do nothing, God can do much; room is made for God, and a new day has dawned.<a name=241:9></a> Hence the Spirit of God begins the history over again in the light of this new day, for God always links on recovery

		with the beginning.<a name=242:1></a> God's work is one whole, one piece from start to finish.<a name=242:2></a> Whatever <i>we</i> may do God holds on to His work, hence, when recovery is effected, He begins over again.<a name=242:3></a> He links on with the beginning.<a name=242:4></a> "This is the book of the generations [or histories] of Adam.<a name=242:5></a> In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him".<a name=242:6></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:1">Genesis  5:1</a>.<a name=242:7></a> Not now in the image of God, but the "likeness"; Adam had come into the new light that was shining.<a name=242:8></a> Man was irretrievably ruined as after the flesh, but God remained in His eternal lustre, the eternal God, and men began to call on His name.<a name=242:9></a> "From everlasting to everlasting, <i>thou art God</i>" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90:2">Psalm  90:2</a> that is the refuge for faith, there is no change with God.<a name=242:10></a> So what He began at Pentecost continues, in spite of all man's failure in responsibility; the work of God is one piece, and we shall see it presently coming out of heaven as the holy city.<a name=242:11></a> The foundations of the city have in them the names of the twelve apostles (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:14">Revelation  21:14</a>) and the city contains in it every item of the work of God from their day to our day, and until the assembly finally is caught up to be with Christ.<a name=242:12></a> Each recovery enables God to begin over again with the record, He links it on with the beginning.<a name=242:13></a> What we enjoy today began at Pentecost.<a name=242:14></a> So in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:1">Genesis  5:1</a>,2 God reverts to the generations of Adam, "In the day that God created man .<a name=242:15></a>.<a name=242:16></a>.<a name=242:17></a> male and female created he them and blessed them, and called their name Adam".<a name=242:18></a> Not a word about the curse here, nor of Adam earning his bread in the sweat of his brow; he is <i>blessed</i>.<a name=242:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it goes on to say, "Adam .<a name=242:20></a>.<a name=242:21></a>.<a name=242:22></a> begat a son in <i>his own likeness</i>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:3">Genesis  5:3</a>; but not the likeness of a man who slunk away behind the trees afraid to look into the face of God, but of Adam set up again in a new life.<a name=242:23></a> Men had begun to call on the name of the Lord; God had regained His place in their hearts and in their minds; there was faith.<a name=242:24></a> Seth comes in on the line

		of likeness first, and then of image; in other words the principle is, that whilst God began with the idea of image before likeness, now that sin has come in, you must have likeness before you can have representation.<a name=243:1></a> So Seth is born in the likeness of Adam first, for representation must be dependent on likeness.<a name=243:2></a> God's intention is that <i>we</i> should be here for Him on the principle of representation, but for that we must be like Him -- like <i>God</i>.<a name=243:3></a> God will never again anoint the flesh.<a name=243:4></a> He anointed Saul, but He will never anoint a man of the flesh again: He anoints a Man after His own heart, and that Man is like Him.<a name=243:5></a> Seth as begotten in the likeness of Adam is after his image, and he is appointed, his name means that -- he is a type of Christ.<a name=243:6></a> God always works on the principle of what came out in Christ, and what came out in Christ was likeness.<a name=243:7></a> He was like God, and as like God He is anointed, hence "He is the image of the invisible God".<a name=243:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Seth, then, is the appointed one, and in him is secured in faith, not the death line, but the life line.<a name=243:9></a> You may say, They all died, But no, Enoch did not die.<a name=243:10></a> He comes in as the great result of the recovery God had secured; He had set His heart upon men to walk with Him, and He secures it in Enoch.<a name=243:11></a> What a precious privilege to walk with God as perfectly revealed in Jesus!<a name=243:12></a> "The radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God .<a name=243:13></a>.<a name=243:14></a>.<a name=243:15></a> has shone in our hearts" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:4">2 Corinthians  4:4</a>, 6, and it is our privilege to walk with that God.<a name=243:16></a> That is what God has reached, He has secured men in the recovery to walk with Him.<a name=243:17></a> So it says, "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>.<a name=243:18></a> In the gospel of John the Lord brings to light that there were those who should not taste death nor see it.<a name=243:19></a> "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death .<a name=243:20></a>.<a name=243:21></a>.<a name=243:22></a> for before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>; the most precious testimony to have in your soul,

		The next great recovery, as I remarked, gives the basis for the gospel.<a name=244:2></a> God would have us to pay attention to that.<a name=244:3></a> We have here a foreshadowing of the reconciliation of the world.<a name=244:4></a> The rejection of the Jew, according to Romans, involves the reconciliation of the world.<a name=244:5></a> Notwithstanding the untold guilt that exists in it, it is in reconciliation.<a name=244:6></a> Though man's heart is evil, God says, "While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease".<a name=244:7></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>.<a name=244:8></a> Noah, in the recovery, thought for <i>God</i>; he knew what it was to walk with God, no doubt, but he built an altar.<a name=244:9></a> We are not told that Enoch built an altar, but Noah set up definitely the public worship of God.<a name=244:10></a> That is the next great feature.<a name=244:11></a> If I walk with God and God is before me, the next thing is to have my altar both privately and publicly.<a name=244:12></a> My house is for God, my business is for God, and I am for God in regard of His public worship.<a name=244:13></a> God is before me.<a name=244:14></a> I have a universal outlook, and I understand that on the ground of the sweet savour offering He rests and can be complacent towards all men through Christ.<a name=244:15></a> It was a provisional situation, for it is "while the earth remaineth", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>, just as today the position is provisional, but nevertheless it is there.<a name=244:16></a> God would arouse us as to the magnitude of the position that God is favourable to all men.<a name=244:17></a> It is in the light of the favourableness of God you continue to announce the glad tidings.<a name=244:18></a> There is no change with God; "while the earth remaineth" things go on according to His primary thought.<a name=244:19></a> Whatever happens, while Jesus is on the Father's throne that throne is favourable, God is favourable.<a name=244:20></a> You can announce the glad tidings with the fullest confidence to all on the principle of those marvellous words of Christ, "As they had nothing to pay, he forgave both of them", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:42">Luke  7:42</a>.<a name=244:21></a>

		I have in mind to speak about the King.<a name=255:1></a> The King of the Old Testament is the Lord Jesus.<a name=255:2></a> The relation of the King to the soul is recognised in Mary's reference, "They have taken away my Lord".<a name=255:3></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:13">John  20:13</a>.<a name=255:4></a> Kingship has reference to rule.<a name=255:5></a> It has a very great place in Scripture and it is important that it should be understood in one's soul now in view of the fact that kings and thrones are disappearing from this world.<a name=255:6></a> Within the lifetime of most of us here some of the most renowned monarchies have disappeared.<a name=255:7></a> The idea of government according to God is fast disappearing from this world, whereas in Revelation we are told that there is a throne in heaven.<a name=255:8></a> No convulsions in the affairs of this world can interfere with that throne.<a name=255:9></a> In our passage we read "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever".<a name=255:10></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:6">Psalm  45:6</a>.<a name=255:11></a> For the moment it is a throne of grace, presently the Lord Jesus will take up the thrones of this world and will rule in judging the world in righteousness.<a name=255:12></a> The believer is to know the Lord Jesus as the One that is made Lord and Christ in heaven; as submitting to Christ we receive the Holy Spirit, and so are in the kingdom of God, and we say, "There is .<a name=255:13></a>.<a name=255:14></a>.<a name=255:15></a> one Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=255:16></a> As we thus regard Him, He becomes increasingly attractive to us, so that in time we, like the Psalmist, begin to compose something touching the King.<a name=255:17></a>

		The psalm is the result of an experience of the king.<a name=255:18></a> The writer had evidently been acquainted with David.<a name=255:19></a> David represents in the Old Testament the divine idea of a king, but the roots of kingship extend far back in Old Testament times.<a name=255:20></a> Melchizedek represents kingship in the mind of God.<a name=255:21></a> His name signifies peace.<a name=255:22></a> He was king of righteousness.<a name=255:23></a> God had such

	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to show how this was realised in David.<a name=256:7></a> God begins a line of thought by setting out what was in His mind, and then we have the way traced out by which God reaches His thought.<a name=256:8></a> We have the golden thread of this in Matthew, reaching through forty-two generations from Abraham to the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=256:9></a> The book begins with the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the son of Abraham, and we find when David is reached, he is called the king.<a name=256:10></a> Hence we have the full thought of kingship traced to our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the King.<a name=256:11></a> That was ever in the mind of God.<a name=256:12></a>

		This chapter teaches us the way of love in restoring souls to communion, and seeing we have part in the great recovery, it becomes very interesting to us.<a name=296:1></a> We should certainly have before us the recovery of souls.<a name=296:2></a> The Lord would have us to be on the look-out for souls to gather in; indeed, the great feature in John's gospel is gathering.<a name=296:3></a> He said, "He should <i>gather together</i> in one the children of God that were scattered abroad" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:52">John  11:52</a>), and also, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:32">John  12:32</a>.<a name=296:4></a> Gathering and attracting go together.<a name=296:5></a> Christ is the attractive centre for all, as being lifted up from the earth.<a name=296:6></a> We get that principle in Hosea, "I drew them .<a name=296:7></a>.<a name=296:8></a>.<a name=296:9></a> with cords of love", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:4">Hosea  11:4</a>.<a name=296:10></a> The fact of Christ, as being lifted up from the earth, being the gathering centre, exposes the flesh.<a name=296:11></a> As working miracles and feeding the multitudes they would make Him a king.<a name=296:12></a> John's gospel shows that men would accept Christ because of the outward gain; they believed because of the miracles which He did; <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:14">John  6:14</a>,15.<a name=296:13></a> Christendom is largely on that ground; they recognise the Lord in so far as He benefits civilisation.<a name=296:14></a> It is respectable to follow a man who can work miracles and feed the hungry, but it is another thing to follow a man lifted up on a gibbet; but as such He draws all to Him.<a name=296:15></a> He says, "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:44">John  6:44</a>.<a name=296:16></a> So that we have a gathering principle in John to govern us as to gathering together.<a name=296:17></a>

		John in a special way is different from the other three gospels.<a name=297:15></a> We see in John the principles which should guide us in connection with gathering.<a name=297:16></a> There are two principles.<a name=297:17></a> The one may be said to be the power of attraction which we see in connection with the astronomical sphere, but there is also service in <i>activity</i>.<a name=297:18></a> When it is a question of gathering, He is lifted up to be seen by all.<a name=297:19></a> Paul says, "I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men".<a name=297:20></a> (See <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:9">1 Corinthians  4:9</a>, etc.<a name=297:21></a>) The apostles in this way were in accord with the lifting up above the earth.<a name=297:22></a> The apostle emphasises that fact in writing to the Corinthians, because they were cultivating the flesh, and making

		We are to consider the question of food.<a name=304:1></a> What marks John's record in regard to food is that the Lord gave it directly to those who needed it.<a name=304:2></a> In the other gospels, when feeding the multitude at different times He used His disciples to hand the food to those who needed it, but according to the New Translation by J.<a name=304:3></a> N.<a name=304:4></a> Darby, John omits the disciples' service in this respect.<a name=304:5></a> The Lord having given thanks (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>), He distributed the food, and in this passage in chapter 21 we see how He had the coals of fire and fish and bread all ready, and He invites the disciples to dine, as if to indicate in the recovery of His people in these last days that we not only have food, but we have it as prepared by the Lord, who in a formal way issues an invitation to <i>dine</i>.<a name=304:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the gospel of Luke we have another picture.<a name=304:7></a> The Lord would Himself partake of food, and in asking the gathered company if they had any, He asked them to bring out what they had.<a name=304:8></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>it is what <i>He</i> had, and, dear brethren, there is no limit with Him; His resources are unlimited.<a name=304:9></a> The sea is a kind of type of the resources He has, He could command a hundred and fifty-three great fishes, but without these He had already a dinner prepared.<a name=304:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He would have us who have part with Him prove these resources.<a name=304:11></a> This chapter shows how great they are with Him, and the people of God are proving what these resources are, and that not only is there the means of sustenance in the way of food, but there is a formal meal prepared by the Lord Himself.<a name=304:12></a> Many of us have enjoyed being invited to dine.<a name=304:13></a> There is something peculiarly dignified in an invitation to dine.<a name=304:14></a>

		time, but in no instance have we an invitation to come and dine.<a name=305:1></a> In Luke, as I remarked, it is that <i>He</i> would partake of food, and the question should be raised with us, in each locality in some way or other, as to what we have.<a name=305:2></a> In John it is what He has, but in this passage in Luke it is, "Have ye <i>here</i> any meat?<a name=305:3></a>" The Lord would inquire thus in <i>this</i> city.<a name=305:4></a>

		We may be able to give an account of how many there are nominally in fellowship, we may be able to answer easily many such questions, but if the question is asked: Have ye here anything to eat, what shall be the answer?<a name=305:5></a> What is there the Lord could partake of?<a name=305:6></a> Those addressed here (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:41">Luke  24:41</a>) knew Him; they had been in His company and at meals with Him on many occasions, they knew what He was accustomed to eat, hence they would understand His inquiry.<a name=305:7></a> He does not say: how much?<a name=305:8></a> but, have you <i>any</i>?<a name=305:9></a> "They gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.<a name=305:10></a> And he <i>took</i> it, and did eat before them".<a name=305:11></a> Now I need riot enlarge on this.<a name=305:12></a> What I mean is obvious to all, that the Lord would have in each company of His own something to eat.<a name=305:13></a> God said in <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:10">Malachi  3:10</a>: "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house".<a name=305:14></a> You see the idea of old was that the people were to bring tithes, and <i>full</i> tithes, and God said if they brought <i>full</i> tithes, "I will .<a name=305:15></a>.<a name=305:16></a>.<a name=305:17></a> pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it" <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:10">Malachi  3:10</a>.<a name=305:18></a>

		Then, as having once passed outside the world, it has become a wilderness to me and I need food to sustain me there, hence the manna, the food that <i>came down</i>, for it is now a question of carrying out the will of God; then His will should be done on earth as it is in heaven, and for this I have to eat angels' food.<a name=306:11></a> As it is said, "<i>Man</i> did eat angels' food".<a name=306:12></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:25">Psalm  78:25</a>.<a name=306:13></a> Angels eat that food as <i>subject</i> to the will of God.<a name=306:14></a> The manna refers to the life of Jesus in this world.<a name=306:15></a> As I appropriate Him in His death and feed upon the Lamb, so I accept His path here.<a name=306:16></a> I have to walk as He walked, hence I need the food that came down from heaven.<a name=306:17></a>

		I have before me the subject of Nazariteship, particularly its results as worked out dispensationally, that is in the history of the assembly: and what may be remarked at the outset is that as ever, this great subject -- or the principle of it -- has to be learned from Christ.<a name=322:1></a> For, indeed, in no other is any principle of God worked out perfectly, and it may be well, in order that our minds should be clear as to this section of Scripture, to see that it has <i>to be understood</i> dispensationally.<a name=322:2></a> For we should be greatly deceived if we were to assume that any one now could be guilty of Samson's indiscretions and, indeed, sins, and yet be a vessel of divine power.<a name=322:3></a> It were an entire mistake to assume that anyone today could enter into the evil associations of Samson, and yet be a vessel <i>personally</i> of divine power and grace.<a name=322:4></a> So that it has to be taken account of dispensationally.<a name=322:5></a> But, in using that word, beloved, it is with no thought of occupying you with mere dispensational truth.<a name=322:6></a> I have before me, by the Lord's help, to bring out certain features of Nazariteship which should appear in a practical way among the people of God.<a name=322:7></a> But, in order that the great principle should be clearly before us, the Spirit of God gives it in its abstract perfection in chapter 13, before He comes to the history of Samson, affording, as it does, such sorrowful events, for we must not conclude that God in any way overlooked or justified these occurrences to which I have referred -- far otherwise.<a name=322:8></a> But He gives us in chapter 13, as I said, an outline of Nazariteship in its abstract perfection, and, in order to understand the working of it in a poor failing man like Samson, we have to have clearly in our souls the abstract idea -- we have to see, dear brethren, that Nazariteship involves the

		I have before me, dear brethren, to speak about victory, and you will observe in the first passage read that God gives it to <i>us</i>, the "us" obviously having reference to those having faith, for spiritual things are given only to such.<a name=336:1></a> God is bountiful in material things and provides for all, even although there may not be faith, for He has never left Himself without witness among men, giving rain, as we are told, and fruitful seasons, filling men's hearts with food and gladness.<a name=336:2></a> Indeed, as the passage goes on to say: "In him, we (meaning all mankind) live, and move, and have our being", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:28">Acts  17:28</a>.<a name=336:3></a> But when it comes to spiritual things the dispensation of God is said to be in faith.<a name=336:4></a> The gospel is addressed to those who have faith, and it is said, on the principle of faith to faith; it is an administration.<a name=336:5></a> The Lord Jesus Christ, ere going up to heaven, after He rose from the dead, moved in and out amongst His people for forty days, and in that way would impress them with what is spiritual, so that on going on high, being made both Lord and Christ, He administered what was spiritual.<a name=336:6></a> And so Peter says, referring to the gift of the Spirit which was there to be observed: "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>.<a name=336:7></a> But He shed Him forth upon those who had faith.<a name=336:8></a> He, as shed forth thus, was available to man, but only on the principle of faith.<a name=336:9></a> So that what God gives spiritually, as I said, has reference to those who have faith, and when the apostle here says: "Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:57">1 Corinthians  15:57</a>, the "us" refers to those who have

	<div class="paragraph">
		faith.<a name=337:1></a> As having faith we believe what is presented to us on the principle of faith.<a name=337:2></a> And so, in this chapter, the apostle says at the outset that the gospel which he preached to the Corinthians was that "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures".<a name=337:3></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:4">1 Corinthians  15:4</a>.<a name=337:4></a> These facts were presented to them on the principle of faith, and having received them (if they did, indeed) they came within the "us", to whom God is pleased to give the victory.<a name=337:5></a> And, I may add, so that there may be no misunderstanding as to what this victory implies, that it does not refer to any material success or prosperity in this world.<a name=337:6></a> It refers to what the chapter speaks of; it refers to resurrection, and you will observe that he does not say: 'He <i>shall</i> give it to us', but He "<i>giveth</i> us the victory".<a name=337:7></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:57">1 Corinthians  15:57</a>.<a name=337:8></a> In other words it is a present thing, which God intends should be by faith in the possession of our souls; He <i>gives</i> it to us, and He gives it to us through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=337:9></a>

		Now, the Lord, as risen, remained with His own forty days before He ascended, and, as you will remember, He appeared, according to this chapter, on six different occasions; and I submit to you that on each of these occasions there would be conveyed the sense of victory.<a name=337:10></a> First, He appeared to Cephas.<a name=337:11></a> In the gospel of Luke we are told He appeared to Simon, doubtless to reassure the heart of His erring disciple, but the Spirit of God has not that in view in this passage, and so He mentions Simon's spiritual name.<a name=337:12></a> We have to understand what it is, beloved, to have spiritual names, because it is first that which is natural and afterwards that which is spiritual.<a name=337:13></a> We have to understand how we come under the eye of the Lord, the last Adam who is a quickening Spirit.<a name=337:14></a> If He has to do with us He quickens us; He quickens us in relation to His own perfect wisdom as to the place we are to occupy in that spiritual

		world which He came to effectuate.<a name=338:1></a> So that Simon is referred to here according to his spiritual name.<a name=338:2></a> The last quickening involves certain traits which no one else has.<a name=338:3></a> Each one differs, as this passage tells us: "star differs from star in glory".<a name=338:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:41">1 Corinthians  15:41</a>.<a name=338:5></a> Each one has his own living characteristics, spiritual characteristics, and, as all come under the eye of the last Adam, He sees these and names the person accordingly.<a name=338:6></a> We shall all appear, therefore, in the spiritual realm according to the names which the last Adam confers.<a name=338:7></a> And so, as He appears to Cephas, there would be in the heart of Cephas a sense of victory.<a name=338:8></a> He would be stimulated in the sense of victory as to what he was and the place he was to occupy in the divine structure for his name signifies "a stone".<a name=338:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then He appears to the twelve, for they were to administer.<a name=338:10></a> There was to be here an administrative company appointed by the Lord, and they had been appointed, and as appointed He appears to them.<a name=338:11></a> The appearance would convey to them a sense of victory, for the One whom they were to represent in their administration was Himself supremely victorious; He was out of death.<a name=338:12></a> Their administration should be not of material things, but spiritual things, and they would be impressed by the appearance of Christ to them as the twelve, with the sense of victory that they had to do with a spiritual Person, One who had been into death, and was now out of it.<a name=338:13></a> They would be impressed with victory, and would carry on the administration in the sense of victory; they would be above the least taint of corruption.<a name=338:14></a> We know how administrators after the flesh are exposed to corruption, but these would be set up in their souls in complete superiority in the sense of victory that the Lord Jesus Christ would accord to them as appearing to them.<a name=338:15></a>

		Peter himself was scarcely an elder in the sense that elders were appointed for cities; he was an apostle, and therefore not officially occupied in ruling a local company; so that he was an elder, and they were elders, by experience characteristically.<a name=428:4></a> Peter would have more weight in addressing them as "their fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ".<a name=428:5></a> <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:1">1 Peter  5:1</a>.<a name=428:6></a> He addresses them more on moral grounds than with apostolic authority; he is an elder with them, having had long experience in the ways of God, and being a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and so was qualified to speak a word to them.<a name=428:7></a> He speaks of himself as "their <i>fellow</i>-elder", which would bring him to the level of the elders and give more force to his words.<a name=428:8></a> Peter was one of the brotherhood, not separated from his brethren by official position.<a name=428:9></a> In the wisdom and ways of the Lord, at the outset of any movement, those who came in with it were permitted to remain (like a Moses or a Joshua), so as to foster and nurture the saints, that they might reap the benefit of their experience.<a name=428:10></a>

		Peter had received at His hands a commission: "feed my lambs .<a name=429:3></a>.<a name=429:4></a>.<a name=429:5></a> Shepherd my sheep .<a name=429:6></a>.<a name=429:7></a>.<a name=429:8></a> Feed my sheep", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:15">John  21:15</a> - 17.<a name=429:9></a> It was given in the light of his own martyrdom, and is a word which every young Christian should remember and take to heart, because we are so disposed to be governed by our own wills, even in the things of God.<a name=429:10></a> The Lord in giving the charge to Peter, remarks on that too; He says, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:18">John  21:18</a>.<a name=429:11></a> That is, Peter through experience, as an old man, would resign himself; he would come to the point of the sufferings of Christ, which involves complete resignation, which the will of God requires.<a name=429:12></a> He says in the end of chapter 4, "Let them who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator".<a name=429:13></a> <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:19">1 Peter  4:19</a>.<a name=429:14></a> The will of God led Peter into martyrdom and he accepted it.<a name=429:15></a> The Lord had indicated that to him, and in that connection committed to him the charge of the flock, so that Peter qualified in that way.<a name=429:16></a> Now, as a fellow-elder, he is qualified to speak to the elders.<a name=429:17></a> It is a great thing when there is one who can thus speak.<a name=429:18></a> We all seem at liberty to speak to the young, which of course is a great service, but it takes considerably more power to express oneself to elders.<a name=429:19></a> Peter received the charge, not only of the lambs but also of the sheep, he was to shepherd them.<a name=429:20></a> There is a specific order in the Lord's commission -- "Feed my lambs .<a name=429:21></a>.<a name=429:22></a>.<a name=429:23></a> Shepherd my sheep .<a name=429:24></a>.<a name=429:25></a>.<a name=429:26></a> Feed my sheep".<a name=429:27></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:15">John  21:15</a> - 17.<a name=429:28></a> The lambs do not go astray by themselves; what they require is <i>food</i>.<a name=429:29></a> The sheep need <i>shepherding</i>; they are

		This should be a matter of exercise with us, because we are ready to see the wrong of the lambs in going astray, but what about the sheep?<a name=430:2></a> It is also implied that if the young do stray, we should seek, nourish and cherish them; for if the shepherding spirit was with the elders, it would act as a preventative to this tendency.<a name=430:3></a> There is, therefore, implied a responsibility for the older to look after the younger; a sense of blame attaches to them if the young are not held and preserved.<a name=430:4></a> The Lord says, "Shepherd my sheep".<a name=430:5></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:16">John  21:16</a>.<a name=430:6></a> That would mean that the tendency of the sheep would be to stray away from those in the lead.<a name=430:7></a> When we stand up to address the saints, we are free to say a word to the young, but how many can say a word to the older ones?<a name=430:8></a> They need it, for they are not immune from the straying tendency.<a name=430:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter was evidently qualified to speak to the elders, because he was an elder; and more than that, his experience extended back to the witnessing of the sufferings of the Christ.<a name=430:10></a> So that the order in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>is significant; if it is the lambs, they require feeding; if it is the sheep, they require shepherding.<a name=430:11></a> What young Christians need is food; they are held by the things you present to them, if they are to be held at all; they also need guardianship and influence.<a name=430:12></a> An old brother will listen; he is amenable to correction; shepherding is more in the way of speaking to him as to one who knows the truth, and you bring it to bear upon him.<a name=430:13></a> Timothy was not to rebuke "an elder sharply, but exhort him as a father", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:1">1 Timothy  5:1</a>.<a name=430:14></a> He was to have due respect to the age of the brother and exhort him accordingly; but Peter here does not exhort them as a father, but as a fellow-elder, as one who had more experience than any of them.<a name=430:15></a>

		Peter views the elders whom he addresses as among the flock, and the flock among the elders, which suggests an atmosphere for the mutual exchange of affections.<a name=431:12></a> The word "among" brings all on one level, in a sense.<a name=431:13></a> There was evidently a state of intimate relationships so that the elders were among the flock and the flock among the elders, and Peter places himself there, as a fellow-elder.<a name=431:14></a> It suggests a mutual state of things in which you can help the saints.<a name=431:15></a> One of the greatest assets at the present time is the mutual consideration and feeling that exists among the saints.<a name=431:16></a> You can serve them effectively under these circumstances.<a name=431:17></a> This is very much akin to Paul when he was taking his farewell at Miletus.<a name=431:18></a>

		He sent for the elders of Ephesus, and addresses them in relation to the flock of God in much the same spirit; and points out what he had been among them.<a name=432:1></a> So that what is suggested here is the thought of being models of the flock, not as lording it over them; this would have more weight than assumed authority.<a name=432:2></a> Peter did not assume the place of chief bishop amongst them.<a name=432:3></a> We have no bishop sentiment here; he is simply a fellow-elder, and the elders are such characteristically, not officially.<a name=432:4></a> The light of this would preserve us from assuming an ecclesiastical position.<a name=432:5></a> There was no idea with Peter to arrogate to himself the chief place amongst them, although he had this position morally.<a name=432:6></a>

		The idea of a pope is that he is the chief bishop; Peter was just a fellow-elder, who had taken character from the chief Shepherd, who was to appear.<a name=432:7></a> Peter would gather up at the cross what the heart of that Shepherd was.<a name=432:8></a> To the women who wailed and lamented him, He said: "Do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and over your children" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:28">Luke  23:28</a>; and then in almost the same breath, when on the cross, he said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:34">Luke  23:34</a>.<a name=432:9></a> He also charged John to take care of His mother.<a name=432:10></a> All through He is thinking of others, not of Himself.<a name=432:11></a> These are the features that come out in the sufferings of Christ; it was the shepherd character of the Lord which Peter could see.<a name=432:12></a> So in Gethsemane: "If therefore ye seek me, let these go away", <a href="../bible/John.htm#18:8">John  18:8</a>.<a name=432:13></a> He thought of the disciples.<a name=432:14></a> It is worthy of note that the three apostles who were prominent in the testimony, Peter, Paul and John, each in their old age dropped the official title and appear simply as brothers of experience.<a name=432:15></a> John in Patmos says, "I John, your <i>brother</i> and fellow-partaker in the tribulation" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>, nothing official, but that which he had accumulated in experience.<a name=432:16></a> Paul says, "Being such

		The apostle in speaking of participation in the glory is looking on to the end, to the manifestation.<a name=433:2></a> One idea common to eldership is suffering: "When the chief shepherd is manifested, ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory".<a name=433:3></a> <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:4">1 Peter  5:4</a>.<a name=433:4></a> Glory crowns the suffering pathway of eldership; the idea is gathered up from the Lord's path in suffering, for the chief Shepherd necessarily gives the lead to all the shepherds who follow.<a name=433:5></a>

		What we have been saying hardly covers all the aspects of eldership, for we are not dealing with a local function exactly.<a name=433:6></a> It is what would mark any aged brother; so that there is an aspect in which younger brothers, as having gift in relation to assembly functions and administration, may properly take precedence over those old in age.<a name=433:7></a> What Peter presents here is the appearing of the chief Shepherd; you are not looking for present gain or advantage, but what accrues at the end, in the perfect government of God.<a name=433:8></a> Carrying out the function of a shepherd would involve suffering and self-denial, but the unfading crown of glory is at the end.<a name=433:9></a> This is a timely word for those who are older amongst us; their normal occupation should be in looking after the younger, and the saints generally, and at the same time being models for the flock.<a name=433:10></a> This "exercising oversight, not by necessity", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:2">1 Peter  5:2</a> would mean not doing it as if you are paid for doing it; it is doing it readily, your heart being in it.<a name=433:11></a> "The flock of God" is not a local company, but what is general.<a name=433:12></a> Peter is dealing with the house of God, and love must be behind our activities, love going out to every one of the whole flock of God.<a name=433:13></a> Paul says, "There will come in amongst you after my departure grievous wolves, not sparing

		It is an important principle in the ways of God that eldership is worked out in a parental way; God Himself is seen in the elders, or fathers: "The glory of children are their fathers" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#17:6">Proverbs  17:6</a>; the fathers have brought in and expressed what God is in the parental care of His children, so that the elder brethren are their glory.<a name=434:6></a> This should be seen in the way in which the younger ones are influenced and take character from what they see in the elders.<a name=434:7></a> The divine thought is passed on from generation to generation, doubtless, in that way.<a name=434:8></a>

		The thought of subjection being introduced here is noteworthy.<a name=434:9></a> The young man, Joshua, was Moses' attendant; Elisha, another young man, poured water upon the hands of Elijah; and in due time they fill responsible positions in the testimony.<a name=434:10></a> The young man Joshua was envious for Moses at the time when Jehovah took of the Spirit which was upon Moses and put it upon the seventy elders: "My lord Moses, forbid them!<a name=434:11></a>" he says.<a name=434:12></a> This shows the danger to which a young man is exposed; he is apt to be a partisan.<a name=434:13></a> Moses says to Joshua, "Enviest thou for my sake?<a name=434:14></a> would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, and that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!<a name=434:15></a>" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:24">Numbers  11:24</a> - 29.<a name=434:16></a> That was a desire worthy of an elder.<a name=434:17></a> Moses considered for the welfare of the saints only, whereas Joshua thought of Moses only, which is always partisan where a state

		On the other hand, there is need that the elder brethren encourage and make room for the younger, so that they may not get discouraged; but here, it is not exactly a matter of gifts or ministry, it is taking the oversight, shepherding the flock of God.<a name=435:12></a>

		"The unfading crown of glory" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:4">1 Peter  5:4</a> is put before the shepherds for encouragement as an object of reward, and would be received at the appearing of the chief Shepherd, who knows to whom to give it.<a name=436:8></a> Evidently there must be correspondence between the shepherds and Himself in suffering endured in their care for the saints.<a name=436:9></a> The great Shepherd of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13">Hebrews  13</a>is more personal to Christ, as distinguishing Him in supremacy and skill.<a name=436:10></a> The chief Shepherd is more relative to under-shepherds.<a name=436:11></a>
