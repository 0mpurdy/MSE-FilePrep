		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> I thought that the passages in the Canticles illustrate somewhat the passages in the New Testament.<a name=1:2></a> The verses in Romans point to the leading of the Spirit, and involve the action of the Spirit as we come together in assembly; so that the assembly is seen moving, so to speak, in her own power, the Spirit being the power, but viewed as in herself.<a name=1:3></a> Then Colossians points to Christ leading, answering to the second scripture read in the Canticles; she comes up leaning upon her beloved.<a name=1:4></a> The passage in Colossians says in the new man "Christ is everything": He is everything.<a name=1:5></a> We reach a point where we are, as it were, full; that we are, for the moment, shut up to Him.<a name=1:6></a> Scope is to be given for the working out of this in assembly service.<a name=1:7></a> So that the idea of His leading comes in, for if He is everything, He is also a leader.<a name=1:8></a> It has often been observed that Colossians scarcely notices the Spirit.<a name=1:9></a> It does notice and mention the Spirit -- "your love in the Spirit", (chapter 1: 8), but Christ, who is everything, is what is in mind.<a name=1:10></a> Romans makes a great deal of the Spirit.<a name=1:11></a> In chapter 5: 5 we have Him shedding abroad in our hearts; in chapter 8 He is mentioned; indeed it is remarkable how frequently He is mentioned in that chapter, having in mind that it is the state of the saints.<a name=1:12></a> The state of the saints is to be marked by spirituality, the Spirit having His place.<a name=1:13></a>

		If the brethren have followed my remarks, perhaps we might proceed, beginning with the passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, and linking it on with <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#3">Song of Songs  3</a>, where the feminine personage in the song is seen coming up out of the wilderness, without any external support

		mentioned, but fully furnished so far as it goes.<a name=2:1></a> The passage would correspond in the types with <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, where instead of the tabernacle being the direct guidance, the Spirit is guiding and leading; the Spirit is fully recognised, so that they move on steadily from point to point, no longer wandering in the wilderness.<a name=2:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=2:3></a>H.<a name=2:4></a> "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>.<a name=2:5></a> How would you bring that in in the wilderness?<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:7></a> Well, that comes in after <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>in the types, forming a junction with the ark in the book of Joshua, and with Colossians in the antitype.<a name=2:8></a> Sonship proper belongs to the land, but the Spirit of it comes in in the wilderness, I think.<a name=2:9></a> But the Spirit is to be understood before the passage read in Romans; it is to be understood in chapter 5 and, indeed, in the early part of chapter 8.<a name=2:10></a> The question is the state of the saints.<a name=2:11></a>

		R.A.<a name=2:12></a>L.<a name=2:13></a> We sing in the fourth hymn, 'Now with love's treasure our spirits are freighted'.<a name=2:15></a><a name=2:14></a> (<a href=".<a name=2:16></a>.<a name=2:17></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=2:18></a>htm#4:2">Hymn 4</a>) Does that suggest the work of the Spirit in our souls in the power in which we begin the morning meeting?<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:20></a> Quite so.<a name=2:21></a> Our spirits are freighted with it.<a name=2:22></a> It is a question of the state of the saints, for the early part of the assembly service is left as our part.<a name=2:23></a> We come together to do something, but it is in the power of the Spirit.<a name=2:24></a> We are never seen other than in the power of the Spirit.<a name=2:25></a>

		E.P.<a name=2:26></a> You speak of the people no longer being guided by the tabernacle after <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=2:27></a> Would you mind saying a little more about that?<a name=2:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:29></a> Well, the tabernacle from the time it was anointed, when the glory entered, was to be a guide.<a name=2:30></a> The movements of the people were determined by its movements.<a name=2:31></a> You will remember that at the end of Exodus, the people were to move as the tabernacle moved.<a name=2:32></a> "And the cloud covered the tent of meeting,

		and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.<a name=3:1></a> And Moses could not enter into the tent of meeting, for the cloud abode on it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.<a name=3:2></a> And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel journeyed in all their journeys.<a name=3:3></a> And if the cloud were not taken up, then they did not journey until the day that it was taken up.<a name=3:4></a> For the cloud of Jehovah was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#40:34">Exodus  40:34</a> - 38.<a name=3:5></a> It points to what is presented to us objectively in the way of instruction and assembly formation.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.P.<a name=3:7></a> Would it correspond at all to the Lord being present here on earth, then leaving the disciples dependent on the Spirit?<a name=3:8></a> I was thinking of the disciples in the Acts being left, the Lord having established them in a way, and then leaving them.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:10></a> Going up, you mean?<a name=3:11></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=3:12></a> Therefore, henceforth all would hinge on what transpired in the way of assembly formation, and in the way of devotion to what we get at Pentecost as, for instance, chapter 10.<a name=3:13></a> Right through the Acts the saints were governed by the movement of the testimony.<a name=3:14></a> Of course, Numbers brings that out more than Exodus.<a name=3:15></a> Exodus gives us the general idea, the glory being in the tabernacle.<a name=3:16></a> The guidance was in that connection.<a name=3:17></a> Numbers gives us more detail as to the taking down of the tabernacle, and its being carried and set up again, involving movement and change of encampments.<a name=3:18></a> There were a great many encampments.<a name=3:19></a> Each encampment had in mind some thought, and the people were to observe it.<a name=3:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=3:21></a>H.<a name=3:22></a> Would you say the pillars of smoke were connected with the encampments?<a name=3:23></a>

		G.M.<a name=4:3></a> And there would be constant exercise.<a name=4:4></a> The smoke would speak of that.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:6></a> Yes.<a name=4:7></a> I suppose it would suggest sacrifice, that is out of love, Godward, so that Romans begins with God's love shed abroad in our hearts; and then in chapter 8 it contemplates our love for God -- "all things work together for good to those who love God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a>.<a name=4:8></a> I think the pillars of smoke would indicate the love they had for God, and the sacrifices they offered.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:10></a>M.<a name=4:11></a> It would be the Spirit's comment on it -- in the Song of Songs, the section that we read; and then that section from verses 6 to 11 does not exactly form part of the conversation between the king and the bride; it was rather a sort of commentary by the Spirit.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> It is a view -- something contemplated, as looking at the movements.<a name=4:14></a> "Who is this?<a name=4:15></a>" It is a question asked.<a name=4:16></a> "Who is this, she that cometh up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?<a name=4:17></a>" She is described.<a name=4:18></a> Who is she?<a name=4:19></a> Her history, of course, is in Egypt, and were we to go by the prophets, we would say she has been sinning all the time, from the time she was in Egypt, but as she is identified with the Spirit of God, who is there with her, there was this view.<a name=4:20></a> She is coming up out of the wilderness, and there is no external support.<a name=4:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses is not in evidence; he was earlier.<a name=4:22></a> It is more the power that is within in the type.<a name=4:23></a>

		S.McC.<a name=4:24></a> Would this view, these graces, suggest what is acquired rather than what is put upon her?<a name=4:25></a>

		allude to what is very creditable.<a name=5:1></a> You might say it somewhat corresponds with Balaam's view.<a name=5:2></a> He saw them in a somewhat similar sense.<a name=5:3></a> There was nothing discreditable; everything was creditable.<a name=5:4></a> God caused him to see her.<a name=5:5></a> He is a man who has his eyes opened -- not an ordinary man, but a man with his eyes opened, seeing the vision of the Almighty; that is, seeing things as God sees them.<a name=5:6></a> God is entitled to look at us abstractly; that is, taking account only of what is of Himself in us.<a name=5:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=5:8></a>D.<a name=5:9></a> Would you link this abstract view on with the first part of the morning meeting?<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:11></a> I think we might see that, the place the Spirit has, which is part of the position.<a name=5:12></a> It is not external, although the anointing is external.<a name=5:13></a> It is more the view of <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>; they had drunk and moved immediately, and steadily from point to point in the right direction.<a name=5:14></a> I think that is what we ought to keep in mind, so that all these figures here -- this smoke -- as we come out of our houses in the morning to approach the assembly, these features are to be seen.<a name=5:15></a> They are seen, of course, concretely as we sit down together in assembly.<a name=5:16></a> God is entitled to look at us in that way, what we are in relation to the Spirit.<a name=5:17></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>enlarges on what the Spirit is in us.<a name=5:18></a> First we have the righteous requirement of the law fulfilled, and then the mind of the Spirit is life and peace; and several others -- some dozen references to the Spirit in the chapter all pointing to a state that is in keeping with the first verses, that God has condemned sin in the flesh; that it is out of sight, that it is viewed as ignored.<a name=5:19></a> It is the Spirit now, and these marks are, therefore, the result of the Spirit.<a name=5:20></a> First, I think, is unselfishness or love for God in the volume of sacrifices, the smoke of the sacrifices.<a name=5:21></a> The church is characteristically sacrificial.<a name=5:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>is viewed as sacrificial by John the baptist, and as He walked, He is viewed also sacrificially,

		C.A.<a name=6:4></a>M.<a name=6:5></a> After <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>and after Balaam's vision comes that special household burnt-offering, morning and evening.<a name=6:6></a> They did not have that before, I suppose.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:8></a> No, that comes in in chapter 28, quite so.<a name=6:9></a> First we have, after the brazen serpent and the springing well, the steady movement of the people towards the land and Balaam's view, as if God would give us a right view so that we might look at them abstractly.<a name=6:10></a> Moses in Deuteronomy looks at them in that way.<a name=6:11></a> Moses does what God is entitled to do, to look at us entirely according to what the Spirit has effected in us.<a name=6:12></a> Well, if we sit down in the assembly, God would help us to view things abstractly.<a name=6:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=6:14></a>D.<a name=6:15></a> It would be a wonderful release to the work of God amongst us.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:17></a> That is just what it will be.<a name=6:18></a> John's epistle helps us, too, but Balaam has no desire to justify the people, but he is prepared to do it as one who has his eyes open, who had a vision of the Almighty.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=6:20></a> Would it be helpful to bring in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#24:1">Numbers  24:1</a> - 5, "And Balaam saw that it was good in the sight of Jehovah to bless Israel, and he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.<a name=6:21></a> And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling in tents according to his tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.<a name=6:22></a> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, and the man of opened eye saith, He saith, who heareth the words of God, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, who falleth down, and who hath his eyes open: How goodly are thy tents, Jacob, and thy tabernacles, Israel!<a name=6:23></a>"
	</div>

		J.T.<a name=6:24></a> Quite so.<a name=6:25></a> There is a reference there, perhaps we might look at it a moment in chapter 24: 4, he

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=7:5></a> The devil seems to be very active in the morning meeting.<a name=7:6></a> Our minds are often very wandering, and thus totally unworthy of the occasion.<a name=7:7></a> Is this required on that account?<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:9></a> Quite so, there is not one but would admit that.<a name=7:10></a> We need the power of God to fix our minds first of all on the order and beauty of Israel, and then on Christ as we see Him in Colossians.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=7:12></a> Is that why the leading is looked at in an individual way -- "as many as are led"?<a name=7:13></a> We need to come to this thought on an individual platform.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:15></a> Well, I suppose so.<a name=7:16></a> We have already had it intimated that sonship comes in late in the service of the assembly, but it is only to make a link with the Spirit; for the Spirit's action begins in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, and has considerable authority before we come to chapter 8: 14.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=7:18></a>M.<a name=7:19></a> This matter of the order of the saints and having a sense of how wonderful it is, is all taken for granted as we go on to Colossians; although I suppose Paul was dependent on the information from Epaphras, he realised what was existent in Colosse.<a name=7:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:26></a> I think that is the link.<a name=7:27></a> It links on with Romans and Corinthians.<a name=7:28></a> Corinthians, of course, is the orderly setting, so that Romans and Corinthians enter into Balaam's prophecy.<a name=7:29></a> It is a wilderness scene.<a name=7:30></a> Balaam comments on the order, like cedars by the waters, like aloes of the Lord's planting.<a name=7:31></a>

		J.T.<a name=52:1></a> We have to consider the work and service of persons without formal commissions.<a name=52:2></a> Pursuing the book of the Acts, we find Peter finishing his testimony in the opening of the door to the gentiles, the door of the kingdom, in which he did well; but he had to be prepared for it specially by heaven, reminding us that if any work opens up to us different from what we have been engaged in, we need to be particularly concerned that we get the mind of God.<a name=52:3></a> So that Peter has a vision, a remarkable experience according to chapter 10, and is qualified, fitted, and set at liberty to do the special work, and this great work opens up to him.<a name=52:4></a> At the end of chapter 9 he sets before us a principle, that if we are to be spiritually in the service of God we are not to be out of accord with the change-over in the character of the service.<a name=52:5></a>

		Paul's conversion implied that the Lord had in mind that he was to do a great work, as an elect vessel, that the assembly should be brought into evidence, and that the economy should work out in localities, not in a central or metropolitan position, but in localities throughout the world.<a name=52:6></a> Before the truth given to Paul is developed, but after he is converted, Peter seems to sense by the Spirit what is coming in and is ready for it, so he goes through all quarters in chapter 9: 32, "Now it came to pass that Peter, passing through all quarters, descended also to the saints who inhabited Lydda".<a name=52:7></a> That is a great principle in local matters.<a name=52:8></a> The thing has to be done by the persons there.<a name=52:9></a> Then secondly, raising Tabitha, he "presented her living": there is a sense in the locality of responsibility to do things for God.<a name=52:10></a> On the other hand, they are done in a living way, not in

		Then, as I said, we now have to look at service by persons who are nondescript, but still very successful service, first in Stephen and Philip; and then in chapter 11 we are told, "They then who had been scattered abroad through the tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen, passed through the country of Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone.<a name=53:4></a> But there were certain of them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who entering into Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, announcing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus.<a name=53:5></a> And the Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord" (verses 19 - 21).<a name=53:6></a> So that we see in this section, beginning with the end of chapter 6, how persons without formal commissions may serve and serve effectually, so that their work is taken account of, and is in entire keeping with the spirit of the moment, with the spirit of Paul's ministry, before Paul's ministry came out.<a name=53:7></a> It would mean that they were spiritual persons who walked in the Spirit and lived in the Spirit, as we are told to do.<a name=53:8></a> So that first of all we should consider Stephen and Philip, then in general the scattered saints, and then Barnabas and Saul.<a name=53:9></a>

		WALKING IN THE WAY

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak about the way; particularly at the outset in regard to this voice the prophet heard behind him: "This is the way, walk ye in it".<a name=82:1></a> And in referring to the way one is bound to introduce John's gospel, which is the beginning, we may say, of every divine subject.<a name=82:2></a> It presents Christ in the beginning.<a name=82:3></a> "In the beginning was the Word", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>.<a name=82:4></a> It directs everything and gives character to everything.<a name=82:5></a> "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being" (verse 3).<a name=82:6></a> And so, with regard to the great variety of divine subjects, touching each we have to begin with Christ, and as I said, with John's presentation of Him.<a name=82:7></a> In that presentation of Him we have Christ saying, "I am the way", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a>.<a name=82:8></a> Just this afternoon one was impressed with the thought of how many things Jesus is said to be in John's gospel.<a name=82:9></a> So that you can understand the exuberance of one who carried the message of Jesus to one sitting under his fig tree.<a name=82:10></a> Philip says, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:45">John  1:45</a>.<a name=82:11></a> And so Nathanael names Him and adds to the already great and glorious list of the titles which <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>affords; the titles of Jesus.<a name=82:12></a> It is a most luminous chapter in that sense; radiant with the divine glories shining in Jesus.<a name=82:13></a> The baptist calls attention to them, as one after another who is drawn to Jesus says something about Him.<a name=82:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it is that every one of us, as drawn to Jesus, is to add to the glories already there.<a name=82:15></a> Nathanael says, "Rabbi, <i>thou</i> art the Son of God, <i>thou</i> art the King of Israel" (verse 49).<a name=82:16></a> That is the thought just now; to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		go over the ground of how many instances of that kind there are; and what is it but to draw us into the realm of His influence and glory?<a name=83:1></a> Not to detract from that glory, but to add to it.<a name=83:2></a> So you see a poor outcast woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>; how she added to that glory!<a name=83:3></a> She says, "Is not <i>he</i> the Christ?<a name=83:4></a>" (verse 30).<a name=83:5></a> He told her He was; I do not know that He told anybody else; but He told her.<a name=83:6></a> It is most unexpected that she should be selected for that message.<a name=83:7></a> "I who speak to thee am he" (verse 26).<a name=83:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And again, He discloses Himself to another outcast in chapter 9 as the Son of God.<a name=83:9></a> "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is <i>he</i>" (verse 37).<a name=83:10></a> He was the Son of God; and as regards the way, He is it.<a name=83:11></a> There are many other things that Christ is said to be; but He is the way.<a name=83:12></a> It is not that He shows it, but He is it.<a name=83:13></a> The idea in John is to draw us to Christ personally, each of us in a personal way, to be drawn out of the darkness into the light of Christ; so that we might see that whatever it is that concerns us, that exercises our souls, will find a solution.<a name=83:14></a> The light will shine for us there.<a name=83:15></a> So that Martha says to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day".<a name=83:16></a> But the Lord says, "I am the resurrection and the life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:25">John  11:25</a>.<a name=83:17></a> It is not 'I shall be' but "I am".<a name=83:18></a> So that John would suggest to us, and impress us, that we must be in Christ in our spiritual history.<a name=83:19></a> We, as alongside of Philip, have found Him.<a name=83:20></a> And so He says to Philip later, "Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip?<a name=83:21></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:9">John  14:9</a>.<a name=83:22></a> This was said because Jesus had said to Philip, "I am the way" (verse 6), and Philip had said, "Lord, shew us the Father".<a name=83:23></a> He would have the Father shown, but the Lord says, "Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip?<a name=83:24></a> He that has seen me has seen the Father".<a name=83:25></a> He is taken out from amongst his fellow-apostles and brethren; he is just put out,

		as it were, by himself and attention is called to him; he did not know something that he ought to have known.<a name=84:1></a> How many of us can stand such a test as that?<a name=84:2></a> How much we should know that we have not known, and do not know!<a name=84:3></a> And the Lord would, from time to time, call attention to us.<a name=84:4></a> We may think we are going on well; but, it may be in a Bible-reading or in an address that one discloses unexpectedly to himself his ignorance; and it is inexcusable.<a name=84:5></a> "Am I so long a time with you, and thou halt not known me, Philip?<a name=84:6></a> He that has seen me has seen the Father".<a name=84:7></a> The Father was there; it was not the Person of the Father that was the point; but all the holy traits and features of the Father were there; they were visibly there so as to be known.<a name=84:8></a> So that the Lord could say, "He that has seen me has seen the Father".<a name=84:9></a> There are two Persons; but one Person, the Father, is perfectly portrayed in the Son.<a name=84:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well then, I am speaking about the way.<a name=84:11></a> The Lord says, "I am the way".<a name=84:12></a> So that John would have us begin with that if we seek to be in the way.<a name=84:13></a> So I go on to Isaiah, to point out this verse I read.<a name=84:14></a> It really means that whether turning to the right hand or to the left you hear a voice saying, "This is the way".<a name=84:15></a> This is important because it calls attention to what is practically visible, knowable, an existent thing.<a name=84:16></a> So that no one should be in the dark; no one should be in a bypath or in a blind alley: "This is the way".<a name=84:17></a> There is such a thing as that.<a name=84:18></a> John calls attention to practical things, knowable things, concrete things that are to be seen and heard and felt.<a name=84:19></a> It is a principle with him; that which we have seen, that which we have heard, that which our hands have handled, etc.<a name=84:20></a>; that which was from the beginning.<a name=84:21></a> That -- the thing.<a name=84:22></a> Palpable things were in a Man.<a name=84:23></a> And amongst the things is the way.<a name=84:24></a> <i>He</i> is the way.<a name=84:25></a>

		Now we are told that the disciples went down to the sea.<a name=92:18></a> The Lord, as it says in verse 15, "knowing that they were going to come and seize him, that they might make him king, departed again to the mountain himself alone".<a name=92:19></a> That is what He did.<a name=92:20></a> He did that properly.<a name=92:21></a> Every movement is perfect.<a name=92:22></a> He was going up to pray according to another gospel.<a name=92:23></a> Let the Lord take His way.<a name=92:24></a> Doubtless the disciples felt that He was not with them; but it says, "But when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea, and having gone on board ship, they went over the sea to Capernaum" (verses 16, 17).<a name=92:25></a> They had something in their minds.<a name=92:26></a> What they had in their minds was evidently according to the mind of Christ; and

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak a little about pillars, or in other words, conspicuousness in the things of God.<a name=96:1></a> It is the divine thought that there should be persons of distinction in the divine realm as there are in man's realm.<a name=96:2></a> They mark man's realm in a striking manner, as we know.<a name=96:3></a> The desire for distinction amongst his fellows marks, I may say, all men as they are in this world.<a name=96:4></a> And, of course, there is much distinction in the different sub-divisions of the world.<a name=96:5></a> There is room for distinction.<a name=96:6></a> We find, too, that the offices or places of distinction are usually well filled.<a name=96:7></a> And this comes into view in the final issue between God and this world.<a name=96:8></a> In one respect the issue is closed, for the Lord Jesus says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:31">John  12:31</a>.<a name=96:9></a> That "now" runs on, but it contemplated finality as to the issue between God and the world.<a name=96:10></a> Much detail has to be worked out; different phases of the working of sin have appeared since the cross; but the cross was final.<a name=96:11></a> Everything came to light there.<a name=96:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in working out the detail we find, for instance, seven thousand names of men; names!<a name=96:13></a> They came in for special judgment according to the book of Revelation, which is the book of finality in detail.<a name=96:14></a> So that God takes account of men in their distinction or distinctions.<a name=96:15></a> Seven thousand names would indicate a large number.<a name=96:16></a> I suppose it is symbolic, as is "seven" in Revelation, and therefore would contemplate a large number.<a name=96:17></a> They were slain, it says; as if such men came in for special notice in the retributive dealings of God.<a name=96:18></a>

		These names may include religious distinctions; for the world has its religion, and we do well to take notice that the names and distinctions acquired in the so-called world of religion are on the same footing.<a name=97:1></a> There is that kind of religion that is free from such names: "Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world", <a href="../bible/James.htm#1:27">James  1:27</a>.<a name=97:2></a> That religion admits of no such names as have come under the judgment of God specifically.<a name=97:3></a> These seven thousand names clearly allude to what the world is characteristically in its distinction.<a name=97:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We know how that developed.<a name=97:5></a> Indeed, the suggestion of the devil to Eve, and put into Adam's heart, was to make men equal with God: "ye will be as God", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:5">Genesis  3:5</a>.<a name=97:6></a> That would be distinction developed in this world by the promptings of the devil, by the help of the devil.<a name=97:7></a> For the devil does help men who lay themselves out to be characteristic men of this world.<a name=97:8></a> So we find Cain and his world, men of distinction.<a name=97:9></a> Coming down to the political side we find the Nimrods, and myriads of others since, existing today.<a name=97:10></a> And no doubt, what is prevalent today is in the mind of God particularly in the book of Revelation in the seven thousand names of men slain.<a name=97:11></a>

		So that, dear brethren, the Lord, I am sure, would speak to us as to this, that we may see the kind of distinction that belongs to the divine realm.<a name=98:3></a> I am not now speaking of what we shall be, but of the distinction that is now.<a name=98:4></a> We do not know exactly what the distinction will be then, but we do know we shall be like Jesus.<a name=98:5></a> That is a precious thought "and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:2">1 John  3:2</a>.<a name=98:6></a> And what is involved in that is an eternal weight of glory -- a remarkable expression -- "an eternal weight of glory".<a name=98:7></a> It grows out of our light affliction, as the apostle says.<a name=98:8></a> Affliction is the order of the day; suffering is the order of the day for the followers of Jesus.<a name=98:9></a> "For our momentary and light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:17">2 Corinthians  4:17</a>.<a name=98:10></a>

		And so it is in this connection that we get the twelve pillars; persons brought under the power of the covenant of God, disallowing the flesh as profiting nothing, and professing, as they did, to obey everything that God had said.<a name=104:4></a> Moses read to them all that God had commanded, and they professed to accept His word and obey.<a name=104:5></a> That was the ground they took.<a name=104:6></a> God always accepts us on our profession.<a name=104:7></a> History will show how real we are.<a name=104:8></a> We may not be real, as in their case, but still they were accepted on their profession; as if Moses were to say, I can well afford to build twelve pillars for there is plenty of material; all Israel is going to be obedient.<a name=104:9></a> And it is on that principle that we are made conspicuous in the service of God.<a name=104:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		INAUGURATING CHRISTIANITY

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=110:1></a> My thought in turning to these verses, which I hope will be enlarged on, is that they speak of inaugurating christianity, so to say, they speak much of doing.<a name=110:2></a> It is not a book of precepts but rather of practices or doings, and the eunuch furnishes a good beginning.<a name=110:3></a> He is only that -- he is only an example of those who, as coming into the truth, are on the line of doing; if a certain thing was to be done, why should he be hindered?<a name=110:4></a> If it is clear that I should have a certain part and the doing of it is not marking me, why so?<a name=110:5></a> The word here is "What hinders my being baptised?<a name=110:6></a>" It has been remarked this runs through the book; the book opens indeed with the statement that Luke makes: "The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach".<a name=110:7></a> So the doing is in mind: teaching, too, but doing and the spirit of that is implied to be amongst those who have the Spirit of God; and if there is that which I should have part in, what is hindering?<a name=110:8></a> If I should be doing something and am not doing it, why?<a name=110:9></a> The Lord in converting Paul according to chapter 9 takes the lead in suggesting this to the convert, telling him without his asking, according to the better version.<a name=110:10></a> The idea of Paul's asking is not stated in chapter 9, but the Lord has in mind that he would have part in the economy he was brought into, and he would be told what to do and he would be doing something; and a later account says he asked the Lord what he should do.<a name=110:11></a> As I said, this thought is found running through the book, and evidently it is intended to lay hold of us that christianity involves mutual feeling and mutual service.<a name=110:12></a> That is what I was thinking, and I just suggested these few verses because they present the thought clearly.<a name=110:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=111:9></a> Well, it would indeed; it is underlying it.<a name=111:10></a> The desire for gift is alluded to there, but this way that you allude to is the thing that underlies all service -- that is love -- and on that basic position the Lord furnishes what is needed; and the way of ability follows on that.<a name=111:11></a> So that every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ; and there are special gifts so that the service should go on, and why should anyone exempt himself and be out of it; and if anyone is out of it, why should he not ask himself the question, what is hindering?<a name=111:12></a>

		Then in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#26">Genesis  26</a>Isaac, the type of a believer in the position of testimony, is concerned about wells as it is essential to him in testimony, and we see how, although there was contention for the wells, he found one for which there was no contention.<a name=171:12></a> Then he comes to Beer-sheba and his servants came and told him they had found water; "And he called it Shebah therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#26:33">Genesis  26:33</a>), which would mean the place of God's faithfulness.<a name=171:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=188:1></a> These scriptures teach us how to draw near to God.<a name=188:2></a> That is why they have been suggested.<a name=188:3></a> Indeed the epistle in a general way has this particularly in mind, for it is addressed to believers who are on comparatively low ground spiritually, and some indeed are in retrogression -- indeed have retrograded, so that the need was stimulation to go forward, not to draw back.<a name=188:4></a> So we have stress laid on promises and covenants; unbelievers maybe, believers of small stature, all, of course, need these special features.<a name=188:5></a> God is pleased to come down to us and swear to us and promise us -- furnish us with promises and even with the covenants so that we might be assured, and thus go forward.<a name=188:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another element that is stressed, as most of us know here, is the position of Christ as High Priest above.<a name=188:7></a> As is said in chapter 4: 14, "Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.<a name=188:8></a> For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart.<a name=188:9></a> Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help" (verses 14 - 16).<a name=188:10></a> It is thought that the two scriptures read will furnish us with a sufficient basis for profitable conversation as to drawing near to God.<a name=188:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=189:6></a> Well, that is the way Scripture puts these facts.<a name=189:7></a> Were Abraham an Ephesian christian, so to speak, as one would hope some of us here are, he would hardly need an oath.<a name=189:8></a> That is, if we really know God, we do not need an oath, nor even a covenant, but God took account of Abraham's condition, and confirmed the promise by an oath.<a name=189:9></a> So that, as it is said, we might have a strong consolation or encouragement, and He has engaged Himself to certain things, by promise and by oath.<a name=189:10></a> It is said that it is impossible for Him to lie in any way, without the promise or the oath, but He condescends to promise things to us and to swear to us that the promise will be fulfilled, so as to assure us, taking account of our feebleness of faith and confidence.<a name=189:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=190:16></a> Well, just so.<a name=190:17></a> We are told in chapter 13, that we are to serve.<a name=190:18></a> "We have an altar .<a name=190:19></a>.<a name=190:20></a>.<a name=190:21></a> therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach .<a name=190:22></a>.<a name=190:23></a>.<a name=190:24></a> .<a name=190:25></a> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of the lips confessing his name", chapter 13: 10 - 15.<a name=190:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the practical injunction to us, to carry on the sacrifice of praise, confessing His name, but these instructions are essential to have so that we are at liberty, our footing is inside.<a name=190:27></a> The intervening scriptures, that is chapters 7, 8 and 9 and part of 10, are to establish us on this footing, inside the veil.<a name=190:28></a> We have access, boldness of access, to enter the holiest.<a name=190:29></a>

		J.T.<a name=191:10></a> I am sure that is good.<a name=191:11></a> The passage in the first chapter of Luke shows that the service was being carried on according to the priestly order; the priest himself was unbelieving, as you have noticed.<a name=191:12></a> I am sure there is much of that occurring today among the people of God.<a name=191:13></a> Certain services are proceeding, and even the right order, and hence Gabriel appears on the right of the altar of incense, as much as to say that although the service is going on formally, it is not reaching up to God.<a name=191:14></a> It needs divine help.<a name=191:15></a> So Gabriel, the angel, has to do with the priest afterwards, and tells him that things that he prayed for are about to happen, and the priest does not believe it.<a name=191:16></a> So I suppose the teaching here in our chapters will be what would help us on these lines.<a name=191:17></a> The priest we have seen, like Zacharias, or perhaps like some of us at times in our participation nominally in the service of God -- there is often such unbelief in our hearts, but Hebrews shows that the real Priest is above -- the High Priest, even Jesus -- Jesus the tried One.<a name=191:18></a> Luke fully sets it out, and consequently the disciples are serving in the temple, praising and blessing God.<a name=191:19></a> I am thankful you brought those two scriptures up.<a name=191:20></a> As a matter of fact in Luke, even the disciples themselves after all the tuition they had with the Lord and the priestly service on His part, when He came into their midst, after rising from the dead, they were not ready for Him.<a name=191:21></a> They were not ready to serve,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=192:7></a> It is a great general thought taken from the types.<a name=192:8></a> In the types in Exodus -- first, Moses drew near; he brought the people out from the camp to meet God; he had gone up the mount himself, and then he brought the people out of the camp to meet with God.<a name=192:9></a> Well, that was drawing near.<a name=192:10></a> It is really the formula for drawing near to God, because that is the idea, nearness to God.<a name=192:11></a> The psalmist says, "a people near unto him".<a name=192:12></a> Well, Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, but God is very restrictive and urges Moses to see to it that the people do not get beyond the barriers, so that only Moses could draw near, and yet they themselves were nearer than other people.<a name=192:13></a> There were no people on the earth as near to God, though in the very restricted way as they were, but God would accentuate the idea of drawing near by saying to Moses, 'Now you are to go alone'.<a name=192:14></a> Even if a beast goes, it must be slain.<a name=192:15></a> Then presently God says to Moses, 'well, Aaron can come, too, with you', and then thirdly, after considerable instruction (chapters 20, 21, 22 and 23) we are told that Jehovah says to Moses, "Go up to Jehovah, thou and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel", chapter 24: 1.<a name=192:16></a> So that the number drawing near is being extended, and that is the position now.<a name=192:17></a> God would extend it to all His people; and they did, but before they actually ascended together Moses took precautions that the people should be committed thoroughly to the commandments of God, for no one should draw near to God in

		disobedience.<a name=193:1></a> That is a most serious thing to be drawing near professedly, and to be unbelieving, and to be disobedient.<a name=193:2></a> Moses with true mediatorial instinct, reads the divine terms in the book to the people, and the people say, "all the words which the Lord hath said will we do".<a name=193:3></a> Moses accepts that and builds twelve pillars and an altar, and offers sacrifices and sprinkles the blood.<a name=193:4></a> The people, the altar and the book were all sprinkled with blood, which is the point in Hebrews, that there is the full use of the blood in drawing near to God.<a name=193:5></a> We can only draw near through the death of Christ.<a name=193:6></a> So they went up.<a name=193:7></a> That is the principle, that the thought of drawing near is persistent, and is increasingly accentuated.<a name=193:8></a> So that instead of Moses alone, we have Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, four, and seventy others, which would be seventy-four, and Joshua besides -- he is to come with Moses.<a name=193:9></a> They all went up, and they saw the God of Israel and what was under His feet, and they ate and drank before God.<a name=193:10></a> That, I think, is the idea in the types and ought to be very attractive to us, that God has made a way, provided the blood, the blood of Jesus, even sworn to us, covenanted with us, not with us as christians, but with the Hebrew christians.<a name=193:11></a> They are viewed in that light, but in principle that is what it is.<a name=193:12></a> It is God engaging Himself to us in all these matters, and all to the end that we should be free to draw near to Him, not to remain at a distance, but to draw near to God.<a name=193:13></a>

		What I have in mind is to dwell a little on glory Stephen brings to mind the thought of glory, secondly the glory of the Lord and then the glory of the Father, "the excellent glory".<a name=216:1></a> The passage in Peter has been selected because it shows how glory is graded.<a name=216:2></a> The occurrence of the thought of glory in the Scriptures is affecting as we pursue it; God coming out in creation and in redemption, having His glory in mind, and this is to be distributed in vessels -- vessels of glory.<a name=216:3></a> We, as christians, are vessels of mercy fitted for glory, and we are told also that one star differeth from another star in glory; the sun has one glory and the moon has a glory.<a name=216:4></a> These are mere physical things, but still they set out in figure, at least, what is in the mind of God; for the vessels of His glory are those who are selected in mercy and fitted, prepared for glory.<a name=216:5></a> So that there is distribution of the divine glory in selected vessels.<a name=216:6></a> Christ is personally the glory of God, and the assembly is the glory of Christ as the woman is the glory of the man.<a name=216:7></a> There is a wonderful variety of thought in regard of it and the epistle to the Romans, which is foundational, is marked by it; the word that is peculiarly stamped on it is, "Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father": showing how glory entered into that transaction supremely, for it is really a question of love shining out in whatever form it may take, and it is thought that Romans indicates how we are vessels of glory, in that it is said, "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified".<a name=216:8></a> This evidently alludes to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		distribution of the Spirit to us; we are glorified in that respect in a positive way, a tangible glory: the anointing is glorious in a positive, substantial way.<a name=217:1></a> It was thought if we look at Stephen a little we get this exemplified for he, I believe, is intended to represent a vessel of glory.<a name=217:2></a> First in his face, for it says, "And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel", and then in the end of chapter 7 he is seen in moral glory, acting like Christ in his sufferings, and he speaks of seeing the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God; as if only one who is himself glorious is competent to speak of glory.<a name=217:3></a> He begins his address by saying, "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham" and this was in connection with Abraham's movement out of the world into the land of promise.<a name=217:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=217:8></a> That is what I was thinking.<a name=217:9></a> In creative glory we have the sun, moon and stars, each having its own glory: David says, "The heavens declare the glory of God".<a name=217:10></a> So that the thing is there and, obviously, what God has in mind is that it should be seen in us as vessels of glory.<a name=217:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=218:8></a> Well, if we think of the glory of the sun or the glory of the moon or the glory of the stars, I suppose it is assumed that we are intelligent enough to depict what is in our minds in either case.<a name=218:9></a> We look up into the firmament of the heavens at night, what a glory there is; and the sun in the daytime, what a brilliancy of light, what a glory!<a name=218:10></a> God commanded the light to shine out of darkness, but there is no substance mentioned, simply "Let there be light: and there was light".<a name=218:11></a> There is substance in the sun, and so it is said of Jesus, "In him was life; and the life was the light of men".<a name=218:12></a> There is substance behind the light -- it is Christ as Man.<a name=218:13></a> I am speaking now of the sun: how we come to an advance of glory, the life of Christ here below was <i>the light</i>, and that could easily be followed in the wonderful variety of expressions of life in Christ's path here and how every expression was light.<a name=218:14></a> So the glory of God -- the heavens declare the glory of God creatively.<a name=218:15></a> Then we come to redemption glory, this must be seen in what God is: "Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>.<a name=218:16></a> It is a transaction by glory.<a name=218:17></a> You can perceive what a blank there was to Him during the three days in which the Lord Jesus lay in death: what it was to Him, and to heaven and to all spiritual intelligence, but especially to the Father.<a name=218:18></a> It was a question of time; He

		was, as it were, waiting for the moment to arrive, because the Lord was to be three days and nights in death -- there must be a complete period, and God waited for the finish of that and acted.<a name=219:1></a> It would be as if all His affections were active in bending forth, so to speak, to take up the Object of His love out of death: all His affections would be in that; and so, relatively, in every one of us the reflection of glory is in the actings of love.<a name=219:2></a> It is what we are.<a name=219:3></a> It was what God was in a moral way, stepping forth to lift His beloved Son out of death, it was an act of love.<a name=219:4></a> So if we are glorified, as it is said in Romans, it would be the same power operative in us because the gift of the Spirit is glory, and therefore it would be the actings of love, the fruit of the Spirit is love: it is in what we are in the actings of love that the whole scene is lit up with glory in that way.<a name=219:5></a> A great deal more could be said, but this is a sort of general idea of what glory is, I think.<a name=219:6></a>

		Static love is hardly to be counted, for true love is ever active.<a name=318:9></a> So it is introduced among the family of God in an active way, and the intent is that it should be there for ever, increasing as it goes.<a name=318:10></a> We are reminded of it today in this gathering, affording scope for the Spirit of God to stimulate love; without any element of boastfulness one may say that the brethren do love one another.<a name=318:11></a> These special gatherings are intended to be peculiarly well-springs for us.<a name=318:12></a> The enemy would defeat the purpose.<a name=318:13></a> The more spiritual we are, the more we shall be conscious, as drawing near the time of these occasions, that the enemy is active and would rob us of our portion, diverting our minds to other things or irritating us; whatever it would be that would best hinder such occasions, Satan did not fail to present himself with the sons of God as coming up before Jehovah; <a href="../bible/Job.htm#1">Job  1</a>and 2.<a name=318:14></a> "There was a day", it says twice over.<a name=318:15></a> It is literally a definite article, "the day", as if there were fixed periods even then in which sons

		Well now, as I said, this is a great matter, that this threefold testimony as to love in Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob came in among the family of God, and the thing is to continue.<a name=319:15></a> It comes out in Moses; it comes out in David particularly; his name means 'beloved'.<a name=319:16></a> And so it is with Solomon's name; his second name, but the name that should be written in golden letters for eternity, is that Jehovah loved him.<a name=319:17></a> A greater name than that of Solomon is Jedidiah, only mentioned once in the scripture, as far as I know.<a name=319:18></a> What it means is many times found in the Scriptures.<a name=319:19></a> But Jedidiah is to be outstanding.<a name=319:20></a> Its very solitariness makes it outstanding, the name derived from the immediate expression of divine love.<a name=319:21></a>

		I have in mind to speak to young ones here, and I have read this part of the last chapter of Ecclesiastes in view of this.<a name=355:1></a> It addresses young people, but the contents are almost entirely about old people.<a name=355:2></a> I know young people are not particularly concerned or interested in old people.<a name=355:3></a> It is usual that they should seek to get out of the way of old people and get with their own kind, as they think, persons of their own age.<a name=355:4></a> They do not help each other morally.<a name=355:5></a> They had better stay with the old as much as possible.<a name=355:6></a> I say this particularly to young Christians, and there are many here.<a name=355:7></a> Your safety largely lies in keeping with the old, but, as I said, the chapter is addressed to young people, and they are asked to remember their Creator.<a name=355:8></a> The word 'Creator' is in the plural in the passage, as if God would stress His Creatorship, so as to warn the young ones here -- "Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth", and then it proceeds to speak of things before they happen, meaning before you become old, because the things mentioned are the things that belong to old people, and it is because most of us, if we remain here, shall become old.<a name=355:9></a> Every minute increases your age, and correspondingly increases your responsibility to your Creator.<a name=355:10></a> So that, to be as brief as possible, and yet not to omit anything that may be helpful, we have "before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, of which thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them".<a name=355:11></a> That is to say, you are reminded of something that you do not yet experience -- the evil days and the years in which you have no pleasure.<a name=355:12></a> Of course, you say, in my young days I have pleasure, and if I have not I hope to have, and the world is bent on you having pleasure.<a name=355:13></a>

		I am not speaking of that kind of pleasure.<a name=356:1></a> That kind is the pleasures of sin for a season and that is the time of it, but later, "thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them".<a name=356:2></a> You are not saying that yet, and that is why it is put down here thus.<a name=356:3></a> Others are saying it.<a name=356:4></a> Perhaps in this room there are some who are saying, 'I have little or no pleasure in my life; I am full of aches', and I ask you, how old are you?<a name=356:5></a> Well, I remember asking an aboriginal in Australia the question, as he came down from the wilds, how old he was, and he said, 'Many'.<a name=356:6></a> He meant that.<a name=356:7></a> He perhaps did not have language to say more, and so if I were to ask some people here, How old are you?<a name=356:8></a> they would answer, 'Many'.<a name=356:9></a> Well, they have the experiences contemplated here.<a name=356:10></a> That is, the evil days have come, and the years have drawn nigh or have come when they say, "I have no pleasure in them".<a name=356:11></a> And, of course, we look with a measure of compassion on our old people.<a name=356:12></a> I am speaking somewhat of what I know.<a name=356:13></a> I am not so young.<a name=356:14></a> I am older than most here.<a name=356:15></a> 'Many', as I have said, more than most here; but many are here that we would look on with compassion and our compassion is drawn out because they are old, decrepit, with, it may be, poor hearing, poor sight, poor taste, poor digestion, and many other such things, and I am speaking to you young people, because age is creeping on, too, in your case.<a name=356:16></a> You have not felt it yet, but it is coming.<a name=356:17></a> Presently it will be on you, and that is the point of the exhortation here, "Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth", before these things come upon you, "before the evil days come".<a name=356:18></a> And then the writer who, I would say, is Solomon (thank God for Solomon), is called the Preacher and, of course, I am endeavouring to preach, following his way.<a name=356:19></a> Hence what I am reading is his word as the Preacher: Solomon was a preacher.<a name=356:20></a> Nebuchadnezzar was a preacher, and Solomon was; not that he had much age.<a name=356:21></a> I should

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=373:2></a> I have thought of that.<a name=373:3></a> Take, for instance, Samuel, who had a circuit every year, coming to a place at a definite time; and we know from one instance at least that the people trembled at his coming (see <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:4">1 Samuel  16:4</a>).<a name=373:4></a> It would be necessary in some cases.<a name=373:5></a> We ought to be on our guard lest we should not be found in peace and going on in the things of God.<a name=373:6></a> Samuel came every year.<a name=373:7></a> Of course they would expect him, I suppose, he made the rounds, and he would come to them.<a name=373:8></a> So the Lord in the days of His flesh, it is said, "came in and went out among us .<a name=373:9></a>.<a name=373:10></a>.<a name=373:11></a> .<a name=373:12></a> until the day in which he was taken up from us", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>, 22.<a name=373:13></a> He was coming in and going out; and so after He rose from the dead, He came in amongst them and went out.<a name=373:14></a> Also in the gospel of John especially we see how He comes in to us, He does not leave us orphans, comfortless, He comes, not yet for us, but to us.<a name=373:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we see in the history of Paul's ministry that he sent Timothy instead of going himself.<a name=373:16></a> He sent him, but not with a rod, that they might know his ways as they were in Christ; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:17">1 Corinthians  4:17</a>.<a name=373:17></a> So he writes to Timothy himself that, pending his coming, he might know how to conduct himself in the house of God.<a name=373:18></a> So, with the Lord Himself when He comes to institute His supper in the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, the twelve are seen there; not only Himself, but the twelve, those who would care for things in an administrative way.<a name=373:19></a>

		I would like at this time to refer to the thought of transfer from earth to heaven.<a name=384:1></a> The first passage read contemplates the descent, the transfer from heaven to earth, and the angel was in accord with what happened there.<a name=384:2></a> It would presently be the reverse order, indeed it had already begun.<a name=384:3></a> The Lord, having come to earth and remaining here, soon began to think of going up again; hence Luke speaks of the ascent very early in his narrative.<a name=384:4></a> The multitude of the heavenly host was speaking of peace on earth, but that soon became impossible, immediately impossible and hence chapter 19 speaks of "peace in heaven, and glory in the highest", and that was anticipated by the Lord almost from the outset.<a name=384:5></a> He had been here, of course, remaining here as a Babe, as a Boy, as a Man, and serving as never man did, speaking as never man did, working as never man did, but all was in vain immediately in regard of what the angels had said -- not ultimately, but immediately.<a name=384:6></a> Even in chapter 9 we find the Spirit of God saying that the days of His receiving up had come; so the narrative proceeds until He ascends, a cloud receiving Him out of their sight.<a name=384:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=394:7></a> Well, the gospel of Matthew makes much of the house as a place, the Lord is seen so often speaking in houses.<a name=394:8></a> In one place (chapter 9) two blind men followed Him and named Him 'Son of David' asking Him to have mercy on them, but He said nothing to them until He came into the house, they followed Him and He then spoke to them.<a name=394:9></a> Throughout the gospel of Matthew we have the idea of the house and it is intended to work out as the assembly where the Lord's rights are preserved, maintained and asserted.<a name=394:10></a> As stated in chapter 18 the assembly is representative of the Lord as gone into heaven.<a name=394:11></a> And so here.<a name=394:12></a> I mean it only in that sense, the idea of a place.<a name=394:13></a> Here it is called the upper room, but I have used the word 'house' (as a verb) as what represents authority -- such accommodation.<a name=394:14></a> It says, "They returned to

		The links between these scriptures are in Jacob (to say nothing of Joseph or Rachel) and the Corinthian saints, and in turning to them, I have spirituality in mind.<a name=409:1></a> Jacob and the Corinthian saints were primarily possessed of spirituality in principle.<a name=409:2></a> These verses from Genesis would help to show that.<a name=409:3></a> Spirituality was there in principle in Jacob, and it was also in principle among the Corinthian saints when the first letter to Corinth was written.<a name=409:4></a> The epistles to that assembly have in mind that the principle of spirituality was there basically.<a name=409:5></a> The apostle has no doubt about it, but he resorts to abstract statements, and hence the verses I read in the first chapter are abstract; that is to say, the things mentioned were not in the true sense concretely present in them.<a name=409:6></a> For instance, "I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; that in every thing ye are enriched by him".<a name=409:7></a> If we have time, we shall see later that these statements are not concretely true in that assembly; nor are further statements -- "Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you; so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=409:8></a> God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=409:9></a> These verses from four to eight are abstract.<a name=409:10></a>

		SIMPLICITY

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:14">Luke  22:14</a> - 18, 21 - 30; <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:31">John  13:31</a> - 34
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read from these two gospels in order to bring out the idea of simplicity.<a name=421:1></a> Simplicity marked the Lord's relations with His own as here in flesh and He made it plain that it should mark their relations with each other during His absence.<a name=421:2></a> On the mount of transfiguration, as no doubt most here will remember, as the glory scene disappeared He was found alone with them -- the three disciples or apostles whom He had taken up with Him to that glory scene.<a name=421:3></a> It is said, "And suddenly having looked around, they no longer saw any one, but Jesus alone <i>with themselves</i>", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:8">Mark  9:8</a>.<a name=421:4></a> The Lord having returned to His ordinary way -- the lowly Man who could be seen at any time in Jerusalem or Judaea or Galilee, He intended that the simplicity that marked Him should mark them.<a name=421:5></a> That is what is in mind now, dear brethren, that this simplicity should be with us.<a name=421:6></a> It is a product of the Holy Spirit -- but primarily a product of the Lord Jesus.<a name=421:7></a> He is not here, He is gone to heaven, but the Holy Spirit is here -- a divine Person, as the Lord Jesus is a divine Person.<a name=421:8></a> Those who are indwelt by the Holy Spirit are also simple.<a name=421:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I have read from Luke and from John.<a name=421:10></a> The other two gospels are more official, the one alluding to the assembly, for the only gospel that speaks formally of the assembly is Matthew.<a name=421:11></a> His words as to it are unmistakable, they are words of dignity.<a name=421:12></a> Matthew and Mark speak of official dignity in the service of the Lord as here in flesh.<a name=421:13></a> So, the assembly being the point with Matthew, he does not fail to treat of her in her dignity; of the wayward or lawless believer (a lawless person and yet undoubtedly
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=422>[Page 422]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a believer) the Lord said, "If also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer", that is, a person unfit for fellowship.<a name=422:1></a> Mark on the other hand speaks about levitical service and immediately introduces the Son of God.<a name=422:2></a> Again it is a question of the dignity attached to the servants.<a name=422:3></a> They are to be regarded accordingly.<a name=422:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Luke is sympathetic.<a name=422:5></a> He may have been a gentile, very possibly he was, and it is possible too that if he were a converted gentile he would carry the suitable comeliness and lowliness in his walk and ways which would befit an outsider called into the fellowship of God's Son.<a name=422:6></a> Luke is gracious.<a name=422:7></a> He addresses his correspondent, if I may so call Theophilus, with suitable grace and respect.<a name=422:8></a> Theophilus was evidently a man of distinction and hence required to be addressed accordingly.<a name=422:9></a> Luke is the man for that in both cases.<a name=422:10></a> He writes to the same person, and although somewhat less deferentially the second time, yet he says "O Theophilus".<a name=422:11></a> Luke is gracious and gives us a record of the last passover that is very touching.<a name=422:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have in Luke, "And when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him".<a name=422:13></a> The twelve are said to be with the Lord in the gospels as He partook of the last passover, except in John, who does not record that the twelve were with Him.<a name=422:14></a> Luke alone records that they were apostles.<a name=422:15></a> I mention all this, not because I wish to speak of the Lord's supper; I read about the passover in Luke.<a name=422:16></a> I read about the Supper in John, but we are not told what supper it was; we are left to assume that it was a family affair.<a name=422:17></a> That is what I am aiming at -- that we may cling to the family, not the natural, but the spiritual family.<a name=422:18></a> It is very encouraging that, as far as I know, all the Lord's natural relatives were saved, although at first they were very far from it.<a name=422:19></a> It shows how we might be
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=423>[Page 423]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		encouraged to keep an eye on our children, old and young, so that they might be saved.<a name=423:1></a> The Lord would set that example before us.<a name=423:2></a> If we have children or grandchildren or great grandchildren -- some of us have -- we should pray that they all may be saved, for God has no less a thought for our children.<a name=423:3></a> God would accord everything possible to them so as to encourage them in due time to seek salvation.<a name=423:4></a> The salvation of God is sent to the gentiles, and they will receive it.<a name=423:5></a> Why not our children?<a name=423:6></a> They should be the very first to receive it.<a name=423:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of the passover -- the simplicity of it, and the fact that the twelve were there -- is what I have in mind now.<a name=423:8></a> In all these matters that are depicted in the verses read in both gospels the twelve apostles are there.<a name=423:9></a> The point was that the last passover, which developed into the Lord's supper, should be thoroughly accounted for, attested to, and that all should understand what was said and meant, especially that it was a family affair.<a name=423:10></a> Just for the moment I am confining myself to the passover, because that is how the scripture speaks of it: "when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him".<a name=423:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking now of facts relative to these great matters so that we may see how they enter into christianity at the present time.<a name=423:12></a> Other things were said to the Corinthians, very many and great things, but in that section the apostle says, "I have espoused you unto one man", showing that the assembly was in the apostle's mind, and that it was a practical thought.<a name=423:13></a> It was not simply the sisters of the assembly, but the saints of the assembly, brothers and sisters, old and young, were espoused as a chaste virgin to Christ, all pointing to this great fact of the assembly, and how it was in the apostle's mind when he wrote his letter to the Corinthians.<a name=423:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I go back now to the practical bearing of all this,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=424>[Page 424]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that what was said and done was to be attested in the most accurate way.<a name=424:1></a> The twelve in Matthew, Mark and Luke were seen when this last passover was celebrated, out of which the Lord's supper developed.<a name=424:2></a> This would remind us to be accurate in each thought as to it.<a name=424:3></a> The scriptural thoughts relative to this great matter must be clear so that we may be accurate, not only in what we say of it, but in what we say to the Lord in it.<a name=424:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have now one or two further thoughts about the Lord's supper.<a name=424:5></a> The apostle Paul says, "I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:23">1 Corinthians  11:23</a>, 24.<a name=424:6></a> That and what follows as to the cup are the sum total of the actual facts that were delivered to Paul as to the institution and celebration of the Lord's supper.<a name=424:7></a> It is quite plain that it is simple.<a name=424:8></a> Its very simplicity is its charm, and we should not add to it.<a name=424:9></a> We should be content with the word that Paul gives us.<a name=424:10></a> The beautiful word of Paul's, in which he says that he has received from the Lord the things that I have quoted, should suffice in what we say to the Lord in that matter.<a name=424:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now go back to the idea of simplicity and how the matter stood as the Lord said to the apostles that He would eat the passover with them and directed how it was to be brought about, what was to be done, and sent two of them to attend to it.<a name=424:12></a> He told them about the man who would carry the pitcher of water.<a name=424:13></a> And so the passover was to be celebrated.<a name=424:14></a> He had doubtless celebrated the passover every time it came round during His blessed life here, but this was the last time.<a name=424:15></a> I am speaking of it because it involves so much simplicity as to the Lord's life and ways.<a name=424:16></a> "If even we have known

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking of the simplicity that marked Christ.<a name=425:8></a> He places Himself at table and the twelve apostles with Him.<a name=425:9></a> There they are in position as associated with their Master.<a name=425:10></a> The Lord could see at that moment everything that should run down the ages in regard to this matter.<a name=425:11></a> Much controversy has happened and darkness has marked many in the so-called celebration of the Lord's supper; whereas the thing is simple.<a name=425:12></a> Then He says, and it often affects me greatly, "with desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer".<a name=425:13></a> These are His own words, and He meant to convey a family scene.<a name=425:14></a> That family was to be transferred, it was not to disappear, it was to remain and enter a new order of things.<a name=425:15></a> But at that time the Lord Jesus was there and He was expressing His feelings, that He should eat the passover with them before He suffered.<a name=425:16></a> The Lord would say, I want this time with you.<a name=425:17></a> The whole scene is transferred and could only be so by the Spirit.<a name=425:18></a> The Lord went up to heaven and left the eleven here.<a name=425:19></a> Mary is there, other women are there, and the brethren of Christ are there.<a name=425:20></a> Undoubtedly they are all there.<a name=425:21></a> There is evidence that the Lord's own brethren after the flesh were saved and transferred into the new order of things in which we now have part.<a name=425:22></a> In Galatians Paul says, I went up to

		The Lord says, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me".<a name=508:4></a> Beautiful!<a name=508:5></a> "It is my Father who glorifies me".<a name=508:6></a> The Lord was not depending on the Jews' praise, nor is He on ours in that sense.<a name=508:7></a> The Father is abundant in His praise of the Lord Jesus, glorifying the Lord.<a name=508:8></a> "This is my beloved Son", He says, "hear him", and again, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=508:9></a> And so there is abundance of praise for the Lord Jesus by the Father, and that is what He is saying here, and, of course, we might well rest in it, too, and imitate it, understand how to praise the Lord in everything, and again in everything how to give thanks.<a name=508:10></a> And so it goes on, "Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom ye say, He is our God.<a name=508:11></a> And ye know him not".<a name=508:12></a> How the Lord met everything in combat, not hesitating to say the strongest things in support of the truth -- an excellent example for us!<a name=508:13></a> And so He goes on to say, "and if I said, I know him not, I should be like you, a liar".<a name=508:14></a> He does not hesitate to use that strong word in the ears of men who are opposing Him; and again He says, "But I know him, and I keep his word".<a name=508:15></a> How God comes into the chapter!<a name=508:16></a> It is full of Christ, but full of Christ in combat for the truth, 'the Man of the eighth of John'.<a name=508:17></a> It is a question of what He was here in testimony and in contention for the truth.<a name=508:18></a> He goes on further, "Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day".<a name=508:19></a> Now the Lord brings Abraham in; it is not Adam, or Enoch, or Noah -- it is Abraham; it is a question of the man whom God has selected in a fatherly way; that is to say,

		to bring out the idea of generation among the people of God -- the true generation on the ground of the new birth, because that is what John brings forward.<a name=509:1></a> So it says, "The Jews therefore said to him, Thou halt not yet fifty years".<a name=509:2></a> They were challenging Him as to His age, implying that they thought He was nearly fifty years old, as if He was suggestive of that in His appearance.<a name=509:3></a> Our hearts should be touched at such allusions; but then they are the allusions of the world.<a name=509:4></a> They say, "Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham?<a name=509:5></a> Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am".<a name=509:6></a>

		That is my word, dear brethren, and I commend it to you; the testimony of the Lord Jesus here, according to John's gospel -- what it is, what it is in the body of it, this wonderful book, and this wonderful chapter.<a name=509:7></a> And so it may not be wondered at that "they took up therefore stones that they might cast them at him; but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and thus passed on".<a name=509:8></a> So we can well rejoice that He passed on; His hour had not yet come; they could not kill Him till the time came, but He submitted to it when it did come.<a name=509:9></a> He delivered up His spirit; it was His own action.<a name=509:10></a> They did not do it; it was His own action.<a name=509:11></a> We can thank God and rejoice in it.<a name=509:12></a> The Lord Jesus did not have to die, but He did die.<a name=509:13></a> They could not take His life from Him; "no one takes it from me", He says, "but I lay it down of myself".<a name=509:14></a> We glory in this, that they could not take His life from Him, but then it says that they took up stones to cast at Him.<a name=509:15></a> So that it is a time of persecution, and this chapter is to bring out, among other things, how the Lord stood the test of combat for the truth against all comers -- He did not give way for a moment.<a name=509:16></a> So it says, "Jesus hid himself".<a name=509:17></a>
