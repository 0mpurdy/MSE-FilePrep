		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> Luke's gospel starts with a priest in the temple and finishes with a company of priests in the temple.<a name=1:3></a> We are taught in the first chapter that we can go on with the service of God in an outward way and yet at the same time be lacking in faith.<a name=1:4></a> In <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:4">1 Timothy  1:4</a>, it speaks of "God's dispensation, which is in faith".<a name=1:5></a> Luke contemplates exterior order, but obedience to God is absolutely necessary, for we can have outward order according to God and yet be quite lacking in faith.<a name=1:6></a>

		Zacharias fulfils his service "in the order of his course"; he is a true priest according to Aaron's order, and serves according to the prescribed order.<a name=1:7></a> Outside all the multitude of the people were praying, and at the same moment it is evident that Zacharias is lacking in faith.<a name=1:8></a> He had prayed to God to give him a son, and did not believe that God could do it.<a name=1:9></a> We have a similar case in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12">Acts  12</a>, where many were gathered together in Mary's house, praying for the liberation of Peter from prison; then when Peter was delivered and came and knocked at the door of the entry, those who were there did not believe what the maid reported, but said, "Thou art mad".<a name=1:10></a> Elizabeth said, however, referring to Mary, "blessed is she that has believed, for there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from the Lord".<a name=1:11></a> Without faith it is impossible to please God.<a name=1:12></a> All that I am saying now will show what is in my mind, and I hope that the brethren will be free to engage in this important subject.<a name=1:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:5></a> In the epistle to the Hebrews we read that without faith it is impossible to please God.<a name=2:6></a> An onlooker at Jerusalem would have thought that the service was being carried on suitably, but we see that the angel Gabriel appears "standing on the right of the altar of incense".<a name=2:7></a> While God takes account of His people maintaining outward order in His service, He has to intervene so that this service may be carried on in faith.<a name=2:8></a> If our faith is in exercise, we shall be tested as to what we ask God for, and as to what we say to Him, but if our faith is not in exercise, we shall be exposed and perhaps draw upon ourselves the discipline of God.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=2:10></a> Luke the evangelist was "accurately acquainted from the origin with all things"; from the beginning he had understood all the force of the truth.<a name=2:11></a> Sometimes we are content to have a general idea of the truth, but it is necessary to study and understand the details of "all things".<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:13></a> What is particularly to be noted is the intervention of the angel, not simply of any angel, but of the angel Gabriel.<a name=2:14></a> It is a blessed thing to have an angel's visit, but the presence of an angel implies that there is distance between the man and God.<a name=2:15></a> The book of the Revelation is written on that principle.<a name=2:16></a> There is no doubt that the assembly at Ephesus was carrying on a service according to outward order and had the truth, nevertheless the Lord tells her through an angel that He had something against her.<a name=2:17></a> The whole book of the Revelation gives the idea of distance; the Lord is not satisfied with what is there.<a name=2:18></a> Here the fact that an angel appears to Zacharias agrees with this state of affairs; if the people of God are walking in outward order and in faith too, the Lord Himself will come to them.<a name=2:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:7></a> I believe that all this chapter shows that outward order existed, but that the service was not according to faith.<a name=3:8></a> The fact that the angel appeared at the right side of the altar of incense shows that God was going to act in power, the "right side" gives the idea of power, the power of God; He was going to act and He did so.<a name=3:9></a> God had heard the prayers of Zacharias and was about to answer them; meanwhile Zacharias is made dumb because he had not believed.<a name=3:10></a> God takes no pleasure in a priest who has not faith.<a name=3:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:14></a> It is important to see Gabriel standing on the right of the altar of incense.<a name=3:15></a> In our prayers and thanksgivings, we should remember that we are speaking to God; He hears prayers and can answer them, but He has no pleasure in them if not spoken in faith.<a name=3:16></a> Zacharias had not faith, yet he was a true priest, and the discipline through which God passed him was to make a true priest according to God; he is representative of christians lacking in faith in their prayers and thanksgivings.<a name=3:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:4></a> What you say is very important, for Zacharias had the Scriptures and as he read what God had done for Sarah, Rebecca and others, he would have been encouraged to pray with faith.<a name=4:5></a> When we pray we should believe that we shall receive what we are asking for; God loves to answer a prayer of faith.<a name=4:6></a> The angel Gabriel was there to announce that God was about to give an answer, but when the answer was announced, his faith failed.<a name=4:7></a> The power of God is connected with the altar of incense, then, and this comes out in a remarkable way in this first chapter, for Zacharias was dumb until the divine answer had been fully secured.<a name=4:8></a> Elizabeth had part in the discipline of her husband, but she could say, "blessed is she that has believed".<a name=4:9></a> Mary had no doubts when the angel announced to her the birth of the Lord.<a name=4:10></a> The angel here is definitely in touch with the altar of incense, he stood before God, "I am Gabriel, who stand before God", and this was exactly what Zacharias was claiming to do.<a name=4:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> Zacharias and Elizabeth were both found in faith when the child was born; that is shown by the refusal of both of them to recognise things from the natural standpoint, when the moment came for a name to be given to the child.<a name=4:15></a> "Her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her".<a name=4:16></a> Then it says later, "They called it after the name of his father, Zacharias".<a name=4:17></a> The neighbours and relatives were on natural ground, but his mother says, "No; but he shall be called John".<a name=4:18></a> This was the name given by the angel; not only was

		there belief, but there was obedience.<a name=5:1></a> The child was brought in in connection with what was spiritual, he was to be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb, and that could not be expressed by a natural name.<a name=5:2></a> The name given by the angel signified what the child should be.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:4></a> Zacharias did not wish the child to have the same name as himself; in that case he would have had the natural order and character, and would have been lacking in faith like himself.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> To that suggestion Elizabeth says No, a very fine word given by a spiritual sister.<a name=5:7></a> It is very important to be able to say No to what is natural; if the mother can say No to all that every day, her children will be saved.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Elizabeth had learned during the days of discipline that the name of her child was to be 'John'; the end of discipline therefore, is to produce a spiritual state in us each.<a name=5:9></a> If spiritual regulation is maintained in our houses, they will be contributory to the house of God.<a name=5:10></a> What a great contribution Elizabeth was able to make in the person of this child!<a name=5:11></a> His name was given from heaven; the Holy Spirit was to be in him from the beginning, and his mother announces that he was going to be brought up in a spiritual way.<a name=5:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:1></a> For those who were not here yesterday afternoon, it will be good to go back over what occupied us in the first chapter of this gospel.<a name=8:2></a> We noticed that we could carry on the service of God in an outward way and be lacking in faith, as was the case with Zacharias.<a name=8:3></a> He was a priest serving God in the order of his course; he had prayed that God would give him a son, but when God announced to him through the angel that he would have one, he did not believe.<a name=8:4></a> Consequently he had to pass through divine discipline, the end of which was to make him a real priest, in the spiritual sense; when his tongue was loosed, he opened his mouth, and spoke, praising God.<a name=8:5></a> It is sad to see many of our dear brothers in the meetings, dumb like Zacharias.<a name=8:6></a> The divine thought for all believers is that they should be priests "to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a>).<a name=8:7></a> These sacrifices are largely "the fruit of the lips confessing his name", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:15">Hebrews  13:15</a>).<a name=8:8></a> Do all the brothers here in St.<a name=8:9></a> Etienne take part in the meeting?<a name=8:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:13></a> If a priest has power with God, he will certainly have power with men.<a name=8:14></a> It is said of Zacharias first of all that he blessed God ("his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, blessing God") and then he prophesied; the very words of his prophecy are given to us, he said, "Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, because he has visited and wrought redemption for his people, and raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of David his servant".<a name=8:15></a> He is alluding to Christ, and then he speaks to his own son: "And <i>thou</i>, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways; to give knowledge of deliverance to his people

		J.T.<a name=29:1></a> At St.<a name=29:2></a> Etienne we considered the first two chapters of Luke's gospel; I think it will be profitable to consider the following chapters.<a name=29:3></a> What is to be noticed in this period of the life of the Lord Jesus is His long secret history.<a name=29:4></a> The early chapters present Him to us as Babe and young Boy; He is now presented to us as Man.<a name=29:5></a> We have seen that Mary represents the history of the believer's soul in connection with Christ.<a name=29:6></a> She kept all the things said of Him, pondering them in her heart, (chapter 2:19).<a name=29:7></a> She was astonished at what was said of Him; Simeon had told her many things, particularly that a sword would pierce through her own soul, and at the end of the second chapter we read that she kept all these things in her heart, (chapter 2:51).<a name=29:8></a> A certain incident took place when Jesus was twelve years of age, which is given to us, but many other events had taken place which are not mentioned.<a name=29:9></a> All that was, so to say, within the reach of Mary, and she understood it.<a name=29:10></a> Jesus grew under the notice of His mother who pondered in her heart the things said about Him.<a name=29:11></a> She had the opportunity of contemplating the graces which developed in Jesus, and instead of Him having to learn from His mother, it was His mother who learned from Him.<a name=29:12></a> So the development of a believer is in connection with the things which concern Christ; the believer's secret history is bound up with what he sees in Christ.<a name=29:13></a> Mary represents the secret history of the soul; what we learn in secret will be what will shine in us.<a name=29:14></a> At the age of twelve, the Lord could say to His mother, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?<a name=29:15></a>" Our hearts are enlarged when we see that the Lord was occupied in His Father's business.<a name=29:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=100:1></a> We noticed this morning that the house of God is introduced in connection with the believer on his journey.<a name=100:2></a> After the vision of Bethel, spoken of in chapter 28, it says in chapter 29 that Jacob "continued his journey".<a name=100:3></a> Then in verse 16 of our chapter, that "they journeyed from Bethel"; the end of the journey was Hebron.<a name=100:4></a> Chapter 37 marks a fresh stage for Jacob; "Jacob dwelt in the land where his father sojourned -- in the land of Canaan".<a name=100:5></a> An entirely fresh matter develops with Joseph from that point, whereas before chapter 37 it had only spoken of him once or twice.<a name=100:6></a> When Joseph was born, Jacob, it says, proposed to return to Canaan.<a name=100:7></a> "Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my country", that is to say, that Christ appears on the believer's horizon, although in a somewhat weak way.<a name=100:8></a> In chapter 33, Joseph is placed before his mother; "Leah also, with her children, drew near, and they bowed.<a name=100:9></a> And lastly Joseph drew near, and Rachel, and they bowed".<a name=100:10></a> That shows that, while making the journey to Bethel, Christ comes before us in a somewhat feeble way to begin with, but there is an appreciation of what is spiritual above that which is natural.<a name=100:11></a> In God's house, we are not in any way to be on natural lines.<a name=100:12></a>

		The fact that the house is introduced in connection with a man like Jacob shows us the great patience of God, so that we may be brought to God's house.<a name=101:1></a> The Spirit of God does not recount these happenings in order to satisfy our curiosity, but to answer to our affections.<a name=101:2></a> Although we cannot approve of many of the things which Jacob did, the details of them are given as representing what we are in the flesh, or rather we see there a picture of the flesh working in a believer after God has commenced His work in the heart.<a name=101:3></a> The nearer a man is brought to God, the more the flesh in that man is exposed, and it is only by means of the Spirit that we fully learn what we are according to the flesh.<a name=101:4></a> The spirit of a man who bargains is particularly brought out in chapters 28 to 35; Jacob had specified, so to speak, the wages which he wished to have.<a name=101:5></a> He always had that spirit before arriving at Bethel, in chapter 35.<a name=101:6></a> One is never conscious of being in God's house for the pleasure of God, if one is there with the object of receiving wages.<a name=101:7></a>

		We all know that, in the early days of christianity, the saints met together in the houses of believers.<a name=117:3></a> It says in the beginning of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:46">Acts  2:46</a> that they broke bread in the house; that was not one particular house, but they went from house to house.<a name=117:4></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:42">Acts  5:42</a>, that "every day in the temple and in the houses, they ceased not teaching and announcing the glad tidings that Jesus was the Christ".<a name=117:5></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12">Acts  12</a>that there was a prayer meeting in the house of Mary, the mother of John who was surnamed Mark.<a name=117:6></a> Then we have a remarkable allusion in chapter 16, where it says that the Lord opened Lydia's heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul.<a name=117:7></a> She opened her house to the apostle and to those who were with him, saying to them, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there: her house thus became a centre of gathering at Philippi.<a name=117:8></a> It says that after the apostle was released, he went to Lydia's house.<a name=117:9></a> This woman, therefore, whose heart had been opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul, had the great honour of receiving at her table the apostle Paul.<a name=117:10></a> "And having gone out of the prison, they came to Lydia", and there they saw the brethren.<a name=117:11></a> Now it was Luke who wrote the Acts, and we can understand from the allusions made in his gospel to the various houses, that he had seen the use that could be made of these houses.<a name=117:12></a> Matthew mentions them still more frequently, and says that "every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:52">Matthew  13:52</a>).<a name=117:13></a>

		The first house of which Luke speaks is that of Simon: there is nothing to indicate that Simon was converted when the Lord entered his house.<a name=118:1></a> His conversion took place later in his ship.<a name=118:2></a> What took place in his house was the healing of his mother-in-law of her fever: it says that "standing up she served them", so the first house mentioned brings out the principle of service.<a name=118:3></a> The Lord standing over her, rebuked the fever.<a name=118:4></a> Fever gives the idea of agitation, which indicates the state of one who is not satisfied, and whose service is, therefore, impeded.<a name=118:5></a> One who is in this state has need of being served himself.<a name=118:6></a> We ought to serve one another in love, but if we wait for others to serve us, we can be certain that love is not active in us, and this comes from the fact that we are not subject.<a name=118:7></a> The Lord stands over her and cures her of the fever, then being healed, she is conscious of the authority of the Lord, and as it says, standing up she served them.<a name=118:8></a> She had no preference in her service; the most devoted service she owed to the Lord, yet it is not said that she served Him, but that "she served <i>them</i>".<a name=118:9></a> The spirit of love is such that it serves without partiality; we receive all the saints; we ought to wash one another's feet without partiality and without hypocrisy.<a name=118:10></a>

		In chapter 22 we have what is in connection with the truth of the assembly; here it is not only a question of the Lord coming into a house, but too that the passover must be celebrated, and in celebrating that, He institutes the Supper.<a name=121:3></a> It was a very great honour for the master of the house to have such things done in his house; the Lord evidently knew this house, and knew who was the master of it.<a name=121:4></a> The Lord sent Peter and John to make ready the passover, telling them how they were to find the house; He does not tell them the name of the street nor the number of the house, but speaks of a man bearing a pitcher of water who would lead them.<a name=121:5></a> A guide is necessary to enter this house, and a guide bearing refreshment, a pitcher of water; Peter and John were to follow him where he entered.<a name=121:6></a> We have before us not simply an ordinary house and the usual hospitality, but a great and precious spiritual thought; the instruction given about the other houses prepares us to accept this thought.<a name=121:7></a> Salvation must be in this house; the master of it submits immediately to the Lord's wish.<a name=121:8></a> The man bearing the pitcher of water enters a house and shows them a large upper room furnished.<a name=121:9></a> We are not told who was the master of the house; rather a spiritual thought is before us, for we pass now from the believer's house to the house of God.<a name=121:10></a> "The Teacher says to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?<a name=121:11></a> And <i>he</i> will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready".<a name=121:12></a>

		We have to learn this lesson, that natural affections must be given up when they are contrary to the rights of God over us.<a name=124:3></a> God had a claim over those two milch kine, as He has over each one of His creatures; over us He has a much greater claim than over any other creature, in virtue of redemption.<a name=124:4></a> When He calls us therefore, we ought to put aside natural affections; if we refuse to subordinate natural affections to the claims of God, we prove that we are not spiritual.<a name=124:5></a> "The kine went straight forward on the way"; they were not forced to follow that road.<a name=124:6></a> They had simply been tied to the cart, but they went straight forward on the way to Beth-shemesh; they went by the one high way, lowing as they went, feeling they were deprived of their calves.<a name=124:7></a> They went straight forward, on the one high way, lowing at the same time as if to show their renunciation of natural affections on account of the will of God; having arrived at the end of this road, instead of being sent back to their young ones, they had to be offered as a burnt-offering.<a name=124:8></a>

		Such is the way of spirituality: how it shone in our Lord Jesus Christ who without hesitating set aside all the claims of nature in order to fulfil to the very end the will of God!<a name=124:9></a> In His case, it was a question not only of spiritual instincts but of perfect intelligence in all that He was doing; the milch kine, however, represent this side in us, and very often instinct is truer in us than intelligence.<a name=124:10></a> Finally the cows are offered as a burnt offering to God; the wood of the cart is cut up and the cows offered, for in God's service all is made use of.<a name=124:11></a> The levites appear at this point; instinct is mingled with intelligence.<a name=124:12></a> If I walk in the path of the will of God, having true instincts, I can undertake levitical service,

		As following on the observations made this morning in connection with leprosy, I thought that the subject of purification would be useful.<a name=129:1></a> We know what importance the book of Revelation attaches to this subject and how the Lamb is praised by those who are washed in His blood.<a name=129:2></a> In the first chapter, some of them say, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages.<a name=129:3></a> Amen", (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:5">Revelation  1:5</a> - 6).<a name=129:4></a> They appreciate the service rendered to them by our Lord Jesus Christ who had washed them from their sins in His own blood.<a name=129:5></a> Then, in chapter 7:9, it speaks of a great crowd which no one could number; all these, too, in the same way are occupied in praising God and the Lamb.<a name=129:6></a> "These who are clothed with white robes, who are they, and whence came they?<a name=129:7></a>" asked one of the elders, and he replied, "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb", (verses 13,14).<a name=129:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first chapter, it is Christ who had done it, who "has washed us from our sins", He only could do it, as affording the means of purification.<a name=129:9></a> In chapter 7, they have the gain of the means of purification; they had themselves washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<a name=129:10></a>

		"And last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to <i>me</i> also".<a name=169:11></a> This remarkable expression, which refers to the apostle Paul, "as to an abortion", is an allusion to the feeling he had of himself as being nothing.<a name=169:12></a> He continues, "For <i>I</i> am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God".<a name=169:13></a> That shows what was in his mind; he begins with Cephas and ends with the assembly of God, that is what was before him, what was before God.<a name=169:14></a> The body of Christ was on earth and Saul persecuted it.<a name=169:15></a> That is why he says, "last of all .<a name=169:16></a>.<a name=169:17></a>.<a name=169:18></a> he appeared to me also".<a name=169:19></a> He comes on the scene at the end, and he accomplishes more than all the others.<a name=169:20></a> Ought we to be discouraged, dear brethren?<a name=169:21></a> "Last of all", says the apostle; the Lord can appear at the end and do more even than at the beginning, but by means of whom?<a name=169:22></a> Of the one who is conscious of his own insignificance.<a name=169:23></a> Paul does not consider himself worthy of the name of apostle, because he persecuted the assembly of God.<a name=169:24></a> He adds, "But by God's grace I am what I am; and his grace, which was

		The special thought on my mind is to show that we have to learn everything from Christ Himself.<a name=171:1></a> The gospel of Mark shuts the door on all the colleges and schools in that which concerns the service of Christ.<a name=171:2></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:15">John  7:15</a>, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?<a name=171:3></a>" If it entirely lays aside human methods, still Mark's gospel gives us wonderful education.<a name=171:4></a> Education is good, every one must be educated in order to take a place in the house of God, so that he may behave himself there.<a name=171:5></a> We have to learn that which is called good manners; we must not be rude, or discourteous, or unwise in our way of acting.<a name=171:6></a> As belonging to heaven, we know we are in sight of myriads of beings who have known God before us, not better than us, but <i>before</i> us, and it is of the highest importance that we should know how to conduct ourselves.<a name=171:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like to show from the three passages I have read, three aspects of service.<a name=174:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is in connection with the young.<a name=174:2></a> The Lord has need of the young, of all the young ones.<a name=174:3></a> The colt in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19">Luke  19</a>gives us the thought of a young one under authority, the child of believing parents.<a name=174:4></a> There are several such here today; your parents have prayed much for you since your birth; they have lived in piety and brought you where you could hear the word of God.<a name=174:5></a> Now the Lord is saying, I have need of you.<a name=174:6></a> This incident is recorded by the four evangelists, but each of them puts it in his own way, according to the particular side of the truth which his gospel presents.<a name=174:7></a> According to Luke's teaching, it is a matter of the Lord's need, He needs the young ones.<a name=174:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says that as the disciples were going, the owners of the colt asked, "Why loose ye the colt?<a name=174:9></a>" And they answer, "Because the Lord has need of it".<a name=174:10></a> Perhaps you are saying, "I have need of the Lord"; actually you have need of Him and your parents, too, have need of Him on your account.<a name=174:11></a> They cannot hope to keep you under their control all your life; they need the Lord if you are to be saved.<a name=174:12></a> The Lord knows this and comes to meet you to answer to your need: "Himself bore our sins in his body on the tree", (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:24">1 Peter  2:24</a>).<a name=174:13></a> He has done this so that your conscience may be purified.<a name=174:14></a> "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin", (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:7">1 John  1:7</a>).<a name=174:15></a> Then, too, He has ascended to heaven and sent the Spirit, so that you may have all that is necessary now for your salvation in the present and in the future.<a name=174:16></a> If the Lord is to make use of you, you must be in the gain of these things.<a name=174:17></a> The Lord will not make use of us if we are not in the liberty of sons, "Loose him, and let him go".<a name=174:18></a> If the truth of which we are speaking comes into your soul,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		you will be in liberty.<a name=175:1></a> "Loose it and lead it here", we read in Luke.<a name=175:2></a> If it be a matter of older people, it is possible to let them go, as it was for Lazarus.<a name=175:3></a> In contrast to that, the young man in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>was given back to his mother, but here the thought is of being brought to Jesus.<a name=175:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a great result there would be from these meetings, if someone were led to Jesus for His service.<a name=175:5></a> He has need of you, there is a great need of servants in this world.<a name=175:6></a> How beautiful it is -- to be led to Jesus!<a name=175:7></a> It is not here a question of salvation for a young man -- typically he is already a believer -- but of being brought to Jesus for service.<a name=175:8></a> "And having cast their own garments on the colt, they put Jesus on it".<a name=175:9></a> That shows affectionate consideration, older brethren taking care of the young, and this service is meekly accepted.<a name=175:10></a> The older brethren are glad to see the young ones having part in the service.<a name=175:11></a> There is no jealousy; on the contrary, they put on them their own garments, something of their own personal character.<a name=175:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"They put Jesus on it".<a name=175:13></a> Jesus is not here personally now, but His testimony is here and it has to be carried.<a name=175:14></a> The older brethren are glad to see the young saints carrying it together with them.<a name=175:15></a> What greater honour could be entrusted to them?<a name=175:16></a> We are getting near the end of the present dispensation; the Lord would wish that His testimony be carried in triumph to the end.<a name=175:17></a> For that, He has need of the young; He has need of them as also of the garments -- the experience of the older brethren.<a name=175:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one, it states, had ever sat upon the colt; that is a great thing, a young man who has never been under the yoke of the world.<a name=175:19></a> "No child of man" suggests that the Lord will not use human culture in His service.<a name=175:20></a> We are to learn everything inside, that is, in the circle of the assembly.<a name=175:21></a> We can learn in our parents' house, but we must regard it all in relation

		In coming to the Lord Jesus we have been occupied above all with our own needs; it is what can be observed throughout the gospels.<a name=180:5></a> The Lord has always responded to the needs of those who come to Him.<a name=180:6></a> If there are any here today who have spiritual needs, the Lord is here to answer to them!<a name=180:7></a> It says, on the occasion of a certain incident in His pathway down here, that many came together to hear and to be healed; the power of the Lord was present to heal them.<a name=180:8></a> Your needs can be met on the principle of faith, without your leaving this room.<a name=180:9></a> But, as I have already said, "The Lord has need .<a name=180:10></a>.<a name=180:11></a>".<a name=180:12></a>

		You will notice that in Matthew, Mark and Luke it says, "The Lord has need of it (or them)".<a name=180:13></a> He had need then of a colt, the foal of an ass.<a name=180:14></a> In the first passage He has need of the ass and the colt; Matthew puts it that way, according to the point of view of his gospel, having the intention by the Spirit, of speaking of the assembly.<a name=180:15></a> It was that of which the Lord had need, as it is written, "It is not good that Man should be alone", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>).<a name=180:16></a> Jehovah said, "I will make him a help-mate, his like".<a name=180:17></a> It was the same with Isaac; Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for his son.<a name=180:18></a> These two men, Adam and Isaac, are typical of the Lord Jesus as having need of the assembly.<a name=180:19></a> Matthew alone of the evangelists formally mentions the assembly, and for this reason he makes much of the rejection of Christ by Israel.<a name=180:20></a> The nation rejected its Messiah, and so He seeks another wife, for Israel had been a wife for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He compares Himself with a man seeking goodly pearls; He found one "of great price".<a name=181:5></a> This is a type of the assembly, and this passage should be read in the light of these remarks.<a name=181:6></a> It is in Matthew's gospel that the Lord said, "on this rock I will build my assembly".<a name=181:7></a> If He is to build an assembly, He must have persons, so according to this gospel, at least two are necessary for an expression of the assembly in a locality.<a name=181:8></a>

		The Lord would say to each one in this room, and especially to those of this village, 'I have need of you'.<a name=181:9></a> He has need of each christian in this locality; He has need of you for many reasons, but He needs you, so that there may be here some little expression of the assembly for the satisfaction of His own heart.<a name=181:10></a> Is there a christian here who would like to refuse to Him what He is seeking?<a name=181:11></a> Notice that the Lord said to His disciples, "Go into the village over against you, and immediately ye will find an ass tied, and a colt with it".<a name=181:12></a> That speaks to us of christians who have not gone into the world but are held governmentally.<a name=181:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a question in this passage of the Lord's need as to the assembly.<a name=182:10></a> There are only few gatherings which answer to the Lord's heart in this great country.<a name=182:11></a> No one could be more filled than He with tender love towards the two or three in a locality who respond to His heart.<a name=182:12></a> Although few in number, they are like green oases in the middle of the surrounding barrenness.<a name=182:13></a> He would like to perfect each little meeting so that the verdure, so to speak, becomes more and more luxuriant, so that His eye can rest with more satisfaction on each little gathering.<a name=182:14></a> If, as I have already said, the gatherings are few in number on this plateau, it is His thought to increase them; for that He has need of two, in different places, for there cannot be fewer than this to express the assembly.<a name=182:15></a>

		In this gospel, He says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may

		be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>).<a name=183:1></a> How important it is then that there may be found two, in prayer, of those who belong to the assembly, for where there are such, what they ask will be done for them by "my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=183:2></a> The passage continues, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=183:3></a> So you can see the Lord's object at the present moment, He is seeking material to increase the number of the gatherings; that is why He says of these two, "The Lord has need of them".<a name=183:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thought presented here is that He is to be carried, that is to say, presented in testimony by these 'two' in a living way, for we read that when the ass and the colt were brought to Him, He "sat on them".<a name=183:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said that about Matthew, we will go on now with Mark.<a name=183:6></a> If the Lord has material for a local company, the two or three are really gathered together unto His name, there are conditions for the assembly.<a name=183:7></a> Now for the maintenance of these conditions, the Lord needs servants, so that, in Mark, mention is made only of the colt.<a name=183:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark tells us that at the sepulchre of Jesus there was a young man clothed in a white robe, which is an allusion to service.<a name=183:9></a> The Lord has need of a young man who will serve in purity; in his service he is, so to say, at the open sepulchre of Jesus.<a name=183:10></a> Jesus is no longer there; He is risen from among the dead, He has gone to heaven, He is seated at the right hand of God -- that is what Mark tells.<a name=183:11></a> The disciples preached everywhere, which is exactly what Jesus wishes; He wants the colt for service.<a name=183:12></a> We must understand the incident from Mark's point of view, and he tells us that the colt was brought to Jesus and He sat on it.<a name=183:13></a> The thought is that the testimony of Jesus is to be carried in a living way, and too (according to the passage read in chapter 16), in a pure

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no need to tell you, dear friends, that the Lord has need of such servants in this district.<a name=184:3></a> The Lord has provided for them special ones who come from a great distance, but He desires that each gathering should be maintained by persons who belong to it.<a name=184:4></a> The Lord has in view, in Mark, one brother or several, one sister or several, who have at heart that what is for Him is to be maintained.<a name=184:5></a>

		For the encouragement of all, I shall say that if you take to heart what He has need of, the Lord will say to you, 'I will make use of you'.<a name=184:6></a> When David went to Ahimelech, the priest, he said to him, "And now what is under thine hand?<a name=184:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#21:3">1 Samuel  21:3</a>) If the Lord came to Faussimagne or Bronac or to Tence, He would ask, 'What have you here?<a name=184:8></a>' We must make use of the most possible that we have in our respective localities.<a name=184:9></a> The Lord would say to a brother or a sister who realises the local need, 'I will make use of you', for the Lord wants such.<a name=184:10></a> He will not fail to make use of those who are available to Him.<a name=184:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In looking at the passage in Luke, we should, as in the other two, take account of the incident from the point of view of the writer.<a name=184:12></a> Luke is concerned about the priesthood of Christ; that is why he commences his gospel with a mention of a priest and his wife, and finishes it showing Jesus lifting up His hands and blessing His own, a priestly action, beautiful in the highest degree.<a name=184:13></a> Aaron, in the Old Testament, was to bless Israel saying, "Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee; Jehovah make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious to thee; Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace", (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#6:24">Numbers  6:24</a> - 26).<a name=184:14></a>

		I would like to speak of our relations as believers with God.<a name=188:1></a> Relations exist also amongst ourselves, and that is a great subject.<a name=188:2></a> It is important that such relations, on the basis of truth, should be happy, so that we may be, may I say, on comfortable terms with one another, that there may be no conscious effort -- less indeed than in any company -- but rather a deep sense of restfulness, of reciprocal confidence, as amongst the members of the family of God.<a name=188:3></a> It is indeed a great testimony that there are such persons down here in our day: the Lord said, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>).<a name=188:4></a> Men loving one another is a witness that Christ has disciples here.<a name=188:5></a> The Lord said, "But when the Son of man comes, shall he indeed find faith on the earth?<a name=188:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#18:8">Luke  18:8</a>).<a name=188:7></a> That is a question which awaits its response.<a name=188:8></a> A true disciple, hearing that remark of the Lord's, would like to answer, 'As far as that question concerns me, faith will still exist'.<a name=188:9></a>

		I want now to come to my subject, that is, to the fact that we should be on happy terms, holy and free, with God.<a name=188:10></a> That is our privilege, for does it not say, "Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you", (<a href="../bible/James.htm#4:8">James  4:8</a>).<a name=188:11></a> God does not expect that we should travel the whole of the way, He travels part of it Himself.<a name=188:12></a> If, however, in one sense He had not travelled the whole way, we should never have been in movement at all.<a name=188:13></a> In this way God came into Egypt and caused His people to go out from there.<a name=188:14></a> "Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and how I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself", (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:4">Exodus  19:4</a>).<a name=188:15></a> That is an initial movement, but being so, it implies a beginning of movement towards God on our part; this thought is seen in Sinai.<a name=188:16></a> There God introduced the principle of

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=217:11></a> Yes.<a name=217:12></a> That is the point.<a name=217:13></a> It is God's thought that there should be conformity in a moral way at the present time; in the future it will be literal, for "we shall be like him", seeing Him as He is, (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:2">1 John  3:2</a>).<a name=217:14></a> The testimony first came through Christ Himself, and then through the apostles.<a name=217:15></a> In this we get the complete thought of testimony in unity.<a name=217:16></a> John says that their fellowship was <i>with</i> the Father and <i>with</i> His Son, Jesus Christ.<a name=217:17></a> Doubtless the apostles were specially kept, in order that this might be true.<a name=217:18></a> The use of the preposition 'with' is very noticeable in John's writings, whereas fellowship as Paul presents it is 'of' -- "the fellowship <i>of</i> his Son", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>), etc.<a name=217:19></a> John also

		Ques.<a name=218:2></a> What does the use of the preposition 'with' imply?<a name=218:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=218:4></a> In John the Spirit of God emphasises the idea of persons, things are said to be had <i>with</i> persons.<a name=218:5></a> Whereas Paul emphasises the <i>character</i> of things.<a name=218:6></a> He uses the genitive, implying proceeding from; for example, 'the body of Christ', 'the blood of Christ'.<a name=218:7></a> 'With' suggests nearness and equality; this latter forms a very definite feature of John when divine Persons are concerned.<a name=218:8></a> So in the gospel he presents the Word as having been with God, and speaks of having contemplated His glory, "a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>).<a name=218:9></a> It is the relation of divine Persons to one another.<a name=218:10></a> And it is the Lord's desire to have <i>us</i> with Himself, as it is said, "where I am, there shall also my servant be" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:26">John  12:26</a>), and also, "that where I am, there ye may be also", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:3">John  14:3</a>).<a name=218:11></a> Love would always have it that way; it ever seeks the company of its objects.<a name=218:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So John speaks here of "that eternal life, which was with the Father".<a name=218:13></a> Eternal life is thus lifted up to a plane far higher than that on which it is presented in the Old Testament, to the plane of the relationship of divine Persons with one another, that of the Son's relationship with the Father.<a name=218:14></a> That is a plane by itself, so to speak.<a name=218:15></a> Of course it is the Son as Man, not the relationship that existed between the Persons as in the Deity -- before incarnation.<a name=218:16></a> Then follows, "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ", (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:3">1 John  1:3</a>).<a name=218:17></a> This is clearly a step lower in the matter of fellowship; it is the fellowship of the apostles in relation to the testimony.<a name=218:18></a> It is important to see that the reference to the "eternal life, which was with the Father", does not refer to what Christ was eternally, but to what He was as Man here.<a name=218:19></a> It involves the Son becoming Man.<a name=218:20></a> Similarly in the gospel, John says, "we have

	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of a well is very remarkable: it is a very small subdivision of water.<a name=234:8></a> The thought of water has a great place in Scripture.<a name=234:9></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>that the Spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters.<a name=234:10></a> The waters however were then not serviceable.<a name=234:11></a> Evidently a great catastrophe had occurred, and the waters had engulfed that which God had made, the earth.<a name=234:12></a> The heavens apparently were not touched by this disaster.<a name=234:13></a> But "the earth", as it says, "was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep", (verse 2).<a name=234:14></a> By the subsequent operations of God account was immediately taken of this situation, for there was light given; and a recession of the waters brought about, a gathering of them into one place, and the merging of the land.<a name=234:15></a> Then He gave the waters a name -- "the gathering together of the waters called he Seas", (verse 10).<a name=234:16></a> Thus great divisions of water, oceans, have to be taken account of, they have their use.<a name=234:17></a> They typically represent great general influential masses or bodies.<a name=234:18></a> Then we have seas, gulfs, lakes, rivers, rivulets and

		ponds; and the smallest subdivision of water, the well.<a name=235:1></a> But it is not by any means the least interesting, for it is used by the Lord Himself as a type of the Holy Spirit having come down from heaven and taken up His residence here.<a name=235:2></a> But in contrast to the thought of coming down, the well refers to the <i>upward</i> movement expressed in persons who have the Holy Spirit.<a name=235:3></a> As the Lord says, "shall be <i>in him</i> a well of water <i>springing up</i> into everlasting life".<a name=235:4></a> The allusion brings before us believers in the aggregate in their faith and spiritual affections, in a striking way.<a name=235:5></a> What a depositary they provide for what is of God!<a name=235:6></a> We have to look at the saints from that point of view, and see what potentiality exists in them in connection with the mighty power of God come down from heaven.<a name=235:7></a> The Spirit is <i>here</i> actually, and here to be the power in believers whereby there may be the truth of the well, the springing up to God.<a name=235:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many allusions to wells in Scripture, and several of these in Genesis.<a name=235:9></a> The first two wells are in connection with a woman upon whom they made but little impression, Hagar.<a name=235:10></a> It is remarkable that there is no evidence that she was genuinely affected.<a name=235:11></a> The well as a type of the Spirit of God should have affected her.<a name=235:12></a> But she was not affected; she remained an Egyptian bondmaid.<a name=235:13></a> And moreover, her offspring grew up like her, and she "took him a wife out of the land of <i>Egypt</i>", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21:21">Genesis  21:21</a>).<a name=235:14></a> The natural proclivity remained.<a name=235:15></a>

		So that the allusion to Joseph is very interesting, "Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well".<a name=236:7></a> If there was not fruitfulness in Hagar and in others, there was in Joseph.<a name=236:8></a> His "branches run over the wall".<a name=236:9></a> He represents the very great truth of the presence of the Holy Spirit here bringing in the fruitfulness of Christ, and the position in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>corresponds almost exactly to this.<a name=236:10></a> How fruitful was the Lord Jesus there by the well!<a name=236:11></a> At noon He meets there the poor woman with her desolate heart and shameful character.<a name=236:12></a> What prospects had she?<a name=236:13></a> She had none; and further, she was a Samaritan and a wall existed between Samaria and the Jews, but the branches of the true Joseph ran over it.<a name=236:14></a> She becomes fruit for Christ, and brings to His mind that all around the fields were white unto harvest.<a name=236:15></a> So He says to the disciples, "Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:35">John  4:35</a>).<a name=236:16></a> He Himself was the source of all the fruitfulness; but it was by the well; that was the divine way.<a name=236:17></a> It was in connection with the Spirit.<a name=236:18></a> It had just been said that "God gives not the Spirit by measure", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:34">John  3:34</a>), and this marks the present dispensation.<a name=236:19></a> The Lord Jesus as Man here had the Spirit entirely

		and in His mediatorial position He brings in a state of fruitfulness which will culminate in the whole world being fill of fruit for God.<a name=237:1></a> Men attempt to bring about the fruitfulness of the earth by various instrumentalities, there are efforts in the way of cultivation, irrigation and what not.<a name=237:2></a> But "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#24:1">Psalm  24:1</a>).<a name=237:3></a> Men may divide it up amongst themselves, setting out its boundaries, and placing on it the tokens of their proprietory rights but presently the Lord Jesus will come forth putting His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the earth, and will cry with a loud voice as when a lion roareth, and when He has cried, seven thunders will utter their voices.<a name=237:4></a> Who will dispute <i>His</i> right?<a name=237:5></a> Thus He will take possession of the earth and of the sea.<a name=237:6></a> And what will He do with it?<a name=237:7></a> He will remove every trace of evil from it and fill it with fruit in every way.<a name=237:8></a> And the poor desolate woman at Sychar's well coming out of the city with the empty water pitcher was to be the sign of all this.<a name=237:9></a> She drank into His words herself; and then went to the men of the city, and said, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?<a name=237:10></a>" (verse 29).<a name=237:11></a> Then they also came and believed, and thus the fruit extended.<a name=237:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Moses' case we have not only the fruitfulness, but also the actual administration of it.<a name=237:13></a> He was not as Joseph, simply a fruitful bough by a well, but was more than that; he was the great administrator.<a name=237:14></a> He is a type of Christ as Apostle and Administrator.<a name=237:15></a> When young he had it in his mind that God would use him, as many young men have.<a name=237:16></a> They get impressions from the Lord that they are going to be used by Him.<a name=237:17></a> But how could Moses be used?<a name=237:18></a> In what spirit could his service be carried out?<a name=237:19></a> We read that when Moses was grown "he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens", (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:11">Exodus  2:11</a>).<a name=237:20></a> We have a very fine example here, for it is not a question of how I may shine in the ministry,

		Now in the last passage read we reach the great final result.<a name=240:18></a> It is recorded, "And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses".<a name=240:19></a> It is as if it were said, How shall I act if the Lord is not actually looking on?<a name=240:20></a> Can I be trusted?<a name=240:21></a> If the brethren are not looking at me, can I be trusted?<a name=240:22></a> The answer lies in the state of my heart.<a name=240:23></a> Hence what we find emphasised throughout these verses is the state of the heart, what kind of a heart the people had.<a name=240:24></a> So it says, "And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing".<a name=240:25></a> What kind of a state was found there?<a name=240:26></a> They were not being moved by their <i>natural</i> hearts.<a name=240:27></a> The Lord gives a

		In all these incidents we have the spiritual line running through the book leading up to Abigail.<a name=302:13></a> Saul comes in and fails.<a name=302:14></a> He was head and shoulders above the rest of the people, but he was not spiritual.<a name=302:15></a> It is those who are lowly and little like Paul, who are spiritual.<a name=302:16></a> So the Lord says to Samuel, "fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons", (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:1">1 Samuel  16:1</a>).<a name=302:17></a> And also, "Take a heifer with thee", (verse 2).<a name=302:18></a> It was to be a <i>female</i> offering, also seen in the milch kine, and was intended to bring out the great subjective result before God -- love.<a name=302:19></a> If I have not love, I am nothing.<a name=302:20></a> Saul did not have the love, but David had and was lovable.<a name=302:21></a> His name means beloved; he is a beautiful type of Christ.<a name=302:22></a> He was beautiful-eyed and of a lovely countenance.<a name=302:23></a> The heifer is a symbol of the response of the assembly

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to a concrete example of this in one person, namely, Abigail.<a name=303:13></a> A woman "of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance", and one who knew what to do in a crisis.<a name=303:14></a> If we are in the assembly we shall have to go through crises.<a name=303:15></a> Indeed, its history is one of a succession of crises.<a name=303:16></a> The history of Abigail teaches us how to meet every emergency arising in connection with the testimony.<a name=303:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In our chapter we have a crisis of the most extreme character.<a name=303:18></a> Samuel had died and Saul was still in power.<a name=303:19></a> Samuel had been a great spiritual asset in Israel.<a name=303:20></a> Although Saul was officially on the throne, it is recorded: "Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life", (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:15">1 Samuel  7:15</a>).<a name=303:21></a> He ruled Israel in spite of Saul, for his influence was there.<a name=303:22></a> There are many like Samuel today; although unofficial, they have a wide-spread influence for good among the people of God.<a name=303:23></a> But Samuel had died, and his death was an epoch in Israel.<a name=303:24></a>

		So Nabal immediately comes into evidence.<a name=303:25></a> He was a distinguished man according to the flesh; but stood squarely athwart the path of God's anointed king.<a name=303:26></a> Whether in great measure or small, woe to the man who selfishly stands across the path of one whom God has anointed.<a name=303:27></a> Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy, are we

		But it was not so with Nabal's wife.<a name=304:15></a> She was of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance.<a name=304:16></a> She represents the divine thought at the outset.<a name=304:17></a> The two things should go together; intelligence and attractiveness.<a name=304:18></a> Abigail is a type of the church in these respects.<a name=304:19></a> There is nothing more attractive than the church save Christ Himself.<a name=304:20></a> It is His body and fulness.<a name=304:21></a> All that He is shines in it.<a name=304:22></a> It is said typically of the church by Adam of Eve, "bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:23">Genesis  2:23</a>).<a name=304:23></a> He knew her for he recognised she was of himself.<a name=304:24></a> But Eve does not represent the church militant, nor does Rebecca, but Abigail does.<a name=304:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I desire to call attention to what is very practical in this chapter, and that is the service of David's young men.<a name=304:26></a> Young men have a great place in Scripture, and they are presented here as employed in David's service, in a peculiarly interesting way.<a name=304:27></a> There were ten of them,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=305>[Page 305]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and they were very commendable, being <i>David's</i> young men.<a name=305:1></a> 'Ten' gives the element of responsibility, but they were capable if young.<a name=305:2></a> They are sent to Nabal, and in being sent, great tact would be needed.<a name=305:3></a> So it is if you go out to preach Christ on the street.<a name=305:4></a> The listeners do not care much about it, so that it requires much courage and tact.<a name=305:5></a> It is not a question of much speaking, because brief statements are the most effective.<a name=305:6></a> What are needed are brief attractive statements concerning Christ and conveying the terms of the gospel.<a name=305:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we turn to the Lord's first preaching in Mark, we find it of much brevity: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:15">Mark  1:15</a>).<a name=305:8></a> Yet there was nothing left out that was necessary; it is a complete statement.<a name=305:9></a> It is very valuable to have the power of condensation in spiritual things.<a name=305:10></a> There is no book so condensed as the Bible, yet we could not exhaust it, though we read it a thousand times; its moral texture is so wonderful.<a name=305:11></a> It is lucid, but condensed.<a name=305:12></a> And the gospel of Mark is particularly so.<a name=305:13></a> How much was involved in the first preaching: "Repent ye, and believe the gospel"!<a name=305:14></a> A very long book could be written on the subjects of repenting and believing the gospel.<a name=305:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the ten young men go to Nabal, who was neither interested in nor appreciative of David.<a name=305:16></a> We can often accomplish a great deal if our audience is interested.<a name=305:17></a> But here there was entire opposition.<a name=305:18></a> It is what we may expect on the street corner.<a name=305:19></a> Nevertheless if we find one in a thousand the effort is well worth while.<a name=305:20></a> There is joy in heaven over <i>one</i> sinner that repenteth.<a name=305:21></a> But we may have to contend with the opposition of the nine hundred and ninety-nine, and it is here we need the utmost tact and patience.<a name=305:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 14 we come to another young man, one of Nabal's young men.<a name=306:14></a> He had heard Nabal's dreadful answer to David's message, his refusal of the peaceful requests of the anointed of God.<a name=306:15></a> He is one who sees danger imminent.<a name=306:16></a> That is another point: We are not all called to preach; the fact that I am a young man is not a proof that I am a preacher; preaching is based on gift.<a name=306:17></a> But if I am not a preacher I can be a <i>watcher</i>.<a name=306:18></a> The Lord said, "what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:37">Mark  13:37</a>).<a name=306:19></a> We should not leave all the care of the testimony to the elder brethren, inasmuch as everyone in the assembly is responsible for it.<a name=306:20></a> This young man saw the danger, and at once went to the right one as to it; typically he went to the assembly, to where such matters belong.<a name=306:21></a> There only can such matters be handled properly; for even though one be an elder he cannot of himself handle them.<a name=306:22></a> The Lord is owned in the assembly, and the Spirit is there, and thus it is there that

	<div class="paragraph">
		proper attention is given to these things.<a name=307:1></a> So this young man goes to Abigail and says in effect: There is a terrible thing impending, disaster is overtaking us.<a name=307:2></a> He tells what had happened -- that Nabal had railed on David's men.<a name=307:3></a> He knew that David's men had been very good to those of Nabal, but he also knew his master to be a son of Belial.<a name=307:4></a> It was clearly a time of crisis.<a name=307:5></a> Could he have done better?<a name=307:6></a> No.<a name=307:7></a> He is a type of a believer who sees impending danger and places the information where it belongs.<a name=307:8></a> So Abigail took the matter on her own shoulders at once; she was prepared to accept the responsibility of it and make it her own.<a name=307:9></a> In this way the assembly faces difficulties, and it is only thus they can be handled according to God.<a name=307:10></a> Abigail knows what to do, and this is what I want now to dwell upon.<a name=307:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a matter of fact, David at this point was acting somewhat remissly, although the intended judgment was deserved.<a name=307:12></a> Smiting tends to misrepresent the position.<a name=307:13></a> It is for the assembly to rightly reflect the character of the dispensation, and whatever affects it should be rectified in such a manner that the dispensation is not belied.<a name=307:14></a> It is very satisfactory when this is done, for it is a dispensation of grace, not of judgment; the latter is held in abeyance.<a name=307:15></a> And we see here how Abigail very beautifully effects the adjustment of the position, in that she prevents David from taking vengeance, for war was in his heart.<a name=307:16></a> The Lord Jesus, by and by, will take vengeance; He will come out with these same feelings, having war in His heart.<a name=307:17></a> He will then tread the winepress of the wrath of Almighty God, but it is not the time for that now.<a name=307:18></a> The saints understand this and so maintain the reign of grace.<a name=307:19></a> Normally, the assembly knows how to act in a crisis, and to see to it that things are so adjusted that the character of the dispensation is not denied.<a name=307:20></a> It is a day of grace and of salvation, since the Lord is sitting on His Father's throne, not on His own throne.<a name=307:21></a> That is the present

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Abigail knows what to do.<a name=308:5></a> We should be exercised to know what to do at all times.<a name=308:6></a> If certain information is laid before us we are under obligation to know what to do regarding it.<a name=308:7></a> How quickly and suitably Abigail acts!<a name=308:8></a> It is said, "Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses".<a name=308:9></a> In this we see the character of what is to be done.<a name=308:10></a> All these loaves, the bottles of wine and the other things, what do they portend?<a name=308:11></a> What do they speak of but grace?<a name=308:12></a> That is the thing.<a name=308:13></a> We have food in abundance.<a name=308:14></a> I often think that when trouble arises and a meeting becomes divided, what is needed is food.<a name=308:15></a> What is needful is a supply of food whereby saints are nourished and brought into a state wherein they are capable of being adjusted.<a name=308:16></a> When such conditions arise it is an evidence usually that they have been living, so to say, on controversy, biting and devouring one another.<a name=308:17></a> They will never judge themselves as long as they are living on that kind of food.<a name=308:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord, before probing Peter (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>), fed him royally.<a name=308:19></a> He did not give him a sandwich, but a good meal!<a name=308:20></a> He said, "Come and <i>dine</i>"; that is a dignified word.<a name=308:21></a> The Lord had the fire of coals, and fish laid thereon, and bread; the food was <i>cooked</i> for them.<a name=308:22></a> What grace on the Lord's part!<a name=308:23></a> How that scene reflects the dispensation!<a name=308:24></a> Having thus fed him, the Lord can address Peter's conscience.<a name=308:25></a>

		And now we have another thing -- we read that as Abigail rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and David and his men came down against her; they came down on opposite sides.<a name=309:8></a> That is another great principle in a crisis: There must be no mounting up.<a name=309:9></a> In this instance, both sides were coming down; and they meet on the lowland.<a name=309:10></a> It is said of Abigail that <i>she met</i> them.<a name=309:11></a> Then a beautiful, if speedy, solution is reached by Abigail, in which she succeeds in pacifying David.<a name=309:12></a> She says, You must not shed blood; and David says, You have kept me from doing it.<a name=309:13></a> He says, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me.<a name=309:14></a> And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging myself with mine own hand".<a name=309:15></a> "Blessed be thy <i>discernment</i>" -- we have very great need of this quality.<a name=309:16></a> Thus in all this she is a very beautiful type of the church; and David fully appreciates and owns her.<a name=309:17></a> It is a most beautiful passage of Scripture!<a name=309:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=329:11></a> Well, people got into the habit of swearing, and the Lord checks it here, saying, "it has been said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt render to the Lord what thou hast sworn.<a name=329:12></a> But <i>I</i> say unto you, Do not swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.<a name=329:13></a> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.<a name=329:14></a> But let your word be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; but what is more than these is from evil".<a name=329:15></a> That is a very fine moral principle!<a name=329:16></a> It is really weakness in man to resort to swearing, to say nothing about the profanity that enters into it.<a name=329:17></a> It is weakness.<a name=329:18></a> If a man knows what he is saying, and says it, that is all; there is power in what he says.<a name=329:19></a> Paul's word was not Yea and Nay; he said Yea, and he meant it (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:17">2 Corinthians  1:17</a> - 20).<a name=329:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=368:1></a> What came before us yesterday afternoon requires, I believe, particular attention in connection with this inquiry in verse 3, that is, the order of things in heaven.<a name=368:2></a> For the heavenly is to be seen now in the assembly; it is to be marked as the <i>heavenly</i> Jerusalem in the millennium, and this is to be reflected now.<a name=368:3></a> So that chapter 17 deserves special attention, as bringing into view what exists in heaven.<a name=368:4></a> Paul was caught up, he says, to the third heaven, but it was not what he saw but what he <i>heard</i>; he heard things which are not allowed to man to utter.<a name=368:5></a> Whereas the mount of transfiguration is something to be seen and contemplated; and withal we have the thought of speaking, the speaking of One who is the Object of affection -- the beloved Son; and then the faith in the disciples which should say to the mountain, Be thou removed and cast into the sea, and it should be removed -- it should remove itself.<a name=368:6></a> The removal is by an unseen hand, of what stands in the way of the heavenly order of things, because the Lord is introducing this in that chapter; it is in those who form the assembly; they are sons, associates with Himself.<a name=368:7></a> Room has to be made for the assembly as thus composed, but faith is required for the removal of what stands in the way.<a name=368:8></a> It is not now simply to leave it; we can leave as the Lord did, He left them and went away (chapter 16), but the obstruction has to be removed.<a name=368:9></a> That brings in providential service, without which we could not hope to be here in testimony, as heavenly.<a name=368:10></a> Way is made, but it is through the faith of those who compose the assembly -- the power of God through faith.<a name=368:11></a> Hence the importance of recognising "the powers that be" -- through whom God operates angelically.<a name=368:12></a>

		So, as I said, the Lord selects three, and takes them from among the others and brings them to the top of the mount.<a name=452:10></a> It is an act of His own.<a name=452:11></a> Then, as on high, they see something of heaven.<a name=452:12></a> They acted very poorly in that glorious scene; they were not in keeping with it.<a name=452:13></a> We do not want to go there and to be out of accord with the place.<a name=452:14></a> We do not want to go to court, so to speak, without knowing court manners.<a name=452:15></a> But Peter, James and John, although selected by the Lord, were entirely out of keeping with the scene on high.<a name=452:16></a> Peter would doubtless say later, 'If I had another opportunity like that I should act very differently'.<a name=452:17></a> He says, "we .<a name=452:18></a>.<a name=452:19></a>.<a name=452:20></a> were eyewitnesses of his majesty .<a name=452:21></a>.<a name=452:22></a>.<a name=452:23></a> when we were with him in the holy mount", (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:16">2 Peter  1:16</a>,18).<a name=452:24></a> Then it is Peter who tells us that we are made a royal priesthood, shewing that we shall have majesty up there, being made "kings and priests", as it says (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:6">Revelation  1:6</a>), to His God and Father.<a name=452:25></a>

		Well, what I wish to shew here is liberty as seen in Christ, because in this section of Mark, ministers, levites, are in the making, for the need of them is very great, now as ever.<a name=453:13></a> But then we want servants that are after the pattern of Christ.<a name=453:14></a> The Lord is to be represented in His servants, so that you have two ideas, likeness and image.<a name=453:15></a> If I am like the Lord, then I can be His representative.<a name=453:16></a> I must be like Him first, and these chapters are to make us like Him.<a name=453:17></a> The disciples are not actually sent out till chapter 6; in these chapters they are being prepared.<a name=453:18></a> Here in chapter 2 we have the Lord entering into Capernaum again, and whenever the Scripture says He does things <i>again</i>, it is an additional thing.<a name=453:19></a> The first chapter gives His first visit to Capernaum, and here He enters again into it, and it is said He was in the house (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#2:1">Mark  2:1</a>).<a name=453:20></a> That is to say, it suggests to us how the servant behaves in the house.<a name=453:21></a> You say, 'I should like to have the' room 'so as to preach', but then, how have you been in the house?<a name=453:22></a> how do you get on there?<a name=453:23></a> I refer to this only by the way.<a name=453:24></a>

		The Lord was in the house, and the crowds came and thronged Him, and what comes to light is that a certain evangelistic spirit arises, so that they bring to the Lord a paralytic, "borne of four".<a name=454:1></a> Four were carrying this man.<a name=454:2></a> A man's need may be so great that he needs the general sympathy and prayers of the brethren in the district, if he is to be helped.<a name=454:3></a> So they bring the man, but they cannot get him in through the doors.<a name=454:4></a> Well, they go up on the roof and dig it through and let the man down; I do not dwell on that, save to shew the zeal of these four men.<a name=454:5></a> They uncover the roof and dig it, so that the <i>couch</i> on which he lay can come down, as much as to say that the Lord is to see this man in all his circumstances.<a name=454:6></a> It does not say that they let <i>the man</i> down, it says they let down the couch whereon the man lay.<a name=454:7></a>

		That is the first thing in this chapter.<a name=454:8></a> A good deal might be said about it, but I just refer to that incident as leading up to what follows.<a name=454:9></a> The Lord, in verse 13, goes again to the sea and teaches, then passing by He sees Levi and says, "Follow me".<a name=454:10></a> Levi is actually sitting, occupied with the taxes.<a name=454:11></a> It is not that he was told to leave the taxes, the word is simply, "Follow me", but the Lord was so attractive that he arose and followed Him.<a name=454:12></a> That is the principle.<a name=454:13></a> He followed the Lord and made a great entertainment in his house for Him.<a name=454:14></a>

		Then other things follow, including the idea of fasting.<a name=454:15></a> There were the disciples of John and the Pharisees fasting, and they say, Why should not the followers of Jesus do the same?<a name=454:16></a> The followers of Jesus never imitate this world, or anything in it; they imitate Christ.<a name=454:17></a> To imitate what is around us religiously is simply to add to the world, and we must never imitate the world, although the disciples of John the baptist seemed to do so.<a name=454:18></a> The questioners here (verse 18) link the disciples of the Baptist with those of the Pharisees.<a name=454:19></a> The Lord Jesus has brought in something new, and it

		Then He speaks of the new cloth; He will not allow any patching up of the old.<a name=455:6></a> It is a wholly new thing.<a name=455:7></a> So, too, the new bottles.<a name=455:8></a> That the wine be not lost, there must be new bottles for the new wine; for we are brought into something entirely new.<a name=455:9></a> Let us treasure it; let us value it, and not give way one iota to any suggestion from what is around us.<a name=455:10></a>

		The next thing is that the Lord goes through the cornfields on the sabbath day.<a name=455:11></a> It is an extraordinary movement, as if He did it deliberately.<a name=455:12></a> Indeed, He <i>did</i>, for He does <i>everything</i> deliberately.<a name=455:13></a> Here He is challenged.<a name=455:14></a> Notice, it does not say that He ate the corn, the point is that His movement was to be a suggestion.<a name=455:15></a> The Lord at this juncture would expect His disciples to learn, not by direct teaching, but by what seemed to be a casual movement.<a name=455:16></a> But with Christ all is deliberate, as I said, and we must not be asleep.<a name=455:17></a> If He takes a turn I must not miss that turn.<a name=455:18></a> If I neglect certain meetings, I may miss some movement of the Lord, and miss it for ever.<a name=455:19></a> So here is a movement through the cornfield.<a name=455:20></a> Someone comes home from the meeting and you say, Well, what did you have?<a name=455:21></a> Oh, they say, we had the Lord going through the cornfield.<a name=455:22></a> You say, That is a common thing.<a name=455:23></a> Is it a common thing for a man in the midst of the Jewish system, where the sabbath was held in reverence and sanctity, to break through all that and go through the cornfields on that day?<a name=455:24></a> It was very much otherwise.<a name=455:25></a> He was acting right across the religious feelings of everybody that saw Him, and we must learn to do that.<a name=455:26></a> The full bearing of a divine movement would come out at a meeting, and those absent would miss it.<a name=455:27></a>

		This was no small matter, and quickly enough the Lord was challenged, not because of what He did, but because of what His disciples did.<a name=456:1></a> That is to say, it is what the saints do.<a name=456:2></a> He is in heaven now, and it is what <i>we</i> are doing, what the disciples of Jesus are doing that is the testimony.<a name=456:3></a> As you will observe in verse 23, it says, "his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.<a name=456:4></a> And the Pharisees said to him, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?<a name=456:5></a>"

		The Lord says that David hungered and did what was unlawful, as they would say.<a name=457:6></a> Thus He vindicates His people in their liberty.<a name=457:7></a> David was a type of the Lord Himself as seen here.<a name=457:8></a> Later (chapter 11) He hungered as He was returning from Jerusalem, a little while before His death, and He came to a fig tree that He might find something on it, but there were no figs.<a name=457:9></a> Think of the Lord of glory being hungry!<a name=457:10></a> The earth is His, and its fulness -- think of <i>Him</i> being hungry!<a name=457:11></a> He became in all things like us, that He might sympathise with us.<a name=457:12></a> If His sheep are hungry in these systems around, does He not feel it?<a name=457:13></a> He does, and would liberate them, so that they might have food.<a name=457:14></a>

		I may refer here to what is very interesting; in this chapter you have the Lord looking around twice.<a name=459:12></a> In verse 5 He looks round upon those in the synagogue with anger, then in verse 34 He looks round upon those in the house.<a name=459:13></a> I just wanted to touch on those two scenes.<a name=459:14></a> Every one in christendom has to do with Christ; every one in the world for that matter, for all shall confess Him; He is the One that sits on the great white throne (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20:11">Revelation  20:11</a>).<a name=459:15></a> But as regards the present time, He is moving about among the seven assemblies.<a name=459:16></a> He walks about and He looks about.<a name=459:17></a> His eyes are said to be "as a flame of fire".<a name=459:18></a> He looks at the cathedral and at this place and that place.<a name=459:19></a> What does He think of them?<a name=459:20></a> Is He indifferent?<a name=459:21></a> He knows all about them and their history.<a name=459:22></a> Do you not believe that the Lord has visited this city many times, in the sense of which I am speaking of it?<a name=459:23></a> He comes and He looks around, but how does He look around?<a name=459:24></a> With anger?<a name=459:25></a> Yes!<a name=459:26></a> He is angry with what men are doing, with what is going on religiously among those that profess His name.<a name=459:27></a> He is angry about it.<a name=459:28></a> I

		Now in verse 6 the Pharisees, as you will observe, take counsel with the Herodians.<a name=460:18></a> That is to say, the leading religionists take counsel with the politicians, which is the combination here; they are the people who look this way and that way (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:12">Exodus  2:12</a>); they have to get the votes.<a name=460:19></a> And these combine to put Christ to death.<a name=460:20></a> Indeed it says, that they might <i>destroy</i> Him.<a name=460:21></a> That is a remarkable word here -- not simply to kill Him, but to <i>destroy</i> Him.<a name=460:22></a> He is never to appear again; that is their idea.<a name=460:23></a> Think of the murderous spirit of these men!<a name=460:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not intend to confine myself to these verses, for I hope to refer to the first chapter, and perhaps the third.<a name=463:1></a> What I wish that we may be led on to is the <i>evidence of salvation</i> in a believer.<a name=463:2></a> The book of Jonah is evangelical from the beginning to the end; it works out the principle of salvation in the preacher, that is, in Jonah himself.<a name=463:3></a> If it is to be set out in anyone, certainly it should be in the preacher.<a name=463:4></a> The divine thought is that what is presented in the preaching is exemplified in the preacher; that at least in one man the idea of salvation is exemplified, and if in one man, in a hundred -- in a million men.<a name=463:5></a> God would indeed set out this great principle in the preachers, that it might spread abroad and be laid hold of by needy sinners, for all need salvation.<a name=463:6></a> The divine thought is not simply that there is such a thing as that, or that it should be spoken of, but that it should be <i>exemplified</i>, especially in those who herald it.<a name=463:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the twelve the Lord commissioned to preach were characterised as saved men.<a name=463:8></a> Indeed Peter, the leading apostle, corresponds peculiarly with Jonah.<a name=463:9></a> He is seen in this very town of Joppa (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>), but although he needed some adjustment in regard to the gentiles, to whom he was to open the door of the kingdom of God, yet he was not like Jonah.<a name=463:10></a> In Jonah at Joppa you have a man going down, down, down, and no saved man is marked by that.<a name=463:11></a> Not that he is not like Jesus; He went down into the lowest parts of the earth, but it was to ascend up again.<a name=463:12></a> He did not go down to stay.<a name=463:13></a> But many do; they take a moral descent.<a name=463:14></a> Certainly Tarshish, to which Jonah took ship, conveyed no idea of ascent, of moral elevation.<a name=463:15></a> We read here of Jonah that he went <i>down</i> to Joppa, and being in Joppa he went <i>down</i> to the ship, and being in the ship he went <i>down</i> to the sides of the ship.<a name=463:16></a> There are three descents; whereas in Peter

		you have in the same town a man going <i>up</i>.<a name=464:1></a> He was a saved man, a preacher; indeed, the first preacher of the gospel after the Holy Spirit came.<a name=464:2></a> He was the first to announce Christ in heaven -- a wonderful honour!<a name=464:3></a> He announced that "God hath made that same Jesus both Lord and Christ", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:36">Acts  2:36</a>).<a name=464:4></a>

		Now he is in the town of Joppa, and instead of going down, he goes up.<a name=464:5></a> He went up, we are told, to the housetop to pray (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:9">Acts  10:9</a>).<a name=464:6></a> It does not say that Jonah went down to the ship to pray, or that he went to Tarshish to pray.<a name=464:7></a> No!<a name=464:8></a> Not that he did not pray later, as I hope to shew, but Peter went <i>up</i>.<a name=464:9></a> Joppa was a port town, and this house in which Peter was was "by the sea".<a name=464:10></a> No doubt he would look out on the Mediterranean.<a name=464:11></a> He went up to pray, we are told, and as he prayed he became in an ecstasy.<a name=464:12></a> That is a saved person; and as he preached his next sermon, those who heard him were all saved, as far as we can see.<a name=464:13></a> Peter had brought in a great draught of fishes at one haul of the net; now he brings in a house full of gentiles -- Cornelius and his company.<a name=464:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As praying on the housetop heaven acknowledges him; the sheet is let down containing the different creatures of the earth, and, as he tells Cornelius, God shewed him in this to call no man common or unclean.<a name=464:15></a> He is a saved man -- saved from nationalism.<a name=464:16></a> We have to be saved from that; we are all very prone to be patriotic, but Peter was saved from the narrowness of national feeling.<a name=464:17></a> Then, too, he was saved from himself, for as he reached the house of the centurion the latter fell down and worshipped him.<a name=464:18></a> He worshipped the preacher.<a name=464:19></a> Alas, there are many preachers who like to be made much of!<a name=464:20></a> They like, indeed, to preach themselves, if not in word, yet in effect.<a name=464:21></a> Paul says, "We preach <i>not</i> ourselves" (he was converted and saved from his own importance) "but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:5">2 Corinthians  4:5</a>).<a name=464:22></a> There are those who command the bended knee and the doffed hat, because

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter is thinking of Cornelius, that <i>he</i> might be saved; and entering into his house he finds there a fine congregation, not a vast one, but one of quality.<a name=465:5></a> Cornelius says, "we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:33">Acts  10:33</a>).<a name=465:6></a> They were not there out of curiosity, but to hear what Peter had to say.<a name=465:7></a> And what did he have to say?<a name=465:8></a> He spoke about Jesus, that God had anointed Him -- not that God had anointed Peter, or made an apostle of him, but that He had anointed <i>Jesus</i>, and that He had gone about doing good, for God was with Him.<a name=465:9></a> That is the kind of preaching.<a name=465:10></a> And so, as Peter preached, the Holy Spirit fell on all those that heard the word.<a name=465:11></a> Those who heard the <i>word</i>, not who heard Peter simply; the true preacher preaches the word.<a name=465:12></a> Those who hear the word are taken possession of by the Holy Spirit; that is the idea of salvation.<a name=465:13></a> You cannot be saved in the true sense without the Holy Spirit.<a name=465:14></a> You cannot be saved without the death of Christ surely, but you cannot be saved without the Holy Spirit.<a name=465:15></a> The Holy Spirit is the great <i>power</i> of salvation in <i>this world</i>; we need that power.<a name=465:16></a> As Christ is up in heaven, so the Holy Spirit is here, sent down by Him to effect salvation.<a name=465:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So you see that Peter went up, but Jonah went down.<a name=465:18></a> He was not a saved man, although a preacher.<a name=465:19></a> There are many like him, many preachers who are not really saved.<a name=465:20></a> He was actually commissioned by God to go to Nineveh, but instead of that he would go to Tarshish; he is full of national feelings, of national prejudices.<a name=465:21></a> He would not have the gentiles saved; he would not go to Nineveh.<a name=465:22></a> He was unsaved in that sense.<a name=465:23></a> Salvation is not simply from hell to come; it is that, thank God!<a name=465:24></a> He is our Deliverer from the coming wrath, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And Jonah has to go that way, and so God gives him latitude; He allows him to go to a point, but not beyond it.<a name=466:4></a> You see, in verse 8 he speaks of <i>his own</i> mercy -- "they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy" -- he is now coming into it; he is coming into the great fact that there is such a thing as mercy.<a name=466:5></a> How many there are who observe lying vanities and consequently forsake their own mercy!<a name=466:6></a> These lying vanities are prevalent abroad today, and those that listen to them forsake their own mercy.<a name=466:7></a> The mercy of God is made ours, for it is according to His rich mercy He hath saved us (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>).<a name=466:8></a> Jonah had forsaken that by observing lying vanities, and God allowed him to go down to Joppa.<a name=466:9></a> He allows us to go to a point, for He has salvation in view for us.<a name=466:10></a> It is not that He withdraws His commission, for "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:29">Romans  11:29</a>).<a name=466:11></a> Jonah was a prophet; the Lord Jesus Himself calls him that later.<a name=466:12></a> So God allows him to go to a point, for he must experience the way of salvation, and, as I said, he went <i>down</i>.<a name=466:13></a> Now let every one here challenge his own heart as to whether he is on the <i>down-grade</i>, or the <i>up-grade</i>.<a name=466:14></a> As we have seen, Peter was going up, and heaven greeted him, but Jonah is on the down-grade.<a name=466:15></a> We are on either one or the other.<a name=466:16></a> One often challenges one's own heart in a practical way as to which grade one is on, the ascending or the descending one.<a name=466:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Joppa was a port town, an outlet.<a name=466:18></a> It was the port of Jerusalem.<a name=466:19></a> You can understand therefore, what it would be in the mind of a man like Jonah; it was a

		Then they began to inquire more of him; I do not go into details -- the passage is well known -- but they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.<a name=470:8></a> That was of God.<a name=470:9></a> They say, "Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation?<a name=470:10></a> and whence comest thou?<a name=470:11></a> what is thy country?<a name=470:12></a> and of what people art thou?<a name=470:13></a>" Now he has to give an account of himself.<a name=470:14></a> You see, God has pointed His finger to him.<a name=470:15></a> It may be so here tonight, that God is pointing His finger to some of you; your conscience has come into action.<a name=470:16></a>

		So the lot fell upon Jonah; there can be no escape, for God was in this matter.<a name=470:17></a> Who can flee from the presence of God?<a name=470:18></a> "Whither shall I flee from thy presence?<a name=470:19></a>" says one, (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#139:7">Psalm  139:7</a>).<a name=470:20></a> You cannot.<a name=470:21></a> Jonah is detected and exposed, but what for?<a name=470:22></a> That he may be saved.<a name=470:23></a> That is the thing.<a name=470:24></a> All this is that he might be saved, and that he might exemplify salvation.<a name=470:25></a> So Jonah has to say, This is on my account; he has to answer for himself.<a name=470:26></a> So he says, "I am an Hebrew".<a name=470:27></a> Well, there is a lot said in Scripture about Hebrews.<a name=470:28></a> Who was the first Hebrew?<a name=470:29></a> The father of all believers -- Abraham.<a name=470:30></a> They might have said, You have a wonderful ancestry, why should you be here?<a name=470:31></a> If you belong to that family -- that family that has ever been under reproach in this world, but under the favour of God; it is wonderfully favoured by God, for God is the God of the Hebrews -- why should you be here?<a name=470:32></a> He acknowledges his relation with Abraham; in other words, he is a <i>true believer</i>.<a name=470:33></a> There is a work of God in him, but his will has been at work.<a name=470:34></a> He has observed lying vanities and forsaken his own mercy, and God will not let him go.<a name=470:35></a> He is after him.<a name=470:36></a>

		If he paid his fare and went down to the ship, God followed him.<a name=471:1></a> The lot falls upon him, and he says, "I am an Hebrew".<a name=471:2></a> But then he says more than that; he says, "I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land".<a name=471:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are coming now to the turning-point.<a name=471:4></a> He has far more intelligence than any of those mariners.<a name=471:5></a> "Jehovah", he says, "who hath made the sea", the very thing they were suffering from.<a name=471:6></a> He was no idolater; he knew better, but he was in moral degradation, his will was working.<a name=471:7></a> I can imagine a man like this speaking the truth of God in the most unholy circumstances, in a theatre, in a saloon, in the very worst company.<a name=471:8></a> But his conscience is reached; he confesses that he is an Hebrew, and that he fears God.<a name=471:9></a> He is now on the <i>ascent</i>.<a name=471:10></a> And who is this God he fears?<a name=471:11></a> Jehovah, the covenant God of Israel; the God that led them out of the land of Egypt; who made the sea and the dry land.<a name=471:12></a> He quotes Moses.<a name=471:13></a> Then he tells them what to do.<a name=471:14></a> May God grant that someone here who has been on the down-grade may be aroused!<a name=471:15></a> Let your conscience work.<a name=471:16></a> You know you have the truth; God would reach you and cause it to act on you, so that you may say, "I am an Hebrew"; that you may say, 'I am a christian, I fear God, but I have got into this plight through my own will'.<a name=471:17></a> God says, 'I am here to help you'.<a name=471:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So Jonah knows what to do.<a name=471:19></a> The passage says the men were "exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this?<a name=471:20></a> .<a name=471:21></a>.<a name=471:22></a>.<a name=471:23></a> And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you".<a name=471:24></a> He is <i>confessing</i> now.<a name=471:25></a> I do urge you to take that way, as the light reaches you, acknowledging that it is on your account that calamities have happened.<a name=471:26></a> Jonah is taking the blame of the storm on himself.<a name=471:27></a> A sure sign of the work of God in young men and young women is when they begin to blame <i>themselves</i>.<a name=471:28></a>

		While one is saying to his parents, '<i>You</i> did it', or to his brothers or sisters, 'You were unkind', he is not with God.<a name=472:1></a> But as soon as he begins to take things to himself and say, 'I am to blame for all this', deliverance is in sight, salvation is in view for him.<a name=472:2></a> So Jonah says, "Cast me forth into the sea".<a name=472:3></a> Then it says that the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.<a name=472:4></a> He is to be enclosed in a living being, as I may say; taken away from the mariners and from the ship-master and cast into the sea.<a name=472:5></a>

		Apparently all is hopeless now, but no, this is the beginning of positive salvation.<a name=472:6></a> So he is in the belly of the great fish.<a name=472:7></a> It must have been the most extraordinary fish that ever swam; it was <i>divinely prepared</i>.<a name=472:8></a> You will perhaps remember that the fish is the first living creature made, according to Genesis.<a name=472:9></a> The fish are called "living souls".<a name=472:10></a> This fish is prepared by God.<a name=472:11></a> Can we doubt that Jonah's experiences in that place are the experiences of Christ?<a name=472:12></a> He goes the road of the sufferings of Christ.<a name=472:13></a> It is not now moral descent; it is the descent of love.<a name=472:14></a> He goes down to the bottom of the mountains; it is the descent of Christ.<a name=472:15></a> The Lord Jesus went the whole way -- "that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?<a name=472:16></a>" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:9">Ephesians  4:9</a>).<a name=472:17></a> Nobody can go lower, but it is in love, that He might come up again and take us up and have us in heaven.<a name=472:18></a> That is the gospel in Ephesians; it is the gospel of ascent.<a name=472:19></a> "By grace are ye saved through faith"; that is in a passage that tells us that God has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places (chapter 2:5,6).<a name=472:20></a> He has taken us away altogether from the earth; that is the full thought of God, and to secure it the Lord Jesus goes down to the bottom of the mountains.<a name=472:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The answer to the prayer is that the fish is directed to dry land.<a name=473:13></a> Every inch taken in that sea towards the dry land spoke of obedience to the will of God.<a name=473:14></a> That fish was wholly subservient to the will of God.<a name=473:15></a> The word came to him, and he vomited up Jonah.<a name=473:16></a> Jonah had already said, "Salvation is of Jehovah".<a name=473:17></a> That is to say, God had taken him up, as all of us, for His own pleasure.<a name=473:18></a> If Jonah is a saved man, it is for Himself.<a name=473:19></a> So he says, "I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving".<a name=473:20></a> Think of that!<a name=473:21></a> Did not that reach the ears of God?<a name=473:22></a> Was there ever a fish (a "living creature") more living than this one?<a name=473:23></a> Within him was a praying man, a sacrificing man, a praising man, and a worshipping man.<a name=473:24></a> What a scene -- a veritable temple right down in the depths of the Mediterranean, by the mighty power of God!<a name=473:25></a> That is salvation; that is what God can effect.<a name=473:26></a> You may not believe it, but there is here a marvellous testimony to the power of God in the gospel.<a name=473:27></a> What He did for Jonah He is ready to do for any sinner here
