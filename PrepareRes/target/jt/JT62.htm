	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> It is in mind to speak of "the way", an expression which is found several times in the Acts.<a name=1:2></a> It is thought to refer now to Paul in chapter 9, but the expression is also used in relation to the assembly at Ephesus and also that at Corinth.<a name=1:3></a> The thought of the way requires some consideration on our part so that we may understand it.<a name=1:4></a> It is found in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10">Mark  10</a>, but in Acts it has a particular significance, being used in a sense not generally employed or understood in ordinary language amongst men.<a name=1:5></a> It is there used as denoting God's ways in Christ or God's way in Christ; His way although the world and out of it.<a name=1:6></a> In Paul's whole experience undoubtedly it had a great place, and the idea is seen in what is known as the Appian Way, which records what the Romans had in mind in pursuing their way in the world.<a name=1:7></a> In a system like Mohammedanism, or any other religious system such as is recognised in the world the term is not used, as far as one understands, in the sense in which it is used in Christianity, in which sense we shall consider it at this time.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thought that it would be suitable to speak of Paul first, who as unconverted, was opposed to the way.<a name=1:9></a> Therefore, we have to speak of it negatively in regard to him until he was converted, as recorded in this chapter.<a name=1:10></a> The Spirit of God refers to the way on several occasions after Saul was converted, as we see in chapters 18, 19 and 22, so that it has now acquired the significance of which we have just spoken; that is, as denoting a system as in Christianity; a system of doctrine and principles and manners, which should mark us and govern us as distinct from any other system of things in the world.<a name=1:11></a> Christianity denotes essential qualities and not

	<div class="paragraph">
		simply confessions, the word itself being derived from the word 'Christian'.<a name=2:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>the disciples were first "called Christians".<a name=2:2></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>records the conduct of Paul, the persecution which he conducted for a considerable time under the guidance and authority of the Jewish priesthood.<a name=2:3></a> As is well known, Christianity has suffered down the ages on the same principle from the accredited religions of the world, especially from those professedly Christian but who are nevertheless apostate.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:5></a> Would we gather from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:2">Acts  9:2</a>, that "the way" was already a known course of things?<a name=2:6></a> It says, "so that if he found any who were of the way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem".<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> I think that confirms what has been said.<a name=2:9></a> The word says, "so that if he found any who were of the way".<a name=2:10></a> The article indicates that the term was well understood as denoting the profession of Christianity, as we speak of it now.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:12></a> You distinguished just now between Christianity and Christendom.<a name=2:13></a> Is it not very necessary for us to appreciate that Christendom has departed from the way?<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:15></a> Hence the necessity for separation so that as the way comes into our minds and into our phraseology it is quite intelligible.<a name=2:16></a> It includes the fellowship of God's Son, the fellowship of His death, the fellowship of the Spirit, and of the saints.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:18></a> Does the expression "the way" suggest what is distinctive?<a name=2:19></a> I was thinking of the reference in the Acts to the Epicureans, Stoics, the Sadducees and the like?<a name=2:20></a> "The way" suggests something very different from all such.<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:22></a> It does.<a name=2:23></a> It is not that we designate ourselves, but as Paul says, "In the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers' God".<a name=2:24></a> It would be so regarded as over against those elements that you mention.<a name=2:25></a>

		F.B.<a name=3:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>Abraham's servant says, "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren".<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:3></a> That corresponds with what we are saying.<a name=3:4></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>it is said of Apollos, that he was instructed in the way of God more exactly, by Aquila and Priscilla.<a name=3:5></a> That confirms what has been said; it amplifies it and makes it most definite.<a name=3:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=3:7></a>T.<a name=3:8></a> They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles.<a name=3:9></a> Is that characteristic of the way?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> That would be the idea.<a name=3:12></a> The apostles as a company, as a set of ministers, were twelve.<a name=3:13></a> The Lord Jesus unfolded the truth, and instead of saying the teaching of Jesus, or the teaching of Moses, or David; it is the teaching of the apostles.<a name=3:14></a> "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers", and that, of course, held its ground for a long time.<a name=3:15></a> Paul and others came into it, but the primary reference is to the twelve, showing that Christianity is a system, and as we had yesterday it is set forth in persons qualified to join in the service.<a name=3:16></a> The Lord Himself inaugurated it and in doing so we are told He appointed twelve.<a name=3:17></a> Matthew tells us that, also Mark and Luke, but Mark says, "that they might be with him".<a name=3:18></a> He sent them forth to preach, and we are old also that He sent them forth by two and two.<a name=3:19></a> Then following on that we have seventy others, showing how the system became extended.<a name=3:20></a> The principle of twelve governs the position as setting out the manner, the Lord's way of inaugurating Christianity and establishing it in this world.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=3:22></a> Is what you have in mind referred to in Hebrews as the new and living way?<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:24></a> We shall have to consider that a little; "the new and living way which he has dedicated for us", alludes more to the order, we might say, of the service

		of God.<a name=4:1></a> That, of course, enters into the way, but more as dealing with certain features of divine service.<a name=4:2></a> The way is dedicated for us through the veil.<a name=4:3></a> The Lord has designated it for us in that way.<a name=4:4></a> I think it is well to differentiate.<a name=4:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>the special order, or, as I may say, the ritual of the service of God is in mind, whereas what we are dealing with now includes the preaching, and the unfolding of truth and principles publicly in the world.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=4:7></a> Is that why the way, and those who are of it are exposed to persecution?<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:9></a> That is what we get here.<a name=4:10></a> Whether there was persecution at the beginning we cannot say; it arose very early, but the service was set up and the preaching was inaugurated by Peter, and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>describes the facts relative to it and how the Lord added to the assembly, the term "assembly" being implied although not actually stated.<a name=4:11></a> "The Lord added .<a name=4:12></a>.<a name=4:13></a>.<a name=4:14></a> daily those that were to be saved"; so that it is a matter of the public system of salvation which I think is more particularly in mind.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:16></a> Is Paul, this great servant, brought into that in a special way, and for a special reason?<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:18></a> Yes, and that will come in more fully later.<a name=4:19></a> We are now dealing with Paul as opposed to the way and as attacking it; understanding what it meant and attacking it.<a name=4:20></a> It is not unseemly, I think, that we should take account of him thus because he is our apostle; that is to say, the apostle of the gentiles, he takes account of himself in that way.<a name=4:21></a> He says, "For <i>I</i> am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:9">1 Corinthians  15:9</a>.<a name=4:22></a> He disqualifies himself and makes out that he is the least of all on this line, so that he becomes an example to us in service in that sense.<a name=4:23></a> He violently attacked the way.<a name=4:24></a> He had been doing so for some time, as

		it says, "But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest and asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem".<a name=5:1></a> He was an instrument of the devil who is the destroyer, and he does not endeavour to disguise the fact.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:3></a> I suppose the attack against the way is kept up continually?<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:5></a> "Still breathing out" shows that it was an inward thing.<a name=5:6></a> The idea of breathing has to be linked with the use of the word in this book.<a name=5:7></a> The Holy Spirit coming in to inaugurate this way, to set it up, is viewed as the very breath of God.<a name=5:8></a> The very inwards of God are involved, so that we can see how Saul's attitude shows antagonism to God Himself, not only to the saints, but to the whole system of Christianity.<a name=5:9></a> It was expressed in those "called Christians".<a name=5:10></a> The word so used would not then include unconverted persons.<a name=5:11></a> People now refer to Christians meaning that they are not Jews, but the word 'Christian' in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>denotes a really converted person, a true follower of Christ.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:13></a> Is that seen in Stephen?<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:15></a> In him we come to something that marks an outstanding servant, one who, in a little while, though not an apostle, purchased to himself a good degree and much boldness in faith, and he became most efficient in setting out the whole truth that led up to Christianity.<a name=5:16></a> According to the record in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>he ably set out the whole position from the beginning, from Abraham being called out by the God of glory; it is a wonderful unfolding, made with feeling, leading up to the first martyrdom of Christianity.<a name=5:17></a> I am sure you are right in saying that he is marked by all this of which we have been speaking.<a name=5:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:1></a> Would those who were in the way be such as were seen walking with God before?<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:3></a> Well, that is so.<a name=6:4></a> You see it in Mark in blind Bartimaeus.<a name=6:5></a> It says he "followed him in the way".<a name=6:6></a> He was converted, and he recognised the claims of the Lord Jesus.<a name=6:7></a> It was a peculiar position, it was near to the crossing of the Jordan as entering Canaan proper.<a name=6:8></a> It says he "followed him in the way", not simply that he followed Jesus, but he followed Him in the way.<a name=6:9></a> No doubt primarily it would be the ordinary idea of a way, but the significance of it enters into what we have been saying.<a name=6:10></a> It was the way of Jesus, all that would mark Him.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.C.<a name=6:12></a>S.<a name=6:13></a>P.<a name=6:14></a> Does the expression <i>the way</i>, as you have been referring to it, involve a beginning and an end, and would the beginning be in all the things that Jesus began both to do and to teach?<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:16></a> I would think that was so; a beginning and an end.<a name=6:17></a> The word <i>end</i> is not to be overlooked for it says, "Then the end", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:24">1 Corinthians  15:24</a>); that is, the end of all revelation, as it were; God Himself being the end.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.S.<a name=6:19></a>P.<a name=6:20></a> Would the way, in the sense you are now speaking of it, be God's great answer to the exercise of the prophet when he said, "I know, Jehovah, that the way of man is not his own; it is not in a man that walketh to direct his steps" <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#10:23">Jeremiah  10:23</a>?<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:22></a> That is quite apropos to what we are saying.<a name=6:23></a> It is not in man, it is in God.<a name=6:24></a> The way comes out from God, and, therefore, the Spirit comes in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>as violent breathing.<a name=6:25></a> It says, "And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting".<a name=6:26></a> Christianity thus emanates from God, its power from the very inwards of God, speaking most reverently.<a name=6:27></a> In Saul the breathing was on the line of destruction and violent opposition to God.<a name=6:28></a>

		T.G.<a name=7:1></a> Would it be right to say that the Spirit of God is in the way as seen in Abraham's servant in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>?<a name=7:2></a> He says "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren".<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:4></a> Just so.<a name=7:5></a> "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:27">Genesis  24:27</a>.<a name=7:6></a> It is a type of the Spirit of God.<a name=7:7></a> The servant in Abraham's house is unnamed.<a name=7:8></a> It is the Spirit that is in mind, really.<a name=7:9></a> It is a remarkable thing that it says "the man was astonished" at Rebecca.<a name=7:10></a> Her way was heavenly, I would say, and she is a type of the assembly.<a name=7:11></a> What we are speaking of is a question of the assembly.<a name=7:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.A.<a name=7:13></a> It would appear from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>that though the Lord is on high actually, yet in another sense He is here, for He says to Saul, "Why dost thou persecute me?<a name=7:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:15></a> Exactly.<a name=7:16></a> He is here.<a name=7:17></a> According to this record it is not simply that the Lord is coming in in the way He comes to us in assembly, as we say, which is by the Spirit no doubt.<a name=7:18></a> It was not by the Spirit that He came to Saul, but He was there Himself.<a name=7:19></a> It says, "Suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven, and falling on the earth he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?<a name=7:20></a> And he said, Who art thou, Lord?<a name=7:21></a> And he said, <i>I</i> am Jesus, whom <i>thou</i> persecutest".<a name=7:22></a> The Lord doubtless is active on earth, especially on the first day of the week, but in general that would be impersonation by the Spirit.<a name=7:23></a> He would use the Spirit in that sense, but that would not apply here.<a name=7:24></a> It is the Lord personally coming out from heaven to Saul.<a name=7:25></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, verses 5 to 8 say, "He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.<a name=7:26></a> Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep.<a name=7:27></a> Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to <i>me</i> also".<a name=7:28></a> So it is a real

		J.T.<a name=8:4></a> Quite so; from heaven and not from Jerusalem.<a name=8:5></a> The Lord Himself came out of heaven, which is another thing.<a name=8:6></a> I would say that it was a physical appearing of the Lord Jesus in His own Person, and nothing less than that.<a name=8:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:12></a> I would say the same thing happened.<a name=8:13></a> The Lord personally came to meet him and to speak to him.<a name=8:14></a> He made a great point of distinguishing Paul in view of all that He would use him for; the Lord had in mind that he should be thoroughly imbued with the truth.<a name=8:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=17:10></a> The Lord was still recognising Jerusalem, but the probable use of the plural word "assemblies" may signify that the local idea was coming to light.<a name=17:11></a> Chapter 14, however, is definite; "having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed".<a name=17:12></a> Then Paul and Barnabas moved on as if the work were finished.<a name=17:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=18:8></a> If it be a question of assembly service I should say, By all means.<a name=18:9></a> The gatherings should be kept small, as near as possible to what the Lord indicates, that is fifties; so that one was added here during this week-end because of the influx of brethren from different parts.<a name=18:10></a> In America the same thing is done and has proved to be profitable, for large meetings in these special times become unwieldy.<a name=18:11></a> Years ago at large meetings we used to have two or more cups, and more than one loaf, but the Lord has helped us as to the order which should govern assembly service, involving the size of meetings.<a name=18:12></a> I mention all this because of the reference we have made to the use of the plural word in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:31">Acts  9:31</a>: "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit".<a name=18:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=48:1></a> The verses in chapter 20 are read to link our subject with Paul's ministry, and it is clear that the Lord's supper is part of "the way".<a name=48:2></a> The verses read in chapter 2 may be taken as a primary indication of "the way"; that is, the way things were done.<a name=48:3></a> It refers in that section to the Lord's supper twice; "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (verse 42); and then, "every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people; and the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved" (verse 46).<a name=48:4></a> These remarks may be rightly linked with the references to the Lord's supper in the gospels, showing that it was an essential part of the divine way of the testimony.<a name=48:5></a> It is mentioned by Matthew, as is well known, also by Mark and by Luke, and then Paul in his epistle to the Corinthians mentions it very fully.<a name=48:6></a> It may be noted, that there it is a further communication from the Lord, and should be taken as the final word as to the Lord's supper.<a name=48:7></a> It eliminates some of the things mentioned in the synoptic gospels and it adds other things.<a name=48:8></a> This thought should be particularly under our notice on this occasion, because the Lord has revived the truth as to the Supper, and greatly enlarged on it for the edification of the brethren, and peculiar reference is to be made to the instruction furnished by Paul.<a name=48:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=77:1></a> Inquiry was made as to Samson last evening, and it was thought that a consideration of his history would help on the line which has been before us already, especially the feminine side of the truth.<a name=77:2></a> There is no section of the book of Judges more interesting or more important than that which treats of Samson, especially from the standpoint of his birth and what led up to it, Manoah's wife being presented as more spiritual than her husband.<a name=77:3></a> The spiritual side was before us last evening as seen in the daughters of Zelophehad who knew how to "speak right" in the presence of God, also in the presence of Moses and the elders of Israel.<a name=77:4></a> Manoah's wife discerned that an angel had visited her, and while her husband said that some mischief would befall them, she asserted that, "If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and an oblation at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would he at this time have told us such things as these".<a name=77:5></a> She is a discerning intelligent woman, which in the main was in mind yesterday, and it is in mind now.<a name=77:6></a> The history of Samson proves the feminine side in that sense.<a name=77:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=82:5></a> Well, it is clearly an allusion to the death of Christ and the sweetness of the ministry; and then following upon that the Spirit of God implies in chapter 16 the resurrection of Christ in what Samson did when he "seized the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and tore them up with the bar, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron".<a name=82:6></a> Added to chapter 15 this is a remarkable testimony to the power of God operative in His servant.<a name=82:7></a> In chapter 15 we have the great exploit of Samson.<a name=82:8></a> It says, "the Philistines shouted against him.<a name=82:9></a> And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and the cords that were on his arms became as threads of flax that are burned with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.<a name=82:10></a> And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand and took it, and slew with it a thousand men.<a name=82:11></a> And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, a heap, two heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men.<a name=82:12></a> And it came to pass when he had ended speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-Lehi.<a name=82:13></a> And he was very thirsty, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou hast given by the hand of thy servant this great deliverance, and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?<a name=82:14></a> And God clave the hollow rock which was in Lehi, and water came out of it.<a name=82:15></a> And he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived.<a name=82:16></a> Therefore its name was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day".<a name=82:17></a>

		It seems to me that chapter 15 suggests the thought of power, especially the Spirit's power, in the water by which he was refreshed.<a name=83:1></a> And then in chapter 16 the exploit at Gazah would point to the resurrection of Christ, and not only that, but to the purposes of God reached through it.<a name=83:2></a> It says at the end of the third verse alluding to the gates, that he "tore them up with the bar, and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron".<a name=83:3></a> The shoulders suggest strength, and Hebron alludes to what antedates the world and to the greatest thoughts we can have.<a name=83:4></a> All this lies in the Spirit, but then it is real power too, the masculine thought of power -- the two shoulders.<a name=83:5></a> Then we have the failure, which is of course distressing, but at the same time the chapters provide a great delineation of the truth, it may be in relation to the individual, but particularly dispensational truth.<a name=83:6></a> So it says the hair began to grow.<a name=83:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=83:12></a> Quite so.<a name=83:13></a> That all links on with what we are saying, and the heifer is a very suggestive thought; "my heifer" he calls her, although he never really secured her.<a name=83:14></a> The heifer is typical of great affection.<a name=83:15></a> It is a female thought suggesting great affection.<a name=83:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>, Abram was to secure a heifer amongst other creatures there, and I believe that whatever Samson may have understood, the Spirit of God means that the feminine thought was there, and in due course Christ would secure it; Christ would have the assembly.<a name=83:17></a> But God uses the Philistines to deny Samson what he sought.<a name=83:18></a> It must

		J.T.<a name=91:1></a> It is in mind to consider love as the dominating element in priesthood.<a name=91:2></a> That is why the verses in chapter 21 were read because in Exodus Aaron is not formally called a priest until after love is introduced.<a name=91:3></a> This is according to a principle which was set out in Adam in naming the creatures of God as they came to him, for the thing was named as it was there characteristically.<a name=91:4></a> Aaron is much spoken of before, but is not formally named as priest until chapter 28.<a name=91:5></a> This comes in after chapter 21 which refers to love.<a name=91:6></a> Aaron is introduced because he had suitable qualities, but particularly brotherly love as seen in chapter 4.<a name=91:7></a> Love is seen in chapter 21, and it is to be noted there because of its ascending, descending and horizontal activities.<a name=91:8></a> Aaron is seen as having a quality that Moses professed to lack, that is, the power of speech.<a name=91:9></a> God said to Moses, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=91:10></a> I know that he can speak well.<a name=91:11></a> And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart.<a name=91:12></a> And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.<a name=91:13></a> And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God".<a name=91:14></a> What is in mind to consider now is the love system, a system in which there would be God, and Moses representing the word of God, and then Aaron, not the priest, but the prophet.<a name=91:15></a> It is a question of speaking, of what God would say in a public way in order to make His mind known and to assert His rights.<a name=91:16></a> It is important that things should be said rightly.<a name=91:17></a> It will be noted that in chapter 7 Aaron is

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=95:4></a> So chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians, which deals with love, comes between chapter 12 where we have the gifts and chapter 14 where we see the gifts, especially the gift of prophecy, being exercised.<a name=95:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=95:6></a> That is it.<a name=95:7></a> The apostle had in mind to write much, and had already written much, but in the ministry he was thinking of the persons who were involved in the discipline.<a name=95:8></a> Chapter 5 brings out the discipline and Paul told them what to do in the exercise of it, but then there was really more in the man than even Paul intimated, because he was restored quicker than it was expected he would be.<a name=95:9></a> He had sinned grievously, but he was able to meet the thing in confession and so quickly was he restored that the brethren did not keep pace with the restoration, and this is often the case.<a name=95:10></a> We must keep pace with the recovery and confirm it.<a name=95:11></a> So the second epistle is to bring out the need of confirmation and that should be in the judgment of the brethren at Corinth, so that the brother should be set free in freedom, and be allowed to breathe, as one might say, the Spirit of Jesus, the spirit of forgiveness.<a name=95:12></a> The Lord breathed into them so that they should be qualified to forgive.<a name=95:13></a> Why should we continue in hardness and in legal exaction amongst ourselves when the Lord's mind is that we should all be set free?<a name=95:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=120:1></a> This scripture is proposed not only because it instructs us as to the promises of God, but also because the apostasy and the consequences of it are contemplated in it as the alternative to the appropriation of the promises.<a name=120:2></a> The non-appropriation of the promises will mean falling away; that is, apostasy.<a name=120:3></a> The chapter is intended to strengthen us in the truth so that we should go on to the end, as it says, that "we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil, where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec".<a name=120:4></a> The writer is aiming throughout the whole epistle to get the saints steadily going on and entering into the holiest, which is the final thought.<a name=120:5></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>of the day drawing near; that is to say, faith discerns the circumstances of the moment, and notes that the day is drawing near.<a name=120:6></a> It is not simply the end of this dispensation, but <i>the day</i> drawing near, and this chapter is intended to strengthen us to go on.<a name=120:7></a> It is intended therefore that we should understand and use the ways and means by which we can pursue the way of God until the end; this is in mind throughout the epistle.<a name=120:8></a>

		I have read this section in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>because of verse 11, "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".<a name=204:1></a> All that I have to say will centre around that verse, as bearing on this great moment; I mean the present moment, and all that enters into it, so as to impress us here at this time with the great responsibility resting upon us; that no one may regard themselves as irresponsible, but each one knowing what rests upon him, accepting it and doing what it involves.<a name=204:2></a> Luke begins his second treatise, as you will all remember, by mentioning what the Lord began both to do and to teach, doing first and then teaching.<a name=204:3></a> It is our hope that the teaching may proceed, the teaching that began, as John records, with the Lord Jesus who, as here in the flesh, is called Teacher in the early pages of that gospel.<a name=204:4></a> Mary Magdalene takes up the thought and furnishes a word that is peculiar, saying, "Rabboni"; He was her Teacher; not simply that He was a Teacher, but He was hers.<a name=204:5></a> In the case of Mary of Bethany, we have the anointing of the Lord's head; this is mentioned by more than one evangelist, and of her it is said that "she hath done what she could", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:8">Mark  14:8</a>.<a name=204:6></a> That is a word, dear brethren, that I would seek to impress upon us all, "She hath done what she could".<a name=204:7></a> She anointed the Lord's head, which would mean that she recognised the divine intelligence that was there and available for her.<a name=204:8></a> Elsewhere she is seen sitting at the feet of Jesus and hearing what He said.<a name=204:9></a> That came in after the wonderful scene on the mount, called the mount of transfiguration, where the voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, hear him"; that word should impress us; "Hear him".<a name=204:10></a>

		Following this the Lord said of Mary as she sat listening to His word, "Mary has chosen the good part, the which shall not be taken from her"; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>.<a name=205:1></a> Such expressions by the Lord would refer to His power, and what He will do, as we see it here in the passage I have read, when He speaks of Himself as the One "who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open".<a name=205:2></a> As with Mary, the good part could not be taken from her, so we can see, dear brethren, how the Lord would impress us with the impregnability of the protection He affords us, and the defence and support too that He affords us, so that we need not fear.<a name=205:3></a> Another word that is to be noted specially, occurring in the holy pages from the Old Testament and down to the Lord's last writings to the assembly, is "Fear not".<a name=205:4></a> The present situation politically, industrially, socially and financially is full of fear, but the Lord's word to us, I am assured, is "Fear not".<a name=205:5></a> I spoke of it before I crossed the Atlantic this time, I felt it was a word to the brethren in America, and I say it to you, dear brethren, now; the atmosphere all round us is charged with fear, nations fearing each other industrially, and otherwise; but the word to us is "Fear not".<a name=205:6></a> That word carries with it almighty power, almighty protection, whatever scientific men, so-called, may say, whatever dangers exist, and the hidden dangers, they are not intended to cause <i>us</i> to fear.<a name=205:7></a>

		I have taken up these scriptures, as I said, with the thought before me of the word of the Lord to His assembly, saying to her, "Behold, I come quickly; hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown".<a name=205:8></a> That word comes like the blast of a trumpet in war, like the silver trumpets in the book of Numbers which were to be employed in the case of war.<a name=205:9></a> I intend to compass all the verses read in some sense and particularly

		because of John.<a name=206:1></a> You may say, It should be because of the Lord, and of course it is; but the Lord is pleased to distinguish His own bondmen, and they are to be in mind, not always, but prominent at certain times.<a name=206:2></a> At times when love is in question John is in evidence; he is the disciple whom Jesus loved, which clearly would mean that he was a lover, he understood love, one of the most important things to understand.<a name=206:3></a> John quotes the Lord as saying, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>.<a name=206:4></a> This is what marks off Christianity from all other associations or societies; it has love in it, and John the evangelist, the writer of the gospel and the three epistles bearing his name, was the actual writer of this book.<a name=206:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord is Himself the designer of the book and the author of it too, but He tells John how to write it.<a name=206:6></a> It is remarkable that John should be taken up in this peculiar way as a writer; in fact it is John who says, that if all the things which Jesus did were written, he supposed that "even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written".<a name=206:7></a> But he said, "These are written", that is to say, he calls attention to his own composition, and, of course, a servant whom the Lord employs in this sense ought not to be ashamed to call attention to his own words; if the Lord is not ashamed of them he need not be himself.<a name=206:8></a> So John says, "These are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life in his name".<a name=206:9></a> Many things are to be held in His name; salvation is in His name, life is in His name.<a name=206:10></a> The great question of life which the Lord Himself has brought up within the memory of some of us, the great question of eternal life, is still a burning question and will be till the end.<a name=206:11></a> So John says, "These are written that ye may believe

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in order that I should thus speak, because of what the Lord says to John here.<a name=207:2></a> It really is a conversation, as you might say, between the Lord and John, who in sitting down to carry out his holy task of writing this book, places certain verses at the outset; a foreword for us so as to introduce us into the great subject of the Apocalypse, a subject which came in late in the history of revelation.<a name=207:3></a> Things had begun to wane and flag; disloyalty had come in.<a name=207:4></a> It is recorded in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13">Mark  13</a>that He said that neither the angels nor Himself knew certain things; that is, the day and the hour of His coming; only the Father knew.<a name=207:5></a> This is one of the most interesting matters, and undoubtedly His words link on with this wonderful book called the Apocalypse which is said to have been given to Him by God.<a name=207:6></a> John, in writing this book, embellishes it at the outset, calling attention to the Deity and other matters in relation to God, and to the assembly too; so that we are introduced into the book with most blessed suggestions.<a name=207:7></a> In verse 4 we read, "John to the seven churches which are in Asia", and then he speaks of the blessing which is ours, saying that God has "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages, Amen.<a name=207:8></a> Behold he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him.<a name=207:9></a> Yea.<a name=207:10></a> Amen.<a name=207:11></a> I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty".<a name=207:12></a> These are assertions of Deity, of Him "who is, and who was, and who is to come".<a name=207:13></a>

		We can see how nobly John served his Lord and Master in writing this book, and in doing what was needed in order to present it to be read.<a name=208:1></a> He adds a premium to the reading of it, which we ought to take notice of.<a name=208:2></a> It is hardly found anywhere else, but in this book.<a name=208:3></a> This book is to be read; not to be thought by anyone as too hard to be understood, but to be read and read and read again.<a name=208:4></a> It will be understood as we read it; as Habakkuk says of his prophecy "that he may run that readeth it" (chapter 2: 2).<a name=208:5></a> This book is written for that purpose, because these are most urgent times and they are short too.<a name=208:6></a> The Lord says in the verse 1 had particularly in mind that the crown might be snatched from us, so that we are to be continually on the alert, so that we may not be robbed of our greatest distinction.<a name=208:7></a> We are not told what the crown is, and that makes it all the more precious.<a name=208:8></a> We are to see to it that it is not snatched from us, stolen from us.<a name=208:9></a> We are to be always on the alert, to be doing; that is the principle.<a name=208:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as I said, John is taken up by the Lord, and he says, "I turned to see the voice", showing that he was an alert attendant to what was being done.<a name=208:11></a> Earlier he says that he heard a voice behind him, but here he turned to see the voice, a remarkable thing, and then he tells us what he did see.<a name=208:12></a> I mention things in this order for the sake especially of the young ones, because they are the coming generation; one generation passes away and another comes; that is going on constantly, yet the Lord at the very beginning of the dispensation said, "Surely I come quickly".<a name=208:13></a> We have to understand that.<a name=208:14></a> It was said to the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest?<a name=208:15></a>" we have to understand the statements of Scripture.<a name=208:16></a> So the Lord said, "Surely I come quickly".<a name=208:17></a> If He had said that 1800 years ago, He meant that certain things must happen.<a name=208:18></a> He is under

		As John undertakes his task, he says, "I turned to see the voice".<a name=209:4></a> There may have been many things on the horizon that might have diverted him, but he was not diverted; he turned to see the voice, and what he saw was similar to what Isaac saw when Rebecca was coming; instead of noting that Rebecca was coming, Isaac, we are told, saw the camels coming.<a name=209:5></a> So here, what John sees first are the candlesticks.<a name=209:6></a> Isaac saw what carried Rebecca, and John saw that in the midst of which the Lord Jesus Himself was; namely, in the midst of the golden candlesticks; in other words, in the midst of the assemblies; that is where He is.<a name=209:7></a> The Lord Jesus speaks about it as regards the service of God saying, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".<a name=209:8></a> You may say, 'I can praise God anywhere'; but He says, "In the midst of the assembly".<a name=209:9></a> Let us understand that, and let us be ready to join in the song.<a name=209:10></a> "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", shows that in the Lord's mind, the assembly is essential.<a name=209:11></a> It was not essential to the creation primarily, nor even to the creation described in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>; not even angels are seen in the work in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>.<a name=209:12></a> God Himself said, "Let there be light, and there was light".<a name=209:13></a> God did it; in truth it was the Lord Jesus.<a name=209:14></a> I say with joy and glory, that the Lord Jesus is said to have created all things and "without him not one thing received being that has received being"; and so John does not record any assistance, as it were, in the creation.<a name=209:15></a> But when we come to the assembly, then persons are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John was brought in in a peculiar way, as I said, so he says, "I turned to see the voice", and what he saw was seven golden lamps or candlesticks and "in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man".<a name=210:3></a> As there the Lord is now intent on an operation which is described throughout the book and He is taking the saints with Him, the assembly is with Him.<a name=210:4></a> There may be things He does alone, I quite admit that, but in general the position is that the saints have part in the divine operations, and that is what John saw, "seven golden lamps and in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet".<a name=210:5></a> How marvellous these verses are!<a name=210:6></a> and John says, "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not".<a name=210:7></a> I have already touched upon it, and I am sure the Lord would dispel from our hearts every kind of fear; instead of that the word is, "Fear God".<a name=210:8></a> "Fear not those who kill the body and after this have no more that they can do".<a name=210:9></a> Although the cities may be wiped out, as men speak, yet after that they have no more that they can do.<a name=210:10></a> "Yea, I say to you, fear him", that is, God.<a name=210:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now John says, "When I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades".<a name=210:12></a> In approaching this wonderful book in this way through the servant whom the Lord is pleased to signalise by causing him to write

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to chapter 3, just to show how this matter spoken of in verse 11 is reached, and I want to leave the brethren with this verse at the close of this remarkable time we have had.<a name=211:16></a> We are to hold fast what we have; "hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown".<a name=211:17></a> The Lord is, as I was saying, implying that we are not to be robbed; not indeed that we are to put things under lock and key, so to speak; that is not the idea.<a name=211:18></a> We are not told what the crown is that is alluded to.<a name=211:19></a> We were saying today that the saints themselves at times are called crowns, and there is no suggestion

		of their being hidden or concealed; they are to remain in the activity of love, and that is why they are called crowns.<a name=212:1></a> Any one of us could be a crown to the Lord Jesus or even to the saints; Paul says to the Philippians, "My brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown".<a name=212:2></a> In addressing the assembly in Philadelphia the Lord Jesus calls Himself the holy and the true; the Lord Jesus is naming Himself thus.<a name=212:3></a> What thoughts to be in our hearts, holiness and truth!<a name=212:4></a> He says, 'I have the key of David', as much as to say, I am ready to attribute to you refinement spiritually, not worldly refinement, but refinement spiritually, that is what we get in Philadelphia.<a name=212:5></a> And so the Lord here refers to David, saying, "These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man shutteth; and shutteth and no man openeth".<a name=212:6></a> The whole book has to be read in order to get at the thought of the Spirit of God as to David, and to see what characterises him.<a name=212:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The very best suggestions as to refinement are found in the Lord Jesus, they are found in the saints too in principle, because of the Spirit of God being in us.<a name=212:8></a> So He says, "I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star".<a name=212:9></a> Our hearts should be thrilled with these thoughts, they are sobering and glorious, and they are also applicable to us, for we belong to the Lord Jesus, we belong to the assembly.<a name=212:10></a> So He says, "<i>I</i> Jesus .<a name=212:11></a>.<a name=212:12></a>.<a name=212:13></a> testify these things to you in the assemblies".<a name=212:14></a> He is dealing with the greatest things, and that is what I wish to impress all with.<a name=212:15></a> He says to Philadelphia, "I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an opened door".<a name=212:16></a> He has done it already, and it is for us to enter in, for it is a door "which no one can shut".<a name=212:17></a> None can interfere with the Lord, He has almighty power.<a name=212:18></a> So He goes on to assure us that we are able to have to do with these matters,

		and He says, "because thou hast a little power;" it is but a little of the real thing, but again, "and hast kept my word"; not My commandment, but My word; that which opens things up for us and illuminates us; "and hast not denied my name".<a name=213:1></a> Life is in that Name, but many other things; salvation and all the matters relative to the service of God are in it.<a name=213:2></a> So that while we repudiate all mere officialism and clericalism as not of God, we revere the name of Jesus.<a name=213:3></a>

		<i>Christian</i>.<a name=216:1></a> Peter employs it, although writing to Jewish exiles, and he says to them, "if any man suffer as a Christian", not as a Jew, but as a Christian, and it meant suffering to be a Christian.<a name=216:2></a> When Agrippa said to Paul, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian", Paul's reply was that he himself was that, but he wished that all that were there including Agrippa were that, were Christians; that they should be as Paul, "except these bonds".<a name=216:3></a> He did not wish anyone to have them, and clearly the idea of overcoming was there in Paul.<a name=216:4></a>

		I have read from John's epistle to bring out this thought of overcoming in relation to Christianity.<a name=216:5></a> Christianity is not comparable at all with any human sect or system on the earth.<a name=216:6></a> It is a heavenly product and the Spirit of God glorifies it in those who are Christians and who as such are overcomers.<a name=216:7></a> Hence John in the verses read, says, "Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.<a name=216:8></a> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=216:9></a>" These verses speak of overcoming, and also give the way of it, the facts that lead to it.<a name=216:10></a> The thought that all that has been begotten of God overcometh the world, alludes to the generative power of God; not simply that one is born anew, or born again, for that is not quite so advanced in the work of God; new birth is basic, and without it nobody can be a Christian, nor an overcomer, but more is needed and that is included in the term, "born of God".<a name=216:11></a> There are many who regard the thought of "born again" as if it meant "born of God", but it is not that, it is not quite so far on as that.<a name=216:12></a> Persons in the millennium will be "born again".<a name=216:13></a> Indeed, without new birth we can have no part or lot properly in divine matters, but John in his epistle is dealing with more than that.<a name=216:14></a>

		He is the evangelist who especially deals with new birth, but here he is speaking of "born of God".<a name=217:1></a> Peter also speaks of it, but John alludes much to it, and therefore those who would seek help and guidance as to the fulness of the truth should refer to John.<a name=217:2></a> Many are content with what is short of the fulness of the truth.<a name=217:3></a> John, in speaking of the Lord, tells us of His fulness, that is, of Christ's fulness, and no-one should be content with less.<a name=217:4></a> So here John says, "whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world".<a name=217:5></a> The idea is what is new as to birth, but what is implied is <i>persons</i>, not merely material.<a name=217:6></a> In the gospel (chapter 3), the Lord says that no-one can see the kingdom of God unless he be "born anew", but we have more than that here, and the better translation says, "For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world".<a name=217:7></a> Much has to be said by way of expansion, for John is abstract, as has often been remarked, which means that he is saying some things and leaving out other things which could be said.<a name=217:8></a> <i>Whatsoever</i> here implies much that could be said, but the abstract idea is very brief, as intended, so that many may be included; indeed all that are born of God are included.<a name=217:9></a> It is a very wide and comprehensive thought and a very blessed thought, for Christians are outside of the things in the world and superior to it.<a name=217:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next statement is that "this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith".<a name=217:11></a> I am speaking of what John makes much of, for he speaks much as to overcoming, particularly in the book of Revelation, of which I shall speak in a moment.<a name=217:12></a> The word is used there many times, firstly in every epistle to the seven assemblies.<a name=217:13></a> They had seven letters written to them, and in each letter there was a special word to the overcomer and much promised by way of reward.<a name=217:14></a> The Lord speaks of Himself in the seventh letter, saying, "I also have

		overcome and have sat down with my Father in its throne".<a name=218:1></a> The Lord is tonight on His Father's throne as an Overcomer, and He is saying that this is open to us.<a name=218:2></a> The honour of sitting down with Him, not on His Father's throne, but on His own throne, and that throne is future.<a name=218:3></a> He is not sitting on it yet, but He will sit on it, and we shall join Him on it, and hence the greatness of the suggestion.<a name=218:4></a> The word in John's epistle is, that "this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith", and then he says, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=218:5></a>"; so that the passage goes on to a very concrete matter.<a name=218:6></a> It is addressed to all persons who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=218:7></a> But the idea of faith is the first thing.<a name=218:8></a> It seems to be set down for us as the first great thought in overcoming.<a name=218:9></a> I say the first great thought, because it is so here, and believers are to understand that, in overcoming, there is this idea of being "<i>born of God</i>" -- not simply "born again", but "born of God".<a name=218:10></a> Then so as to amplify that and clarify it, we have, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=218:11></a>"; that is a great presentation of the truth.<a name=218:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Although "our faith" is mentioned before, I refer to it, so that the brethren will all be revived in their interest in what belongs to us; it is <i>our</i> faith.<a name=218:13></a> It is not what is called a creed or religion of which there are many, but it is faith, not faith in the sense of what a person may have, but faith in the sense of the truth held in faith, and that, of course, applies to Christianity.<a name=218:14></a> It singles out Christianity in the way in which I have spoken about it, that there is nothing comparable with it at all as a system.<a name=218:15></a> I say system, for it is a system; and the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are operating in it systematically; the saints are taking part in it too.<a name=218:16></a> God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go back to what I was saying about faith.<a name=219:8></a> It is a thing that applies to Christians, and makes Christianity what it is.<a name=219:9></a> It refers to the faith period as coming into the world.<a name=219:10></a> It did not come into the world properly until Christ came into manhood, and coming here He was "the leader and completer of faith" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:2">Hebrews  12:2</a>); not indeed that it was not there before.<a name=219:11></a> It was here, hence we get it depicted down the line from Abel, but at the same time the Spirit of God says, "Jesus, the leader and completer of faith"; so that we have to look to Him, and learn from Him.<a name=219:12></a> He says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:29">Matthew  11:29</a>.<a name=219:13></a> So faith is to be learned from Christ.<a name=219:14></a> It is a universal thought in Christianity, and this is the dispensation of faith, as Paul in writing to the Galatians says, "faith having come"; that is, when Christ became Man and inaugurated the great idea

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the next dispensation comes, it will be a sight dispensation, and everything will be seen then, but now everything that is of God is to be understood by faith.<a name=220:3></a> That which is seen is not faith, but that which is not seen is eternal, and so faith links us on with what is eternal.<a name=220:4></a> Although we shall not need faith in heaven, yet it links us on with eternity, because it is the element of faith that makes everything real, but what will be by sight in the future is now by faith.<a name=220:5></a> We are designated a heavenly people as discerning things by faith, and hence the word is, "this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith".<a name=220:6></a> <i>Our</i> faith, not what a person might have himself, of which we are told in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>, "faith, so as to remove mountains".<a name=220:7></a> There is not time to explain that, but that is to be understood, that one might remove mountains by faith, yet, if one has not love, he is nothing.<a name=220:8></a> He could not be less than nothing.<a name=220:9></a> He is nothing at all spiritually, even although he have faith to remove mountains.<a name=220:10></a> I say that as calling attention to what Paul says, and that we might not be aiming at doing great things or exploits, but rather being governed by faith <i>and by love</i>.<a name=220:11></a> Faith working by love is the practical idea of Christianity.<a name=220:12></a> But the faith mentioned in this verse, "our faith", is not simply that some of us are believers, but that there is such a thing as <i>the</i> faith, which is Christianity, known as a system of truth, but known by the Spirit and understood by the Spirit; it is a system of truth, because the truth is to be held as a whole.<a name=220:13></a> The Lord Jesus is said to be the truth; the Spirit is the truth, too, but objectively the idea is applicable to Christ.<a name=220:14></a> He speaks of Himself thus in connection with other things, saying, "I am the way, and the truth, and

		the life".<a name=221:1></a> These three things are applicable to Christ, who is the truth.<a name=221:2></a> Thus the faith is the complete thing, the whole, not simply that I have part in it, for, of course, we know in part, but the Lord tells us that the Spirit will guide us into all truth.<a name=221:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The dear brethren would do well to take it to heart, not to settle down even in any known or well established doctrine, but to see that we hold things in a vital way, as maintained by the Holy Spirit, for the Spirit is the truth subjectively, even as Christ is it objectively.<a name=221:4></a> What I would seek now to make clear is that this passage, in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:4">1 John  5:4</a>, this "victory that overcometh the world, even our faith"; that is, the faith which we enjoy, which we come together constantly to look into, to speak of as the truth, is superior to anything in the world.<a name=221:5></a> The world is in mind here, and the victory is while we are here in the presence of it, and it is superior in the sense of power, the power of God, power in Christ, and in the saints.<a name=221:6></a> That we have the mind of Christ is a wonderful fact, and assures the intelligence, the power of thought that enters into this victory.<a name=221:7></a> What I am saying can only be seen when the faith is held as a whole, and held in a spiritual way, as a complete system of truth.<a name=221:8></a> Paul says that it was given to him to complete the word of God.<a name=221:9></a> I do not say that what Paul says is all, because the Old Testament is also involved as well as the gospels and other writings of the New Testament, in the truth, and matters of the faith include all these.<a name=221:10></a> These are things in which one would seek to be practical, not to be speaking over the heads of the brethren, but that all might follow, that our consciences and hearts might be affected by these things; that we might understand the greatness of the system with which we are connected, not only the system as formed of persons, but the system as formed by truth, and that truth is eternal.<a name=221:11></a> Christ

		Well, that is what I understand by the verse in John's epistle, "the victory that overcometh the world"; but then the next verse is the concrete expression of it in persons, in any one of us.<a name=222:8></a> The question asked by the apostle, by the Spirit of God, is "Who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=222:9></a>" I want to ask that question of myself, and I want all the brethren here to ask it of themselves, to see whether we really believe that "Jesus is the Son of God".<a name=222:10></a> No doubt most of us would subscribe to it, because Scripture is so plain about it, but we want to have it in our souls on the principle of faith.<a name=222:11></a> "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=222:12></a>" That is what marked Paul almost at the outset of his career as a Christian he preached that Jesus was the Son of God, and he tells us that God revealed His Son in him.<a name=222:13></a> He revealed His Son <i>to</i> Peter, but to Paul it was to the end that he might "announce him as glad tidings among the nations", so that our souls

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I proceed to the book of Revelation to show how these elements are used to overcome, not the world only, but the devil himself.<a name=223:3></a> One of the most remarkable things in chapter 12 is that the woman "brought forth a male son, who shall shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne".<a name=223:4></a> He is called a <i>male son</i>, which, of course, may be regarded as a redundant term, but the Spirit of God by it emphasises the idea of Christ's manhood as important and foundational as to His Person.<a name=223:5></a> So the chapter runs on to the overthrow of the devil, as it is said, "There was war in the heaven; Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon.<a name=223:6></a> And the dragon fought, and his angels; and he prevailed not, nor was their place found any more in the heaven.<a name=223:7></a> And the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, he who is called Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole habitable world, he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him.<a name=223:8></a> And I heard a great voice in the heaven saying, Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren has been cast out, who accused them before our God day and night: and <i>they</i> have overcome him by reason of the blood of the Lamb, and by reason of the word of their testimony, and have not loved their life even unto death".<a name=223:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are wonderful verses, and I am not reading them because of their prophetic use, but rather to make clear to everyone how the blood of the Lamb, the blood of Christ, is used in our everyday life, our business life, and household life, in travelling, and so on.<a name=223:10></a> The blood of Christ is victorious

		as it is presented here; "<i>they</i> have overcome him by reason of the blood of the Lamb, and by reason of the word of their testimony".<a name=224:1></a> It is the efficacy of it in redemption, so as to maintain our consciences clear before God and men and shelter them in the presence of the accuser.<a name=224:2></a> Our consciences are apt to fail us, save as we are kept in the full light and shining of the gospel.<a name=224:3></a> Paul says, "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>.<a name=224:4></a> It is in that light we are victorious, because we use and understand the blood of the Lamb, the redemptive power of it is a real and known thing, and Satan cannot overthrow it; even if we fail that does not overthrow it.<a name=224:5></a> The point is, that failure should not overthrow our faith.<a name=224:6></a> God has set us up in Christianity and in the Spirit and I may add, in the assembly.<a name=224:7></a> God has set us up in Christ in that wonderful system, with light as to all that Satan can employ to discredit us, to cause us to fear as to our eternal salvation.<a name=224:8></a> The devil is bent on that sort of thing.<a name=224:9></a> The blood of the Lamb, and its efficacy understood will shelter us from the attacks of the devil.<a name=224:10></a> John says they overcame "because of the blood of the Lamb".<a name=224:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says further, "and by reason of the word of their testimony".<a name=224:12></a> That is to say, the efficacy of Christ's blood has sheltered my conscience in the face of the devil's attacks, and has caused me to be restful in the presence of God, because I am connected with the righteousness of God in Christ; faith will tell me that, and I have overcome the devil by that light, by that truth that I carry about with me, not what I believe only, but what I have in my soul, in my conscience.<a name=224:13></a> I am invulnerable to his attacks.<a name=224:14></a> Peter says, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you".<a name=224:15></a> That is remarkable, and we have

	<div class="paragraph">
		A great deal more could be said as to the book of Revelation, especially as to the letters to the different assemblies; in each one of them we have the idea of overcoming and a reward is promised to every overcomer.<a name=225:11></a> I trust that the brethren will look into this book, and see how full it is, and how it is intended to help us in this terrible time in which we are living, for we are living in a terrible time politically and that is not all, for worse things are to come.<a name=225:12></a> The book of Revelation is full of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I commit the matter to the brethren, to our souls and consciences, for overcoming in view of sitting down with the Lord Jesus in His own throne, when He shall rule, for God "hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained".<a name=226:11></a>

		I have read these scriptures from John's gospel in the light of the fact that he is said to be the disciple whom Jesus loved, and also in the light of the further fact that John the baptist is a special one in the mind of John the evangelist.<a name=227:1></a> I am sure that John the evangelist, whom Jesus loved, in his turn regarded John the baptist particularly as one to be respected, one upon whom he could bestow peculiar distinction.<a name=227:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We learn from these facts that in the divine circle there are favourites, and so John the baptist affords John the evangelist the opportunity to speak of one, as I might say, of these favourites.<a name=227:3></a> The Lord Himself bestows peculiar honour on John the baptist, and I speak of him now in this way in view of what is current in the world, and how important it is to have the truth set out, not simply in words, but exemplified in Christians.<a name=227:4></a> The Lord, as I said, bestows much honour on John the baptist, saying that there was not one born of women greater than he, and saying further that, if they would receive it, he was Elias.<a name=227:5></a> So there is the idea in Scripture of personification of one saint by another.<a name=227:6></a> John the baptist is seen as representing Elias, and I am calling him now to the front especially in view of current conditions, and the need of meeting them; and if they have to be met, they can only be met properly by those who have the Holy Spirit.<a name=227:7></a> It is not simply a question of brethren talking or conversing at tea-tables, or the like, or even of what they may think, or what has been said, but what we say!<a name=227:8></a> If we undertake to say anything, it should be in an orderly and responsible fashion.<a name=227:9></a> And so the Lord makes inquiry as to what men said about Him, the Son of man; not what they thought, but what they

		Now we have before us John the baptist, this remarkable vessel who is introduced almost immediately by John the evangelist, the gospel-writer.<a name=228:5></a> He says, "There was a man sent from God, his name John".<a name=228:6></a> Much had entered into that name.<a name=228:7></a> His parents' friends and neighbours would have had him named Zacharias, but his father, who had been disciplined for nine months by being caused to be dumb, made his first pronouncement as he asked for a writing tablet, saying "John is his name".<a name=228:8></a> Whatever the meaning of the name John it was prophetically announced that it was the name of this man.<a name=228:9></a> John the evangelist speaking about John, says, "There was a man sent from God, his name John".<a name=228:10></a> Words are not wasted in the Scriptures; they are just sufficient, suggesting that we have what is needed.<a name=228:11></a> The Spirit of God employs words according to what is needed, and so here it is stated that John was "a man sent from God".<a name=228:12></a> That is a very great fact, and I do not hesitate at all to say that there are such men today, men who are sent from God.<a name=228:13></a> I do not point to anyone, for there are many.<a name=228:14></a> I speak of a great fact, that there are men "sent from God;" not angels, but men.<a name=228:15></a> Although angels have power of speech and are employed by God on the most important errands, yet John the evangelist says, "There was a man sent from God, his name John".<a name=228:16></a> In the book of Acts, which has a great place in the divine records, we read that

		"the crowd of names who were together was about a hundred and twenty".<a name=229:1></a> Those names were real, and each had a meaning, and on that account the names are mentioned.<a name=229:2></a> They had <i>names</i> and there was a <i>crowd</i> of them, as if they were all great enough to be distinguished as saints by themselves as they will be in heaven.<a name=229:3></a> I have no doubt that each inhabitant of that celestial scene will be designated by his appearance, by what he is, not simply by the name acquired, but by what the person is.<a name=229:4></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>all were there because of what they were, and that idea was seen in Peter.<a name=229:5></a> It was he that answered the Lord, by saying, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God", and the Lord designated him by saying, "<i>Thou</i> art Peter".<a name=229:6></a> "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.<a name=229:7></a> And <i>I</i> also, I say unto thee that <i>thou</i> art Peter".<a name=229:8></a> The Father had spoken, and now another divine Person is speaking to Peter.<a name=229:9></a> "<i>I</i> also, I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and on this rock" (that is, on the Lord Jesus, for the rock refers to Him) "I will build my assembly".<a name=229:10></a> The Son of the living God is the One designated as the foundation of the assembly.<a name=229:11></a> And so it is in that connection that Peter's name came out, and the Lord said, "<i>Thou</i> art Peter", meaning that he was that; 'a stone'.<a name=229:12></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>the Lord said, "Thou shalt be called Cephas".<a name=229:13></a> But in Matthew the word is, "<i>Thou</i> art Peter".<a name=229:14></a> That is very current among us, and perhaps well known, but it is well to have it before us as to names.<a name=229:15></a>

		Having said all that, I come back to those scriptures that were written in regard of John the baptist.<a name=229:16></a> He was a most distinguished man, as I have said, and particularly because of the distinction the Lord Himself put upon him.<a name=229:17></a> How humble John was!<a name=229:18></a> He was equal to the moment, and it was a great

		There is another noted man in this gospel (chapter 9).<a name=230:14></a> The Lord met him after He had opened his eyes, and said to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=230:15></a>".<a name=230:16></a> That is a question one would ask every Christian here, every person present, tonight, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=230:17></a>" That is the great testimony of John the evangelist, and the testimony of John the baptist too, and so I put that question, and I leave it with you, with each one of us to answer.<a name=230:18></a> "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=230:19></a>".<a name=230:20></a> I have said <i>on</i> the Son of God; but if I say <i>in</i> the Son of God, that would raise the question of finding out who He is and what great possibilities there are; but believing on Him means that He is the great Object of faith.<a name=230:21></a> We are living in the faith period, and so the thing is to have faith, to be in faith, the faith of the Son of God, believing on Him.<a name=230:22></a> This is the urgent burning question of the moment, for the truth is denied all around, and if not denied then it is not confessed!<a name=230:23></a> There is very little difference between people denying and not confessing.<a name=230:24></a>

		As I said, as regards names, John the baptist's name is full of renown, and John the evangelist makes much of him.<a name=231:14></a> No other evangelist makes so much as John, of John the baptist, and he does it in order to bring out thoughts as to the Son of God.<a name=231:15></a> The current conditions abroad permit of things being said that evidence that the truth has been given up.<a name=231:16></a> In the world generally, great reverses have taken place as to the profession of Christianity; great nations have fallen, and great cities have fallen, great societies, too, have fallen, and what is going to replace these?<a name=231:17></a> How much there is being said in the world that is antichristian, and we are here today as Christians, as believers on the Son of God, and our business is to seek to counter those things; to counter them with the truth.<a name=231:18></a> That is the point we should have in mind; and not simply the truth as it is put in the creeds, but the truth as we are taught it by the Spirit of truth.<a name=231:19></a> The Lord Jesus is referred to at the beginning of this gospel as <i>Teacher</i> and He is alluded to as <i>Teacher</i> at the end of it, and in this connection it

		In the passage read in chapter I of John's gospel we learn that the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask John.<a name=232:4></a> "Thou, who art thou?<a name=232:5></a>".<a name=232:6></a> The Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him.<a name=232:7></a> You will see that this gives weight to my point.<a name=232:8></a> Those Jews, whoever they were, in Jerusalem, sent to John the baptist; <i>they</i> sent to John.<a name=232:9></a> I am stopping now to explain that what I had primarily in mind in reading these verses is the statement of John in chapter 3.<a name=232:10></a> We are told there in verse 26, "And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan to whom thou barest witness, behold he baptises, and all come to him.<a name=232:11></a> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven".<a name=232:12></a> That is the word I had in mind particularly, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven".<a name=232:13></a> If I refer to current conversations, talks, speeches, magazines and newspaper articles, all of them, I might say, and all that is expressed in them, can be received naturally; whether one be a politician, industrialist, an educationalist, or a medical man, what is current in the world in the way of teaching and of prime importance is to be received and compassed by the ordinary

		In chapter 1 the Jews sent to John, to ask, "Who art thou?<a name=233:11></a>".<a name=233:12></a> What were they sent for?<a name=233:13></a> What was in their minds?<a name=233:14></a> The whole matter raises the question with us, and what would <i>we</i> do?<a name=233:15></a> What would any one of us answer if put in such a position?<a name=233:16></a> What would the worldling do, if he had such opportunity?<a name=233:17></a> What would we do if we were just simply ordinary men, with natural ability, ability such as could make us shine in this world, what would we do?<a name=233:18></a> If governed by earth, we would say to ourselves, What an opportunity!<a name=233:19></a> The leading men of the day have sent messengers to ask me, "Who art thou?<a name=233:20></a>".<a name=233:21></a> Well, I must let them know about my ancestors and my education, and my means.<a name=233:22></a> I must bring forth everything that is to my credit humanly, and put it in the answer, hoping that this will bring me some distinction.<a name=233:23></a> You see, dear brethren, in speaking thus, I desire to show how we are tested in this way every day, and we are tested as Christians, and the test brings out whether we are governed by heaven or earth.<a name=233:24></a> If we are governed by heaven, we answer even as John did in chapter 3, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven".<a name=233:25></a> Now, where are we as to those matters?<a name=233:26></a> If all

		earthly distinctions are ruled out, where am I?<a name=234:1></a> I shall have to explore heaven, because "A man can receive nothing except it be given him out of heaven", and so heaven is the place of origin of each matter that is of value to ourselves as Christians.<a name=234:2></a> Heaven has its distinctions to give, its honours to proffer.<a name=234:3></a> I hope that the dear brethren will be moved inwardly as to this matter of what heaven has to offer!<a name=234:4></a> John is nobly victorious in this test, and that is why I have touched on it so freely.<a name=234:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the beginning, John acted nobly, as it says, "And he confessed and denied not".<a name=234:6></a> He was the first to confess it to another.<a name=234:7></a> As walking in truth one has joy in another's confession.<a name=234:8></a> Not denying is additional, as confirming that he is the victor from the start.<a name=234:9></a> He is confessing the truth as to himself, and not denying it in any way.<a name=234:10></a> So it says of him, "he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ".<a name=234:11></a> Distinction is one of the things the natural man would grasp at.<a name=234:12></a> How many have grasped at being something in this world religiously, but John confessed, "I am not", and denied not!<a name=234:13></a> He gave no opportunity to anyone who sought to draw him into the thought of honouring himself, or making himself something, in this world religiously.<a name=234:14></a> When I say religiously I include the dear brethren that are now here along with myself, because we are apt to aspire to be something; but John confessed and denied not.<a name=234:15></a> He gives no occasion for anyone to say that he aspired to anything.<a name=234:16></a> And so the narrative goes on, "Art thou Elias?<a name=234:17></a> And he says, I am not.<a name=234:18></a> Art thou the prophet?<a name=234:19></a> And he answered, No.<a name=234:20></a> They said therefore to him, Who art thou?<a name=234:21></a> that we may give an answer to those who sent us.<a name=234:22></a> What sayest thou of thyself?<a name=234:23></a> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness".<a name=234:24></a> One is reminded of Balaam, when the king of Moab sent messengers to him, with the proposal to glorify him, to add to him

	<div class="paragraph">
		in every way.<a name=235:1></a> The prophet seemed proof against it for the moment, but really at the bottom of his heart he was hoping that he would obtain what the king of Moab offered.<a name=235:2></a> Not so John, "he confessed and denied not".<a name=235:3></a> And so, dear brethren, if we have any aspirations to acquire distinction in a human way among the brethren to whom I am speaking, John's answers are a model for us.<a name=235:4></a> If we aspire to anything in the way of distinction according to man, John's way of escape is simple.<a name=235:5></a> His answers are remarkable.<a name=235:6></a> These priests and Levites continue, and they say, "What sayest thou of thyself?<a name=235:7></a>".<a name=235:8></a> They did not enquire about his forefathers; not a word about them; nor about his father, nor about his mother, and he is not going to say a word about any of them, whoever they may be.<a name=235:9></a> We are all easily led into making much of these things, ancestry, education, or anything that makes much of us.<a name=235:10></a> That is the intention of the devil, and we are to be proof against it.<a name=235:11></a> John was proof against it.<a name=235:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it says, dear brethren, that the inquiry made of John is, "Who art thou, that we may give an answer to those who sent us.<a name=235:13></a> What sayest thou of thyself?<a name=235:14></a>".<a name=235:15></a> He answered, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of the Lord, as said Esaias the prophet".<a name=235:16></a> They that were sent were from among the Pharisees, and they asked him further, assuming, we may suppose, that they were a distinguished people, as belonging to a distinguished sect.<a name=235:17></a> They asked him, "Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?<a name=235:18></a> John answered them saying, I baptise with water.<a name=235:19></a> In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose".<a name=235:20></a> Now, dear brethren, I am just leaving John the baptist at this point for your consideration.<a name=235:21></a> How nobly he met the temptations of the enemy in the attempt to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		make much of him, and again I say, we are all exposed to this temptation, even amongst those with whom we are walking, exposed to the desire to be distinguished in the service of God, but John is a noble testimony to us against it.<a name=236:1></a> He is not led away, but is superior to the temptations of the devil.<a name=236:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go on to the third chapter of John, so as to bring out how John is again tested, not now by the Pharisees, but by his own disciples.<a name=236:3></a> "There was, therefore, a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification.<a name=236:4></a> And they came to John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold he baptises, and all come to him.<a name=236:5></a> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven".<a name=236:6></a> John did not say this in the first chapter.<a name=236:7></a> He is saying it now, when his own people, those who were interested in him are around him, and they are saying to him that the Lord Jesus to whom he testified is now baptising even as he.<a name=236:8></a> Although we are told in the next chapter that the Lord did not Himself baptise, but that His disciples did the service, here it is said that <i>He</i> is baptising.<a name=236:9></a> They are saying this to John, but he is proof against any suggestion of rivalry.<a name=236:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have spoken of ambition in relation to oneself, but now I speak of rivalry, even amongst our brethren.<a name=236:11></a> The things said to John were intended to promote rivalry between him and the Lord Jesus, that is, in the heart of John.<a name=236:12></a> How proof against all that is John the baptist, and so he says, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven".<a name=236:13></a> John has heavenly thoughts, and he goes on to say, "Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am no, the Christ, but, that I am sent before him".<a name=236:14></a> I want you to notice, dear brethren, what John was occupied with in the midst of this atmosphere of rivalry.<a name=236:15></a> He says, "He that has the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=237>[Page 237]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		bride is the bridegroom".<a name=237:1></a> There is only One who has the bride.<a name=237:2></a> We do not want to rival Him, nor do we want to rival each other, but John brings in this rich and holy thought of the Lord's possession of the bride; the richness of what belonged to Him; that is "the bride".<a name=237:3></a> The Lord is drawing our attention peculiarly to the idea of the assembly as the bride; and John brings this in in what he says.<a name=237:4></a> In bringing this in at this particular juncture, John the baptist shows that he is outside the range of rivalry.<a name=237:5></a> His language plainly tells us that, as he says, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom".<a name=237:6></a> I would rather be joyous thus than in possession of the greatest gift, for gift in itself will not make me joyous.<a name=237:7></a> The Lord makes us joyous.<a name=237:8></a> The Holy Spirit sheds the love of God abroad in our hearts to make us joyous; the greatest gift will not do that.<a name=237:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak with warning now, not that I am aiming at anyone, and would bring before you John as an outstanding example of one superior to temptation, and specially the temptation arising from rivalry.<a name=237:10></a> John is enjoying the voice of Christ, and is completely delivered from rivalry if there was any need for it in him.<a name=237:11></a> He says, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom".<a name=237:12></a> John the baptist does not tell us who the bride is.<a name=237:13></a> Paul does.<a name=237:14></a> John the baptist speaks of the voice of Christ the Bridegroom.<a name=237:15></a> What a theme, dear brethren!<a name=237:16></a> What deliverance from rivalry and pride and every other thing that goes with the natural man!<a name=237:17></a> What a deliverance!<a name=237:18></a> The joy of Christ's voice brings deliverance.<a name=237:19></a> John the baptist goes on to say, "but the friend of the bridegroom .<a name=237:20></a>.<a name=237:21></a>.<a name=237:22></a>" That is a great matter.<a name=237:23></a> We do not speak of ourselves as friends of the Bridegroom, but as friends of Christ.<a name=237:24></a> The Lord Himself tells us,

		"Ye are my friends".<a name=238:1></a> We are His friends; that is a delivering element in these matters.<a name=238:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then I am speaking of what John says: "the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices in heart".<a name=238:3></a> John has enough power inwardly to stand as he does.<a name=238:4></a> We already know from the first chapter how firmly John stood, and now these are his own words, "the friend of the bridegroom who <i>stands</i> and hears him, rejoices in heart, because of the voice of the bridegroom; this my joy then is fulfilled".<a name=238:5></a> What can anyone do to decoy John into rivalry, to draw him into it.<a name=238:6></a> He is too satisfied.<a name=238:7></a> He is settled.<a name=238:8></a> His mind is fixed.<a name=238:9></a> His joy is full.<a name=238:10></a> I am speaking freely of this great subject, because John is not here, and John the evangelist is not here, but their testimony remains.<a name=238:11></a> We are here today, and I am speaking in order that we may be moved in regard to this matter, in regard to the Bridegroom and the bride.<a name=238:12></a> The Bridegroom's voice, the voice of Jesus, what it should be to us, how it should cause us joy, satisfying joy, for that is really the effect here, the satisfying joy of which John speaks.<a name=238:13></a> He says, "This my joy therefore is fulfilled".<a name=238:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I might say much more, but I felt I must not fail in this line of thought that came before me, and I must not fail in presenting to the brethren the example which the Spirit of God has left us as John the evangelist presents it; not as Matthew, or Mark, or Luke present the Baptist, but as John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, speaks of Him.<a name=238:15></a> How beautifully he speaks of John and presents him to us as a model of satisfaction, satisfied desire.<a name=238:16></a> He is the friend of the Bridegroom, and his work is not done; he is not yet cast into prison; John the evangelist does not speak of John the baptist after he is cast into prison.<a name=238:17></a> When he was in prison, he sent words of a very different tone to the Lord Himself, asking Him, "Art <i>thou</i> the coming one?<a name=238:18></a>

		<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:4">1 Timothy  1:4</a>; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:23">Acts  4:23</a> - 37
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The verse in 1 Timothy furnishes the subject of our theme this evening.<a name=240:1></a> It presents to us "God's dispensation", which is the proper rendering of the words given in the Authorised Version as "godly edifying".<a name=240:2></a> It is the dispensation, or it may be called, the administration of God, which is in faith.<a name=240:3></a> (See the note in the Darby Translation for <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:25">Colossians  1:25</a>).<a name=240:4></a> So the subject opened up to us, in the few words, is really the greatest of all the dispensations.<a name=240:5></a> We may speak of the other dispensations, such as the ante-diluvian period, then the post-diluvian down to Abraham, then down to Moses, then the Judges, then David and Solomon, then the prophets.<a name=240:6></a> These are periods marked out plainly in the Scriptures, and we are told in the New Testament that they all converge on ourselves, "upon whom the ends of the ages are come", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:11">1 Corinthians  10:11</a>.<a name=240:7></a> Our position therefore is extremely solemn, yet glorious, for as the end comes it will be manifestly glorious.<a name=240:8></a> There will be gloom, for the Lord Jesus tells the assembly in Philadelphia that He will keep the assembly "out of the hour of trial which is about to come upon the whole habitable world to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=240:9></a> We may say these words briefly, but they involve what is most sorrowful, and terrible as the time arrives, and they are intended to affect us.<a name=240:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord intended to affect Philadelphia, which represents a period of love for the assembly towards the end of this dispensation.<a name=240:11></a> He intended that she should be feelingly affected, although assured of His word and its fulfilment, "I also will keep <i>thee</i> out of the hour of trial".<a name=240:12></a> Intelligence in the saints would lead us to say that He is speaking of the

		<a name=241>[Page 241]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		assembly, and that He will keep her out of the great tribulation.<a name=241:1></a> We may reckon on these words, and that the Lord intends to keep us out of it, by taking us out of it, although the idea of keeping has to be borne in mind.<a name=241:2></a> There is undoubtedly a process in the keeping until it is complete, for the Lord does things in that way.<a name=241:3></a> Certain things have been in progress in an evil sense for almost the whole period of the dispensation; that is to say, the mystery of iniquity, a terrible thing.<a name=241:4></a> It is a mystery.<a name=241:5></a> Those who have fostered it, and built it up, and now make much of themselves as in it, are not aware of the evil they are dealing with and building up, but God is aware of it, and those who have light from God, as we ought all to have, are aware too.<a name=241:6></a> We find in the Apocalypse, which is the part of Scripture that instructs us most as to this, that God will judge our judgment upon the system that embodies this mystery.<a name=241:7></a> So we have some light in this sense, and have become aware of what is incumbent upon us; that is, to keep ourselves, for it is God that worketh in us for the willing and doing of His good pleasure.<a name=241:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I now proceed to speak of the dispensation of God which is in faith, not in history, although I have alluded to things that are historical, for we are entitled to pay attention to history in these matters, so that we know the facts, but the dispensation of God is in <i>faith</i>, it is not simple history; in no way can it be explained by history.<a name=241:9></a> Faith can never be explained by history.<a name=241:10></a> "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.<a name=241:11></a> For by it the elders obtained a good report".<a name=241:12></a> So that we are dealing with faith.<a name=241:13></a> Politics, society, industry, and all else that makes up the world are seen; they can be known, searched out, spoken of, written about, by man in his natural mind.<a name=241:14></a> God, of course, has given him that mind, and he is entitled to use it and give thanks for it, but at the same time, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=242>[Page 242]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		natural man does not understand the things of God, for they are spiritually discerned.<a name=242:1></a> Therefore those who are possessed of faith are morally outside of the world as it is, whilst having to do with it under God.<a name=242:2></a> The natural mind is God-given, we give thanks for it; indeed we need it now in the service we render, but at the same time, "we have the mind of Christ".<a name=242:3></a> The we is very touching, it means Christians.<a name=242:4></a> If there are those here who do not embrace the great opportunity of belonging to that we, then the intent of this word is to encourage you to do so, to come into the realm of faith, which in time will lead you into the realm of <i>love</i>, which is what is in mind to call attention to.<a name=242:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This dispensation, this administration, in the divine phraseology is bound up with the idea of <i>twelve</i>, which numeral is largely found in relation to Jacob's family, and that is in mind, too, in the book of the Revelation.<a name=242:6></a> My hope is that a few remarks on administration may help us to see how the idea is introductory to the millennium.<a name=242:7></a> It is carried forward in the dispensation of faith, for it is by faith that we understand, "by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God".<a name=242:8></a> In referring to administration, for the word in 1 Timothy bears that interpretation as well as dispensation, one is minded to call attention to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>.<a name=242:9></a> It is the chapter that has most references that I know of to the idea of twelve.<a name=242:10></a> Certain numbers have a great place in the Scriptures, particularly the number twelve, which is almost entirely bound up with Jacob's family.<a name=242:11></a> Whatever men may think of Israel today, of the Jews, that which denotes love is bound up with them, in the import of this number.<a name=242:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This number twelve comes into the assembly too, for as the apostle Paul says, in writing to the Corinthians, "all things are yours and ye are Christ's
	</div>

		<a name=243>[Page 243]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and Christ is God's".<a name=243:1></a> The things that belong to other dispensations, and particularly to the Jewish, belong to us in this present period.<a name=243:2></a> This dispensation is so flexible, as built up by the Spirit and supported by the Spirit, that those who are in it can touch things, and enjoy them, which in themselves do not belong to it.<a name=243:3></a> Take the new covenant, for instance; it was never made in view of this dispensation.<a name=243:4></a> The Spirit of God is in this dispensation, He builds it up and supports it, and is with us, as the Lord said, "he dwelleth with you and shall be in you".<a name=243:5></a> It is the Spirit who searches all things, even the depths of God, and these depths belong to us.<a name=243:6></a> Christianity cannot be bounded by physical limits.<a name=243:7></a> The heavens are not bounded so far as we can see.<a name=243:8></a> Earth can be measured, the sea, all that is terrestrial can be measured, but not the heavens, and certainly not the uncreated condition to which Deity belongs.<a name=243:9></a> I speak reverently, dear brethren, of Deity, because it means Godhead.<a name=243:10></a> The realm of Deity is outside of us.<a name=243:11></a> We read of the third heaven, but we are not told how many more there are.<a name=243:12></a> Paul said he was caught <i>up</i> to the third heaven, but <i>into</i> Paradise.<a name=243:13></a> The elevation was as far as, but no higher than, the third heaven.<a name=243:14></a> Paradise is equivalent or synonymous with the third heaven, and Paul heard unspeakable things there, unutterable things, things not permitted to man to utter.<a name=243:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we are reminded constantly in these matters of our limitations.<a name=243:16></a> We are to be <i>filled</i> to all the fulness of God, but we cannot compass the fulness of God, we are limited.<a name=243:17></a> Length and breadth and depth and height, however great, is limitation.<a name=243:18></a> The assembly is the nearest of all the families that are named, for every family in the heavens and on earth is named of the Father; not named of the Son, for it is the Father who is the Head of the families, and He names them.<a name=243:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the references to twelve in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>are remarkable, the more remarkable because it is at the introduction of the millennium.<a name=244:1></a> The introduction of the millennium shows what is carried forward from our dispensation.<a name=244:2></a> The prophets are full of the introduction of the millennium, and of the body of it, but say very little of the end of it.<a name=244:3></a> As it finishes, it is followed by the terrible destruction of Gog and Magog.<a name=244:4></a> As the Spirit tells us in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20">Revelation  20</a>, they come up on the breadth of the earth, and surround the saints, the earthly people, and the beloved city.<a name=244:5></a> This hostile element, this enemy of God, at the close of the millennium comes up on the breadth of the earth, which would mean that its historical bounds are set aside, as always is the case, and as often happened to Israel, but fire will come down from God out of heaven and consume them every one.<a name=244:6></a> How quickly it will finish, making way for the eventual merging of things in the millennial day with the eternal situation!<a name=244:7></a> God says very little about it, but flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.<a name=244:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would stress the thought as to the number twelve in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, because it is most important in regard to the point before me, that we should understand how it is related to this wonderful dispensation that is about to break upon us, and our heavenly part in it, which nothing can exceed.<a name=244:9></a> Indeed, the assembly's part and place is not to be exceeded by the blessing granted to men in any other dispensation, yet God in His wonderful skill places the names of the twelve sons of Israel on the gates of the heavenly city; twelve angels are there too, so that all the features of administration and government are linked up with the heavenly side of the position, and the heavenly side is our side, beloved; we belong to that place.<a name=244:10></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=245>[Page 245]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How full the chapter is of the idea of twelve, which, as one could easily show, is worked out in the development of love; and, dear brethren, if we have not love, we are nothing.<a name=245:1></a> God has written down with great pains His mind as to this matter of love, and He is endeavouring to put it upon our hearts now.<a name=245:2></a> I will not say our consciences, but our hearts.<a name=245:3></a> It is a heart time, when God would speak to us as to love.<a name=245:4></a> The number twelve is most divisible, and it is multiplied by thousands, and finishes in the cube (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:16">Revelation  21:16</a>).<a name=245:5></a> "Two of you", for instance, refers to the numeral in which love is shining.<a name=245:6></a> "If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>.<a name=245:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would urge this on the dear brethren, the sisters especially, because they are often neglected and belittled.<a name=245:8></a> The feminine idea is first in the chapter; as the city is seen "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband".<a name=245:9></a> There is nothing said in the first part of the chapter about the number twelve, because those verses refer to eternity, and the further we get into eternity the less there is need to call attention to love, love will prevail everywhere.<a name=245:10></a> There is no need to call attention to what is prevalent everywhere!<a name=245:11></a> It is prevailing in heaven now, but on earth it is not prevailing, hence attention is called to it.<a name=245:12></a> We speak of it when we celebrate the Lord's supper, it is a time of love; it is the time of Christ's love to us, and it is the time of our love to Christ.<a name=245:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would just remind you that in the gospels the <i>apostles</i> are seen as representative of love.<a name=245:14></a> The Lord took them up for that purpose.<a name=245:15></a> I refer to that now, because of the place which the Lord's supper has acquired amongst the brethren.<a name=245:16></a> Historically it has had a great place, especially from the time of the Reformation, but not since pentecostal times has the Lord's supper had such a place as during the

		<a name=246>[Page 246]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		past fifty years.<a name=246:1></a> I am not speaking of mere intelligence as to facts, but I am endeavouring to interest the saints in it, that all may see that the Lord's supper is for them, for the younger as well as for the older ones, and that it would result in our being accustomed to love, and to open our hearts to it.<a name=246:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If a believer wants to break bread, the love matter is bound to come up; have we love, love for Christ, love for the brethren?<a name=246:3></a> It is a time of searching, and this matter of the Lord's supper at the end of this dispensation is testing us.<a name=246:4></a> At the beginning, when it was inaugurated, the twelve apostles were there; they are not here now, but their writings are here, and Paul's writings are here; it was he to whom the Lord, after His ascension, gave authoritative instruction as to the Supper.<a name=246:5></a> This was to be communicated to the assembly, and Paul did that, so that whatever may be said, Paul has the last word, and there is no mistaking what he writes.<a name=246:6></a> When Matthew and Mark speak of the Lord's supper, they speak of it in a way that Paul does not, and they do not refer to it as to be continued as a memorial of Christ.<a name=246:7></a> Luke comes nearer to Paul than any of them.<a name=246:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If any one wanted to break bread and the apostles spoke to them, the apostles would interrogate such and be very careful.<a name=246:9></a> Matthew says, "When the evening was come, he lay down at table with the twelve" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:20">Matthew  26:20</a>).<a name=246:10></a> Why did He come with the twelve?<a name=246:11></a> Surely He had in mind that through all the ages down to the present, the twelve had much to say about this matter, for this matter of love was in it.<a name=246:12></a> Mark says the same thing in effect.<a name=246:13></a> If the Lord were here He would come with the twelve.<a name=246:14></a> He is away and they are away.<a name=246:15></a> If He were here they would not be needed.<a name=246:16></a> Luke is the only one who says, "the twelve apostles with him".<a name=246:17></a> "The twelve"; there could be no other twelve like

	<div class="paragraph">
		them anywhere.<a name=247:1></a> Others were added afterwards, perhaps in some sense superior, especially Paul, but there was none like the twelve.<a name=247:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>the "twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb" are in the foundations of the holy city.<a name=247:3></a> What an honour to be conferred on these men!<a name=247:4></a> The allusion is to the Lord's sufferings; He suffered as the Lamb, and they were the apostles of the Lamb.<a name=247:5></a> According to Luke, when the hour was come He placed Himself at table and the twelve apostles with Him.<a name=247:6></a> We are not told what they said, for <i>they</i> do not instruct us at that time.<a name=247:7></a> The Lord said all that was to be said as to the Supper, and He would, as I may say, make a gesture which Peter and John and James would understand, and indeed the twelve, for they were all there.<a name=247:8></a> Even Judas was there.<a name=247:9></a> The Lord said, "The hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table".<a name=247:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope the dear brethren will have followed what I have endeavoured to say as to this matter of twelve, and the place it has at the end of this dispensation and at the beginning of the millennium.<a name=247:11></a> Great stress is laid on the idea embodied in the word twelve, now that we are at the end of the dispensation.<a name=247:12></a> In the ministry the Lord has been giving in our time, He has been telling us about the Supper, and telling us about administrative matters.<a name=247:13></a> Eldership in a formal sense has not been made prominent, but instead we have care-meetings; we never have had so many care-meetings.<a name=247:14></a> The word <i>care</i> covers the whole matter.<a name=247:15></a> It is a matter of love.<a name=247:16></a> If we care for the saints and put our word <i>care</i> on our meetings, they are love-meetings.<a name=247:17></a> If we love the brethren we want them cared for; many will continue late at night in these care-meetings as needed, that the assembly may be cared for.<a name=247:18></a> These are the lessons in the administrative idea being so prominent in these verses in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20">Revelation  20</a>and 21.<a name=247:19></a>

		I urge that upon the brethren, in view of all there is to attend to.<a name=248:1></a> The world is pressing upon us its ideas, and brethren will have to stand against much.<a name=248:2></a> Why should it be that unionism and many other 'isms' are talked about interminably?<a name=248:3></a> The Spirit of God is with us to instruct us, and we ought to be able to arrive at something of the meaning of the mark of the beast.<a name=248:4></a> We ought to be able to finish our discussions and to make up our mind as to the mind of God.<a name=248:5></a> In these matters of administration which God has placed in our hands, He gives to His servants (not apostles, but bondmen, <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:34">Mark  13:34</a>) the authority, and decisions can be reached humbly and simply under the Lord, so that we can arrive at finality in any matter.<a name=248:6></a> We are not driven to the wall, we never shall be; the Spirit of God is too great for that.<a name=248:7></a> Adjustments should be made, and things not left undecided and unfinished.<a name=248:8></a>

		Now I want to say a few words about <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>.<a name=248:9></a> This is a love chapter.<a name=248:10></a> It was in the Lord's mind that Peter and John should be in at the beginning of the dispensation, fit in every way to be looked upon.<a name=248:11></a> "Look on us", Peter said; not hear us, but "Look on us", as though they were adorning the whole position of the dispensation.<a name=248:12></a> It was following this presentation of what was in themselves, that they were taken before the council of the Jews, but after being threatened they were let go, and it says, "being let go, they went to their own".<a name=248:13></a> They were not occupied with themselves but with the saints, with "their own".<a name=248:14></a> There is what is <i>our own</i>, what belongs to us, and this would preclude our attachment to unions and all other worldly institutions and associations.<a name=248:15></a> We look on each other as <i>our own</i>, and say, We have many brethren, many saints of God, all included in this blessed term, <i>our own</i>.<a name=248:16></a> Then, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>, love being there, and joy

		What is in mind at this time is to speak about priesthood.<a name=252:1></a> Yesterday, we had the dispensation of God as the subject for our service, and it may be stated now that this dispensation is maintained by priesthood.<a name=252:2></a> The system as we spoke of it, for it is a system, is maintained by Christ in heaven.<a name=252:3></a> He is High Priest above, High Priest after the order of Melchisedec, which denotes that He is a divine Person.<a name=252:4></a> On the other hand, the system is maintained by the Holy Spirit here on earth.<a name=252:5></a> That is to say, all is upheld and maintained in function by Christ in heaven on the one hand, and the Holy Spirit here on earth on the other.<a name=252:6></a> Hence the invulnerability of the system.<a name=252:7></a> It cannot be overthrown, for it rests on the foundation of God, which stands.<a name=252:8></a> Whatever happens on man's side, the foundation of God stands, and that is because of two divine Persons active in relation to it, one in heaven, and another on earth, of whom the Lord said, calling Him the Comforter, "another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever".<a name=252:9></a> So that we may count on the maintenance of the system until the end of the dispensation.<a name=252:10></a> The Spirit is here until then, and He has never been withdrawn.<a name=252:11></a> He remains here, and Christ remains above.<a name=252:12></a>

		Now what is in mind is not so much to call attention to the priesthood of Christ and the service of the Holy Spirit here below, although keeping these two great facts always before us, but to call attention to priesthood among the brethren, priesthood in the saints.<a name=253:5></a> Peter says we are "a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".<a name=253:6></a> What one has observed is that there is a great shortage of priests, and that among those who may be regarded as priests, a great shortage of power to carry out priestly service; hence the weakness of the meetings.<a name=253:7></a> We have to take account of the feelings of sisters too; they are not permitted to speak in the assembly, but have to wait for the brothers to speak, because their function is to speak.<a name=253:8></a> If there is to be prayer, they are to pray.<a name=253:9></a> If there is to be praise, they are to praise.<a name=253:10></a> If there is to be ministry, they are to minister.<a name=253:11></a> Sisters are debarred the service, but they are not debarred from the service of priesthood in another sense; that is to say, they are to pray as the brothers are, but in their own setting; they are to pray without ceasing, as the brothers are.<a name=253:12></a>

		The disciple in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>, whoever he was, asked the Lord to teach them to pray, and obviously it was because the Lord Himself had been praying.<a name=254:9></a> One does not hesitate to suggest that there was something particular about the Lord in the attitude of prayer, and as to this or aught else in the service of God, we have to learn everything from the Lord; and so here the disciple said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray".<a name=254:10></a> He did not ask the Lord to teach him, showing that he was not selfish, nor did he count himself to be over the heads of others, nor desire to be at an advantage among them; he wanted all to be taught.<a name=254:11></a>

		Now, in this case in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>, it was a brother, and he was just a disciple, but he did not ask the Lord to teach <i>him</i> to pray, as if to make a parade of something that he had.<a name=255:7></a> No, he says, "teach us to pray"; and so it is that the chapter teaches us about priesthood, for praying is a priestly function.<a name=255:8></a> The Lord responds to the wish of this disciple, and no doubt they greatly valued it, for the instruction in all probability supplied what the disciple would say at some time as he prayed.<a name=255:9></a> The Lord would perchance say to the disciples, 'I would like you to know how to pray, to see how I pray, and to know what words to use'.<a name=255:10></a> How appropriate then is the desire of this disciple, in saying, "Lord, teach us to pray".<a name=255:11></a> In answering, I suppose, the Lord would have the full meaning of the word <i>pray</i> in His mind, so that the disciple should be a true priest; and indeed all the disciples.<a name=255:12></a>

		to pray, but apparently, as the chapter shows, he did not know how to pray, and hence he had to be taught, and he was taught, so that he became a true priest.<a name=256:1></a> He had never really been one before, as far as we can see, although he is called one, and served as one, but he was simply a legal priest, a Jewish priest, whereas Luke has in mind Christian priests, priests after the order of Christ.<a name=256:2></a> Zacharias was within the temple at the hour of prayer when incense should arise, but he was stricken dumb.<a name=256:3></a> I leave that there, so that we can have it in our minds.<a name=256:4></a> He was stricken dumb, and he remained dumb for nine months.<a name=256:5></a> There is a sequel to it, a very great one, and a very precious one too.<a name=256:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord proceeds patiently to instruct the disciples, no doubt far beyond what the disciple expected.<a name=256:7></a> "He said to them, When ye pray, say, Father, thy name be hallowed, thy kingdom come: give us our needed bread for each day; and remit us our sins; for we also remit to every one indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation".<a name=256:8></a> They were evidently attentive and He then proceeded to say more; even as we learn in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19:11">Luke  19:11</a>, that "as they were listening to these things he added and spake a parable".<a name=256:9></a> They had been hearing something from Christ and because they were attentive, "he added and spake a parable".<a name=256:10></a> So here we read in the fifth verse, "And he said to them, Who among you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, let me have three loaves".<a name=256:11></a> So the Lord goes on with His teaching in this chapter, giving in an extended way the instruction that the disciples asked for.<a name=256:12></a> He enlarged on the matter for them, beginning with the prayer that was suitable to the Father, as He said, "When ye pray, say, Father".<a name=256:13></a> That was suitable, but He goes on to the eleventh verse and says, "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I think I may take the opportunity of just stopping there, dear brethren, and asking you to consider this matter, how the Lord in this instruction begins with <i>ourselves</i> and ends with His Father and the greatness of what His Father would give if anyone asked of Him, namely, the Holy Spirit.<a name=257:8></a> Now, let us stop to think, as we are praying.<a name=257:9></a> Some of us here may not have the Holy Spirit.<a name=257:10></a> There are many who have not, who are nevertheless the subjects of the work of God, yet do not know enough, they do not know redemption.<a name=257:11></a> Through bad teaching or through negligence, they do not know enough, as Jehovah says, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge".<a name=257:12></a> That is a solemn word, but how true it is.<a name=257:13></a> "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge".<a name=257:14></a> The Lord is giving us knowledge here as to the Father, and as to prayer, and as to the possibilities of prayer, and what the Father might give as we pray.<a name=257:15></a> "How much rather shall the Father, who is of heaven, give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=257:16></a>" That great and glorious gift is available to those who pray, and therefore, I would urge anyone here, who is not sure as to the Holy Spirit, to get to God about it, and ask, as the Lord says, in the plainest possible language.<a name=257:17></a> "If therefore, <i>ye</i> being evil, know how to give good gifts to your

		We perhaps know the beautiful word of Elizabeth as to Mary, "Blessed is she that has believed".<a name=258:4></a> She could hardly have said anything more blessed and greater at that time.<a name=258:5></a> "Blessed is she that has believed".<a name=258:6></a> What I am saying is for faith; it is for the believer, and the very greatest gift that God can give to us is the Holy Spirit.<a name=258:7></a> He gave His Son to die <i>for</i> us, and He gives the Holy Spirit <i>to</i> us.<a name=258:8></a> The Son and the Spirit are both blessed divine Persons; one of Them as having become Man, has died for us, and the other is given to us and works in us so as to fit us for God, and for the assembly, but also to fit us for our place in heaven.<a name=258:9></a> We cannot afford to go into heaven without suitable education for the place, and God is educating us so that we should know.<a name=258:10></a> "And we shall know", says Hosea.<a name=258:11></a> "We shall follow on to know Jehovah".<a name=258:12></a> Divine things are to be known.<a name=258:13></a> Why not avail ourselves of them?<a name=258:14></a> We need them if we are to be priests unto God, and that is my point.<a name=258:15></a> So the Lord says, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them who ask him?<a name=258:16></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now having said so much, and I hope that what I have said is clear, I want to show that the passage read from chapter 1 affords three notable examples of persons who became priests in the true sense, priests in the Christian sense, as I might say.<a name=258:17></a> I can cite others too, because Luke affords many examples of priesthood, but he gives these three, and there is not time to speak of more.<a name=258:18></a> The first one in mind is Elizabeth; the second is Mary, the Lord's mother, and the third is Zacharias, Elizabeth's husband.<a name=258:19></a>

		Those three are recorded or presented in this chapter as typical of what I am saying, not simply typical of Jewish priests, but of Christian priests.<a name=259:1></a> Luke would transfer our thoughts to Christianity, and above all he would instruct us in the truth of priesthood according to Christianity, to deliver us from the error of the many who have returned to the Jewish system of priesthood.<a name=259:2></a> I do not hesitate to say that many of the Protestant denominations have returned to the Jewish system, and this is true of Christendom in general; they have returned to Judaism or paganism.<a name=259:3></a>

		It is a fact that in the early days of Christianity the apostle Paul, who is the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews, had to write to the Jewish Christians, and Peter also wrote to them, to set aside in their souls the legal system, for they had returned to it.<a name=259:4></a> The assemblies of Galatia had also returned to it, and the apostle Paul had to labour with them in order that they might renounce what they had returned to.<a name=259:5></a> The whole teaching of these epistles is to set out the error of returning to Judaism or paganism, of returning to what we have left in becoming nominal Christians, because leaving nominal Christianity means apostasy, and one great point in the epistle to the Hebrews is to warn and deliver from apostasy.<a name=259:6></a> It says in chapter 6, for instance, "For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted of the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away".<a name=259:7></a> Read the chapter for yourself, when you have opportunity.<a name=259:8></a> There is no hope for ever for such persons.<a name=259:9></a> You will understand, beloved friends, that I am seeking to testify the truth as the opportunity is open to me, and what I say <i>is</i> the

		Well now, I want to show, as I said, that these three persons, Elizabeth, Mary, and Zacharias, are illustrations of the Christian priesthood.<a name=260:3></a> The Lord's teaching, as I have been speaking of it in chapter 11, is to show how it could be effected, for it is a question of being taught how to pray.<a name=260:4></a> Let us remember, dear brethren, and let us be touched by it, that the Lord Himself as here upon earth had His ears opened morning by morning as a learner, that He might know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.<a name=260:5></a> Isaiah prophetically records that.<a name=260:6></a> Is it not marvellous, that the Lord should say that, and yet He is "over all, God blessed for ever"?<a name=260:7></a> He became so low, to teach us to pray, and to teach us all other things, and show us how to learn, by Himself taking the place of a learner before God.<a name=260:8></a> He is not learning in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>, He is teaching, and indeed, He is no longer in the <i>place</i> of learning, but He was in it.<a name=260:9></a> The disciple asked Him to teach them to pray, and He teaches them, and I am seeking to show you now that these three persons in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>are intended to instruct us by example, because that is the divine way.<a name=260:10></a> Hence the Lord says Himself in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest".<a name=260:11></a> He would give us rest, knowing how many of us are in the throes of anxiety as to our soul's state.<a name=260:12></a> We do not know the way out, but the way out is often by example, and that way is Christ.<a name=260:13></a> He says, "I am

		As I said, Elizabeth, Mary and Zacharias here, are three illustrations of transfer through instruction out of Judaism into Christian priesthood.<a name=261:5></a> I know full well how much the word priest is attached to certain religious leaders, but I am not referring to that kind of priesthood.<a name=261:6></a> Elizabeth and Mary and Zacharias did not develop into that kind of priesthood, for they really left the Jewish system, and they are examples of the true Christian priesthood.<a name=261:7></a> The remarks of Elizabeth are very beautiful; many of us have been charmed by what is presented in the chapter as to these two women in the hill country of Judea.<a name=261:8></a> Priesthood belongs to heaven, for it is a heavenly priesthood, and Christ is our model.<a name=261:9></a> Elizabeth's remarks are most touching, but she does not say as much as Mary, for she did not know as much.<a name=261:10></a> She did not advance so much; she had not had such intercourse with divine Persons as Mary had.<a name=261:11></a> I have no need to remind you of what I am saying.<a name=261:12></a> What intercourse Mary, the mother of our Lord, had with divine Persons.<a name=261:13></a> "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee", the scripture says, "and power of the Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God".<a name=261:14></a> He was the Son of God as born in time, as becoming incarnate.<a name=261:15></a> Mary had that experience, through the power of the Highest overshadowing her, and the Holy Spirit coming upon her.<a name=261:16></a> To be priests we have to understand that, and what I am saying will help us to do so.<a name=261:17></a>

		And so as John the baptist was born, the neighbours and her cousins spoke to Elizabeth.<a name=264:1></a> We have to notice these neighbours and cousins, because they are apt to be very natural, for natural feelings are very likely to lay hold of persons in these cases.<a name=264:2></a> Natural sentiments tend to deprive us of the quality of priesthood.<a name=264:3></a> And so it says of Elizabeth, that "her neighbours and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy with her and they rejoiced with her.<a name=264:4></a> And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called it after the name of his father, Zacharias".<a name=264:5></a> That is what the kinsfolk would do; they would say, 'His name must be the same as his father's name, and his grandfather's name'.<a name=264:6></a> Well, that is not heaven's thought.<a name=264:7></a> Heaven has other thoughts.<a name=264:8></a> And so it says, "his mother [that is Elizabeth] answering said, No;" she is a spiritual woman now.<a name=264:9></a> She is not any longer simply of the daughters of Aaron, as she is called in verse 5.<a name=264:10></a> That is another thing to notice.<a name=264:11></a> Her husband was a son of Aaron; the sons of Aaron were called priests in relation to their father, but not so the daughters.<a name=264:12></a> Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron, and no doubt would cherish the fact that she was a priestess, so to speak.<a name=264:13></a> But now when they say of the son that was born, Call him Zacharias, she says, "<i>No</i>".<a name=264:14></a> She had become spiritual.<a name=264:15></a> I am not saying that she would say that, but that is the fact in her soul, that she becomes spiritual, and I am humbly insisting on the brethren becoming spiritual, and going in for priesthood, to know how to pray, and know how to worship, and whatever else requires to be done.<a name=264:16></a> There is what sisters can do, and what brothers can do.<a name=264:17></a> And so here, Elizabeth says 'No'.<a name=264:18></a> The cousins say, He must be called after his father.<a name=264:19></a> He is his firstborn.<a name=264:20></a> That is just how cousins and grandmothers are apt to speak; whereas what we are engaged with now is not what we do naturally,

		How important it is that husbands and wives should be of one mind, and in matters of this kind especially, that is, as they bear on the service of God, on the testimony, and on the priesthood.<a name=265:4></a> And so it says, "There is no one among thy kinsfolk who is called by this name.<a name=265:5></a> And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called".<a name=265:6></a> He had been dumb for nine months or so, had no power to serve even in the temple.<a name=265:7></a> And, of course, it is right that the father should name the child, although Eve named her first child, but Seth named his, and gave him a name that was suitable; Enosh.<a name=265:8></a> He was a poor dying man, that is what Seth said.<a name=265:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so finally, "they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called.<a name=265:10></a> And having asked for a writing table, he wrote, saying, John is his name".<a name=265:11></a> It is firm and it is settled.<a name=265:12></a> Let no one ever raise a question about this name.<a name=265:13></a> He is John the baptist, his name has come down the ages to us as a witness to Christ.<a name=265:14></a> As the Lord said, There is none greater born of women than John the baptist.<a name=265:15></a> The cousins would have him called Zacharias, and spoil the whole matter if they could, but Zacharias is proof against that.<a name=265:16></a> He has now become spiritual, and therefore become priestly.<a name=265:17></a> He asked for a writing table and wrote, "His name is John".<a name=265:18></a> And they all marvelled.<a name=265:19></a> His mouth was opened immediately, showing that he was on spiritual lines now, and what does it say?<a name=265:20></a> "His mouth was opened immediately and his tongue, and he spake blessing God".<a name=265:21></a> He is the priest and speaks to God.<a name=265:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=282:1></a> Attention was called this morning to the use of the title Lord, as applied to Jehovah; in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:2">Genesis  15:2</a> it is said, "Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me?<a name=282:2></a> seeing I go childless".<a name=282:3></a> The title Lord applied to Jehovah clearly would have authority in mind.<a name=282:4></a> Here it is Adonai, a plural word, and is connected with the word "Father" in the epistle of James, chapter 3, verse 9.<a name=282:5></a> "Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men made after the likeness of God".<a name=282:6></a> The title Lord used here is connected with the Father, and it is undoubtedly of significance, especially as we are accustomed to connect grace purely with the Father.<a name=282:7></a> At the same time there is the idea of authority attached to the Father; the Lord Himself refers to the Father in this very sense, addressing Him as "Lord of the heaven and of the earth", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a>.<a name=282:8></a> We have to apprehend the Father in that extended way in order to understand how the terms applied to the Godhead are flexible; and that in treating of the Father we are not to limit the idea simply to grace, for there is authority also with Him.<a name=282:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=282:10></a>G.<a name=282:11></a> Would that agree with what we have in the first epistle to Timothy where God is spoken of as the blessed and only Ruler, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship?<a name=282:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=282:13></a> That thought is stressed there in the sixth chapter; Paul says ".<a name=282:14></a>.<a name=282:15></a>.<a name=282:16></a> which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall show, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship".<a name=282:17></a> He will show who is to have authority whatever it may be.<a name=282:18></a> A very important matter just now, because of the need of the idea of authority being stressed among the brethren.<a name=282:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=284:7></a> I am glad you mentioned that, because Abraham is in full accord with it; it is a question of "the Judge of all the earth".<a name=284:8></a> We have someone who does right; we have come to "God the Judge of all".<a name=284:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:13></a> Yes.<a name=284:14></a> It enters into the chapter in a very conspicuous way, I mean the idea of accepting judgment.<a name=284:15></a> It is a question of God entering into covenant with Abraham, and these pieces of sacrifices are brought forth pointing to maturity in the subject we are engaged with, because the animals are of mature age, three years of age; not the birds, but each animal.<a name=284:16></a> They were to be three years of age, the females, and then the ram.<a name=284:17></a> So that we have maturity before us in these matters, and the truth brought in in connection with Isaac in chapter 22 helps as to it, because there the <i>ram</i> is found caught in the thicket; that is to say, it is the idea of continuance in the sense of begetting, of fruitfulness, on the line of a certain family, and what we have had

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=285:13></a>H.<a name=285:14></a> What is the main distinction?<a name=285:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=285:16></a> The first is as to whether there is such a thing as male and female in the eternal state of things, and then what it means, because the Lord meets that question in the Sadducean objection to Him; and it -is to be understood between us now, especially as to where it comes in in our exercises in the service of God, in our relations in that sense.<a name=285:17></a> The Lord, as I said, met the matter in very plain terms, but then we have to think of it as it is treated in the epistles as well as the gospels; and the epistle to the Galatians treats of it directly.<a name=285:18></a> There is no male and female, it says, in Christ Jesus (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:28">Galatians  3:28</a>).<a name=285:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C-S.<a name=313:13></a> It says in verse 24, "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly; of which I became minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given me towards you to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations".<a name=313:14></a> Reconciliation comes between the two.<a name=313:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=315:4></a>W.<a name=315:5></a> I was wondering if God speaking to Abraham was somewhat similar to our sitting under the ministry of reconciliation, bringing about the same results in us where it is accepted.<a name=315:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=315:7></a> Well, that is a matter to be considered, because the section we are engaged with, that is, beginning with chapter 14, leads on methodically but surely, to the truth of reconciliation, in principle.<a name=315:8></a> I say in principle, because we have to await the New Testament for doctrine, only that all Scripture is inspired of God and is profitable for doctrine, Paul says to Timothy.<a name=315:9></a> My thought is that Abraham, in all that we read of him up till now in these chapters, speaks or acts in the light of grace, allusion being found to certain persons that are not exactly of the dispensation or in the spirit of it, such as Ishmael and others, but yet they are treated graciously, especially Ishmael.<a name=315:10></a> It is thought, therefore, that what we are engaged with should remind us of the spirit of reconciliation, which is brought out, not in the first letter to Corinth, but the second.<a name=315:11></a> The letters to Corinth have to do with the service of God, beginning with the Lord's supper, and chapter 5 in the second epistle contemplates the spirit or principle of reconciliation.<a name=315:12></a> The chapter now read will engage us with Abraham, and the spirit in which he is seen in this section expressed in the seven ewe-lambs which he gave to Abimelech, and as to which Abimelech enquired.<a name=315:13></a> It is said that "Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.<a name=315:14></a> And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven

		J.T.<a name=316:11></a> Well, I think that is good and opens up much, because we cannot ignore the section we have had to pass over for want of time and the place that Lot has in it.<a name=316:12></a> Lot being related to Abraham represents our brethren who stand in relation to us m some sense, though not exactly in fellowship, but in some relation to us, and so Lot has a remarkable place and he is treated of in the New Testament, especially by Peter, as a righteous man.<a name=316:13></a> We have already alluded to Peter as having part in the formation of the dispensation, as one of the apostles, of whom he is said to be first, and to the spirit and terms in which he refers to Paul himself, as "our beloved brother Paul".<a name=316:14></a> In saying this he also treats Paul's letters or writings as Scripture, and he alludes to what Paul had written to the Jewish brethren, Peter would co-ordinate the position in encouraging the Hebrew brethren at that time.<a name=316:15></a> It is thought that what is before us now will help in that spirit, in which we are to proceed with our meeting, and what we find with Abraham here, as to Hagar and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=345:2></a> One has to think more about this matter.<a name=345:3></a> Verse 24 reads, "I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me", that is to say, there is a glory that the Father has given Him, and He wishes that the disciples should know it, should behold it.<a name=345:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=345:5></a>G.<a name=345:6></a> Yes.<a name=345:7></a> Is that the distinctive glory given to Christ to bring in, in Himself, all the thoughts of love which the Father had formed before the foundation of the world, and would it link at all with what Peter records in the first chapter of his second epistle, that when they were with Him on the holy mount, the Father said to them, "This is my beloved Son, in whom <i>I</i> have found my delight"?<a name=345:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=345:9></a> Then this prayer in verse 24 is, "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world".<a name=345:10></a> If I may make a comparison, in verse 5 the Lord says, "And now glorify <i>me, thou</i> Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was".<a name=345:11></a> Here it is "the glory which I had along with thee", but in verse 24 it is something that is given to Him.<a name=345:12></a> This is clearly a distinct thing from verse 5.<a name=345:13></a> The disciples are to see the glory of verse 24, and I would think what you say is quite correct.<a name=345:14></a> It is a question of the unfolding of love, divine thoughts between the Father and the Son, and the disciples are to come into these, and see the glory that He has as unfolding these thoughts, and bring them into evidence.<a name=345:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=381:1></a> I suppose it is astronomical in the sense that the word <i>in</i> sometimes implies a position dependent on some other body.<a name=381:2></a> It is some heavenly body, or whatever it may be, everything being made contingent on its relation to another body; and of course what is in mind in John, is that the Lord is everything.<a name=381:3></a> You must begin with Him, you must not work up to Him, for He is the beginning of everything.<a name=381:4></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God .<a name=381:5></a>.<a name=381:6></a>.<a name=381:7></a> .<a name=381:8></a> In him was life, and the life was the light of men" and so forth.<a name=381:9></a> We must begin with Him, and so we are here now in this chapter beginning with Him as the Vine.<a name=381:10></a> Hence abiding in Him would mean the attitude of your mind is that you are fixed in Him.<a name=381:11></a> It implies a certain fixity of position in which we keep ourselves.<a name=381:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=396:1></a> This chapter introduces the gentiles.<a name=396:2></a> It is a testimony of God, and what impressed one is the spirituality of the facts presented.<a name=396:3></a> Beings outside of divine Persons are employed in the service, such as the angel, then Peter himself, and others, all contributing to this, as if it was divinely intended that the gentiles should be brought into a spiritual condition and state of things, not what had obtained in Israel, a legal condition, but a spiritual condition.<a name=396:4></a> The man in question, that is Cornelius, is introduced as having certain characteristics which were intended to accredit the whole position.<a name=396:5></a> He is said to be "pious, and fearing God with all his house, both giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually".<a name=396:6></a> Then it is said he "saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.<a name=396:7></a> But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of fear, said, What is it, Lord?<a name=396:8></a> And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God".<a name=396:9></a> So that the person involved is evidently a marked subject of the Spirit's work, and having moral conditions too, as described in what habitually marked him; that is to say he was pious and feared God with all his house, gave alms to the people, and supplicated God continually.<a name=396:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=398:6></a> Well, you can hardly say that according to the facts.<a name=398:7></a> Cornelius is said to have had the qualities which are the fruit of the Spirit's working in a man before he receives the Spirit, and then he is directed what to do by an angel.<a name=398:8></a> Cornelius said, "What is it, Lord?<a name=398:9></a>" and the answer is, "Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God".<a name=398:10></a> What is stressed is his prayers and his alms.<a name=398:11></a> The actual intervention is <i>direct</i> from God, I would say.<a name=398:12></a> It is direct divine intervention.<a name=398:13></a> Peter is the instrumentality of it eventually according to what is indicated earlier.<a name=398:14></a> He had the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=398:15></a> He had opened to the Jews earlier, and now he opens to the gentiles.<a name=398:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=398:19></a> That is right.<a name=398:20></a> The angel is one who is sent out to minister.<a name=398:21></a> "Are they not all ministering spirits?<a name=398:22></a>" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:14">Hebrews  1:14</a>.<a name=398:23></a> They are not divine Persons, they are not men, they are spirits, and they are ministering.<a name=398:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C-S.<a name=398:29></a> Do you take it that the conditions, commended in Cornelius, were the product of the Spirit Himself in him?<a name=398:30></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=399:6></a> Yes.<a name=399:7></a> And we being gentiles here today, I suppose all of us, the question is whether we are taking on these spiritual features, including recognition of angels; first of all recognising what the new birth means, what it implies, but then what angelic service means, and then what the direct service of the Spirit Himself, the Spirit of God, implies, because He speaks of Himself as sending the men to Peter.<a name=399:8></a> He says to Peter, "Because I have sent them"; so that the Spirit of God Himself sent those men to Peter.<a name=399:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C-S.<a name=399:10></a> So that the Spirit in that way was really assuming charge of matters here, was He?<a name=399:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=399:12></a> That is the thing to see, the place He has in the economy, which perhaps is more or less obscure in our way of thinking.<a name=399:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.R.<a name=399:14></a>T.<a name=399:15></a> Chapter 13 has a similar thought.<a name=399:16></a> The Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them".<a name=399:17></a> "They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit".<a name=399:18></a> Is that a similar thought?<a name=399:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=399:20></a> It is a fuller thought really, I think, a fuller thought as to ministry, but attention is called to the Spirit, both as to His intervention in the case of Cornelius, and then the ministry that flows out from such as Paul and Barnabas, because they are sent

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=400:3></a> Does that mean that in these arrangements which men make the fact of new birth is really ignored?<a name=400:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=400:5></a> And I think the fact of the Spirit being in the position of sending is ignored also, because in the human organisations called churches, men assume the place of the Spirit, in that men, such as bishops ordain others who thus enter nominally into the service of God, whereas it is a question of the Holy Spirit doing these things.<a name=400:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=400:7></a> Then would it be right to say that the assembly, and its completion by the incorporation of the gentiles into it, was distinctly in the mind of the Spirit?<a name=400:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=400:13></a> Well, it is.<a name=400:14></a> All that has been effected first in Peter and the other eleven apostles is taken account of in this chapter, so that it is not really a separate work, it is all one work, the work of the Holy Spirit.<a name=400:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=400:19></a> I am sure that is so.<a name=400:20></a> Peter is the spiritual name that he receives; it is given in two languages, Greek and Aramaic.<a name=400:21></a> It is a spiritual thought; it means material for the assembly.<a name=400:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=401:3></a> Quite so.<a name=401:4></a> That is clearly the case; the epistle to the Ephesians contemplates Jew and gentile brought together, but Romans contemplates the Jew first, which is to be observed too; but at the end of this book Paul announces that the salvation of God was sent to the gentiles.<a name=401:5></a> Now the particular place that the Jew has or had is dropped, for we hardly have any Jews now, yet we have the assembly; in fact the assembly is more stressed than ever.<a name=401:6></a>

		as used in Scripture properly belongs to Christians.<a name=416:1></a> It is a word that is used in the world, but as used in Scripture it is the property of Christians.<a name=416:2></a> We have, as Christians, peculiar title to the use of the word, and I refer to verse 19 of <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>to show how what is presented there affords opportunity for the working out of assembly operations, of assembly results, particularly of spirituality.<a name=416:3></a> The worker, the operator, as it has often been mentioned, was a woman.<a name=416:4></a> I do not say that the Lord was not operating, for He was, but the person in mind particularly now, and who was in the Lord's mind, too, at that time, is Mary Magdalene.<a name=416:5></a> She is a sister out of whom the Lord had cast seven demons; she had been in bad company, in bad service and doing bad work, serving sin; but now she is rescued, and in the Lord's service in a peculiar way.<a name=416:6></a> She had been much affected by the Lord's disappearance from view; it was fully in her mind that He had died and now she is recovered, she is secured, according to the verses preceding verse 19, for the Lord in His service.<a name=416:7></a> Hers was an extraordinary service, one rarely done by a woman; that is, the service in the assembly.<a name=416:8></a> Of course you will understand that all the sisters here are afforded the opportunity of serving in the assembly, because it is the proper sphere for us.<a name=416:9></a> Whether we are brothers or sisters we are to serve, and there is much to be done; but I speak of what she did in the sense of an industrious woman.<a name=416:10></a> Not that she had yet shown much of this, but she did eventually I am sure, and already was doing so; that is to say, she had already begun and was now occupied industriously in the Lord's service and for the assembly, for the benefit of the assembly.<a name=416:11></a>

		The type that I would bring forward as to her for the moment, dear brethren, is in the last chapter of the book of Proverbs.<a name=416:12></a> It is what is called an

		alphabetical chapter because the section referring to the virtuous woman is written on the principle of making the first letter of each verse follow in the order of the Hebrew alphabet.<a name=417:1></a> The woman in that chapter became a model of industry in the service of the Lord.<a name=417:2></a> She is called a virtuous woman.<a name=417:3></a> "Who can find a virtuous woman?<a name=417:4></a> for her price is far above rubies".<a name=417:5></a> We have a description of her from verse 10 to the end, and it aptly illustrates, dear brethren, what is needed in assembly service, not service by persons who have gift specially, but by persons who love the Lord Jesus.<a name=417:6></a> That is what really marked Mary.<a name=417:7></a> She loved the Lord; and I need hardly remark on this that it is a matter of primary importance that we should love the Lord.<a name=417:8></a> You may say, Well, that is very general.<a name=417:9></a> It is, but what is less general is loving His appearing.<a name=417:10></a> And I would challenge everybody as to whether he loves the Lord, but also as to whether he loves the Lord's appearing.<a name=417:11></a> There is a special tribute paid to all those who love the Lord's appearing.<a name=417:12></a>

		Now, coming down to Mary I would regard her in this sense as marked by industry, by industriously serving the saints.<a name=417:13></a> Not simply serving one of them, but serving them as such characteristically; because she was one of them, and the Lord knew she was of them, and as of them she called the Lord by the name of "Rabboni".<a name=417:14></a> She gave Him that name, and it had a meaning, and her use of it implied that she had learned from Him.<a name=417:15></a> He was her Instructor, and that is what she meant to say; that is what He was, He was her Instructor.<a name=417:16></a> The question for everyone here tonight to answer is, Who is our instructor in the things of God?<a name=417:17></a> It is no question of the things of this world, or the sciences of this world, but the things of God.<a name=417:18></a> Who is instructing you in the things of God?<a name=417:19></a> Mary had decided as to who should instruct her, so she called the Lord Jesus by a

	<div class="paragraph">
		name that indicated that <i>He</i> was her Instructor.<a name=418:1></a> So you see what a place she has, beloved brethren, and how important and how right that the consideration of her should enter into a meeting of this kind, so that we should be learners and quick learners, because the time is short.<a name=418:2></a> We should learn to do things, but learn them well, and learn quickly, because they <i>are</i> to be learned quickly, and they <i>may</i> be learned quickly.<a name=418:3></a> If we are not quick learners there is something lacking with us, because the matter that we are engaged in is so necessary and urgent, so profound, so wonderful.<a name=418:4></a> Mary was one of these learners and she had to do with the disciples, and she was effective.<a name=418:5></a> She was sent indeed to them with a message, and I would venture to say that she in measure gave character to them as they were together at that particular time.<a name=418:6></a> The Lord had given her a message for them, and that message was intended to characterise them, and it did; but she was the instrument of the message.<a name=418:7></a> She thus affords an example for every one of us, specially sisters, at such a time as this.<a name=418:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now I come down to the point before us in the passage; that is, promotion of spirituality.<a name=418:9></a> If this is to be the result in our services, we are to learn to shut the doors; not simply the door, but the doors, the word is in the plural.<a name=418:10></a> It is, of course, easy enough to convey the idea of shutting a door, but to shut doors is more general, and sometimes more laborious, and would involve more care, more work, where the number is not mentioned; and the number is not mentioned here.<a name=418:11></a> The doors were shut and we are told why, it was for fear of the Jews, meaning that the Jews would influence the meeting.<a name=418:12></a> It was a meeting of the Lord's people, of those who believed on Him.<a name=418:13></a> It was a meeting of such persons and the Lord came because they were there.<a name=418:14></a> He did not come to an empty room, He came because they

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		were there.<a name=419:1></a> It says "where the disciples were".<a name=419:2></a> And so the doors were shut.<a name=419:3></a> Whether she had anything to do with the shutting of the doors I am not saying, but I am saying that somebody had to do with it.<a name=419:4></a> It was evidently part of the needed service to be rendered, in view of the meeting in prospect, that there should be no Jews there.<a name=419:5></a> They were not simply men called Jews, but persons of a peculiar religious character and characteristics, such as would spoil such a meeting for which the disciples had come.<a name=419:6></a> Then the Lord was come too, not indeed that they had expected Him formally, but He had in His mind to come, and He did come.<a name=419:7></a> I am not saying that Mary had in mind that the doors should be shut, or that she had done it, or that she had indicated that it should be done; but anyway it was done, and she had given the message, she brought the message to the disciples; and these are the facts.<a name=419:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I am saying now has to be used for instruction by each of us, if indeed he is at all interested, because it is a most interesting matter.<a name=419:9></a> That is, how to assemble where the Lord Jesus is about to come, and if there be anything to be attended to negatively, it is not left unattended to, it is attended to, that is the point.<a name=419:10></a> And hence there were results, because it is quite obvious that the brethren there were promoted in their spiritual thoughts, and I hope that what I am saying tonight will help each one here in this fairly large number of brethren, that there will be some promotion of spiritual thoughts in every one of us.<a name=419:11></a> And so it says "The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord".<a name=419:12></a> It was not a mere curious gladness: but it was real gladness, because they loved Him, and they were glad to see Him.<a name=419:13></a> And He said to them "Peace be to you".<a name=419:14></a> That was His thought for them.<a name=419:15></a> Their thought was that they were glad to see Him, and they were.<a name=419:16></a> His thought was that they should have peace, and He

		said it twice.<a name=420:1></a> "Peace be to you".<a name=420:2></a> There were, of course, many other things that He did, He breathed into them which was a portentous matter, a very great matter, a matter that would have effective results ultimately.<a name=420:3></a> "He breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit".<a name=420:4></a> It was not simply that He would give them the Holy Spirit, but that they should actually receive the Holy Spirit.<a name=420:5></a> This is a very great matter, and one has to challenge the brethren as to whether he or she has, whether all of us have received the Holy Spirit because we cannot be in the assembly aside from receiving the Holy Spirit.<a name=420:6></a> Well, now I need not say much more on this passage because the whole matter is simple; most here know all about what I am saying and therefore everyone, I believe, is capable of taking it in, and perhaps enjoying it.<a name=420:7></a> And so the meeting starts; it is the inauguration, I might say, from John's point of view, of the assembly.<a name=420:8></a> John, however, speaks rather of those who form it, and there is quite a difference to be understood between the assembly itself and those who form it.<a name=420:9></a> I do not say that John speaks of it as formed, he does not speak formally of it at all, he does not even use the word in his gospel, but he does speak of the persons who form it being together.<a name=420:10></a> There were very few of them, of course, but they were there, and they were glad they were there, and it is said that they were glad when they saw the Lord, and they got the word from Him, "Peace be to you".<a name=420:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now I want to go on to the second scripture read which is not an assembly matter, not exactly even a household matter, although it is recorded of a household.<a name=420:12></a> It is a matter for gift, a matter in which gifted men are to serve; hence in the facts mentioned it is said that Jairus, who is the subject of the narrative, had his little daughter very ill, at extremity, he said.<a name=420:13></a> She was about to die, and he begged the Lord

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to come to her and lay His hands on her, and the Lord immediately went with him, but He took Peter and James and John with Him.<a name=421:1></a> That is why I said it was a matter of gift, of men who as having gift can serve the Lord on that principle.<a name=421:2></a> Gift is a wonderful matter; it is a question of what the Lord Jesus, having gone into heaven, has received from the Father.<a name=421:3></a> He has gone in and He has received gifts for men.<a name=421:4></a> It is a question of the means of working out what God has in mind in view of the assembly, but I am not now speaking of the assembly as such.<a name=421:5></a> I am speaking of what came out in this household.<a name=421:6></a> There is a girl in it who is dead, who may be part of the assembly in time; but she is dead, and she comes in for this line of teaching that is now in mind.<a name=421:7></a> I want to enlarge on it so that the brethren might profit.<a name=421:8></a> These gifted men must go with Him, the Lord would have them to go, He takes them on first.<a name=421:9></a> He takes on the mother and the father of the child afterwards, but He takes on these three men first.<a name=421:10></a> It is a question of gifted men, of men who can be used, as having gift which the Lord gives from heaven.<a name=421:11></a> He gives gifts to men, and that is why I am stressing the point of gifted men, and how they are to be used.<a name=421:12></a> Their gifts are not to be used as toys, or as making much of themselves, they are to be used for the promotion of spiritual power and spirituality, and too for the help of persons who have fallen under the power of sin or death; in this case the child had fallen under the power of death.<a name=421:13></a> The father said that she had actually died, but then the Lord said "the child has not died, but sleeps".<a name=421:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to remark on the importance of gift, and how the Lord selects gift, and how when He comes to the house He selects these men.<a name=421:15></a> After He heard about the child being dead He comes to the house, it was not far away, apparently, and then we have a selection of these men, as if they were needed

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		at this particular time.<a name=422:1></a> So the matter proceeds and we are told that certain ones derided the Lord.<a name=422:2></a> A terrible thing that there should be a condition of derision when we are dealing with the things of God, the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, His death, His burial, His resurrection, and His ascension to heaven, and all else that enters into the truth of the gospel.<a name=422:3></a> It is a terrible thing that there should be found derision in a city like this, but it is so, and it is actually in the house in this chapter, but the Lord put the deriders out.<a name=422:4></a> That is my point in this passage.<a name=422:5></a> The doors were shut in the first, and these deriding people are put out here.<a name=422:6></a> The Lord did it.<a name=422:7></a> If we look into the gospels, we find that Matthew says they were put out, without saying who did it; but Mark says that the Lord did it.<a name=422:8></a> Then the Lord selected the father and mother of the child and He said to her, "Talitha koumi, which is, interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, Arise".<a name=422:9></a> The Lord used those words and she arose and walked.<a name=422:10></a> You may say, Why do you say that she walked?<a name=422:11></a> Well, because she did, and she was old enough to be regarded in the light of being able to walk.<a name=422:12></a> She was not simply a babe or a little child, she was a girl and therefore the question arises as to whether she was fit for fellowship; because what I am dealing with, dear brethren, is spirituality, and we must have intelligence before spirituality, and now this girl is evidently ready for fellowship.<a name=422:13></a> She is able to walk.<a name=422:14></a> She can go to the meeting herself.<a name=422:15></a> She could be trusted to walk.<a name=422:16></a> I want to make the thing simple and practical; she points to a person who is at the age of suitability for the fellowship, for fellowship in the things of God, if you will understand me.<a name=422:17></a> I do not want to be misunderstood.<a name=422:18></a> It is a question of the things of God.<a name=422:19></a> There may be fellowship in other things but I am speaking of the things of God, and that there may be fellowship in them, and this little girl is

		clearly one that can be viewed as in fellowship.<a name=423:1></a> She walks.<a name=423:2></a> It says, "for she was twelve years old".<a name=423:3></a> That word <i>for</i> means something.<a name=423:4></a> It means that something grows out of it, that she is one of those who can go to the meeting and participate in what is of God, "for she was twelve years old".<a name=423:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the Lord took care of the other side of the matter; He commanded that something should be given her to eat.<a name=423:6></a> That is another point of great importance, especially to mothers, as to young girls and what they read, what they are living on in that sense.<a name=423:7></a> Sometimes one has ventured to refer to Elisha who had to do with a dead boy in the Old Testament.<a name=423:8></a> Elijah did too, but Elisha had to do with a dead boy and he wondered why he had died, what caused his death.<a name=423:9></a> He wondered, he walked up and down the house as if he were saying to himself, Why has this happened?<a name=423:10></a> What caused this, why should this child have died?<a name=423:11></a> Well, what is the cause?<a name=423:12></a> So, as I have said, you can understand how Elisha walked up and down in the house.<a name=423:13></a> Would he not look around to see if someone had any books that would be damaging to that young boy?<a name=423:14></a> Certainly he would, and other things like that, because these are the things that hinder fellowship, that hinder the growth of meetings.<a name=423:15></a> Youths are damaged by what they eat; that is, in the moral sense of reading and the like.<a name=423:16></a> Then, besides that, the Lord commanded that something should be given her to eat.<a name=423:17></a> What is the something?<a name=423:18></a> Something surely that is not stale, not something that has been used before, but something that is fresh.<a name=423:19></a> She is a girl just raised from the dead and surely we would do the very best for her, and would select what is fresh and good and nourishing, but above all what is spiritual; what would promote spirituality in that child.<a name=423:20></a>

		dead, she was living.<a name=424:1></a> She had been morally dead, but now she is living.<a name=424:2></a> She has come into touch with Christ.<a name=424:3></a> John would say she is living.<a name=424:4></a> She belongs to the living.<a name=424:5></a> When we come to Dorcas, she was a woman.<a name=424:6></a> We often say, Well, she is a woman.<a name=424:7></a> But why should we say that?<a name=424:8></a> Why should we use the word <i>woman</i> in any sense except the true sense?<a name=424:9></a> Dorcas was not only a woman; but, as ordinary people would say, she was a useful woman, a woman making garments for the poor, and how useful these are at the present time, but then she died.<a name=424:10></a> She grew sick and died.<a name=424:11></a> She lived at Joppa, but she grew sick and died, and the widows and the persons around were no doubt interested, they were concerned; not that they were said to be relatives, but they were in close relation to her clearly, and they sent for Peter.<a name=424:12></a> A very great matter that Peter should be sent for, for he was shortly to be sent for to do something very wonderful; that is, to help Cornelius; but now he has been sent for to raise the dead woman.<a name=424:13></a> It is another matter altogether, but he is ready to be sent for, and he goes with them.<a name=424:14></a> The Lord went with Jairus, and Peter goes with those sent from Joppa, and what he found was that she was dead.<a name=424:15></a> She was taken care of too, she was washed, she was in the upper chamber, she was not left carelessly, although dead, she was left with respect.<a name=424:16></a> The passage tells us what happened.<a name=424:17></a> "And Peter rising up went with them, whom, when arrived, they brought up into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing him the body-coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them".<a name=424:18></a> But Peter put them all out.<a name=424:19></a> Now, I am pointing this out, because it refers to what has to be put forth from our associations, and our affiliations, if we are to progress spiritually.<a name=424:20></a> We are not to make everyone our companions.<a name=424:21></a> We are to select our companions.<a name=424:22></a> We belong to heaven.<a name=424:23></a> We are called

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the third case in my address, the third feature of my subject, it is a question of finding out what has to be learned in this woman.<a name=425:5></a> She is dead.<a name=425:6></a> Well, what about Peter?<a name=425:7></a> What can be learned from Peter?<a name=425:8></a> See what he did.<a name=425:9></a> Peter put them all forth without any discrimination, clearly.<a name=425:10></a> That is to say, they were not fit for these surroundings.<a name=425:11></a> They would, if left there, only hinder what he had come for to Joppa; and yet they had washed the woman and laid her in the upper chamber, but Peter has these exercises about them, and he prays.<a name=425:12></a> He was a praying man.<a name=425:13></a> I have already referred to Peter and James and John as gifted men; that is the point as regards them.<a name=425:14></a> Peter is an apostle of course, but more than that he is, according to Matthew, the first apostle.<a name=425:15></a> There is that fact mentioned, that Peter is first, and clearly there is involved in that the sense of responsibility.<a name=425:16></a> The great matter if we have gift at all, or if we have anything from God, is to have a sense of responsibility as to it, and make whatever we can of it in the power that God gives to us, and that power is in the Holy Spirit.<a name=425:17></a> There is no other power for the work of God today, and if anybody is attempting to work in the Lord's service, do not think of it unless you can see that you have the Holy Spirit and that you have learned how to use Him, and that He is free to use you too, and He will be free as you are free to be used.<a name=425:18></a> So Peter is a true

		J.T.<a name=429:1></a> If I may use a title for the subject, it would be the divine appointments as seen in the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=429:2></a> The thoughts centre in the truth of sonship and priesthood from the divine side and the service of the saints as entering into the divine appointments in the assembly.<a name=429:3></a> Our subject covers the whole epistle if we wish to extend it, but at one reading it is thought that, whilst perhaps touching on the different features of each thought mentioned, we might seek to restrict ourselves so that each part of a subject should be taken in.<a name=429:4></a> Sonship is the first and the greatest and it has various branches, or extensions.<a name=429:5></a> It is hoped that we may touch on the leading thoughts even though they are not included in the passages read; we should not forget the appointments of the saints, the appointments of God as covering the saints themselves in the divine service.<a name=429:6></a> Chapter 13 will cover that side; but sonship, as we said, is the greatest of the features of the subject before us and it is thought we should touch on the first chapter in itself; that the speaking is by the Son.<a name=429:7></a> God has spoken unto us in Son; spoken as God but in the character or relation of Son.<a name=429:8></a> Chapter 3 speaks of the house over which Christ is Son.<a name=429:9></a> Chapter I deals almost entirely with the thought of sonship, and, as we said, it is the greatest, not so much because it involves deity, but because of the need for it as affording liberty in the service of God, dignity too, but especially liberty.<a name=429:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=430:1></a> Well, it is, I suppose.<a name=430:2></a> It is applied in this epistle according to the tenor of the epistle; not exactly according to the tenor of Galatians.<a name=430:3></a> It is evidently Paul's service and he is carrying his doctrine and his ministry into the Jewish side of the position then.<a name=430:4></a> This accounts for much that is said here that is not found elsewhere, because the writer intends to affect the Jewish believers who were in danger of turning aside.<a name=430:5></a> So the idea of speaking has a great place.<a name=430:6></a> We have, therefore, in chapter 2: 1 - 4, "For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things we have heard, lest in any way we should slip away.<a name=430:7></a> For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution, how shall we escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken of by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard; God bearing, besides, witness with them to it, both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will?<a name=430:8></a>".<a name=430:9></a> This passage is, I think, one of the most important as to the practical side, because of the threatened danger and warning where there may be a tendency with us to slip away, growing cold through worldliness and the like.<a name=430:10></a> This paragraph shows the great pains that God had taken to save His earthly people, that is to say, those who had come into Christianity; and the warning is held out because of what was said.<a name=430:11></a> That is, the reference would be to the ministry of the twelve, which had been widespread, and now Paul evidently had in mind to apply certain features that he was accustomed to, only giving them a Jewish turn, so that he should be more intelligible to the Jewish Christians, and above all, that there were the various distributions of the Holy Spirit according to God's will.<a name=430:12></a>

		I want to speak about personal liberty.<a name=452:1></a> I have selected the Lord Himself as my subject.<a name=452:2></a> It is suitable to connect the subject with the gospel of Mark for it is the minister's gospel.<a name=452:3></a> In using the word 'minister' I am referring to service in ministry such as the Levites used to be engaged in typically.<a name=452:4></a> Now more accurately it would be those who serve in the word of God, although the service of the Levites included more.<a name=452:5></a> But the service of the word of God remains as belonging to the subject, the levitical subject, because it entailed toil or labour, real toil; and hence the word 'labourer' is the word to use if we are to be accurate.<a name=452:6></a> Mark is the section of Scripture that especially unfolds the truth to us as to ministry; and so when I spoke about personal liberty, I should have added particularly as to those persons who minister.<a name=452:7></a> But the Lord leads in this for us, as He does, indeed, in all the gospels.<a name=452:8></a> Recently we have spoken of the gospels extending beyond the present dispensation and have used a well-known phrase, the gospels go over the wall; that is, the wall of holy discrimination and separation in truth.<a name=452:9></a> Hence, we may speak of cutting in a straight line the word of truth.<a name=452:10></a> That expression is intelligible according to what I have said.<a name=452:11></a> The person who is dealing in the truth treats of the assembly in what belongs to it.<a name=452:12></a> That is, he does not mix things; he does not confuse things.<a name=452:13></a> The idea of a straight line means I am not confusing the truth by misapplication.<a name=452:14></a> And so in Mark He is introduced to us very abruptly.<a name=452:15></a> It speaks of the Lord as "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God".<a name=452:16></a> It is very abrupt, but clearly it is a personal matter that the theme before us is

		Jesus Christ, referring to Him as a Man, but as Son of God.<a name=453:1></a> Personally He is Jesus Christ in His service, and of course, the term 'Son of God' might be left out and the matter would be perfectly intelligible to us, but 'Son of God' is added because it is a question of the levitical work, or the labourer's work, the teacher's work, the preacher's work.<a name=453:2></a> And so the gospel provides not only for the Lord but for every preacher and every teacher; everyone engaged in the work, as it is called; nothing is omitted that the labourer needs.<a name=453:3></a> Above all, he needs encouragement.<a name=453:4></a> So we find in the record of the Lord's baptism that the heavens were opened to Him and the voice was not, 'This is the Son of God', but, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=453:5></a> That is a word for the labourer; a labourer needs to know that God is well pleased with him.<a name=453:6></a> You understand I am not at all detracting from the terms applied to the Lord personally, but it is clear that the labourer needs to be assured that God is well pleased with him, not simply that the brethren are well pleased with him or that he can preach well or teach well, but that personally God is well pleased with him.<a name=453:7></a> So the word was to the Lord Himself, and it would set Him on His glorious way as the gospel here presents Him, and what a way!<a name=453:8></a> What a way of glory!<a name=453:9></a> The Spirit came upon Him, fitting Him, if I may use that expression, for the service ahead.<a name=453:10></a> He is appointed, for it is a question of appointment as we had it already today.<a name=453:11></a> It is a question of God's appointments and it is clear that the appointment of Jesus, whom God has made both Lord and Christ, should be clear.<a name=453:12></a> There should be every reason for it, every ground for it.<a name=453:13></a> He is appointed in heaven.<a name=453:14></a> "God has made him, this Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:36">Acts  2:36</a>.<a name=453:15></a> God has made Him that; the appointment is right.<a name=453:16></a> So it should be with everyone

		So if we want to get young people to come into manhood, we have to teach them to put away childish things.<a name=469:7></a> I have not time really, but I should not mind at all if I were asked to give a list of the things that I would call childish things, but I forbear.<a name=469:8></a> I can allude to Timothy as a model young man who would serve an elder and serve him well and have no idea of displacing him or replacing him, but serving with him as Elisha served with his master Elijah.<a name=469:9></a> He served well and Elijah served well, and Elisha learned from Elijah.<a name=469:10></a> He was not slow and did not hesitate to use the very phrases, the very figures that Elijah used: we ought to be ready to do that.<a name=469:11></a> Language is of God.<a name=469:12></a> Man makes it to some extent but it is of God, and of course it is for all.<a name=469:13></a> The use of language is a most important ability.<a name=469:14></a> We can hardly serve in the Lord's work unless we know something of it.<a name=469:15></a> So Timothy was taught by Paul and was rebuked by him: "Stir up the gift" Paul says.<a name=469:16></a> He also says in his letter to the Colossians, "Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:17">Colossians  4:17</a>.<a name=469:17></a> So that if people are still on their knees or take their case in the services, when something is needed, then the Spirit of God will rebuke it because a gift is not given for nothing.<a name=469:18></a> It is given to be used.<a name=469:19></a> So

		Well now, the letters to Corinth afford a fine field for my subject, because of the use which the saints there were making of gifts.<a name=470:5></a> Paul has recourse to beautiful language in this last verse of chapter 12: "But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence".<a name=470:6></a> It is one of the best phrases in the epistle; you could hardly get a better anywhere: "a way of more surpassing excellence".<a name=470:7></a> If anyone has a gift or is usable in the Lord's service, he does well to study it, and see if he has part in this way.<a name=470:8></a> The apostle stops then and takes up the way he has in his mind, which is chapter 13.<a name=470:9></a> It is there he unfolds this way of surpassing excellence.<a name=470:10></a> He comes down to the last verse of chapter 13 and comes on to chapter 14 and he says, "Follow after love".<a name=470:11></a> He had been suggesting that they might be following after other things, but he had the one thing particularly in his mind, that the servant is to learn how to follow after this great commodity which I may call love.<a name=470:12></a> The Lord speaks of it in that same way.<a name=470:13></a> He says, "if ye have love amongst yourselves" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>); that is to say, it is to be in yourself.<a name=470:14></a> It belongs to the saints; it cannot be carved out into quantities or squares, or held in vessels in that sense.<a name=470:15></a> It is to be among us; it is in heaven.<a name=470:16></a> It is among the angels, I believe.<a name=470:17></a> It will be among all

		And so this chapter is taken up by the apostle and made the theme for the moment.<a name=471:11></a> I may say the apostle segregates the truth in the most skilful way - most wonderful are the verses running through this epistle - especially when it comes to the direct teaching of the assembly.<a name=471:12></a> Chapter 12 is worked out from chapter 11; but chapter 12 is worked out as the great matter of the assembly and the body of Christ.<a name=471:13></a> The assembly is the great theme of it, and in speaking of it the apostle seems to have stopped at the end of chapter 12, as if to say, I must make full room for this way of more surpassing excellence.<a name=471:14></a> I love that verse.<a name=471:15></a> I have already alluded to it.<a name=471:16></a> It is a way of more surpassing excellence.<a name=471:17></a> It is a most wonderful phrase and worthy of being left for the moment to shine in its glory, for that is what it is.<a name=471:18></a> We can look at it, go around it, and see how it does shine.<a name=471:19></a> And so he leaves it; and yet he does not leave it because he begins to delineate the thing in chapter 13, and it begins thus: "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels"; you can see how he changes his thoughts from chapter 12 to chapter 13.<a name=471:20></a> He says, "if I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal".<a name=471:21></a> Now I might say he is becoming contemptuous because he is alluding to persons who are not Christians and who would make toys of the truth, as

		I was saying.<a name=472:1></a> I venture to say it is contempt.<a name=472:2></a> The person endeavouring to show himself and speak with tongues of men and of angels and who has not love is become as sounding brass and a clanging cymbal.<a name=472:3></a> You can see the depth of the fall from that glorious verse in the end of the previous chapter, and how it may apply even to a person, maybe, in the ministry.<a name=472:4></a> Let us, for instance, suggest Judas, because he was in the ministry; he was numbered among the apostles.<a name=472:5></a> He was regarded as a gift and was a gift, such as is spoken of here.<a name=472:6></a> Hence the contempt: "I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal".<a name=472:7></a> I am sure there is not a person here who would like to be classified in that way.<a name=472:8></a> I am certain there is not.<a name=472:9></a> And yet there arc those who are no better.<a name=472:10></a> The so-called ministry is dumped in that way abroad in the sects.<a name=472:11></a> Men go to school and college and take the highest orders and yet you find them shining up their classics; shining them up to make what they have got shine.<a name=472:12></a> I do not mean shining the books or making much of the books, but 'I know something about those books'.<a name=472:13></a> Well, that is what Paul means here.<a name=472:14></a> The very designation he uses earlier alludes to this.<a name=472:15></a> You may have ten thousand instructors and not many fathers.<a name=472:16></a> You may say, 'well, were there ever as many as that?<a name=472:17></a>' Are there not now?<a name=472:18></a> In the three hundred millions of Protestants how many ministers there are, how many of the clergy; and then the other sects.<a name=472:19></a> How numerous they are!<a name=472:20></a> It is a regular trade.<a name=472:21></a> So that the apostle says they make a trade of the word of God.<a name=472:22></a> I am not doing that, but how easily we can do it.<a name=472:23></a> I am not saying anyone here is doing that; I am just parading the truth, as it were, before us just for a moment so that we may see how Paul - as someone has said -shows a picture on the wall, if you can understand that figure; it means that in the Corinthians love was not there.<a name=472:24></a> It was there really, but it

		It is clear that the movement now in view began with the introduction of Cornelius who may be taken as a representative of the gentiles, but certain features were needed to lead up to and introduce the movement in Paul and Barnabas, especially in Paul, for the chapter contemplates Paul coming into the lead in the divine movement.<a name=500:5></a> It is thought that it will be a help to us here to review a little of the divine way in revivals.<a name=500:6></a> The Lord may be pleased to continue the movement here in this city and enlarge it, and it will be advantageous to the brethren if a new clear apprehension is had of this feature in the economy; that is, the feature of revival.<a name=500:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=501:7></a> That is a good point to bring up, because it was so in all revivals.<a name=501:8></a> It is hardly suitable to speak of Adam himself, but there was something in the sense of revival in Abel, and then in Seth, and in Enoch.<a name=501:9></a> We may see what was there; and so in the great movements in Noah himself and in Abraham; and then in Joseph and Moses and David, divine instruments already there, carried down from previous movements, even inclusive of the creation of Adam and all that flowed out from him and Eve; but the revival was in Abel.<a name=501:10></a> I do not know whether I am saying too little, but I am sure the brethren will get the idea at once, that it is a matter of divine energy revived.<a name=501:11></a> The energy is always there, for God does not change; Christ does not change, and the Spirit does not change.<a name=501:12></a> But in the saints there is change.<a name=501:13></a>
