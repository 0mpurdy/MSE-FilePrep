		THE INTRODUCTION OF THE GOSPEL INTO EUROPE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:1">Acts  16:1</a> - 34
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point I want to call attention to is the way in which the apostle Paul carried on his service, a subject which should not only be of great interest to all who would labour, but to all Christians, whether labourers or otherwise, for it indicates the divine manner of approaching man with the gospel.<a name=1:1></a> God takes great pains to allay every prejudice in men; and when it becomes a matter of introducing the gospel to a new continent, this manner on the part of God is brought into evidence.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The incidents recorded in this chapter, as many know, mark the introduction of the gospel into the Western world; it was Paul's first visit to Europe.<a name=1:3></a> It recalls to one's mind the attitude of God as foreshadowed in the temple; the cherubim there were looking out toward the house instead of looking down toward the mercy seat as in the tabernacle, as if to take account of the need which was outside, and to meet it in grace.<a name=1:4></a> In that outlook God embraced men, for He has a very long look-out.<a name=1:5></a> When the prodigal was moving towards his father in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, his father saw him a long way off, and so here one may picture God looking out towards Europe.<a name=1:6></a> He saw the end from the beginning, and that the introduction of the gospel there was to be of far-reaching consequences to the human race.<a name=1:7></a> He had His own chosen vessel, too, in Paul for this work, not one sent from Jerusalem, but as one might say, sent from heaven; he was a heavenly missionary.<a name=1:8></a> We have to bear in mind that Paul in his evangelical ministry worked from the full height of his commission, as he tells us in his epistle to the Ephesians, "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us".<a name=1:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:4">Ephesians  2:4</a>).<a name=1:10></a>

		As the chapter teaches, Paul is guided to Philippi.<a name=2:1></a> He was forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia, and when he assayed to go to Bithynia the Spirit of Jesus suffered him not, and he was subject.<a name=2:2></a> A beautiful model for all who serve!<a name=2:3></a> Presently, as a subject vessel, he has a vision.<a name=2:4></a> There was need in Macedonia, there was need in Europe, a need perfectly known to God, but now already becoming known to a few in Philippi, for there was a spot there where prayer was wont to be made.<a name=2:5></a> I wonder if there is any one here who has a spiritual need, who is conscious of his absolute weakness in having to say to God, feeling his powerlessness, and who has the power of evil pressing upon his spirit, and it may be death before him.<a name=2:6></a> Is there any one here like that?<a name=2:7></a> If so, God takes account of it The man from Macedonia appears in the vision and says, "Come over and help us".<a name=2:8></a> It was a call, and the servant was subject, entirely subject, thus affording room for God to show what He had in His mind, and how He would reach the regions beyond.<a name=2:9></a> The divine horizon was far beyond even Paul's.<a name=2:10></a> Later on he spoke of going to Spain, of going to the utmost limits; he had that in his heart, but God had it in His heart before Paul.<a name=2:11></a> God had looked out and saw Europe.<a name=2:12></a> One cannot but dwell on that.<a name=2:13></a>

		Now, God is not carrying on government simply for the sake of having government on earth, but on account of those who shall be heirs of salvation.<a name=2:14></a> It is said of angels, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?<a name=2:15></a>" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:14">Hebrews  1:14</a>) We may reckon on that, and we should be concerned, as Paul was, with what is going on in the souls of men and women; and when I say women, I say it, because they are very prominent in this chapter.<a name=2:16></a> In two of them a work of God had already begun before Paul preached to them.<a name=2:17></a> In the third, a dreadful work of the devil proceeded;

		sad, solemn fact!<a name=3:1></a> It may be that in this company, small as it is, there are those in whom an initial work of God has taken effect, but whose hearts as yet have not come into the good and blessing of the gospel; but, on the other hand, there may be one in whom the devil has begun to work, who has been employed by the devil in some way or other.<a name=3:2></a> The damsel with the spirit of divination said, "These men are the servants of the most high God".<a name=3:3></a> It sounded very nice; apparently she is a helper of Paul, but in reality she is an agent of the devil, and opposing the introduction of the light of grace.<a name=3:4></a> It may be there is one here who has come under the power of the devil; if so, now is your opportunity.<a name=3:5></a> The <i>mind</i> of God for you is exactly the same as it is for those in whom God has begun to work.<a name=3:6></a> The mind of God for this wretched woman was the same as for the others, for God has not two minds.<a name=3:7></a> Of the Saviour God it is said, "who will have all men to be saved".<a name=3:8></a> (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:4">1 Timothy  2:4</a>) His mind for her was grace, and so the demon was cast out of her.<a name=3:9></a>

		But to refer for a moment to the first woman mentioned in this chapter, Timothy's mother; she is an honoured woman, she is said to be a "believing woman", for that is how it should read; a Jewess, but not simply one who had believed.<a name=3:10></a> To make a profession of faith on a certain day and then to go as usual does not constitute a believing woman.<a name=3:11></a> A "believing" woman is one who is marked by faith every day.<a name=3:12></a> Well, Timothy's mother was said to be such, she believed not only for herself, but for Timothy.<a name=3:13></a> Her mother, too, that is, Timothy's grandmother, we see also was a believing woman.<a name=3:14></a> The apostle in writing to Timothy said, "The unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice".<a name=3:15></a> (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:5">2 Timothy  1:5</a>) But I only speak of that to show how important it is for wives and mothers to be believing women; women

		who bring in faith, who bring God into things, both in regard to their husbands and their children.<a name=4:1></a> As to Timothy's father, all that is said of him is that he "was a Greek".<a name=4:2></a> He possibly had a political status, but nothing spiritual is indicated in regard of him, and therefore this is a word for unbelieving husbands.<a name=4:3></a> Is there any husband here of whom all that could be said is, that he is an Englishman?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Timothy himself had a good report.<a name=4:5></a> We read, "which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium".<a name=4:6></a> Young man, young brother, what about you?<a name=4:7></a> What about the report that can be made about you in your district?<a name=4:8></a> That is a word for young brothers!<a name=4:9></a> You all understand that I am endeavouring to make a present application of the facts that are presented to us in this scripture, for, if we profess to believe the gospel, God looks for a life in accord with it.<a name=4:10></a> Timothy was such as to be worthy to be taken up by the great apostle as a companion and fellow-labourer; it is said, "him would Paul have to go forth with him".<a name=4:11></a> What a trophy of grace!<a name=4:12></a> One would appeal to those who have Christian parents as to the importance of following what has come to you through them, lest you should become a profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of meat, a mess of pottage, sold his birthright.<a name=4:13></a> One would speak to the young people who know the Lord, for God is taking the old ones home, and you will be called soon, if the Lord tarry, to occupy the ground and to stand for Him.<a name=4:14></a> One would desire that your report should be a good one from the Lord's people in the district where you are.<a name=4:15></a>

		The next woman that we get is Lydia.<a name=4:16></a> What one notices in connection with her is that the apostle's desire is first of all to associate himself with that which is of God in that place.<a name=4:17></a> He did not take a hall in Philippi and start to preach.<a name=4:18></a> He found the place where prayer was wont to be made; he found

		that dependence was already there, and he came into touch with it; he and those with him "sat down and spake unto the women"; and now Lydia comes into evidence.<a name=5:1></a> This woman was not of Philippi but of the city of Thyatira.<a name=5:2></a> She was a seller of purple, she had a trade; of her it is recorded that the Lord opened her heart, "that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul".<a name=5:3></a> Notice that!<a name=5:4></a> She attended to them, and they were taken into her heart and pondered over.<a name=5:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What about your heart?<a name=5:6></a> Simeon in the temple, when he took up Jesus in his arms, said that the thoughts of many hearts would be revealed in connection with that Child.<a name=5:7></a> The coming of Christ involved the testing of every heart.<a name=5:8></a> How about your heart?<a name=5:9></a> Your heart has to be taken account of by itself.<a name=5:10></a> The word of God has to be received there, but I would call your attention to what the Lord says in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, that while the word may be received, unless it is understood, the devil comes and catches away that which was sown in the heart.<a name=5:11></a> The apostle said "the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in heart".<a name=5:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:8">Romans  10:8</a>) Now that is remarkable, because it shows that the word may be received, and yet if it not understood, Satan takes it away.<a name=5:13></a> One has seen many instances of that kind, where the enemy takes away the word, so that the man remains what he ever was, he is unaffected.<a name=5:14></a> I ask again, How about your heart?<a name=5:15></a> Has the word been received into your heart, and has it been understood?<a name=5:16></a> The word of God brings in what God is, and what Christ is, and so works effectually in those who believe.<a name=5:17></a> It is effectual only in those who believe.<a name=5:18></a> Lydia believed; she received the word into her heart, and then she opened her house to Paul.<a name=5:19></a>

		My thought on this occasion is to say a word about Paul, to seek to make clear, if I can, the circumstances under which he was introduced and their spiritual significance, and then to show a little the main features of his doctrine and manner of life or conduct, and the accompanying features that are mentioned in the passage I read from 2 Timothy.<a name=10:1></a> I have chosen that passage because of its bearing on the last days.<a name=10:2></a> Timothy being the chosen servant to take up, and continue, and hand on to the saints that which Paul had ministered.<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of Timothy I would call attention to what I think should be observed in regard of him, namely, that in the first letter he is said to have received gift through prophecy and the laying on of the hands of the presbytery, whereas in the second letter his gift is connected entirely with the putting on of Paul's hands, as if to impress upon him that, whilst he had to do with the assembly in order, as an apostolic delegate, and consequently the elderhood or presbytery had necessarily place and influence, now the time had come when Paul's impress must be emphasised.<a name=10:4></a> It is well that the elderhood, or presbytery should be observed, but conditions arise in which Paul, as the chosen and faithful vessel of Christ, must take precedence, and so Timothy is to re-kindle the gift of God which was in him by the laying on of Paul's hands.<a name=10:5></a> Then another feature in this second letter is that Timothy was to have an outline of sound words.<a name=10:6></a> I mention these, dear brethren, as things to be observed now by us, if we are to be here intelligently and rightly for Christ, He was to have "an outline of sound words, which words", says the apostle, "thou hast heard of me".<a name=10:7></a>

		This involves Paul's doctrine.<a name=11:1></a> Paul's teaching was to be held in outline in the ministry of Timothy "in faith and love, which are in Christ Jesus".<a name=11:2></a> And then, thirdly, he is to pass on to faithful men the things which he had learned of Paul in the presence of many witnesses that they might "teach others also".<a name=11:3></a> Thus, in this letter, Timothy (or the man of God for the last days) is to be stamped by Paul's teaching and example.<a name=11:4></a> I bring these points forward at the beginning so that we might have in mind how matters stand at this hour, that is, in our day.<a name=11:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul and his ministry afford a great test for us in these days.<a name=11:6></a> The apostle says in chapter 3, "thou hast fully known [or, 'hast followed up'] my doctrine, manner of life, purpose".<a name=11:7></a> I mention this because of the importance of following things up from the outset, that we might have clearly in view what the mind of the Lord is.<a name=11:8></a> You will recall how Luke writing with method to Theophilus, "having been accurately acquainted from the origin with all things" began "from the very first"; (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>,3) hence the great importance of going back to the beginning; that is, of being in exercise, as Timothy undoubtedly was, in order that we should follow things up and miss nothing.<a name=11:9></a> And I may remark another feature in passing, namely, that you have in this letter Paul and his company as it appeared at the end, not as it appeared at the beginning.<a name=11:10></a> You will recall the word in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:13">Acts  13:13</a>, how that after Paul, having started out from Antioch with Barnabas, had caused blindness to come upon Elymas, the opposer of the truth, mention is made of "Paul and his company".<a name=11:11></a> The Spirit of God emphasises the place of this remarkable servant and those who were regarded as his company.<a name=11:12></a> That was the beginning, whereas this second letter to Timothy presents to us the company at the end, after having passed through the conflicts, the storms, and all the

		efforts of the enemy to shatter it, and although discredited, marred and depleted, it remained true, for Paul was still the triumphant witness, and Luke was with him, with others mentioned honourably, and especially Mark.<a name=12:1></a> The case of Mark shows that, whilst the enemy had wrought for disintegration, the Lord had wrought in the way of recovery.<a name=12:2></a> The restorative grace of Christ is that which we may reckon upon, dear brethren, so that a man who "separated from them" as it is said of Mark in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:13">Acts  13:13</a>, "from Paul and his company", is now sent for, as one who is profitable to Paul for ministry.<a name=12:3></a> Wonderful triumph of the restorative grace of Christ!<a name=12:4></a> -- a grace, as I remarked, which we may rely upon, and indeed which we should always be in sympathy with, for the Spirit of Christ in us always aims at recovery, never at destruction; so that, although a brother may depart from the company, as Mark did, in the end he is serviceable for ministry.<a name=12:5></a>

		Now I go on to the circumstances under which Paul was introduced, and what one may call attention to, and what is very well known doubtless to most of us, is the assertion at that juncture of the authority of the Lord.<a name=12:6></a> He comes in peculiarly <i>as the Lord</i> at that epoch, for it is a most memorable period in the history of the assembly; the enemy having stirred up a terrific persecution against the saints, Saul entered into the houses one after another, as we are told, and in his zeal dragged off men and women, delivering them up to prison, and now by permission of the priests at Jerusalem he sets out with his credentials to Damascus to carry out his mission of persecution and destruction of the people of the Lord.<a name=12:7></a> At that moment the Lord manifests Himself in His authority on behalf of the assembly.<a name=12:8></a> He had been made "Lord and Christ", and He is now interfering to assert His authority as such in the way of protection.<a name=12:9></a> I commend that simple

		thought to you, dear brethren, it is a thought most important to us.<a name=13:1></a> The wing of Christ's protection is extended over the assembly, the object of His love; and so the Lord meets this man on the way, having allowed him first to traverse the road from Jerusalem to Damascus.<a name=13:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At this point I would call attention to another feature in the Lord's position; that is, that He had not only come from God, but He had gone <i>to God</i>.<a name=13:3></a> I mention that here so that you may see the setting of Paul's introduction.<a name=13:4></a> The disciples believed that He had come out from God (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:30">John  16:30</a>); that was a good deal to believe, but it was not enough; we must believe that He is gone to God, and I am not now speaking of His exaltation or His ascension, but of what was due to Him morally as having been here as a Man on earth for God's glory.<a name=13:5></a> Think of a Man going in to God in the dignity of His Person!<a name=13:6></a> I commend that thought to your consideration as the other side to the Lord's position.<a name=13:7></a> It may seem very simple, but it is of all moment for us to apprehend that He has gone to God; the truth of His Person is involved in it, but it refers to what He did as a Man here on earth.<a name=13:8></a> He went to God, as having glorified God as a Man here on earth.<a name=13:9></a> So He says to Paul, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest".<a name=13:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:5">Acts  9:5</a>) He was the Man who had been known on earth, in whom God was glorified, and who could say, "I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do"; (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:4">John  17:4</a>) it is that Jesus, that Man, the One whom Stephen had seen in the glory, who had gone in to God.<a name=13:11></a> And further, dear brethren, I want to say here that the whole mediatorial system which was to come out and be developed in Paul's doctrine hangs on this great fact, that He has gone to God, a Man has gone in to God.<a name=13:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, not to dwell in detail as to Paul's introduction, I want to say at this point that whilst the Lord
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus revealed Himself in this remarkable fashion in bringing down this mighty agent of the devil, God also was at work at the same time; so the apostle tells us, in writing to the Galatians, that God revealed his Son in him.<a name=14:1></a> I shall say a word about that on account of the connection here.<a name=14:2></a> "But when God", he says, "who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations".<a name=14:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:15">Galatians  1:15</a>,16) I plead for a moment for that feature, the Father's work, which is parallel with the work of the Son, and brings in the element of sovereignty, a most important element for us.<a name=14:4></a> Whilst the <i>Lord</i> acts from heaven, and speaks to Saul by name, and announces Himself to him as "Jesus", the Man, <i>God</i> revealed His Son in him.<a name=14:5></a> He revealed His Son <i>in</i> him; that is God's sovereign act, and I want to speak of that, because one feels the immense importance of the sovereign acts of God.<a name=14:6></a> Now in acting thus, God acts in relation to the work of Christ; Christ appeared from heaven to Saul, and God revealed His Son in him.<a name=14:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Referring now for a moment to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, we find the Father had beforehand revealed the Son to Peter.<a name=14:8></a> Peter confessed "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God", and the Lord said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.<a name=14:9></a> And I also, I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly".<a name=14:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:16">Matthew  16:16</a> - 18) Now "the Christ" was a feature in the revelation to Peter, although the major part of the revelation is the great fact that He is "the Son of the living God"; so that the structure to be reared up would be marked by an understanding of the fact that all things are accomplished, not by human agency nor by combination, but by <i>the Christ</i>.<a name=14:11></a> The Christ is the One by whom God effects everything, an

	<div class="paragraph">
		immense thing for us to understand, delivering us, as being in the structure of which this is the foundation, from all dependence on human agencies and methods; we apprehend that the Christ not only <i>tells</i> us all things, but He <i>accomplishes</i> all things for God; He is the Anointed.<a name=15:1></a> But then there is also in this revelation to Peter that which is <i>living</i>, and I commend to you at the present time the importance of this feature.<a name=15:2></a> The structure is to be replete with life, for it is composed of living stones built "on this rock", which is living; "the Son of the living God".<a name=15:3></a> Now we are said to have come to the <i>city</i> of the living God.<a name=15:4></a> This comes about, as I apprehend, through the testimony of the twelve; it is involved in the confession by Peter, but we have an additional thought in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>, namely, that we have come to the <i>heavenly</i> Jerusalem, "the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem", and this latter, I believe, is Paul's feature.<a name=15:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might remark here that the Father; that is, God, acting <i>sovereignly</i> is, as I said, an immense thing for us, because it is a question of what He does at any particular moment.<a name=15:6></a> We read in the Old Testament that He lays "for foundation in Zion, a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation", (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28:16">Isaiah  28:16</a>) but where is He laying His foundation now?<a name=15:7></a> It is for us to know, dear brethren, where He lays it, or rather, where He has laid it.<a name=15:8></a> It is quite clear that it is not now in Zion literally; it is laid in the souls of His people.<a name=15:9></a> According to His sovereign election He lays it, and so, in bringing in this fresh thought; that is, the Son of God, the Person revealed in Paul, we have suggested the dignity and liberty that belong to sonship.<a name=15:10></a> In the letter to the Galatians the apostle develops sonship from that point of view, not as a foundation exactly, but as that which occasions liberty in the souls of God's people, so that whilst the testimony is living,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		it is also in liberty.<a name=16:1></a> It is dignified as being the heavenly Jerusalem; that is Paul's feature.<a name=16:2></a> "Jesus is the Son of God", he says; that is the first preaching by Paul, according to the scriptural record.<a name=16:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to his commission, in order to get some little light on how matters stood as he began his ministry, and I selected <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26">Acts  26</a>, because it is one of his own accounts of the occurrence.<a name=16:4></a> Chapter 9 is the account given by the Spirit, whereas the two other records are Paul's own accounts.<a name=16:5></a> On this occasion he is before king Agrippa, and it is quite evident that the apostle is moved in his soul in speaking of it.<a name=16:6></a> I mention that, not to occupy you much with it, but one does think of the importance of being moved in our souls.<a name=16:7></a> As the truth develops in us we become habituated to soul movement, and, as I might say, soul emotion.<a name=16:8></a> Let us not be without spiritual emotions Godward!<a name=16:9></a> Let us not be without true holy emotions as we dwell on the magnitude of the truth!<a name=16:10></a> The apostle here seems to be moved; he says, "At midday, on the way, I saw, O king, a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven round about me".<a name=16:11></a> His heart was affected as he goes on to speak of the light and what it was.<a name=16:12></a> Things seemed to have become enhanced in his soul.<a name=16:13></a> May God grant that the truth may thus affect us, for, as you will notice, he speaks here of the light in stronger terms than it is spoken of in the earlier record.<a name=16:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, passing on to the Lord's commission, He says, "I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister".<a name=16:15></a> To Ananias He had said that He would show Saul how much he must suffer for Him, but He does not say that to Saul himself, but "To make thee a minister [that is, an 'official servant'] and a witness".<a name=16:16></a> In chapter 9:6 he is told to "arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do".<a name=16:17></a> I want to dwell for a

		moment on that, so that we might have before us the exact position.<a name=17:1></a> He is appointed a minister and he magnified his office; it was not that the office magnified him.<a name=17:2></a> If any one has any little bit to do for the Lord now, the thing is to magnify it, to magnify the service, so that it be not regarded as a common thing.<a name=17:3></a> We are apt to look at the things of God as common, as ordinary; they are not ordinary.<a name=17:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Paul is a minister, and what I want to point out is that his ministry consisted of two parts; in fact there are two ministries, and they are definitely distinct, and this is indicated here, I believe, in what the Lord says, "both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee", including, I apprehend, the truth of the gospel and the great truth of the mystery.<a name=17:5></a> I would remark here that the ministry of the gospel (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:13">Colossians  1:13</a>) had reference to the bringing in of what God is in Christ to men; so he says, which "was preached to every creature which is under heaven"; a statement which shows that the whole creation was in view in the gospel testimony.<a name=17:6></a> Then he goes on to speak of the mystery, I am referring to <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:24">Colossians  1:24</a> - 27, and to say that he was a minister of it.<a name=17:7></a> The line he took in that service was not bringing God to men, but bringing <i>men to God</i>; hence he speaks of the mystery as "Christ in you [Gentiles], the hope of glory, whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect <i>in Christ Jesus</i>".<a name=17:8></a> What a marvellous conception Paul had of the bearing of his ministry; it was "to present every man perfect in Christ".<a name=17:9></a> It is not that I would seek to occupy you merely with the facts relating to Paul, but that we might see what it is to be in "his company", so to speak, to be thoroughly acquainted with his doctrine and the manner of his service, for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would commend that to all who seek to serve, for the service is to go on.<a name=18:2></a> God has brought about changes in the world to a degree undreamt of by us perhaps, and yet the Scriptures indicate it.<a name=18:3></a> He has done it, and it is not in relation to a testimony to come, for He is acting in relation to the testimony that is <i>now</i>.<a name=18:4></a> That is what God is doing.<a name=18:5></a> Let us not be carried too far.<a name=18:6></a> God is acting for us at the present time, and He has moved and brought things to pass; He has weakened the world, in order that His people might come out of Babylon and be brought together as in Christ; that is the ministry of the assembly, but the ministry of the gospel stands also.<a name=18:7></a> I am persuaded that God would address Himself to every man today as at the beginning.<a name=18:8></a> These two ministries remain in the blessed light they afford us, and it is for every one who ministers to know how ministry was carried on at the beginning.<a name=18:9></a> On the one hand there is to be the communication of light, the shedding forth of light, in order that the elect might be brought in, might be saved; and on the other hand, the saints, the assembly, have to be awakened and separated, so as to be in the good of "perfect in Christ Jesus".<a name=18:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, dear brethren, let us think for a moment of perfection.<a name=18:11></a> Let us not drop to the level of the flesh or of mere mentality in looking at the things of God.<a name=18:12></a> The apostle had nothing less than perfection in his mind, and do you think the Lord has anything lower than that in His mind today?<a name=18:13></a> What I would say is that Christianity is full measure.<a name=18:14></a> Take the way John presents the truth of the Holy Spirit; he says, "God gives not the Spirit by measure", chapter 3:34.<a name=18:15></a> Think of that marvellous statement as

		I would now just appeal to all as regards the company, the Pauline company, as I may call it, or in the language of Scripture, "Paul and his company".<a name=19:15></a> Is there anyone here who has separated from him and his company?<a name=19:16></a> Many, alas!<a name=19:17></a> have done it, and I would repeat that the great point for us to see is that there should be recovery.<a name=19:18></a> The Spirit of Christ is on that line, and so we get, "he that converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins".<a name=19:19></a> (<a href="../bible/James.htm#5:20">James  5:20</a>) A great service that!<a name=19:20></a> And this leads me to remark for a moment on the principle of limitation.<a name=19:21></a> God in His judicial ways deals on that principle; sometimes in mercy and at other times in direct judgment.<a name=19:22></a> The lake of fire is a limiting principle, but it is limitation under wrath; hence there is no escape

		I am not speaking of what is official, but of a principle that should govern us in the house of God.<a name=20:7></a> Those who follow the ways of God will know that He continually acts on this principle, and the saints should be in accord with Him in it.<a name=20:8></a> We may be slow to exercise the loosing principle, as Peter was.<a name=20:9></a> The Lord gave him the keys of the kingdom, saying, "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:18">Matthew  18:18</a>) but he was very slow to use them; but the Lord leads him to it.<a name=20:10></a> The sheet was let down in order to impress Peter with the importance of loosing, because the loosing would involve a wonderful thing, the going up to heaven and coming down from heaven.<a name=20:11></a> It opened up an immense area spiritually.<a name=20:12></a> If I am bound, I am limited in the enjoyment of the truth, but if I am loosed, I am introduced into the full scope of Christianity, and what is that?<a name=20:13></a> It is that which is eternal in character, for Christianity has no limit.<a name=20:14></a> It is like the feast of Pentecost, without any <i>time</i> limitation.<a name=20:15></a>

		This book helps us to see that God was not limited to Israel in Old Testament times, and we see here the way God educates His servants in order that they may be sympathetic with His mind at any moment.<a name=27:1></a> God turns Jonah's self-will to account, and disciplines him, so that in result he goes to Nineveh as having passed through this peculiar experience.<a name=27:2></a> The book shows that he fell short in his sympathies with God, yet ultimately he went to Nineveh as a man who had been through death in figure.<a name=27:3></a>

		The apostle had to tell the Jews that salvation was sent to the Gentiles and they would hear; (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#28:28">Acts  28:28</a>).<a name=27:4></a> It comes to us through the true Jonah, the One who is in entire sympathy with God, who came preaching the glad tidings of peace to those who are near and to those who are far off.<a name=27:5></a> In such an One the gospel testimony has been presented to us.<a name=27:6></a>

		The book gives us the foreshadowing of the gospel coming to the Gentiles through Christ.<a name=27:7></a> It is only a shadow, of course.<a name=27:8></a> Christ was the perfect Preacher.<a name=27:9></a> There are three great preachers in the Old Testament, Solomon, Nebuchadnezzar, and Jonah.<a name=27:10></a> Nebuchadnezzar preached to all his realm after his wonderful experience under the discipline of God.<a name=27:11></a> See <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#4:1">Daniel  4:1</a>.<a name=27:12></a> "Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you".<a name=27:13></a> Then he proceeds to outline what had happened to him and in the last verse says, "those that walk in pride he [God] is able to abase".<a name=27:14></a> It is a wonderful message to send to all the inhabitants of the world by one who had been through things with God.<a name=27:15></a> A preacher <i>is</i> one who

		When we extend the thought to Christ, what a sense we get of what He has gone through, as, after all, He is the anointed Preacher, and the principle that comes out in Solomon is that the preacher is king.<a name=28:5></a> It is not that the king is preacher, but the preacher is king.<a name=28:6></a> Solomon is the outstanding preacher of the Old Testament, he is called such.<a name=28:7></a> One who is king has access to all, has right of way.<a name=28:8></a> The book of Acts shows how the king has acquired right of way.<a name=28:9></a> Satan aimed at the twelve, and in connection with the persecution by Saul, the enemy made a great attempt to blot out the testimony.<a name=28:10></a> But the Lord came in as King, meeting Saul and breaking him down as he went out of Jerusalem accredited by the high priest with authority to imprison all whom he found "of this way", as it says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:2">Acts  9:2</a>.<a name=28:11></a> The Lord came in in authority and subdued Saul, so that instead of his being any longer an opposer, he is employed by the King to preach.<a name=28:12></a> We can reckon on the Lord in heaven making a way for the preaching.<a name=28:13></a> This is seen here in principle in the way God uses the elements, such as the raging of the sea; all is to the end that the preacher may go to Nineveh.<a name=28:14></a>

		It is remarkable that Jonah complains.<a name=29:2></a> We read of another who went down to Joppa, Simon Peter, and who had to be called away in view of preaching to the Gentiles; and we see the same principle that comes out here in the course God took to bring him into sympathy with His own outlook.<a name=29:3></a> It is noticeable that while God uses the Jewish apostles there is not the same sympathy seen in them with the work of God as in Paul.<a name=29:4></a> Things were in Jonah's favour, too.<a name=29:5></a> It is remarkable the sympathy the boatmen had with him.<a name=29:6></a> They tried to row to the shore, but God's power was greater than their oars.<a name=29:7></a> He would see to it that His servant should go back.<a name=29:8></a> It is wonderful that it should pleased God to take up such as Jonah.<a name=29:9></a> He could have sent one of the angels, and the message would have been carried at once, but it must be by Jonah.<a name=29:10></a>

		I suppose in coming to the point of paying his vow Jonah recognised he belonged to Jehovah, and would now yield himself to Jehovah; he would not allow his will to carry him away.<a name=30:10></a> It is like <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:1">Romans  12:1</a>, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable [or intelligent] service".<a name=30:11></a> "Intelligent" would refer to what you have gone through.<a name=30:12></a> Christians do not make vows in detail, but you get the <i>spirit</i> of a vow in Christianity.<a name=30:13></a> The paying of a vow is very important.<a name=30:14></a> It is a question of whose I am.<a name=30:15></a> Am I wholly for God?<a name=30:16></a>

		Then in chapter 5 a man who is a paralytic is brought to the Lord; he needed to be served; he was not exactly irritable, but burdensome.<a name=35:10></a> He was brought to the Lord by sympathetic persons who cared for him.<a name=35:11></a> Luke does not tell us the number of men, it simply says, "men brought in"; but Mark says, that there were four.<a name=35:12></a> It says he was carried on his "little couch", for that is how it should read.<a name=35:13></a> It is a suggestive thought, there was a certain advantage in this man's case in regard to those who had to do with him, the couch was "little"; and the Lord in answering the thoughts and reasonings of His enemies says to the paralytic, "Arise, take up thy little couch and go into thy house".<a name=35:14></a> The Lord did not rebuke the palsy, neither did He stand over

	<div class="paragraph">
		As I remarked, the advantage of the little couch is obvious; he was evidently a little man, his circumstances were little, and of course, that has a spiritual meaning.<a name=36:2></a> It is dangerous to be big; even as unconverted, a great man is at a great disadvantage, and certainly a man should not be bigger or greater after conversion than before.<a name=36:3></a> It is not the Lord's intention that His people should spread out like trees in the world; His thought is rather that His people should be reduced in an external way; certainly if they are being educated to have part in the house of God, it is of all moment that they should accept that littleness is the divine thought; not littleness, surely, in a spiritual way; that is another matter, but littleness in regard of human circumstances; there is a great advantage in it.<a name=36:4></a> Og, king of Bashan, was a big man and had a very large bed (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#3:11">Deuteronomy  3:11</a>); but this man in Luke must have been a little man, for he had a little bed, suggestive of the fact that he was a man of little circumstances and no doubt for that reason, he came in for more sympathy in his soul's needs; for he is a type of condition of soul.<a name=36:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, later in the chapter Levi, who is no doubt the counterpart of the man with the little couch, invited the Lord into his house.<a name=36:6></a> He was evidently a man of riches, a man of means; but being the counterpart of the man with the little couch, he was not big in his own apprehension.<a name=36:7></a> He did not regard his means as adding to him in any wise; they never add to us; on the contrary, the tendency is for them to detract from a person spiritually unless he holds them in regard of Christ, as a steward and a good steward.<a name=36:8></a> Unless he holds them in that light, the tendency would be to detract from him spiritually.<a name=36:9></a> So Levi makes a great entertainment for Christ in

		his house, and the kind of people that the Lord would desire to have, from Luke's point of view, were in the house, "a great crowd of tax gatherers and others".<a name=37:1></a> I am referring to that in a moral way, so that we might see how Luke would lead us on in our education, in order that we might have part in the house of God.<a name=37:2></a> We shall all have part in the Father's house; God will have us there; the Lord has gone to prepare a place there; but I am speaking for the moment of the house in its provisional aspect in relation to the gospel.<a name=37:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am somewhat afraid, dear brethren, that we are forgetting the gospel.<a name=37:4></a> I believe it is the divine thought that an evangelistic spirit should be found with the people of God at the end.<a name=37:5></a> I say that advisedly.<a name=37:6></a> I believe God will bring that about, not only an assembly state in regard of Christ, but an evangelical sympathy in sentiment and feeling.<a name=37:7></a> Luke speaks of the year, "<i>the acceptable year</i>"; mark it is not only what was preached in the year, but that the year itself was preached.<a name=37:8></a> He says, "<i>to preach</i> the acceptable year of the Lord", as if it were glad tidings that there should be a long period of grace called "the acceptable year".<a name=37:9></a> That should be kept in mind; we are near the end of it, but it still remains, and the point is that there should be that spirit of evangelisation until all the elect shall be saved.<a name=37:10></a> I believe God will bring that about, and Luke has it in view.<a name=37:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Levi makes a great entertainment for Christ and then he had the kind of guests in his house that the Lord would appreciate; not his rich neighbours or relatives, those who could repay him, but he gets together the kind of people that the Lord desired; there was a company of publicans and sinners there.<a name=37:12></a> This drew out a certain opposition and criticism, for we read, "But their scribes and Pharisees murmured", but Jesus said, "I came not to call the righteous

		I have mentioned these three incidents of houses that we might have them before us as indicative of the educational line which Luke has before him in his gospel, to prepare householders for the house of God.<a name=38:5></a> Matthew speaks of the householder; he says that a scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, who brings out of his treasure things new and things old; that is Matthew's point of view You can understand how Matthew would bring in the old things, the testimony of Moses and the prophets; the householder must have them in his treasury; the old things are there, not in the sense of cast-off things that are threadbare, but as antiques, things of value.<a name=38:6></a> There are such things in Scripture, and we must be on our guard not to discard the things of the Old Testament.<a name=38:7></a> They are kept in the treasury of every scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven, and he brings them forth as he has opportunity; he delights in the antiques as one might say, but he brings in the new first; the things in the New Testament are brought in and developed, but he does not forget the old: he calls attention to the old things, how they all point to Christ.<a name=38:8></a> There are old things and new things, and they both go together, they belong to the treasures of the scribe who is instructed into the kingdom of heaven.<a name=38:9></a> That indicates Matthew's point of view.<a name=38:10></a> He is concerned about Christ as the Heir of David, and necessarily, all things that come down, as one might say reverently; the things are handed down that belong to the family and should be treasured

		Now there is another feature in chapter 10 as to Mary and the house of Martha, in Bethany.<a name=39:3></a> It says that Martha received the Lord into her house; the Spirit of God says that; she had the house and she had extended hospitality, genuine hospitality.<a name=39:4></a> Now we may be hospitable and yet not teachable.<a name=39:5></a> We have to acquire the habit of being taught of the Lord in our houses.<a name=39:6></a> Hospitality is spoken of in Scripture and valued in Scripture, but teachability is more important than hospitality.<a name=39:7></a> The Lord will teach us, and so it says, "Mary having sat down at the feet of Jesus, was listening to his word".<a name=39:8></a> That is how it should read.<a name=39:9></a> What a character she was!<a name=39:10></a> He was speaking, and whatever He said she listened to it; that is the true disciple; she was truly teachable, simply listening to whatever Christ had to say.<a name=39:11></a> Do you know anything about listening to Him?<a name=39:12></a> He is very varied in what He says.<a name=39:13></a> Whatever He said, Mary listened to it, but Martha did not.<a name=39:14></a> Martha owned the house; she extended hospitality and received Him into the house, and not only so, she served, she did the work; but one thing was needful and that was teachability.<a name=39:15></a> If we are not teachable, subject to Christ, receiving His word, all else will fail; so the Lord puts that right, so far as His word went; He said, "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but there is need of one and Mary has chosen the good part".<a name=39:16></a> He had the house of God in view, and the one thing that He spoke about was essential in the house of God, that is, to listen.<a name=39:17></a> Martha might be hospitable and active in her house, but in the house of God where would she be?<a name=39:18></a> She was not listening, she was occupied with the cares and things of her house.<a name=39:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to chapter 13.<a name=40:4></a> The Lord says to the Jews, "Your house is left unto you".<a name=40:5></a> The word <i>desolate</i> in the authorised version should not be in the passage.<a name=40:6></a> We are now dealing with what had taken place in the house of God.<a name=40:7></a> "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!<a name=40:8></a>" And then He adds, "Behold, your house is left unto you".<a name=40:9></a> Now, dear brethren, how do we stand in relation to our local company?<a name=40:10></a> Is it your company, or is it God's company?<a name=40:11></a> Is it God's house?<a name=40:12></a> If it is yours, if you regard it in that light in any way, if you rule there, and your influence there, your example there, has in view that it is yours in any sense, then you are in danger of it being left to <i>you</i>.<a name=40:13></a> I suppose we might say Christendom sets before us a solemn example of it; what once had the name and the reality of being God's house is left unto them.<a name=40:14></a> They have arrogated it to themselves.<a name=40:15></a> Now <i>God</i> says, It is yours.<a name=40:16></a> God is not there, and it is all out of order if God is not there.<a name=40:17></a> "Behold!<a name=40:18></a> your house is left unto you, and I say unto you that ye shall not see me until it come that ye say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord".<a name=40:19></a> The Lord says a very solemn thing, that they are not to see Him until they shall say, "Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord".<a name=40:20></a> They will have to come back to divine authority,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord proceeds to show how we are to be in the house of God.<a name=41:2></a> He begins by finding, in the house He was invited to, a man who had the dropsy, whatever that may be spiritually.<a name=41:3></a> It was some disease, and shows, that that which might have been helpful to the man, has, through some abnormal formation, rendered him inflated in the house.<a name=41:4></a> This man who might have been helpful to himself and to others is rendered an invalid in the house; but the Lord heals the dropsical man, and that is grace.<a name=41:5></a> We can reckon on the healing of the Lord; and I do not know of anything that is more encouraging, in having to do with the house of God, than this; where one is exposed to disease and will is not at work we can reckon on divine healing, the healing of the Lord.<a name=41:6></a> How could we go on without this?<a name=41:7></a> Where should we be?<a name=41:8></a> But the Lord comes in and touches this brother and that brother, and this sister and that sister; apart from this we could not walk together, but we can reckon on the Lord putting us right and keeping us right.<a name=41:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He goes on to note how certain ones chose the chief rooms.<a name=41:10></a> He says, so to speak, I have healed that man, but here is the certain road to disease.<a name=41:11></a> Should we not be wise and take the road that will save us from it?<a name=41:12></a> The Lord marked those who chose the first places, those who sought a place in the house of God, and, in His own way, while exposing the working of the flesh, He shows the wisdom of taking the lowest place.<a name=41:13></a> He says, You are placing your host at a great disadvantage.<a name=41:14></a> Why should I place my brethren in the position of humbling me?<a name=41:15></a> If they do not, the Lord will; it may take days, or months, or years, but he will do it; for He is over the house of God and nothing escapes His notice.<a name=41:16></a> Then He says, You will have honour in the presence

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He says, If you invite, do not invite your rich neighbours.<a name=42:8></a> That is, you are not to do things for recompense in the house of God.<a name=42:9></a> The world in the very principle of it never does anything except in view of recompense -- a return; this is what marks the flesh.<a name=42:10></a> What the Lord enunciates here is that you are not to have that in mind at all; what you are to have before you is to reflect what God is, and what He has in mind, that is to say, the gates of Zion; "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob".<a name=42:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87:2">Psalm  87:2</a>) He is interested in every one of us.<a name=42:12></a> He loves the gates of Zion; that is really the assembly.<a name=42:13></a> It is the sovereignty of God.<a name=42:14></a> He administers according to His sovereign love and bounty; and so He loveth the cheerful giver, for such a one is in accord with the gates of Zion.<a name=42:15></a> So in making an entertainment you are not to have recompense in mind; you want to satisfy the love of your heart; you do not discriminate against the poor in favour of the rich, as the Corinthians were doing, but you invite those who cannot repay you, you act in love and grace.<a name=42:16></a> To such the Lord says, "Thou shalt be blessed and it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the just".<a name=42:17></a> You will have it then.<a name=42:18></a>

		of God".<a name=43:1></a> The man had taken note of what the Lord said, and he says in effect, I would like to eat bread in the kingdom of God, where things are regulated according to God.<a name=43:2></a> One has seen queues of people (especially on the Continent) waiting for bread and other necessaries to be doled out to them, but that is not like the kingdom of God; the kingdom of God is different from that.<a name=43:3></a> God says, "I will abundantly bless her provision, I will satisfy her poor with bread".<a name=43:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:15">Psalm  132:15</a>) How the heart looks on to the time when this very earth shall be marked by that instead of the scanty provision!<a name=43:5></a> Not that one would say anything against the effort to secure just distribution, one is thankful for it; but I am only contrasting it with the kingdom of God.<a name=43:6></a> I suppose we as Christians can testify to what it would be to eat bread in the kingdom of God, the order of things which God administers, for as in it one feels that one is nourished by God Himself, "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning".<a name=43:7></a> (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:17">James  1:17</a>) He feeds us bountifully; it is all according to divine order.<a name=43:8></a> So the Lord, when feeding the multitude, made them sit down, and then He blessed the bread, then broke it, and they were all abundantly satisfied, and there were twelve baskets over.<a name=43:9></a> I only speak of the kingdom of God as it is put here.<a name=43:10></a>

		Then in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>the Lord opened up the parable of the Supper, which is so well known to many of us here.<a name=43:11></a> He says, "A certain man made a great supper and bade many".<a name=43:12></a> He uses the suggestion of a listener to bring out something that was greater than the kingdom; that is, God's celebration in His house of the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=43:13></a> He shows, in the parable, God's delight in the work of redemption, in the accomplishment of righteousness.<a name=43:14></a> He would have all to have part in it.<a name=43:15></a> He first sends an invitation, and those invited refuse to come.<a name=43:16></a> Then He urges

	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose everyone here can testify to the compelling grace of God in taking us out of the wretchedness in which we were and placing us in His house; not that we are in the house in that wretchedness.<a name=44:6></a> Other scriptures teach us how we are there; indeed, chapter 15 shows us how we are to be there; we are to be there in the best robe.<a name=44:7></a> The best robe is not presented as fitting us for heaven; it is a question of our place here, for the elder brother hears the music and the dancing.<a name=44:8></a> The house must be filled, and it will be filled with those whom God compels into it.<a name=44:9></a> Remember, all the education that went before is in view of the house, all these people who have been compelled to come in are not there without education, God sees to that.<a name=44:10></a> The point of view is grace; how the house will be filled, and how, as filled, it expresses the grace of God during this acceptable time.<a name=44:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now just a word about the robe.<a name=44:12></a> When you come to the returning prodigal you get the word "Bring forth the best robe".<a name=44:13></a> It does not say from where the robe is brought forth; and although the best robe and the shoes and the ring were put on the prodigal, we are not told that he was brought into the house.<a name=44:14></a> In chapter 14 they were compelled to come <i>in</i>, but in chapter 15, the Lord does not say that the prodigal was brought in, the reason being that he himself was part of the house.<a name=44:15></a> In his not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The place that music and dancing have in relation to Christianity and the grace of God is very striking.<a name=45:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>we read: "As well the singers as the dancers say, all my springs are in thee", that is, in Zion.<a name=45:5></a> They do not draw anything at all from the world, they owe nothing to the flesh; they draw everything from that blessed city called Zion.<a name=45:6></a> "All my springs are in thee".<a name=45:7></a> I think in that way we have the constitution of the house.<a name=45:8></a> By the presence of the Holy Spirit, and all that is involved in that presence, we learn the meaning of merriment.<a name=45:9></a> What incomparable holy emotions are felt in the house of God!<a name=45:10></a> Thus we are led on and up to it according to the lines indicated in Luke, and we learn to value those holy emotions, which have touched the spiritual chords of our hearts.<a name=45:11></a> The Holy Spirit produces the music and the dancing in the presence of God, whose delight is in those He has brought there, for they are there all according to Christ.<a name=45:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		What is specially in my mind is the position in which the Lord is seen in this chapter; He is "standing upon the altar".<a name=46:1></a> One could speak of many positions in which the Lord is seen, using the term <i>Lord</i> for the moment as referring to Christ.<a name=46:2></a> He is seen at the right hand of God; He is seen walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks in Revelation; and Isaiah says, "In the year of the death of King Uzziah, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple", (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6:1">Isaiah  6:1</a>).<a name=46:3></a> But here He is standing upon the altar.<a name=46:4></a> The Lord Jesus was upon the altar in another attitude; it touches the believer to connect Him with the altar.<a name=46:5></a> There are several altars spoken of in Scripture; one of the most interesting being in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, where Christ is seen figuratively bound to it.<a name=46:6></a> The ram caught in the thicket by its horns, being offered up, is the complete thought typically of Christ's sacrificial death.<a name=46:7></a>

		What one would remark on is that we should be rich spiritually; God loves to see the wealth that He has enriched us with in Christ worked out in our souls, so that we move about here in a certain spiritual dignity and magnanimity.<a name=95:6></a> God looks for these things; He hates the smallness and niggardliness which belong to the flesh.<a name=95:7></a> As regards Paul, he was "as poor, yet making many rich".<a name=95:8></a> There was a largeness of soul in him, and so he says, "ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:10">2 Corinthians  6:10</a>,12).<a name=95:9></a> The principles of the world had got amongst the Corinthians, and so they had become narrowed in their affections.<a name=95:10></a> Even the philanthropist, so called, of the world is small, he has in view his own greatness; whereas, in Christianity, it is what God is, it is the greatness of God expressed through His people; and so the apostle looked for spiritual expansion amongst the Corinthians.<a name=95:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Through these letters, he labours to bring that about, and in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8">2 Corinthians  8</a>and 9, he deals with this subject of giving, and brings in these words, involving what is so touching in regard to our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=95:12></a> At the end of chapter 8 he speaks about those who carried the bounty of the saints; he says, "whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow-helper concerning you: or our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To go back to the riches with which we are enriched, I would remark on the working out of it in the assembly, and so in chapter 14 of the first epistle, where he speaks of the order of the assembly he brings in these remarks.<a name=96:5></a> "How is it then, brethren?<a name=96:6></a> when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation"?<a name=96:7></a> I call attention to the word <i>hath</i> in the verse; we are supposed to have something, when we come together, according to the riches, or the prosperity, of our souls.<a name=96:8></a> And so the question is raised in my soul, What have I as among the people of God?<a name=96:9></a> One hopes it would be raised in each one of our souls.<a name=96:10></a>

		And so in Leviticus, where you have God dwelling amongst His people, he speaks of offerings.<a name=97:9></a> There were burnt offerings, meat offerings, peace offerings, and in each case the people were supposed to have <i>something</i>, a handful of meal if nothing more.<a name=97:10></a> There was a variety of gifts, so that the rich and the poor could each contribute.<a name=97:11></a> Mutuality is a great thought in Scripture; that is, that each one has part, either in contributing to what we are brought into or receiving of it.<a name=97:12></a> God blesses each of us, the rain comes upon us all, and hence God looks for fruit, even from the very poorest spiritually, so that no one is shut out.<a name=97:13></a> "Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a>).<a name=97:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are <i>grades</i> of spirituality, and Mary was more spiritual than the two disciples; she had more affection.<a name=124:13></a> The angels address her.<a name=124:14></a> They say, "Woman, why weepest thou?<a name=124:15></a>" But now, note what it says in verse 14, "she turned backward".<a name=124:16></a> She heard what they had to say, but turned away from them; she placed the angels, one might say, in their own position, something else was before her, <i>they</i> were not what she sought.<a name=124:17></a> She is not affrighted as in Mark, she is spiritual and acts with intelligence.<a name=124:18></a> She "turned herself back"; it is a spiritual scene, and then she saw Jesus standing; she knew not that it was Jesus, but she saw Him standing; the fact is stated.<a name=124:19></a> Mary's act in turning herself backward, as I understand it, was an act of spiritual instinct,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I just touch on this in connection with the setting of the private declaration of which the Lord speaks.<a name=125:4></a> He makes Himself known to Mary, and then says to her, "Touch me not", and immediately furnishes the reason, "for I have not yet ascended to my Father".<a name=125:5></a> In the garden He places a barrier between Himself and her, and goes on to say, "But go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".<a name=125:6></a> Thus we find Mary constituted, through her spirituality, a messenger in the spiritual area: it is not a question of assembly order, or what comes under the public eye, it is the spiritual area, and so the Lord says, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".<a name=125:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would couple with this for a moment the scene in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, where Luke, having told Theophilus of the Lord's charge to the apostles, adds, "to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days".<a name=125:8></a> We know how the Lord came in and stood in the midst of the disciples, the doors being shut.<a name=125:9></a> He came in amongst them, and the doors did not open.<a name=125:10></a> He did it in order to <i>suggest the spiritual</i>.<a name=125:11></a> Thus He came in and went out among them for forty days, appearing to individuals and to the company, and what for?<a name=125:12></a> To impress them with the great fact that a living and spiritual order of things had been established, and they were to have part in it.<a name=125:13></a> The Father and the Son and the brethren of Christ indicate what had come to pass, the great and blessed relationship opened up and established.<a name=125:14></a>

		Well, this is what I had before me, and I have no hesitation in saying that it is a very great exercise with me that saints should become accustomed to what is special, and the special thing about the assembly is that it is brought into relationship with Christ in heaven as being itself heavenly; all this is obviously spiritual.<a name=126:6></a> Matthew, Mark, and Luke deal with what is more public in recording the facts of the resurrection of Christ, but John is occupied with what is private and spiritual.<a name=126:7></a> It is a family state of things that is contemplated, and the Lord comes in, the doors being shut, and does so in this way, in order to impress His people with the fact that things are to be spiritual.<a name=126:8></a> Man in his natural effort and ability is outside of all this; it requires what is spiritual; so the apostle says, "we have received .<a name=126:9></a>.<a name=126:10></a>.<a name=126:11></a> the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God".<a name=126:12></a> He also says, "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard .<a name=126:13></a>.<a name=126:14></a>.<a name=126:15></a> the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<a name=126:16></a> But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit".<a name=126:17></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a>,10,12) He has given to us His Spirit that we might know these things, hence it is through being under the control of the Spirit that we can participate in a spiritual order of things.<a name=126:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=156:1></a> What came before us in chapters 1 to 7 was the truth in connection with the Spirit, as it applies to the <i>individual</i> believer; the individual is in view in that section of the gospel.<a name=156:2></a> We dwelt on chapter 1 and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, as suggesting the way in which the believer is merged in that which the Spirit forms, as is seen in the epistles.<a name=156:3></a> "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body".<a name=156:4></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>) The general position of chapter 1 is brought in to establish the greatness of Christ; <i>He</i> baptises with the Holy Spirit; while in Acts it is, "<i>ye</i> shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit".<a name=156:5></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:16">Acts  11:16</a>) The <i>fact</i> of baptism is emphasised in the latter scripture, whereas in the former, it is the <i>Person who does it</i>; and the bearing of it is towards the whole universe.<a name=156:6></a> For the moment, however, the baptising takes form in regard to us in the body, so that we lose our individuality, and are merged in the body, the vessel in which Christ is to be expressed.<a name=156:7></a> Then, in chapter 4 we have the Spirit on the divine side as <i>gift</i>, meeting the need of souls; the woman being a representative case, sets forth one who having failed to find satisfaction in the world, finds it in Christ.<a name=156:8></a> We read in chapter 3 that the Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hands, and in chapter 4 what that involves is set forth.<a name=156:9></a> The administration committed to the Son involves the gift of the Spirit as meeting thirst in a human soul, and the setting up of that soul here in independency of everything else.<a name=156:10></a> Living water is given, a fountain within, so that one has resources in oneself, and <i>satisfaction</i> is known; and thus the affections are led outside of the channels of sin into holy channels, complete deliverance being in view, with no limit as to result; "springing up

		into everlasting life".<a name=157:1></a> Then in chapter 7 the Spirit is presented from the side of the believer's <i>reception</i>.<a name=157:2></a> What the believer in Christ <i>receives</i> is spoken of, and the effect on the receiver in public testimony, refreshment working out through his compassions.<a name=157:3></a> The lower affections are in view, "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water"; the thought referred to in this way being the expression of kindness, bowels of compassion and consideration for all men; so that the Holy Spirit in the Christian answers to what God is to all men in the way of consideration.<a name=157:4></a> Briefly, that is what we had before us last night.<a name=157:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=157:9></a> Yes.<a name=157:10></a> Chapters 5 and 6 in that way tend to build up the constitution.<a name=157:11></a> In the former Christ is seen in His power as Son of God, the extensiveness of that power, not merely for the saints, but for <i>all</i>, being set forth.<a name=157:12></a> There is no evidence that the man at the pool was wrought on morally, but he got the great benefit of Christ's power.<a name=157:13></a> Even the wicked dead are brought out of their graves as hearing His voice.<a name=157:14></a> It is a great item of faith in the soul of the believer as having to do with adverse power now, that <i>Christ's</i> power is supreme.<a name=157:15></a> Then in chapter 6 food is provided to sustain the soul in life, and chapter 7, as has been said, supposes a certain receptive state which enables one to come and drink.<a name=157:16></a> The general teaching of the Old Testament in regard to water finds its fulfilment in this way in the believer; a great matter in face of the pretensions of the Jews.<a name=157:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads to the next statement: "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith".<a name=182:10></a> I would, on the one hand, lay stress on that which is born of God, "whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world"; it has to be taken account of in the abstract, alas!<a name=182:11></a> with most of us, but nevertheless it is there.<a name=182:12></a> I look at the saints, and myself amongst them; I am entitled to look at them in the light of the wonderful fact that they are born of God, "begotten of him".<a name=182:13></a> I am entitled to look at them in the light of this truth, that what is begotten of God is, as I might say, unovercomable in this world.<a name=182:14></a> In this light the saints are bound to triumph.<a name=182:15></a> That is one side, but on the other hand there is in the disciples the sad spectacle of men who had the most wonderful

		"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith".<a name=183:3></a> I want to dwell on this.<a name=183:4></a> We accept the Lord Jesus as our Saviour, we recognise the Holy Spirit, and are brought into that which is in <i>itself</i> a victory.<a name=183:5></a> It is called a victory, "our faith", and hence what the Lord proposed on the morning of resurrection was the bringing about in those disciples that had seen His wonderful works a <i>state of faith</i>.<a name=183:6></a> This the Lord accomplished; and not only did He bring about in them a state of faith, but He brought about in them a state of <i>spirituality</i>.<a name=183:7></a> We get an instance of this in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, where Peter, standing up in the midst of the hundred and twenty brethren, describes the fall of Judas, and then goes on to say in effect, the Holy Spirit enjoins that another should be appointed to take his place, and one of the qualifications for the position, the chief qualification, is that the successor must be an <i>assembly man</i>; "of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us .<a name=183:8></a>.<a name=183:9></a>.<a name=183:10></a> .<a name=183:11></a>.<a name=183:12></a>.<a name=183:13></a> must one be ordained".<a name=183:14></a> This was a spiritual statement, and thus we see that the disciples came not only to believe in resurrection, but to see what was befitting to the new order of things that was established.<a name=183:15></a> Peter as spiritual says, as it were, The man who is to be our companion in apostleship must be an assembly man.<a name=183:16></a> I wonder if we are all assembly men in that sense!<a name=183:17></a> Note, it says, "companied

		Now to turn for a moment to the Psalms again, we have in David's psalm of contrition, (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>), a reference to material sacrifices.<a name=198:4></a> He says, "for thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it".<a name=198:5></a> He had the means of doing so; but faith says, "the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise".<a name=198:6></a> He brings in these thoughts in contrast to material or legal sacrifices.<a name=198:7></a> I refer to it because it is well to understand how God takes account of sacrifice.<a name=198:8></a> That is, it is unseemly, and not acceptable to God, to assume to be sacrificing spiritually if one is not right in one's soul.<a name=198:9></a> God says, No, that will not do; that is not what I regard as sacrifice from you; you do not belong practically to a holy priesthood.<a name=198:10></a> If there has been sin or crookedness, if you are out of communion, what I look for in you is a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart.<a name=198:11></a> That is what God looks for under such circumstances, and He calls it a sacrifice.<a name=198:12></a> I think that is what is needed where there has been disregard of divine order, assembly order.<a name=198:13></a> When saints are found in that which is iniquitous, in human organisations, you do not talk about spiritual sacrifices there.<a name=198:14></a> What God looks for is a broken spirit and a broken and contrite heart in regard of that, or anything akin to that.<a name=198:15></a>

		I desire to speak about faith.<a name=202:1></a> I was endeavouring to show last evening at Teignmouth how God, being a Spirit as the Lord tells us, looks for spiritual results.<a name=202:2></a> I would now add that these results necessarily depend on faith, the dispensation being a dispensation of faith.<a name=202:3></a> So the ministry of John, calculated as it is to induce spirituality in the saints, emphasises the need of faith; and he specifies what that faith which he aims at would involve.<a name=202:4></a> For if one has faith one should know and be able to give account of what it is to him, what it involves for him.<a name=202:5></a>

		We are apt to be extremely vague in regard of faith, but John specified what he expected to be the result of what he wrote.<a name=202:6></a> Having written his twenty chapters, the last one being an appendix, he adds, "Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:30">John  20:30</a>,31).<a name=202:7></a> Hence such an one as profits fully by John's book would be able to give an account of his faith, not merely the articles of it.<a name=202:8></a> The necessity for writing out a creed only indicated and confessed that faith had waned.<a name=202:9></a> Faith is not what is written as the articles of a creed; it is what is held as a matter of light in the souls of God's people.<a name=202:10></a> So John says triumphantly in his epistle, "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith"; that is, a system of truth in regard of God and of Christ held in the souls of God's people as a matter of light was the victory.<a name=202:11></a> The necessity for writing a creed only admitted that faith, for those who needed such a creed, had ceased to exist.<a name=202:12></a>

		In speaking of faith, I would remark, just for a moment, on the correspondence between those who have it and the tabernacle in the wilderness, as to their external position in this world; and the correspondence of such with the building of Solomon as to their apprehension of what is before God.<a name=205:4></a> These two things run together in the history of the Christian.<a name=205:5></a> The first letter to the Corinthians presents to us what corresponds to the tabernacle in the wilderness.<a name=205:6></a> There is nothing outwardly imposing in that position; inwardly all is infinitely precious, but externally it is weakness, it is despicableness.<a name=205:7></a> The apostle went to Corinth and he found there Aquila and Priscilla, and he allied himself with them because they were of the same craft, they were tent-makers.<a name=205:8></a> Now what are we to look for to earn the respect and approval of the world if the vessel of the light from God is just a common tent-maker, and if he identifies himself with those of his craft?<a name=205:9></a> He made no effort to avoid the humility of such a path; on the contrary he identified himself with the two that he found there who were of his craft; they were craftsmen, not professional men, as we speak, but ordinary tradesmen.<a name=205:10></a>

		The Holy Spirit in the believer operates on the line of producing complete conformity with all these ordinances, directions, and commandments.<a name=212:3></a> It is indeed the glory of the saints that they conform to these commandments.<a name=212:4></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>that "The heavens declare the glory of God"; but in the incarnation; that is, the Son becoming Man here, we have the glory brought down to earth.<a name=212:5></a> In that psalm the sun in the heavens is likened to a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race; he makes a circuit of the heavens.<a name=212:6></a> Then in verse 7 we get the law of the Lord; this was taken up by Christ as having become Man.<a name=212:7></a> He took it up, delighted in it, magnified it, made it honourable; so that the carrying out of the will of God, which marked the heavens, has now been seen on earth.<a name=212:8></a> The glory shone in every step of Christ, as He moved on in the path of God's will, but that will involved certain limitations here.<a name=212:9></a> The Lord in grace came into them, accepted them, and moved within them, and in so doing He glorified God.<a name=212:10></a> There was entire correspondence between the great and blessed truth that He was the Son of man in heaven, and the fact that He was here in the most humble circumstances.<a name=212:11></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>He is seen sitting "as he was" on the well.<a name=212:12></a> He was weary, and the will of God involved that.<a name=212:13></a> He says in that chapter that it was His meat to do the will of the One who sent Him, and to finish His work, and throughout His whole course the Lord moved in submission to the will of God, and delighted to do it.<a name=212:14></a> There is food in it for us; it is indeed the manna, the mighty's meat: "Man did eat angels' food".<a name=212:15></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:25">Psalm  78:25</a>).<a name=212:16></a> What is that food?<a name=212:17></a> It is Christ here in every circumstance of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in 1 Corinthians we see what corresponds with this in regard to the assembly.<a name=213:3></a> There are certain limitations made obligatory by the will of God, and the spiritual man observes them, they are not irksome to him; they remain in all their authority as the commandments of the Lord, and as a lover of Christ he has them and keeps them.<a name=213:4></a> The Lord manifests Himself to such a one as that, and the Father loves him.<a name=213:5></a> The whole point, as to our position here, is that we are for God's will, whether individually or viewed in relation to the assembly.<a name=213:6></a> The Holy Spirit would ever maintain us in accord with that, and in us He also links us with that which is outside the bounds of time; the second letter to the Corinthians presents the accompaniments of this.<a name=213:7></a> In it, you have such expressions as, "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:18">2 Corinthians  4:18</a>).<a name=213:8></a> One has often remarked, and it is worth repeating, that the feast of Pentecost in Deuteronomy is not bounded by time like other feasts, because it refers to the coming in of the Holy Spirit.<a name=213:9></a> The Spirit recognises all the bounds which are set about us in the time conditions by the Lord's commandments, and the spiritual man recognises and keeps them all, but the Holy Spirit is also the link with what is outside time; He is the link with eternity; and so the apostle says, "If our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens .<a name=213:10></a>.<a name=213:11></a>.<a name=213:12></a> .<a name=213:13></a>.<a name=213:14></a>.<a name=213:15></a> He that has wrought us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to connect these verses in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>for a moment with that.<a name=214:3></a> In 2 Corinthians Paul develops the accompaniments of this outlet from time limitations into eternal blessedness.<a name=214:4></a> Chapter 5 states that "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: and all things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ".<a name=214:5></a> That is wonderful to think of; if any man be in Christ he is not only a new creature, but he is in a new creation, and in that new creation all things are of God.<a name=214:6></a> So in the power of the Spirit one may pass out of time limitations into eternal blessedness.<a name=214:7></a> Hence the apostle says further on, "I know a man in Christ".<a name=214:8></a> He had the experience fourteen years before of being caught up to the third heaven, to paradise, to the place of eternal blessedness.<a name=214:9></a> Think of being caught up to that!<a name=214:10></a> He was let down the wall in a basket at Damascus, and in the next statement he can speak of being caught up to the third heaven.<a name=214:11></a> It was a man in Christ; he was not bound by bodily conditions, for he was quite unconscious whether in the body or out of it.<a name=214:12></a> But he knew something of the place; it was paradise, a place of supreme blessedness.<a name=214:13></a> That is the prospect for the Christian, and the Holy Spirit is in him in order that he may know something of it whilst he still has part in time limitations.<a name=214:14></a>

		The assemblies of which the apostle speaks in this second letter to the Corinthians were in accord with Christ; that is why I read the passage.<a name=244:3></a> Certain needs existed elsewhere, and the saints were moved by the love of Christ to render help.<a name=244:4></a> They sent money by the hands of certain brothers, and the apostle said, If any inquire about these brothers they are "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory"; that shows that the principle of giving which is the outcome of love can be taken account of as the glory of Christ.<a name=244:5></a> The assembly, as set here in His absence, was intended to reflect what He was; and so the apostle said to the Ephesian elders, "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:35">Acts  20:35</a>).<a name=244:6></a> Giving is the reflection of Christ; that is to say, the exercise of love towards one another is the reflection and the glory of Christ.<a name=244:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I want to show at this point how, that in the picture we have in Othniel and Achsah, the intelligence of the assembly at the beginning is foreshadowed.<a name=244:8></a> I apprehend that Achsah is a type of the assembly in her Ephesian aspect.<a name=244:9></a> She comes in in the body of the book of Joshua, as many of you will remember, and the book of Joshua corresponds with the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=244:10></a> It is the book which describes the people entering into and taking possession of their inheritance; and in no case is the interest greater than when Caleb takes possession of his allotment.<a name=244:11></a> The history of Caleb is intensely interesting as representing the intelligent faith that marked the assembly at the beginning.<a name=244:12></a> So he takes Hebron, dislodging the giants, and then he says, "He that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There can be no doubt that Othniel represents the prowess of Christ in the way in which he overcame the world of books, for Kirjath-sepher (city of the book) represents that.<a name=245:2></a> Books have had a great deal to do with the downfall of the assembly; they have a great deal to do today with the corruption of the people of God.<a name=245:3></a> There are good books, for Daniel understood by them, and had divine knowledge by them.<a name=245:4></a> And the New Testament contains books, and John said he supposed that if all that Christ did were written down "even the world itself could not contain the books which should be written".<a name=245:5></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21:25">John  21:25</a>) There is plenty of material for books of a good kind, and we may thank God for every one of them, those that nourish and instruct the saints.<a name=245:6></a> But Othniel took a city which speaks of books of a bad kind, and I have no doubt that there is a strong connection between that incident and the triumph of the gospel in the city of Ephesus.<a name=245:7></a> It was there that books were brought by their owners, not confiscated, but brought by their owners, and burnt.<a name=245:8></a> Evidently the truth had laid hold of their minds and eclipsed, for them at least, the contents of the books.<a name=245:9></a> The books were brought and burnt; they were not sent to second-hand stores; they were not fit to be sold or read by any one.<a name=245:10></a> If a Christian cannot read a book profitably, then no one can read it profitably; let it be burnt.<a name=245:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Othniel undoubtedly foreshadowed the great triumph of God by His apostle in the city of Ephesus, and in that city the assembly came out in its heavenly character.<a name=245:12></a> The assembly in Ephesus represented that which was according to the desires of the Lord.<a name=245:13></a> He unfolded all His mind to the Ephesian saints; as the apostle said, "I have not shunned to declare

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord, at Sychar, spoke about a spring, a fountain.<a name=247:3></a> It is very remarkable that that should be found in John and in none of the other evangelists.<a name=247:4></a> I think it is intended especially for us.<a name=247:5></a> "The water", says the Lord, "that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of water".<a name=247:6></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>) One recognises, in the presence of the Holy Spirit in one's own soul, a continuous spring, "springing up into everlasting life".<a name=247:7></a> In the recognition of that there is continuous freshness, and I would urge upon you and upon myself the necessity of taking account of the Holy Spirit in that relation as the means of maintaining us in freshness for Christ, in freshness of spiritual affections.<a name=247:8></a> One would greatly deprecate in one's ministry, or in one's speaking to God, anything stereotyped.<a name=247:9></a> I recognise spiritual customs, but I would urge the necessity for freshness.<a name=247:10></a>

		As I remarked, there is a continual presentation to us in the Lord's supper of the love of Christ in all its infinite depths towards us, and now He looks for the freshness of affection that can only be the product of the Holy Spirit.<a name=247:11></a> Every true believer has the Spirit and must see to it that the affections that he gives expression to are fresh and vigorous; that the words are truly the expression of genuine response of heart to Christ.<a name=247:12></a> Achsah discerned that that was what was necessary, and so it is remarkable that you have this incident not only in the body of the book of Joshua, but in the beginning of the book of Judges.<a name=247:13></a> Any man of faith afterwards would look back to this remarkable woman, and see the necessity of continual freshness.<a name=247:14></a> You see that things began to wane when the old men died.<a name=247:15></a> "Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua", (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24:31">Joshua  24:31</a>).<a name=247:16></a> However

		To proceed further in regard of the household, it says in the next chapter, verse 18: "As he spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler coming in did homage to him, saying, My daughter has by this died; but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live.<a name=332:10></a> And Jesus rose up and followed him, and his disciples".<a name=332:11></a> And then it says, "When Jesus was come to the house of the ruler, and saw the flute-players and the crowd making a tumult, he said, Withdraw, for the damsel is not dead but sleeps.<a name=332:12></a> And they derided him.<a name=332:13></a> But when the crowd had been put out, he went in and took her hand; and the damsel rose up".<a name=332:14></a> I just want to say a word on that, contrasting it with Peter's house.<a name=332:15></a> It is not the mother-in-law now, it is the daughter, the child.<a name=332:16></a> It is not the fever, but <i>death</i>, and it is a question now of how life is to be brought into this household where death, as you might say, ruled; and what one notices is a most extraordinary thing: they were making <i>a noise</i>.<a name=332:17></a> The "flute-players" are those that incite the imagination of the flesh, and here they make a noise in the presence of death.<a name=332:18></a> It is a test as to our houses, what we allow there.<a name=332:19></a> Evidently this ruler of the synagogue had these conditions in his home.<a name=332:20></a> If you have flute-players, or anything like them in the house, how can you expect the Spirit of God to work?<a name=332:21></a> The man was in earnest about the daughter; but what about the state of the house?<a name=332:22></a>

		I desire to say something, dear brethren, in connection with the <i>times</i>.<a name=336:1></a> God has ordained that the history of creation should be marked by time, and, whilst it existed before the creation of the sun, moon, and stars, it was decreed that these bodies in the heavens should regulate time.<a name=336:2></a> It is said of them that they were to "be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years".<a name=336:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:14">Genesis  1:14</a>).<a name=336:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Spiritually, I apprehend, that time should be regulated by Christ, for it is He who regulates everything, whether it be your tiny life and mine, or the history of the assembly here, or the millennial period: all is necessarily regulated by Christ.<a name=336:5></a> He it is who in the heavens sets the beginning of things and the end.<a name=336:6></a> Indeed He says of Himself that He is the beginning and the end; a statement conveying great light morally, implying that all else goes for nothing save what begins with Christ and ends with Christ.<a name=336:7></a> So in the first of Genesis, in that way we have an indication of consideration on the part of God that time should be regulated by One who had sympathy and care for those who should have part in it.<a name=336:8></a> It was not simply the result of the revolution of heavenly bodies.<a name=336:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will observe that in the verse from which I have quoted in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, there is nothing said about weeks.<a name=336:10></a> The weeks are not determined by these heavenly bodies, although it is true, as I will show, that Christ regulates the weeks also.<a name=336:11></a> The idea of a week is seen in the Sabbath, and the Sabbath is introduced, not as a necessary end of a period governed by any heavenly body, but arising from a divine necessity; that is, rest.<a name=336:12></a> God "rested on the seventh day".<a name=336:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:2">Genesis  2:2</a>).<a name=336:14></a> The week is very interesting, especially in view of the place it holds in Scripture.<a name=336:15></a> Christianity

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that, and much more that I cannot mention now, was intended to produce an impression that should remain, so that Christianity should be a reality in this world, a spiritual institution with the impress of Christ on it; and so He established the principle, or practice, of weekly visitations to His own.<a name=338:12></a> Do you not, therefore, readily perceive how a lover of Christ at the beginning would regard his history, viewed in relation to the assembly, as a weekly one?<a name=338:13></a> I can well understand it.<a name=338:14></a> I can understand Peter or John saying, The Lord came the first day of last week, and He came another first day.<a name=338:15></a> It was not necessary that every visitation should be recorded.<a name=338:16></a> We have the principle established that they were <i>weekly</i>; not that one would limit the Lord, for He is sovereign, but He did establish that precedent.<a name=338:17></a> Hence, dear brethren, the assembly's history, as in time, I apprehend, is in this respect, made up of weeks.<a name=338:18></a>

		Peter sets before us the general principle that what is left of one's time is to be spent here for the will of God, whereas Ephesians speaks of <i>the</i> time, and it is to be taken advantage of so that one does not waste it.<a name=342:1></a> The moments are precious.<a name=342:2></a> There is a moment in which I can do something for Christ; in which I can speak a word for Him; in which I can say something to a thirsty soul.<a name=342:3></a> The Lord Himself said in Spirit, "The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned", (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:4">Isaiah  50:4</a>).<a name=342:4></a> "That I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary".<a name=342:5></a> We have here a touching indication of the manner and object of the Lord's gracious and lowly service in this world.<a name=342:6></a> Let me say here, dear brethren, that though there is very great inactivity amongst the people of God, the activity that marks us, as compared with the light and privileges we enjoy, is very meagre.<a name=342:7></a> Say unto Zion, "Let not thine hands be slack".<a name=342:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#3:16">Zephaniah  3:16</a>).<a name=342:9></a> It is not that I would make you legal, but I do urge this on myself and on you, that the time is to be redeemed; it is short; there is much need, and hence much work to be done.<a name=342:10></a> In writing to the Corinthians the apostle says, "the time is short"; not the life of any of the Corinthian saints, but the period of testimony is short, and he says, "that both they that have wives be as though they had none", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:29">1 Corinthians  7:29</a> - 31).<a name=342:11></a> That is, you hold things lightly here.<a name=342:12></a> Your one aim is the furtherance of the Lord's interests in this world.<a name=342:13></a> His testimony is to be constantly before you.<a name=342:14></a> "The time is short".<a name=342:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I dwell on this thought of understanding, and in order to make it clear I would refer to Daniel.<a name=343:7></a> Daniel, in chapter 9: 2, tells us that he "understood by the books".<a name=343:8></a> Now I do not urge you to read everything, but it is important to <i>read</i>.<a name=343:9></a> We read of Ezra as "a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given", (<a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#7:6">Ezra  7:6</a>).<a name=343:10></a> I would be disposed to read anything that Ezra wrote.<a name=343:11></a> I am not saying that Daniel acquired his knowledge by such literature (he speaks of <i>the</i> books, the Scriptures) as may have been written to meet the local need of the saints, but I have no doubt that Daniel would gladly read any helpful production, and if you cannot <i>hear</i> a man whom God has qualified to minister, then do not despise what he may <i>write</i>, for God uses scribes.<a name=343:12></a> There was a scribe in David's regime; there was a chronicler also.<a name=343:13></a> The scribe or secretary, was a man who would write down at the king's mouth what the king might wish to communicate.<a name=343:14></a> Such a man is of great importance, especially in a day like the present, when the saints are so widely scattered, and many isolated.<a name=343:15></a> The preacher

		The Holy Spirit has given much for the people of God and it is for us to get the benefit of what is available.<a name=344:3></a> So it says, "The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd".<a name=344:4></a> (verse 11).<a name=344:5></a> There are words of wisdom, words of truth, carefully set down as food for the saints.<a name=344:6></a> Well now, Daniel said he understood by books, and by these books he gathered that there were certain time limitations, seventy years, and then there should be a return of the captivity.<a name=344:7></a> We gather the mind of God in this way from reading.<a name=344:8></a> Daniel understood by books that there should be a return of the captivity after seventy years, and so he <i>prays</i>.<a name=344:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been speaking about reading.<a name=344:10></a> Now I would urge prayer; so let us turn, for a moment, to the book of Daniel.<a name=344:11></a> It says, "In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; In the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem".<a name=344:12></a> Thus he acquired an "understanding of the times".<a name=344:13></a> And now he says, "I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: And <i>I</i> prayed", (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#9:1">Daniel  9:1</a> - 4).<a name=344:14></a> How much do we pray, dear brethren?<a name=344:15></a> I have been speaking about reading, but I ask, How much do we pray, and how far do we travel in our prayers?<a name=344:16></a> The more you are with God the wider shall become the area covered by your prayers, until the whole household of faith is embraced, and indeed "all men".<a name=344:17></a> Do not be satisfied with

		So Daniel set his face to prayer; and then it says, "Whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God; Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation".<a name=345:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#9:20">Daniel  9:20</a>,21).<a name=345:4></a> What a wonderful experience that was!<a name=345:5></a> It was about the time of the evening oblation, and that was what his prayer was.<a name=345:6></a> It was an oblation; it ascended to God.<a name=345:7></a> And so Gabriel speaks to him:

		THE ASSEMBLY IN RELATION TO DIVINE ADMINISTRATION (3)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=371:1></a> We have noted in chapter 13 how the Lord took up the position of sitting when He spoke the parable of the sower, suggestive, I think, of the deliberation with which the testimony was rendered at the beginning; then in chapter 14 how He carried on His administration.<a name=371:2></a> Chapter 13 brings in the multitude, and in that connection we referred to the Song of Solomon, in which it is said, "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon", (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#8:11">Song of Songs  8:11</a>) signifying "master of a multitude".<a name=371:3></a> Chapters 14, 15 and 16 show how He regulates the multitude, with a view to the saints being here in the assembly.<a name=371:4></a> It was pointed out that the administration in chapter 14 stands connected with the ministry of the apostles, the number <i>twelve</i> appearing there, and that the administration in chapter 15 is rather connected with the Holy Spirit, so we get <i>seven</i> full baskets of fragments.<a name=371:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=371:6></a>McB.<a name=371:7></a> I thought what helped us greatly this morning was the importance that you attached to the position of the Lord at the beginning of chapter 13; the quiet spirit of deliberation in regard to the sowing.<a name=371:8></a> Also, I thought we had a great deal of help in regard of the conditions favourable to feeding, getting the multitude into a restful condition.<a name=371:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=371:15></a> We arrive formally and definitely at the assembly here as that which had been in the Lord's mind in all this instruction, He calls it here "my assembly", and in chapter 18 "the assembly".<a name=371:16></a>

		In chapter 18 He assumed that it should be a court of appeal as we speak, one could appeal to it as having authority from Him, but here it is "<i>my</i> assembly".<a name=372:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=372:2></a>G.<a name=372:3></a> This is the first mention of the assembly in the New Testament.<a name=372:4></a> Why does it come out first in the gospel of Matthew, and only there?<a name=372:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=372:6></a> Because Matthew has administration in view in his gospel.<a name=372:7></a> It was pointed out this morning that the Lord being presented by Matthew as Son of David and Son of Abraham had in view that He was to be the great Administrator for God.<a name=372:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=372:9></a>G.<a name=372:10></a> It is remarkable that it is in what we would call a Jewish gospel that the assembly appears first.<a name=372:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=372:12></a> Yes, it is to show that the Jewish system is formally superseded by the assembly.<a name=372:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=372:14></a> What was in your mind in pointing out that He says "my assembly" in this chapter?<a name=372:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=372:16></a> It is that which He will have to the end; it does not break down.<a name=372:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=372:18></a> You mean it is not the public thing here so much as what is His own building, and vital?<a name=372:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=372:20></a> Yes, what is spiritual; <i>He has</i> that.<a name=372:21></a> The addresses to the assemblies in Revelation show that He has not the public thing; it has given way.<a name=372:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=372:23></a>McB.<a name=372:24></a> This would be the answer to His giving thanks to the Father.<a name=372:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=372:26></a> I think so, The Father operated here; He had already revealed certain things to babes, but what these things were is not specified; here the revelation is formally declared.<a name=372:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=372:28></a>H.<a name=372:29></a> Does "my assembly" bring in the thought of what the Father gives Him as a recompense for His loss of Israel, for the joy of His own heart?<a name=372:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=372:31></a> No doubt, if you take up the type of Rebecca, but it is presented here as "my assembly", and "the gates of hell shall not prevail against it"; so that it is from the side of His own work or building.<a name=372:32></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=373:3></a> In order to bring out this.<a name=373:4></a> It was important if He were going to build, that it should be brought out in this way what the Father had done.<a name=373:5></a> He was about to announce the great fact that He was going to build, but He would bring to light first where the foundation was.<a name=373:6></a> The foundation was the Father's work.<a name=373:7></a> The Father had already revealed things to babes, but it does not say what the things were; no doubt they were things that He had already spoken of in His public ministry; but the revelation made to Peter is not exactly what the Lord had spoken of to them.<a name=373:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=373:9></a> So that He takes account of something that is now in Peter's soul.<a name=373:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=373:11></a> That is right, and the putting of this question brought that out.<a name=373:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.M.<a name=373:13></a> Would it be going too far to say that it brought out what the Father had effected.<a name=373:14></a>
	</div>

		J.T.<a name=373:15></a> It would lead to deep searching of heart as to what apprehension each one had of Christ.<a name=373:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=373:19></a> There was much to indicate that He was that, of course, but He was about to bring out what the Father had effected.<a name=373:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.V.<a name=373:21></a> Is "my assembly" in contrast to "the assembly"?<a name=373:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=373:23></a> I think in chapter 18 it stands in contrast to the Jewish Sanhedrim.<a name=373:24></a> Here the Lord never had anything, Messiah was cut off and had nothing; His rights as Son of David and Son of Abraham were not coming to Him for the moment, hence there is this thing that He Himself would build, the foundation of which originated with the Father.<a name=373:25></a> It takes us back to chapter 11, in which He speaks of the Father revealing.<a name=373:26></a> In that chapter He says the Father had

		revealed these things unto babes, but they were there for the wise and prudent, because they referred to all.<a name=374:1></a> But this referred to what the Father would do; it was therefore a wholly new thing, something that the Lord Himself has, His peculiar portion.<a name=374:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=374:3></a>G.<a name=374:4></a> How does verse 18 come in?<a name=374:5></a> He adds, "And I also, I say unto thee".<a name=374:6></a> The Father's work was manifestly there, and then He adds, "I <i>also</i> I say unto thee".<a name=374:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=374:8></a> Is it that the Father laid the foundation, and now the Lord is going to build on the foundation?<a name=374:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=374:10></a> The "also" means something additional to what the Father had done.<a name=374:11></a> The Father had revealed to Peter that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God and now the Lord says, as it were, 'What <i>I</i> say is Thou art Peter'.<a name=374:12></a> It is His own assembly, it is His part.<a name=374:13></a> "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:17">John  5:17</a>) fits in here.<a name=374:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=374:23></a> That which is the result of the revelation; what a believer is in the light and apprehension of the Lord as "the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=374:24></a> One who apprehends Him in that way is not going to turn to man to do anything, nor is he going to rely on what decays, and perishes, and disappears.<a name=374:25></a> He relies on what is living.<a name=374:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.L.<a name=374:27></a> It was Peter's apprehension of Christ as Son of the living God that constituted the foundation on which the structure rested.<a name=374:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=374:29></a> The Christ, the Son of the living God is the foundation or the rock, but it is a subjective idea; Christ as apprehended in the souls of the saints.<a name=374:30></a> Chapter 14:33 testifies to the fact that He

		J.T.<a name=375:4></a> We have to apprehend that <i>in which</i> the foundation is laid, and the foundation itself.<a name=375:5></a> The revelation to Peter laid the foundation, so that it was the Father's doing.<a name=375:6></a> The Lord had already been recognised as the Son of God according to chapter 14, so that it is not what came out in His ministry that is in view, but the revelation of the Father made to Peter's soul.<a name=375:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=376:6></a> The teaching of the previous chapters shows how a believer is led on to be clear of the world.<a name=376:7></a> In this chapter it says of the Lord that "he left them and departed".<a name=376:8></a> Evidently there was a distinct move there, and a break, but the weakness of the disciples, as ever, comes into evidence, they had forgotten something; there were the discrepancies that marked failure, and it led to confusion in their minds as to what He was saying.<a name=376:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=376:13></a> I suppose they themselves were the bread, and it was a question of their being unleavened.<a name=376:14></a> The figure of bread, as we get it in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>, enabled the Lord to speak of what we are so exposed to.<a name=376:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=376:18></a> Leaven is such an insidious thing.<a name=376:19></a> The Lord introducing it here would mean that the saints would always be exposed to that hindrance to entering into the truth of the assembly.<a name=376:20></a> Leaven is a terrible thing, whatever form it may take; it tends to inflation.<a name=376:21></a> Inflation is a sure hindrance to the working out of the truth of the assembly.<a name=376:22></a> Our section in this gospel begins with this; "I am meek and lowly in heart".<a name=376:23></a>

		I am exercised to point out that we have to be regulated in all our relations by the Lord Jesus.<a name=419:1></a> It is a simple thought, but as I hope to show by the Lord's help, a most essential one for us today; for if we are not regulated by the Lord, however well regulated we may regard ourselves, religiously or socially, it will not only be outside His direct influence and to that extent without His law, but we shall also be deprived of the privileges which He has for us as those who obey Him.<a name=419:2></a> He is the Regulator according to divine appointment, not only of the saints, but of everything, just as of old Joseph was set over the Egyptians, and Pharaoh said to him, "according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled".<a name=419:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:40">Genesis  41:40</a>).<a name=419:4></a> Hence, as a type of the Lord Jesus Christ, we see in Joseph the divine thought that all the saints, and indeed all the nations, and Israel as the head of them, as well as angels and all things are to be regulated and ruled by the word of Christ.<a name=419:5></a> This is perfectly clear from the Scriptures, and I want to show you how essential it is for us; for if we do not go beyond the acknowledgment of our allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ in our baptism, we are simply a multitude without order.<a name=419:6></a> The Israelites came up out of Egypt, not indeed as a disorderly mob, but they did not go out according to their tribes; they came out in military rank, "harnessed" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#13:18">Exodus  13:18</a>); that is, by fives, five in a rank thus presenting a military front to the enemy; they were under divine control, but not yet according to their tribes.<a name=419:7></a> I want to show you that the divine thought is that we should be regulated according to our tribes; in other words, that we should take up assembly position in our

		Now when a young Christian begins his course he recognises the lordship of Christ; that is the initial feature of his confession.<a name=420:3></a> In his baptism he confesses that Christ is Lord, but baptism does not set us in our tribes; it does not place us in the fellowship of God's people; that is a later consideration, a further step, but obviously we begin with the acknowledgment, not only in the outward form of baptism, but in our souls, of the lordship of Christ.<a name=420:4></a> The one thing that is indicative of Israel's faith is that they crossed the sea, so that baptism is only effective as it is taken up in faith; it is a dead form otherwise.<a name=420:5></a> We as parents do it for the child, but in order that it may be effective for the child it must be in faith with him, so that he may be said to have crossed the sea.<a name=420:6></a> He never crosses it truly except by faith, so that he begins his Christian career publicly in that way by the acknowledgment of the lordship of Christ.<a name=420:7></a> This is what Romans teaches us: "for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation".<a name=420:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:10">Romans  10:10</a>).<a name=420:9></a> So that he makes a good start in that way, with the heart affected by faith, and the mouth confessing what the heart has yielded to.<a name=420:10></a> Then the apostle goes on to say, "For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself, .<a name=420:11></a>.<a name=420:12></a>.<a name=420:13></a> whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's".<a name=420:14></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:7">Romans  14:7</a>,8).<a name=420:15></a> Let us recognise that.<a name=420:16></a> Then he adds, "for to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living".<a name=420:17></a> (verse 9).<a name=420:18></a> Thus the Lord has an incontestable right to rule over every soul; He has the keys of hades and of death; He can enter hades at any time and announce His right over everyone there.<a name=420:19></a> For the moment His rights are announced by the gospel testimony through redemption, and as it is accepted in the souls of believers the lordship of Christ is

		Now, the people came out of Egypt, and in their song, joining as they did with Moses, as it is said, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord", they say, "The Lord is a man of war".<a name=421:5></a> (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:1">Exodus  15:1</a>, 3).<a name=421:6></a> That is how they apprehended Him; not yet as the Jehovah who would dwell with them, although no doubt they had it in their hearts, but what the song contemplates is the thought of a military Leader, so that they come out victoriously.<a name=421:7></a> They were not led by the way of the Philistines, "lest peradventure", God said, "the people repent when they see war".<a name=421:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#13:17">Exodus  13:17</a>).<a name=421:9></a> Before we fight, we must learn to be subject.<a name=421:10></a>

		Now the book of Numbers is the great regulating book in the Old Testament, and I want just to touch on it for a moment.<a name=421:11></a> In the beginning of the book it is said, "And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation".<a name=421:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1:1">Numbers  1:1</a>).<a name=421:13></a> That was the position of the tabernacle; it was in the wilderness, and God spake out of it, in that position, and the speaking had in view the regulating of the people in regard to their tribes.<a name=421:14></a> The tribes, for faith, henceforth were always in view.<a name=421:15></a> No one who loves the Lord will ever let the assembly out of his mind; the assembly will be always before him; hence you find that where the Lord Jesus is typically seen in Moses as dwelling in the affections of His people, it is said "he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together".<a name=421:16></a> (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:5">Deuteronomy  33:5</a>).<a name=421:17></a> It is as Christ is recognised and held in the affections of His people that they are regulated by Him in assembly relations.<a name=421:18></a> Moses says in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:3">Deuteronomy  33:3</a>, "Yea, he loved the people".<a name=421:19></a> The Lord would have us in assembly relations, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as in those relations, the heads of the people and the tribes assembled will be seen there.<a name=422:1></a> The Lord is seen there; if as yet He is not acknowledged in the world, yet is He acknowledged there in affection.<a name=422:2></a> I believe that is what the king in Jeshurun signifies; Moses was held in the, affections of the people; so you can see the importance of the tribes.<a name=422:3></a> Those who are not walking in the light of the assembly are not holding to Christ.<a name=422:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see throughout the Old Testament, and in the New, that the tribes are always in view <i>for faith</i>.<a name=422:5></a> You get them in Elijah; you remember how he built an altar of twelve stones, recognising the twelve tribes.<a name=422:6></a> In the Psalms too the tribes always come in for affectionate recognition.<a name=422:7></a> Jerusalem is a city compacted together; it was not a city of endless suburbs like modern cities; it was divinely regulated, "whither the tribes go up".<a name=422:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#122:4">Psalm  122:4</a>).<a name=422:9></a> One loves to think of the saints in assembly order as before God; the Psalmist says, that the tribes go up for "a testimony to Israel", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#122">Psalm  122</a>4).<a name=422:10></a> So the apostle Paul speaks of them; he says before Agrippa, "our whole twelve tribes".<a name=422:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:7">Acts  26:7</a>).<a name=422:12></a> What a witness!<a name=422:13></a> No one can explain how that is, only we see that it is on the principle of faith.<a name=422:14></a> So James writes to them too, "To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad", (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:1">James  1:1</a>) for him they were all there; he does not hint at "lost tribes"; Scripture knows no such thought.<a name=422:15></a> We hear people say that the British people are the lost tribes; this is not so.<a name=422:16></a> The scripture has all in view; you do not write to lost people.<a name=422:17></a> I only speak of it in regard to the assembly, my desire being that we might have before us the thought of the entire company, as being under the eye of the Lord, and moreover that if anyone writes today, he writes as having all the saints on earth in view.<a name=422:18></a> Scripture not only speaks of speakers, but also of writers; every scribe is like unto an householder we read.<a name=422:19></a> James writes to the

		twelve tribes, and so if you write it is not only for the few you know, it is for all.<a name=423:1></a> Anything that the Lord gives, He gives for the whole assembly, because His thoughts of the assembly are never narrower than to include every member of it.<a name=423:2></a> The Lord knoweth them that are His, they are not lost in this sense.<a name=423:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to come to the thought of regulation.<a name=423:4></a> In the book of Numbers Jehovah is said to have spoken to Moses out of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and the word was one of regulation.<a name=423:5></a> It is in keeping with Corinthians, which is the word of regulation for the assembly.<a name=423:6></a> The Lord, through the apostle, addresses Himself to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, "with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours".<a name=423:7></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>).<a name=423:8></a> There is only one Lord; wherever there is a company calling on His Name He is their Lord, as He is of all other companies; and then as the apostle proceeds, you discern that one rule or law is to govern all; all are to be regulated by the same principles.<a name=423:9></a> So the apostle says, "Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you".<a name=423:10></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:2">1 Corinthians  11:2</a>).<a name=423:11></a> There were some directions which they kept, and others which they disregarded, but he credited them with those they had kept.<a name=423:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I dwell on the point of regulation because although there is to be no assumption to the position of the assembly in a <i>public</i> way, yet we must cling to first principles, those which were given to the apostle by the Lord to govern the saints.<a name=423:13></a> So it says, "But if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom".<a name=423:14></a> (verse 16).<a name=423:15></a> It is contrary to the assembly to have contention, "It is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and angry woman", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#21:19">Proverbs  21:19</a>.<a name=423:16></a> Contention is foreign to the assembly, so the apostle says, "We have no such custom, neither the assemblies of

	<div class="paragraph">
		God".<a name=424:1></a> Men might meet on Mars' Hill to dispute about matters, but not so in the assembly; it is a place for subjection to one another in the fear of Christ, hence the importance of rule.<a name=424:2></a> So the apostle says to Titus, "For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting" (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#1:5">Titus  1:5</a>); things were to be set in order.<a name=424:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you come to the regulations in Numbers, the principle was that Judah was to have the first place; that cuts straight across nature.<a name=424:4></a> Nature and all its interests and prejudices must be excluded in the ordering of the house of God.<a name=424:5></a> Reuben was the firstborn, but he has not the first place in regard to the ordering of the tribes; Judah had that; not that he was any better exactly, but God would assert His rights.<a name=424:6></a> Judah gets the first place in relation to the tabernacle; and that is a very important principle; we must recognise God's sovereign right.<a name=424:7></a> He does what He will in the armies of heaven; no one lifts up his head against divine ordering.<a name=424:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, another point in regard to that; Reuben is the firstborn of Israel, he represented natural right.<a name=424:9></a> Natural right was wholly refused in the ordering of the tribes, so that Reuben had his own place, and that place was adjacent to the family of the Kohathites; alas!<a name=424:10></a> they influenced each other injuriously, and the result was a party spirit; a servant of the Lord allying himself with those who had a natural right, and so they rebelled against Moses and Aaron.<a name=424:11></a> There was the alliance of natural right and prejudices with those who had the position of being servants of the Lord; but that moral combination led them to become rebels against the authority of Christ in Moses, and the priesthood of Christ in Aaron.<a name=424:12></a> We are so apt to gender party feeling locally; whilst the Lord emphasised in Numbers the principle of local responsibility, yet that very principle involved a danger, that is the danger of local party spirit.<a name=424:13></a>

		If we have large meetings, or a number of large meetings in a locality, we are apt to think that we must be in a leading place.<a name=425:1></a> The leading place is determined by divine regulation and not by numbers.<a name=425:2></a> There were in that combination two hundred and fifty princes, men who had acquired renown.<a name=425:3></a> Renown is right in a spiritual way, for in Numbers the heads of the tribes are said to be men of renown.<a name=425:4></a> Paul was renowned spiritually, but you get men living on their own renown; there you have the danger and the result is party spirit.<a name=425:5></a> The Lord comes in and decides the thing.<a name=425:6></a> "I will make to cease from before me the murmurings of the children of Israel".<a name=425:7></a> (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#17:5">Numbers  17:5</a>).<a name=425:8></a> These men came up to the tent of the tabernacle in their brazen rebellion; they murmured before God.<a name=425:9></a> God says.<a name=425:10></a> I will make a test, and He did it by setting up Aaron's rod to bear fruit in the sanctuary.<a name=425:11></a> The answer to all this rebellion is in life; life only can meet it.<a name=425:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the book of Numbers you have the great principle of regulation; the people are all regulated according to their tribes and set round about the tabernacle, God Himself dwelling there in love in the midst of them; each tribe had a divinely given place round about the tabernacle.<a name=425:13></a> "Shine forth before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#80">Psalm  80</a>).<a name=425:14></a> The position of these three tribes was in immediate proximity to the holiest; God was to shine forth on them.<a name=425:15></a> How important to occupy your place, for you never can tell when God may shine forth on you.<a name=425:16></a> It is His prerogative to shine forth, He shines in the face of Jesus Christ; "Wake up thou that sleepest .<a name=425:17></a>.<a name=425:18></a>.<a name=425:19></a> and the Christ shall shine upon thee".<a name=425:20></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:14">Ephesians  5:14</a>).<a name=425:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to come to Zacchaeus; I want to show how the principle of regulation works out in the individual.<a name=425:22></a> Zacchaeus is a remarkable man; he is the type of a believer, but of a believer unregulated.<a name=425:23></a> This is true of many today, alas!<a name=425:24></a> The Lord had passed through

		Jericho, the place of the curse, and here is a man evidently exercised.<a name=426:1></a> He had heard of Jesus, and wanted to see Him, "who he was"; that was the exercise he had.<a name=426:2></a> I wonder if we have that exercise, to see Jesus, <i>who</i> He is.<a name=426:3></a> You remember how the Lord had put that question to the disciples, but He did not ask it of Zacchaeus; that was not the point then; Zacchaeus had not had the opportunity to know as the disciples had had.<a name=426:4></a> Zacchaeus runs ahead; "he ran before" it says, and climbed up into a tree, but he thereby placed himself in a very awkward position spiritually, as we are all liable to do, with the very best intentions, unless we are regulated by the word of Christ.<a name=426:5></a> He was one of those men who go before the Lord; never do that!<a name=426:6></a> You may be puzzled to know what to do, you may have the best intentions but do not ever run on before.<a name=426:7></a> A man who goes before the Lord may be called an extremist; extremists are never in the mind of the Lord, hence the importance of waiting for definite regulation by the word of Christ.<a name=426:8></a> He will come and regulate you if there is any uncertainty.<a name=426:9></a>

		In the previous incident in chapter 18:39, before the Lord had passed through Jericho, there were certain "which went before", and they would have silenced Bartimaeus, they would have hindered him from coming to the Lord, and that was a very serious matter, but the Lord asserts His rights and stood and <i>commanded</i> him to be brought.<a name=426:10></a> So Zacchaeus had run before the Lord, and he found himself, as I have said, in a peculiar position spiritually.<a name=426:11></a> Suppose the Lord were here today, how many people who profess to own Him would He have to look up to according to man's order?<a name=426:12></a> A great many, I fear; if I am in a position in which He would have to look up to me, or even in which one of His people would have to look up to me, it is a position to be given up.<a name=426:13></a> I very much prefer to be on a level with

	<div class="paragraph">
		So Jesus says, "Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house".<a name=427:8></a> He encourages him to come down, because He says, I am going to abide at thy house.<a name=427:9></a> Is it not worth while to come down so as to have the Lord?<a name=427:10></a> If you have never tasted what it means to have Christ in your own house, then, as one who in a measure has tasted it, I would encourage you to listen to His word.<a name=427:11></a> He would be near to you so that you might see Him in His beauty.<a name=427:12></a> The house of Zacchaeus was no doubt a well-furnished house, quite in keeping with his means, but the Lord did not say a word about Zacchaeus's riches; He had spoken to another man about his riches, for riches were hindering him, but obviously that was not the case with Zacchaeus.<a name=427:13></a> He loved the Lord, and the Lord knew it, but He says, Zacchaeus, you must be regulated by My word, and in order that you should have Me it must be so.<a name=427:14></a> I would urge you, to be obedient to His word, not only to His commands, but to His word.<a name=427:15></a> What the Lord said to Zacchaeus was an appeal coupled with a promise: "For today I must abide at thy house".<a name=427:16></a>

		Well, I need not dwell further on that point; I turn now to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, to say a word as to verse 47.<a name=428:7></a> The Lord comes in in grace to your house that you may see Him in His beauty, but I draw attention to a beautiful and forcible expression, in the Psalms, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord .<a name=428:8></a>.<a name=428:9></a>.<a name=428:10></a> to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple".<a name=428:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27:4">Psalm  27:4</a>).<a name=428:12></a> It is not now that the Lord might be in my house, but that I might dwell in His.<a name=428:13></a> You remember how beautifully David distinguishes; he says, "I dwell in a house of cedar", (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:2">2 Samuel  7:2</a>) but he did not invite the Lord into that, but he went and sat in the Lord's house.<a name=428:14></a> Have you ever done that?<a name=428:15></a> As he sits, inquiring of the Lord, the word comes.<a name=428:16></a> I cannot enlarge on that now, but you can understand it.<a name=428:17></a> David was willing to forego his own house, to dwell in the Lord's house all the days of his life, and in that house he would see the beauty of the Lord.<a name=428:18></a> So, in Acts, we have described what the effect of Peter's preaching was; three thousand were converted, and it says all that believed had all things common, "and they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers"; then it says, "and the Lord added daily those that were to be saved".<a name=428:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=430:1></a> One has had in one's mind the order and energy that marked the service of the apostle Paul, a service to which he was called and for which he was separated at Antioch, and I thought the passages read would suggest this for our consideration.<a name=430:2></a> The narrative records facts without commenting on them, but it is interesting to note the manner and methods of the saints at the beginning, and the remarkable link of sympathy seen in Barnabas which found expression in his bringing Saul to Antioch.<a name=430:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards chapter 12 I thought the facts recorded there, interesting as they are, and denoting beautiful piety in the saints, show a certain decline.<a name=430:4></a> The fact is stated that there was unceasing prayer made for Peter, and while many were gathered together praying in Mary's house at the time of his release, yet when he came to the door, those present could not believe that it was he.<a name=430:5></a> I think their surprise at the fulness of the answer to their prayers perhaps evidences a certain decline, though outwardly things continued as they should.<a name=430:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In addition to this, one might remark, with no disrespect to Peter, that he was asleep; and while in one way this betokens faith, yet if one compare the scene with that described in chapter 16 there is evident contrast.<a name=430:7></a> In the latter case, spiritual energy is most marked; Paul and Silas in prison prayed and sang praises unto God; they did not sleep.<a name=430:8></a> I only mention this as giving an outline of what was in my mind.<a name=430:9></a> If one thinks of the economy set up under the twelve, one sees the marked difference between that and what was set up by Paul; praise and worship are secured for God in a peculiar way

		There is a great spiritual system that no effort of the enemy can touch; it subsists in Christ, the great Priest.<a name=444:3></a> The disciples had a view of Him as He lifted up His hands and was carried into heaven, they had a view of Him going in, and He remains there, and is supporting the whole system that He unfolded in His ministry.<a name=444:4></a> But now they are left on earth, that is how Luke's gospel ends.<a name=444:5></a> The disciples, it says, "returned to Jerusalem with great joy: and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:52">Luke  24:52</a>,53).<a name=444:6></a>

		Esther, as raised to the throne and as standing in relation to the king in affection for he loved her, might set forth the power that flows from that position and relationship as seen in Ephesians, a power that can spiritually influence things for the preservation and protection of the saints in a scene where the enemy is ever at work to crush them and to overthrow the testimony.<a name=460:4></a> The privilege side of Ephesians would not be in view, but rather the position the saints are set in and how that can be turned to account for the deliverance of God's people and the furtherance of His thoughts on earth.<a name=460:5></a> Esther puts everything at stake, using her queenly position that she may rise to the privilege it afforded her of standing by and preserving the testimony in an evil day, making everything subservient, so to speak, to what she is as a sister, prepared, if her brethren perish, to perish with them.<a name=460:6></a>

		THE ADVANCE OF THE TESTIMONY AND PETER'S RELATION THERETO

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:23">Acts  9:23</a> - 43
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well known to those familiar with the early part of the Acts that while the record of Peter's service practically ceases at the end of chapter 5, the thread of it is resumed in chapter 9, and what I have in mind is to show, by the Lord's help, the result of this new service, or new exercise of apostolic power.<a name=493:1></a> The early chapters, as we all know, are full of Peter's service; indeed, so prominent was he and so effective, that even his shadow was looked to and reckoned upon for relief; and yet notwithstanding that, and the great effectiveness of his service there is a break, chapter 6 introducing a development among the saints of a certain sectional feeling.<a name=493:2></a> The Hellenist believers murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.<a name=493:3></a> Notice it was <i>their</i> widows, those in the Greek provinces.<a name=493:4></a> If they had complained about the neglect of widows <i>in general</i>, it would have been a different matter, though, indeed, it is serious to complain at all in regard to the things of God; any complaint must be established on a solid foundation to be justifiable at all.<a name=493:5></a> I think the word "murmuring" is used for the first time in Scripture in this chapter in relation to Christians, and it certainly is a sinister feature in the things of God.<a name=493:6></a> Now, the Hebrew widows were of just as much interest to Christ as the Hellenist widows, both were equally precious as believers to Christ; <i>He</i> has no sectional feeling at all.<a name=493:7></a> You will recall how John in alluding to John the baptist in his gospel says.<a name=493:8></a> "He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.<a name=493:9></a> That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world"; (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:8">John  1:8</a>,9) or, as it should read, "which

		coming into the world lightens <i>every man</i>", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:8">John  1:8</a>,9.<a name=494:1></a> That is what Christ is; He is concerned about <i>all</i>.<a name=494:2></a> And so the house of God, being a general thought, and embracing all the saints, is cared for by Christ, watched over by Him; and He has, as I said, no preferences of any kind as regards persons, nations or cities.<a name=494:3></a> Hence the development recorded in chapter 6 is a very sinister one, for the element of murmuring is introduced as the result of divisional discrimination.<a name=494:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I mention this at the outset as giving rise to the new movement on the part of the Lord, for if the enemy moves, taking advantage of a low state among the people of God, the Lord will also move and His movement will more than outwit and withstand that of the enemy.<a name=494:5></a> So here we have a completely new departure.<a name=494:6></a> The apostles meet the complaint raised by suggesting to the brethren that seven men be appointed to take up the matter.<a name=494:7></a> We have other business to do, they virtually say, than serve tables, our business is to minister the word and pray.<a name=494:8></a> Most worthy work, surely!<a name=494:9></a> But they were circumscribing their activities, for widows and needy ones <i>have</i> to be attended to; we cannot evade that.<a name=494:10></a> The need of the saints, whether spiritual or otherwise, is of paramount importance.<a name=494:11></a> Indeed, there must be <i>no</i> need; as Paul says, things are to be "on the principle of equality"; there is to be a levelling up, as one might say, so that need may be met.<a name=494:12></a> Even the apostle Paul himself was ready to carry the saints' bounty to Jerusalem, in order that all that was necessary might be supplied.<a name=494:13></a> So here the twelve, realising that there was sectional feeling working amongst the saints, said, "Look ye out among <i>you</i> seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business".<a name=494:14></a> That was very wise.<a name=494:15></a> The saints were put on themselves, so to speak, they were to select

		seven men <i>from themselves</i>, and what is to be noted is that the Hellenists got the advantage, showing that the Spirit of Christ was, as yet, dominant among the saints.<a name=495:1></a> We may thank God for that.<a name=495:2></a> The Hebrews did not arrogate anything to themselves, they did not supply all the persons; the deacons, judging by their names, were mostly Hellenists.<a name=495:3></a> So we see the Lord triumphs here, as He will in relation to anything that arises as the product of a low state among the people of God.<a name=495:4></a> The wrong feeling referred to appears to have been met; right men came forward to deal with the matter, and among them Stephen, a man, the word tells us, "full of faith and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=495:5></a> We may well accept in a humble spirit things that are humbling among the people of God, sensible that the Lord triumphs, as He does here, taking occasion by the very complaint to introduce a man like Stephen.<a name=495:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So now the work develops under two of the deacons, Stephen and Philip.<a name=495:7></a> The former was found with a face like that of an angel.<a name=495:8></a> What a face was his!<a name=495:9></a> First, we are told, the men who disputed with him could not resist the wisdom and spirit with which he spake.<a name=495:10></a> The Lord is pleased to put him forward, and indeed the enemy compelled him to come to the front, for he was attacked, and the very attack brought out the spirit of his Master.<a name=495:11></a> It says that they could not resist his wisdom and spirit, and then it adds, that as he stood in the council, "Looking steadfastly on him (they) saw his face as it had been the face of an angel".<a name=495:12></a> It is a wonderful outcome and triumph from the petty murmuring and national feeling existing among the people of God.<a name=495:13></a> The enemy is defeated, the testimony develops, and is marked by this remarkable address of Stephen recorded in chapter 7, ending with the wonderful reflection of his Master already referred to.<a name=495:14></a> He "kneeled down", the word says.<a name=495:15></a> Think of a man in

		Then in the next chapter we have Philip.<a name=496:2></a> He goes to preach, though without a commission; and the apostles are introduced in verse 14 to link on with Jerusalem the work which the Lord had been carrying on in Samaria apart from them.<a name=496:3></a> They pray and the Holy Spirit is given through the laying on of their hands.<a name=496:4></a> What I wanted to bring out is what we may look for where there is any retirement on the part of those immediately responsible in the house of God.<a name=496:5></a> The Lord proceeds in His own way, for the work must be done.<a name=496:6></a> If we impose limits on the sphere of our activities, the Lord says, as it were, If your sphere is not as great as Mine, I shall go on with Mine.<a name=496:7></a> "Lift up your eyes", He said to the disciples, "and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:35">John  4:35</a>).<a name=496:8></a> The harvest belongs to Christ and if my service does not extend to the whole field, the Lord will bring in others, for the harvest must be attended to and He is Lord of it.<a name=496:9></a> A very great obligation rests on those who have light from the Lord; if <i>He</i> impose limits we must abide by them, but let us not impose limitations for ourselves, let our sphere of responsibility not be any less than the whole house of God.<a name=496:10></a> The word says that the light is set on the candlestick "to give light to all in the house" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:15">Matthew  5:15</a>) -- <i>all</i>, not merely as to those in your locality.<a name=496:11></a> The great thing is to hold yourself as in relation to the whole house.<a name=496:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the effect of the Lord's gracious way.<a name=497:10></a> If we in any way impose limits on our responsibility or on our service, He can get along without us.<a name=497:11></a> We may lay that down as a fundamental principle.<a name=497:12></a> If we are not available He will secure those who are, and probably the most unlikely men, men who "have purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus", as Stephen did.<a name=497:13></a> Note, it says "purchased", It cannot be gainsaid, such a degree is acquired through serious exercises and humiliations.<a name=497:14></a> Then you get such a trophy as Saul brought in by the Lord, one who is subdued and loves Christ.<a name=497:15></a> That is what counts, dear brethren, love for Christ!<a name=497:16></a> Saul loved Christ and so he was able to present Him as the Son of God.<a name=497:17></a>

		May I ask, How much do you rely on others for spiritual life?<a name=498:13></a> Many live, I fear, on what they get at meetings and they have little outside of that.<a name=498:14></a> Now, the Lord has indeed ordained that there should be meetings for the dispensing of food and it is a very great honour to be able to supply food for the saints; that is of the Lord without a doubt.<a name=498:15></a> The faithful and wise servant provides food for the household, in season, but notwithstanding that, each member of the household has to learn to do something for himself.<a name=498:16></a> In saying this I am not turning anyone away from Christ or from leaders He raises up, for He does raise up such, but I believe I am correct in assuming that Peter discerned that the time had come when souls should learn to do

		One is always inclined to make comparisons between the different gospels, and in taking up Matthew, one has in mind that he discredits and disparages religious pretension.<a name=503:1></a> Anyone resting in mere religious practice for his soul's salvation, or hiding behind religion, earthly religion, as a refuge, is exposed in Matthew.<a name=503:2></a> He takes occasion always to dissipate all such claims and pretensions; they are of no value in God's account.<a name=503:3></a> However much they may be worth in the eyes of men, for religion is a great asset in the world, they are of no avail in God's account.<a name=503:4></a>

		What must Jerusalem have represented in those days to a religious mind, as the temple was looked at across the ravine from mount Olivet!<a name=504:1></a> The Lord, sitting on that same mount, says, looking at the buildings, "There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down".<a name=504:2></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:2">Matthew  24:2</a>) Such is the end of mere religion.<a name=504:3></a> If God has refused it, it is without value, and it must go.<a name=504:4></a> So the quicker you get from behind it, seeing its worthlessness, and you surrender to Christ, the sooner will you secure the benefits that are in Christ.<a name=504:5></a> "Ye would not", He says; their will was active.<a name=504:6></a> Although they read in the temple the scriptures that spoke of Him, they would have none of Him.<a name=504:7></a> So Matthew takes that point of view, and instead of the ministry of the Lord beginning at Jerusalem, or ending there, it is in Galilee of the nations.<a name=504:8></a>

		It was a considerable time before Andrew and Peter became fishers of men.<a name=511:1></a> It is a time of work, not that <i>I</i> would put you to work, but I would impress upon you levitical responsibility.<a name=511:2></a> If you go to the Levites' book, the book of Numbers, you will find that every Levite was taken account of for service from a month old.<a name=511:3></a> He could not do anything when he was a month old, but he took up the work when he was ready for it.<a name=511:4></a> So the Lord, who is indeed the great Prince of the Levites, as typified by Eleazar, says, "I will make you fishers of men".<a name=511:5></a> Would to God that we were moved today in regard of men!<a name=511:6></a> They are in dire need, and the Lord would lay it upon us to go after men.<a name=511:7></a> But then we have to be <i>made</i> fishers of men.<a name=511:8></a> Peter might say, I know how to fish.<a name=511:9></a> Yes, but not in the sea of the nations.<a name=511:10></a> The <i>Lord</i> would have to make him a fisher in that.<a name=511:11></a> It is when he announces the gospel on the day of Pentecost that he fishes for men, bringing the truth to their souls, and three thousand are caught in one haul, a wonderful result of the Lord's formation of Peter for this great work.<a name=511:12></a>

		Now you will observe there were two other brethren, James and John, "in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets".<a name=511:13></a> That is what they were doing.<a name=511:14></a> I do not dwell on that, only that I have no doubt it indicates John's line, mending the nets.<a name=511:15></a> What you will observe is that they were not only two brothers acting together, but they were with their father.<a name=511:16></a> The family tie was evidently there, and the Lord calls them.<a name=511:17></a> Now He does not say anything as to what He would make out of John.<a name=511:18></a> It is not that He did not intend to make something out of him, but there are no repetitions in Scripture.<a name=511:19></a> The Scriptures lay down a principle, and it is there, then the Spirit of God goes on to something else.<a name=511:20></a>

		James, and they immediately left the ship and their father.<a name=512:1></a> Perhaps you may say in regard to your case that it would be no great hardship to you to leave your employment and your father.<a name=512:2></a> If you are not content in your employment and in your father's company, you are not subject to the will of God.<a name=512:3></a> What is mentioned here indicates the opposite of that.<a name=512:4></a> They were quite satisfied in their father's service and in their father's company, but they valued the call, and they followed Jesus.<a name=512:5></a> Are you prepared to come just for the call, without anything else added?<a name=512:6></a> John could do that; he valued the Person of Christ, and he followed Jesus.<a name=512:7></a> How important, to be on one hand occupied with the service, and on the other content to be with Christ, to leave all to Him!<a name=512:8></a> So it says they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed Him.<a name=512:9></a> It meant something for them to leave their father and to follow Jesus.<a name=512:10></a>

		Now you will see the great result of Christ's service: there followed Him great multitudes of people.<a name=512:11></a> The Lord sees the necessity of that crowd being regulated; it is a great thing for a young Christian to be regulated by divine principles.<a name=512:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14:25">Luke  14:25</a>,26) He tested the crowd; "He turned, and said unto them, If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother .<a name=512:13></a>.<a name=512:14></a>.<a name=512:15></a> he cannot be my disciple".<a name=512:16></a> Terrible!<a name=512:17></a> But He said that to them, when He saw that they were following Him for some other reason than a spiritual one.<a name=512:18></a> But here, seeing the crowds, He goes up into a mountain, sits there, and teaches His disciples.<a name=512:19></a> It is a question of legislation; so when His disciples came unto Him, He opened His mouth and taught them.<a name=512:20></a> God would not have a crowd here; Christians are set up and regulated by divine principles.<a name=512:21></a> I say to anybody who is not in fellowship, Christian fellowship is regulated by legislation according to divine principles.<a name=512:22></a> When the Lord sees
