		GOVERNMENT IN A DAY OF SMALL THINGS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reading from this prophet I have in mind that he, in company with Haggai, ministered in a day of small things.<a name=1:1></a> The work of God at Jerusalem, the building of the house, had ceased when this prophet, with Haggai, ministered, bringing in the mind of God and stirring up the people to energy, so that the work was resumed.<a name=1:2></a> "The eye of their God was upon .<a name=1:3></a>.<a name=1:4></a>.<a name=1:5></a> the Jews" (<a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#5:5">Ezra  5:5</a>), so that in the face of opposition the work proceeded.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ministries of these two men introduce Zerubbabel and Joshua prominently; that is to say, Christ in type was kept before the minds of the people.<a name=1:7></a> No ministry can be effective save that which keeps Christ prominently before the saints.<a name=1:8></a> These were men, I need not say.<a name=1:9></a> Their offices shall be ultimately filled by Christ -- but as filled by them, under divine appointment, they are employed in these prophets as figures of Christ.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Haggai speaks more about Zerubbabel and he refers to him as governor.<a name=1:11></a> Now it is not a mere incident that he thus refers to Zerubbabel.<a name=1:12></a> He is in a position which Christ was to occupy.<a name=1:13></a> He did not prefigure Him as the Son of David, as we see in Solomon.<a name=1:14></a> As such Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords.<a name=1:15></a> He is universal Ruler.<a name=1:16></a> Zerubbabel represents Him as ruling under certain limitations, but nevertheless ruling.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was a very great difference between the sphere of the rule of David and Solomon and that of Zerubbabel.<a name=1:18></a> They ruled over a vast empire, in which were many millions of subjects.<a name=1:19></a> Zerubbabel ruled over something like fifty thousand, but he was, nevertheless, a governor.<a name=1:20></a> We have to understand that the Lord Jesus is now pleased to be Governor to a few.<a name=1:21></a> "The government shall be upon his

		shoulder" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a>), we are told.<a name=2:1></a> As I said, He will come out of heaven with the name, King of kings and Lord of lords.<a name=2:2></a> He shall then be Emperor, but now He is content, in His grace and His consideration for us, to be Governor to the few.<a name=2:3></a> A "little flock" indeed He called His disciples, His immediate followers.<a name=2:4></a> That little flock extended in Jerusalem to three thousand, to five thousand and again to myriads, as James said, besides those elsewhere, particularly the many among the Gentiles.<a name=2:5></a> But we are in "a day of small things", and the Lord is graciously pleased to be Governor to a few, but, nevertheless, Governor.<a name=2:6></a> We are to understand this, beloved, and that we are to be subject.<a name=2:7></a> For the power by which He will rule over all later is already in His hands, but He is graciously content now with limitations.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Haggai we have encouragement, for the Governor is to be the divine signet by-and-by.<a name=2:9></a> He that is known amongst us in our littleness, in our obscurity and weakness, shall be the divine signet in the future.<a name=2:10></a> Everything shall have to bear His stamp.<a name=2:11></a> And so if we are to be a testimony to that now there has to be subjection to Christ, so that His stamp is upon us.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#4:14">Zechariah  4:14</a> refers to Him, not as a governor, but rather personally.<a name=2:13></a> He introduces a symbol, "the two sons of oil".<a name=2:14></a> This symbol is particularly introduced in connection with a day of small things.<a name=2:15></a> It says, "Who hath despised the day of small things?<a name=2:16></a>" (verse 19).<a name=2:17></a> We are not to despise what the Lord Jesus is identified with, what is marked by the Spirit.<a name=2:18></a> You will always find that where the Holy Spirit is free, Christ is exalted.<a name=2:19></a> So Zechariah introduces the sons of oil, who witness to the divine claims.<a name=2:20></a> They witness in power; they witness in intelligence; they are <i>sons</i> of oil.<a name=2:21></a> Zerubbabel lays the foundation, and having laid the foundation puts on the top-stone saying, "Grace, grace unto it".<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are thus encouraged in a day of small things in view of the end of what has been begun by the Lord Jesus, as He said to Peter, "On this rock I will build my assembly" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>).<a name=3:1></a> There is no other foundation, and those who build on that foundation anything unsuitable shall find it burnt up.<a name=3:2></a> He has laid the foundation and He shall set the top-stone on the structure.<a name=3:3></a> It is Christ Himself, not simply as a governor, but according to what He is personally.<a name=3:4></a> We know Himself by the Spirit.<a name=3:5></a> No one can say, Lord Jesus except by the Spirit.<a name=3:6></a> We may use the <i>words</i>, but in order to use them aright and according to God we must have the Spirit.<a name=3:7></a> So, as I say "Lord Jesus" by the Spirit I have an Object, a Person, who has a place in my affections.<a name=3:8></a> I thus understand that He shall complete things.<a name=3:9></a> He <i>is</i> doing it.<a name=3:10></a> Have we eyes to see this?<a name=3:11></a> He is putting on the top-stone of the structure, and it shall be put on in victory.<a name=3:12></a> He shall bring forth the headstone with shoutings: "Grace, grace unto it".<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The dispensation begins in grace, grace reigns throughout it and grace shall mark the finish.<a name=3:14></a> As John says, "full of grace and truth".<a name=3:15></a> The more room that is given to the Spirit, the more the Person of Christ is seen.<a name=3:16></a> In Zerubbabel, in a day of small things, a note of victory is heard.<a name=3:17></a> He shall lay on the top-stone.<a name=3:18></a> Whatever obstacle may be in our way, before Zerubbabel it shall become a plain.<a name=3:19></a> When the Holy Spirit is free Christ is proclaimed; Christ is dominant and Christ is all, and every obstacle in the way goes down and becomes a plain.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6">Zechariah  6</a>introduces the idea of government, firstly in a <i>providential</i> way, and secondly in a <i>direct</i> way.<a name=3:21></a> These are two thoughts that have to be apprehended in order that we may understand the present situation.<a name=3:22></a> God intends that we shall be intelligent as to everything.<a name=3:23></a> Before the Lord introduces the system in Matthew, He lifts up His heart to God and

		says, "I praise thee, Father, .<a name=4:1></a>.<a name=4:2></a>.<a name=4:3></a> that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.<a name=4:4></a> Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a>).<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord took account of the heavens and the earth, and this chapter furnishes us with light as to how the earth is ruled at the present time.<a name=4:6></a> The prophet sees four chariots -- not simply horses, but chariots.<a name=4:7></a> There are horses attached of course, red horses, black horses, white horses, and grizzled, strong horses.<a name=4:8></a> These chariots issue from between two mountains of brass, meaning that God holds in His hand the means of judgment, and although the powers represented in these chariots do not know Him, yet they do His will.<a name=4:9></a> They are said to be the spirits of the heavens, for heaven never gives up its right over the earth.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever men may say about the 'voice of the people', heaven never gives up its right over the earth.<a name=4:11></a> Even this last power called grizzled, and then bay, or strong, cannot "walk to and fro through the earth" without permission.<a name=4:12></a> They essay to do it.<a name=4:13></a> The great fourth empire, which has its roots in antiquity and extends to our own time, and is about to re-appear in all its ferocity, is nevertheless subject to heaven.<a name=4:14></a> There was a going forth to the south country and then the intent to walk to and fro through the earth, but there could be no walking through the earth without God's permission.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We need to have in our mind the power of God; that He is the sovereign ruler of the heavens and the earth; as the souls under the altar in Revelation say, "How long, O sovereign Ruler, .<a name=4:16></a>.<a name=4:17></a>.<a name=4:18></a> dost thou not judge sand avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth?<a name=4:19></a>" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#6:10">Revelation  6:10</a>).<a name=4:20></a> They understood that He had universal power, and we should understand it too.<a name=4:21></a> So He says, "Go, walk to and fro through the earth".<a name=4:22></a> Hence you have an empire, the like of which has never previously

	<div class="paragraph">
		appeared, extending from the Atlantic to the Euphrates.<a name=5:1></a> Roman roads still existing testify to their means of walking to and fro, but they walked to and fro through the earth by divine permission.<a name=5:2></a> The saints may be assured that nothing can happen without divine permission, and if these strong horses walk to and fro on the earth under God, they maintain order; they have come out from between the two brazen mountains.<a name=5:3></a> They are called "the spirits of the heavens".<a name=5:4></a> They were under divine control and direction.<a name=5:5></a> Our Lord Jesus Christ died under them, saying to Pilate that he could have no power against Him except it were given to him from above.<a name=5:6></a> They were the spirits of the heavens sent out by the Lord of all the earth.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we come to another vision, and this is what I have in mind to dwell on particularly.<a name=5:8></a> The prophet is directed to go to certain ones who had been brought back from the captivity.<a name=5:9></a> They are mentioned by name, as you will observe.<a name=5:10></a> They had come from Babylon.<a name=5:11></a> We have all been recovered; our position is that we have been recovered from Babylon.<a name=5:12></a> The prophet is directed to take "silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest".<a name=5:13></a> I wish to show that this is what is going on at the present time.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not now chariots and horses who are to be in power, but a man, Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, a type of Christ, as I said.<a name=5:15></a> Those who return from the captivity are to give, and the prophet is to take from them; they do not come back empty-handed, nor is anyone who has really been brought back from Babylon brought back empty-handed.<a name=5:16></a> You have come back through exercise if you have come back rightly.<a name=5:17></a> You come back in a spiritual way, with an apprehension of Christ.<a name=5:18></a> Yet come back in the spirit of humility, of littleness, and of subjection.<a name=5:19></a> You do not assert your will.<a name=5:20></a> What you have

		is available and it is to be utilised in making crowns.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this connection a house is mentioned, the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah.<a name=6:2></a> After taking from these men, the prophet was to go the same day into this house.<a name=6:3></a> Having arrived at the thought of a house, I wish to comment for a moment on the relation of our houses to our present position.<a name=6:4></a> As the question has been raised today as to the place sisters have in the service of God, the suggestion of a house enables one to enlarge on this point.<a name=6:5></a> The gospel of Luke prominently introduces women; it introduces them as priests, particularly Elizabeth, Mary and Anna.<a name=6:6></a> If any sisters wish to determine before God what their function is, what their service should be, I cannot advise them better than that they should read the Scriptures from the standpoint of the service and testimony of women as seen there.<a name=6:7></a> Take the gospel of Luke, as I said.<a name=6:8></a> The Lord arrives at Bethany, and a certain woman receives Him into her house.<a name=6:9></a> Is that not a service?<a name=6:10></a> Think of the honour of receiving Christ into your house!<a name=6:11></a> If you are set for that, you would be concerned for your house, for you are to guide it.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And we find that those who witnessed the Lord Jesus go up into heaven in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, returned to Jerusalem, and they go to an upper room, and it says, Peter, James and John were there .<a name=6:13></a>.<a name=6:14></a>.<a name=6:15></a> and certain women.<a name=6:16></a> I think that upper room at Jerusalem was a place of general gathering, and what you observe is that certain women were there, amongst them the Lord's mother.<a name=6:17></a> These women would not be there listlessly.<a name=6:18></a> They would be there with keenest interest.<a name=6:19></a> They would follow all that passed.<a name=6:20></a> They would carry the burden of the testimony on their hearts.<a name=6:21></a> And then Mary the mother of Mark had a prayer meeting in her house.<a name=6:22></a> Then you find a girl, who, as the sequel shows, was in advance of them all.<a name=6:23></a> Her

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to be firm.<a name=7:10></a> If you know a thing is so, stand by it.<a name=7:11></a> Then again, you find a woman like Priscilla.<a name=7:12></a> What an honourable mention she has in Scripture!<a name=7:13></a> In Romans she is mentioned before her husband.<a name=7:14></a> This is not an accident, and what you find is that she and her husband had an assembly in their house.<a name=7:15></a> Do you not think that Priscilla would know what went on in that assembly?<a name=7:16></a> Earlier at Ephesus they had also an assembly in their house.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet is here instructed to go the same day to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah.<a name=7:18></a> There is nothing said about women in that house, but undoubtedly there was a woman or women there.<a name=7:19></a> You see how God connects what is precious spiritually with the house.<a name=7:20></a> The most precious things are found in the houses of the saints, and I need not say again, the woman has to do with the house; it was so in connection with Peter.<a name=7:21></a> The Lord goes into the house and puts his mother-in-law right.<a name=7:22></a> He stands over her.<a name=7:23></a> And may I suggest that much that is wrong amongst us is due to the insubjection of women?<a name=7:24></a> There is a want of authority in the man.<a name=7:25></a> The Lord, it is said, stood over her; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:39">Luke  4:39</a>.<a name=7:26></a> As she would look up to Christ standing over her, she would be impressed with His authority.<a name=7:27></a> He rebuked the fever and it left her.<a name=7:28></a> Need any sister feel at a loss for her service?<a name=7:29></a> Peter's wife's mother did not have far to go.<a name=7:30></a> She arose and served them.<a name=7:31></a> And so again with Lydia, as the Lord opened her heart to attend to the

		things spoken by Paul, she opened her house to Paul and those that were with him.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the prophet was to take gold and silver and enter into the house and make crowns and set them on the head of Joshua.<a name=8:2></a> This is going on now.<a name=8:3></a> Christ is honoured, crowns are being made for Him, as it were.<a name=8:4></a> And then it says, He shall sit on His throne and rule.<a name=8:5></a> What is the value of a throne if the occupant does not rule?<a name=8:6></a> Did He not rule in the house of Peter?<a name=8:7></a> He did.<a name=8:8></a> The fever left the woman at His rebuke.<a name=8:9></a> And then it adds that He sits on His throne as Priest.<a name=8:10></a> Whilst He rules, He rules as a Priest.<a name=8:11></a> There is the tenderest sympathy.<a name=8:12></a> So that whatever happens as the outcome of His rule, you will find the tenderest sympathy flowing in it.<a name=8:13></a> Whatever happens in connection with His rule, you will find it is mitigated by grace.<a name=8:14></a> Then in this state of things you have peace.<a name=8:15></a> "The counsel of peace shall be between them both".<a name=8:16></a> It is a day of small things, but the most precious features of the testimony are to be seen.<a name=8:17></a> Here we have the throne, the rule of Christ on it and the counsel of peace.<a name=8:18></a> How much is the counsel of peace amongst us?<a name=8:19></a> Between Him and God there is the most perfect peace -- the counsel of peace.<a name=8:20></a> This is to be reflected among us, for we are to follow peace together.<a name=8:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Corinthians wrote to Paul about many things, but they did not write about the differences amongst them; these differences were serious, and so the apostle begins with them; "I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:10">1 Corinthians  1:10</a>).<a name=8:22></a> That is what he begins with.<a name=8:23></a> They had said nothing about their divisions to him, but he knew they were there.<a name=8:24></a> It had been told to him by some of the house of Chloe.<a name=8:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak so as to present the word of Christ, a subject that will be interesting to you, for His word must govern; we must come under His authority and move at His direction if we are to profit by the service which the Lord is ready to render us.<a name=30:1></a> I would remark of Luke that he is the most evangelical of all the writers about our Lord's service, for he presents the Lord as serving in <i>the synagogue</i>.<a name=30:2></a> Others do too, but Luke emphasises that the Lord, as led by the Spirit, was driven into the wilderness and tempted by the devil and that He returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee and that He was teaching in their synagogue.<a name=30:3></a> That is to say, Luke disarms all religionists of any prejudice against Christ.<a name=30:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever your choice of a religion may be, the Lord will not at the first raise that question with you, but He is set on your salvation.<a name=30:5></a> And so in view of the Jew being saved, Luke points out that the Lord shows them the greatest consideration at the outset of His service.<a name=30:6></a> Luke tells us that it was His custom to enter into the synagogue -- instead of avoiding it.<a name=30:7></a> Luke tells us how He deported Himself in the synagogue in His own town of Nazareth.<a name=30:8></a> He entered into it as usual and "stood up to read".<a name=30:9></a> There was handed to Him the roll of the prophet Isaiah, and He turned it over and found the scripture and He read it.<a name=30:10></a> I am speaking of His <i>manner</i> in the synagogue and how He would not move against religious prejudice.<a name=30:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is after your soul.<a name=30:12></a> The time will come by-and-by when He will speak to you about your religions associations, but for the moment He wants <i>you</i>.<a name=30:13></a> He has come to seek and to save the lost, wherever they are, whether in the synagogue, or elsewhere, whether

		it be the king on his throne, or the prisoner in his dungeon.<a name=31:1></a> They are all lost and He has come to seek and to save the lost.<a name=31:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it was that He read the scripture to them and sat down.<a name=31:3></a> The Holy Spirit dwells on what He did in that synagogue and He says, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears".<a name=31:4></a> What a moment for those in that synagogue.<a name=31:5></a> There is nothing said of any one being saved on that day.<a name=31:6></a> The facts rather show that the spirit of opposition was aroused, so that they led Him out to the brow of the hill on which their city was built so as to cast Him down headlong, but He went on His way.<a name=31:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He goes into another synagogue; he casts out a demon in it, and then He leaves the synagogue and goes into the house, as if to say, They will let Me do a little more, perchance, in the house.<a name=31:8></a> He enters Simon's house, a wonderful day for Simon.<a name=31:9></a> But there is no evidence that Simon got any blessing through the visit.<a name=31:10></a> His mother-in-law got help, and I have no doubt Simon regarded that as a blessing, but I only wish to call attention to the sphere of the Lord's activities, that now He is moving out from the synagogue into the house.<a name=31:11></a> He is seeking.<a name=31:12></a> If He found you in the synagogue He will save you there, if He finds you in your house He will certainly save you there.<a name=31:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there are two sides to salvation.<a name=31:14></a> Whilst He saves, there has also to be submission to His word.<a name=31:15></a> There is nothing said as to any remark by Simon in the house.<a name=31:16></a> Jesus heals his mother-in-law.<a name=31:17></a> He stood over her.<a name=31:18></a> She will never forget that.<a name=31:19></a> She would be conscious as that glorious Person stood over her that here was One to be listened to; there was power there, and she proved it.<a name=31:20></a> She rose up when the fever had left her and served them.<a name=31:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I am thinking also of Simon, and the Lord's way of following up the lost, and so He goes down by

	<div class="paragraph">
		the seaside.<a name=32:1></a> The synagogue had had its day and the house its opportunity, and now He goes down by the sea and there were two boats there.<a name=32:2></a> He is now following men up in their business relations.<a name=32:3></a> Maybe He will get you there.<a name=32:4></a> You see the Lord is most persistent in seeking he lost.<a name=32:5></a> And He enters into one of the boats with Simon, and He says, "Draw out into the deep water".<a name=32:6></a> He asks them to do it.<a name=32:7></a> It is not a question of His authority, for when you enter into a man's house, or into his business, if you are to help him you must not <i>order</i> him.<a name=32:8></a> It is not the time to order people to do things, but to <i>beg</i> them to do it.<a name=32:9></a> The Lord would descend to that, beloved, in His grace.<a name=32:10></a> He would go any length to reach you, He begged them -- asked them to push the boat out, and He sits down and He teaches the people the word of God.<a name=32:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These were wonderful times; the word of God was being spoken and the Lord sat down, as if He loved it, and He spoke to the people out of the boat, for the Lord knew how to reach them, He knew when to stand and when to sit.<a name=32:12></a> He finished speaking to the people, but He had His eye on Peter, and now when the speaking was finished He <i>directs</i> them.<a name=32:13></a> Notice the word.<a name=32:14></a> It is no longer a request, the time has now come when the Lord asserts His right.<a name=32:15></a> He has got rights.<a name=32:16></a> Had you listened to Him in the boat you would have had to admit that there is a Man with a certain moral right, not only to be heard, but a right to command.<a name=32:17></a> And so He says, "Draw out into the deep water".<a name=32:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show you that Peter's salvation depended upon the recognition of the Lord's word.<a name=32:19></a> It is a critical time, and it may be so in some of your souls at this moment, for God brings a crisis in men's and women's lives when things hang in the balance -- a time of decision.<a name=32:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the Lord says, "Draw out into the deep water .<a name=32:21></a>.<a name=32:22></a>.<a name=32:23></a>

		for a haul".<a name=33:1></a> It was certainly worth the experiment, even from the standpoint of a fisherman, but Peter had no confidence whatever in any results.<a name=33:2></a> He says, "Master, having laboured through the whole night we have taken nothing, but .<a name=33:3></a>.<a name=33:4></a>".<a name=33:5></a> Now I want you to notice that in spite of his unbelief as to the results he was submissive, and that submission was the beginning of his spiritual history.<a name=33:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to pay attention to the Lord's word, whatever He says.<a name=33:7></a> You remember what His mother said to the servants at Cana, "Whatever he may say to you, do".<a name=33:8></a> <i>Whatever</i> He says, whatever you may think of the results, be subject to the Lord.<a name=33:9></a> It is your salvation.<a name=33:10></a> Peter wisely said, though it was contrary to his experience, "But at thy word I will let down the net".<a name=33:11></a> He will do it, and he did it.<a name=33:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see the Lord is in His own sphere in this position.<a name=33:13></a> In the synagogue He was in the religious sphere.<a name=33:14></a> He does not command there.<a name=33:15></a> In Simon's house He was in Simon's sphere, but in the sea He was in what belonged to Him.<a name=33:16></a> The sea is His and He made it.<a name=33:17></a> Think of the rule the Lord had there.<a name=33:18></a> He is now in His own sphere.<a name=33:19></a> If you want salvation, then I present this passage to you, "But at thy word I will let down the net".<a name=33:20></a> You see the Lord says, "Let down your nets".<a name=33:21></a> There is that which you have to do, it is a question of submission.<a name=33:22></a> And the net was full of fishes, so that it broke.<a name=33:23></a> The fish are of small importance, for the Lord was after <i>Peter</i>.<a name=33:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was after more, He had a partnership in His mind too.<a name=33:25></a> Peter was to be a fisher of men.<a name=33:26></a> He was to be taken out of that business relation and act in something greater.<a name=33:27></a> It is the Son of man speaking, beloved friends.<a name=33:28></a> He is the Creator of the sea and the fishes that were in it.<a name=33:29></a> He could command them.<a name=33:30></a> He is no less than Jehovah; He made the fishes great and small.<a name=33:31></a> The light entered into Peter's soul.<a name=33:32></a> How

		many of us have experienced light entering into our souls?<a name=34:1></a> -- those wonderful moments, never to be forgotten!<a name=34:2></a> As Paul said, "God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>).<a name=34:3></a> It shone into Peter's heart.<a name=34:4></a> He fell down -- you see the work is going on.<a name=34:5></a> Millions of people are affected superficially by the light of the gospel, but how many <i>fall down</i>.<a name=34:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saul of Tarsus fell down, struck by the light which shone upon him -- very like his great fellow-apostle, Peter.<a name=34:7></a> They both had beginnings similar in that instincts sense, only Peter fell at Jesus' knees.<a name=34:8></a> What instincts were at work in him, truly spiritual instincts, so that whilst his words convey that he was unfit for the Lord, instinct -- fruit of the Spirit's work -- compelled him, and he fell down at His knees.<a name=34:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say, What about His knees?<a name=34:10></a> In Luke they speak volumes.<a name=34:11></a> Luke presents Christ as a praying Man.<a name=34:12></a> Had He not prayed for Peter?<a name=34:13></a> You may depend that He had.<a name=34:14></a> He says later on, "I have prayed for thee".<a name=34:15></a> Can we doubt for a moment that Peter understood, the Lord had whispered in his ear at some time and said, Peter, I prayed for you, I was after you.<a name=34:16></a> I was in your house, and nothing happened.<a name=34:17></a> I spoke in the boat and nothing happened.<a name=34:18></a> I was after you and I commanded those fishes, I brought them all up so as to get you.<a name=34:19></a> That is what the Lord can do; what things He can do to get one soul!<a name=34:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Maybe I am speaking to somebody who has no affection.<a name=34:21></a> The Lord has been doing a lot of things in your circumstances to get you.<a name=34:22></a> Have you been resisting?<a name=34:23></a> I do not pursue that subject, it is a question of coming under the word of Christ; that is the point I want to make.<a name=34:24></a>
	</div>

		Now I come to Zacchaeus.<a name=34:25></a> Zacchaeus has a story.<a name=34:26></a> He is evidently a converted man.<a name=34:27></a> The Lord had passed through Jericho.<a name=34:28></a> You can think of the Lord -- I can -- as He passed through; what memories were

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was a rich man, we are told, but he was little in stature.<a name=35:8></a> Rich people are not the people that grow great spiritually.<a name=35:9></a> Riches will never help you to grow spiritually though you may be a Christian.<a name=35:10></a> As I say, this man was wealthy.<a name=35:11></a> The Holy Spirit says he was rich, but he was small.<a name=35:12></a> But he was one of those whom the Lord expressly states He had come to seek and to save.<a name=35:13></a> He says He came to save the rich, to seek the rich and the poor, and Zacchaeus wanted to know and see who this was.<a name=35:14></a> He was not content simply with reading about Jesus.<a name=35:15></a> He may have read the Old Testament, and he may have been told who Jesus was, but he could not have seen Him.<a name=35:16></a> Luke makes much of what you see.<a name=35:17></a> Have you seen Jesus, who He is?<a name=35:18></a> You say, He is my Saviour.<a name=35:19></a> Yes, thank God, He is mine, but I see more than that.<a name=35:20></a> I have seen something of who He is.<a name=35:21></a>

		Then you see Zacchaeus took up a position of his own, he went ahead.<a name=35:22></a> He ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree, where everybody could see him, but there can be no doubt he was accustomed to make a show.<a name=35:23></a> He had no compunction about being stared at.<a name=35:24></a> Rich men are prone to that, they like to take the leading place, so that I have no doubt that Zacchaeus was not in the least disconcerted by the crowds looking up at him, and yet I have no doubt he was sincere, for he wanted to look at Jesus.<a name=35:25></a> But

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses sought to see the glory, but he would have died had he done so.<a name=36:3></a> He saw the back parts, and certainly Zacchaeus is not going to be more favoured that he should see it.<a name=36:4></a> If you would see the glory of Christ, and who He is, you must be regulated by the word of the Lord.<a name=36:5></a> Are you?<a name=36:6></a> And so you see He says, "Zacchaeus .<a name=36:7></a>.<a name=36:8></a>.<a name=36:9></a> come down".<a name=36:10></a> The Lord looked up.<a name=36:11></a> I do not think it disturbed him one bit when the Lord looked up.<a name=36:12></a> He would show himself.<a name=36:13></a> But then the Lord says, "Zacchaeus .<a name=36:14></a>.<a name=36:15></a>.<a name=36:16></a> come down".<a name=36:17></a> Think of it.<a name=36:18></a> The Lord knew his name, and He says, "To-day I must remain in thy house".<a name=36:19></a> What grace!<a name=36:20></a> Does he hesitate?<a name=36:21></a> Are you hesitating to get out of that false position you are in?<a name=36:22></a> Do not hesitate, He has got great things for you.<a name=36:23></a> He has got Himself for you.<a name=36:24></a> You shall have Me in your house if you want to see Me.<a name=36:25></a> He says, You can have Me in your house.<a name=36:26></a> Zacchaeus made haste.<a name=36:27></a> Are you going to do it, to allow the word of Christ to regulate you?<a name=36:28></a>

		And now the Lord is in his house.<a name=36:29></a> You bring the Lord into the house and then He is prepared to control you in it and He is going to do great things for you.<a name=36:30></a> Listen to this man speaking.<a name=36:31></a> He says "Lord".<a name=36:32></a> He does not address the crowd.<a name=36:33></a> True enough you have got to hear what they say about you.<a name=36:34></a> Zacchaeus heard them, and so he said, "Lord".<a name=36:35></a> He has got redemption, he is learning to say, Lord.<a name=36:36></a> And what does he say?<a name=36:37></a> He wants to give the Lord an account of his riches.<a name=36:38></a> He was a rich man, and these people had said he was sinful, but he gives the Lord an account of his riches.<a name=36:39></a> Do we all do that, beloved?<a name=36:40></a> We have to reckon with the Lord in regard to what we have got, and so he says, "Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will finish briefly.<a name=37:9></a> I want to show you how the word is appreciated on its own account so that you can speak of it to others.<a name=37:10></a> The centurion is a very remarkable man.<a name=37:11></a> He is one of the finest characters in Luke's gospel, and there are many characters in Luke.<a name=37:12></a> He is a Roman officer.<a name=37:13></a> Different from Zacchaeus, who was a tax-gatherer; different from Simon, who was evidently a fisherman.<a name=37:14></a> Each has his own significance, but now we are in the presence of a Roman officer who is resident officially in the town of Capernaum.<a name=37:15></a> He is on good terms with the Jews, for Luke writes from that point of view.<a name=37:16></a> This Roman officer, who ruled in Judaea, was on the very best terms with the Jews.<a name=37:17></a> He built a synagogue for them, he loved them, and they were ready to come to Christ on his behalf.<a name=37:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so he sends them to the Lord.<a name=37:19></a> He had never met the Lord before, but he had heard of Him.<a name=37:20></a> Evidently he was on the very best of terms with his servant.<a name=37:21></a> He loved his servant, but his servant was ill and he would appeal to the Lord.<a name=37:22></a> He sends to the Lord to come and heal him.<a name=37:23></a> It appears that he had some exercise.<a name=37:24></a> He might say, Now I have sent the Jews, I will wait till He comes, but no, he has some exercise, he sends other servants.<a name=37:25></a> He says, The message I sent Him is not suitable.<a name=37:26></a> How fine that is.<a name=37:27></a> How respectful he is.<a name=37:28></a> He sends servants to the Lord, and says, Lord do not come to my house, for the truth came home to him that this was a great personage.<a name=37:29></a>

		He thought of his own position as having authority, and so he says to himself, Why, if that were so, He does not need to come any more than Caesar would need to come here to have his word carried out, or that I should go down to speak to my soldiers, all I have to do is to send, "I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it".<a name=38:1></a>

		He sends a message to the Lord, a very fine expression of his own humility, befitting surely his position.<a name=38:11></a> He says, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but say the word.<a name=38:12></a> May He say that in regard to some of you; "Say by a word and my servant shall be healed".<a name=38:13></a> And the Lord turned round to those who followed and said, "Not even in Israel have I found so great faith".<a name=38:14></a> And they returned to the house and the servant is healed.<a name=38:15></a> It was a question of the word of Christ.<a name=38:16></a>

		While on the way a blind man had struck a note that was due to His Person, which note was taken up later at Olivet and Bethany, but the reception accorded to Him there in no way indicated an underlying condition of sympathy in the city.<a name=40:7></a> It was far otherwise, for, as I said, Satan had for a long time established opposition there against God, against His anointed, against the truth, and against the saints, that could be found nowhere else, and so what we have to consider is not the power vested in Christ, although it was there, but the perfection of His service in <i>such conditions</i>.<a name=40:8></a> You will understand that in saying these things I have in view that our service is to be carried on under like conditions.<a name=40:9></a> The enemy has succeeded in establishing an opposition, exceeding all that ever preceded it, in those who were nominally subject to Christ, but whose hearts, alas!<a name=40:10></a> were far away, and so eve may with interest take account of His wonderful <i>way</i> during the few days that remained to Him for the completion of the service committed to Him.<a name=40:11></a>

		most inveterate opposition, individual attachment to Christ.<a name=41:1></a> That is the point I would endeavour, with the Lord's help, to dwell upon.<a name=41:2></a> In an apostate state of things what counts particularly is individual attachment to Christ and devotedness to Christ.<a name=41:3></a> It is incumbent on me to befriend Him; He has befriended me, as the apostle says, He "has loved me".<a name=41:4></a> I do not know anything that speaks so loudly to the believer: He "has loved me and given himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=41:5></a> <i>I</i> was in His mind then; that is what the apostle would emphasise in speaking in the past tense.<a name=41:6></a> Wonderful fact!<a name=41:7></a> I was in His heart when He died.<a name=41:8></a> Think of that!<a name=41:9></a> Is <i>He</i> in <i>my</i> heart?<a name=41:10></a> The occasion calls for individual attachment and devotedness (whatever others do) to Christ and His interests.<a name=41:11></a> The apostle indeed had such a sense of the <i>lovableness</i> of Christ (if you will understand the word, for He is, in language well known to us, "Altogether lovely") that he says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:22">1 Corinthians  16:22</a>), as if a non-lover of Christ deserved nothing less.<a name=41:12></a> Such a sense had he of what was due to Christ from the hearts of His people that any one who was a non-lover should be accursed.<a name=41:13></a>

		Now there are in the Old Testament remarkable examples for us.<a name=41:14></a> I speak for the moment of the need of lovers of Christ, and as lovers of Christ of those who devote themselves to His interests whatever others do; not that we shall ever be alone as lovers of Him, but <i>I must</i> love Christ.<a name=41:15></a> We have in Hiram, king of Tyre, one who was "ever a lover of David", but then, of necessity, he was a lover at a distance, for he did not live with David, but the Spirit of God records for us that there was one man, although not related to him, who was ever a lover of David.<a name=41:16></a> He was a lover of David, I apprehend, in the way of admiration; he admired David.<a name=41:17></a> Now one would value such a love as that, but the Lord looks for

		The apostle in writing to the Corinthians plainly intimates that they did not understand him; they assumed he was a prevaricator, and yet he says, "If even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:15">2 Corinthians  12:15</a>).<a name=42:7></a> He was an ardent lover of Christ, notwithstanding he was in reproach, and he was an ardent lover of the Corinthians.<a name=42:8></a> We have to be prepared for that, but love <i>we must</i>.<a name=42:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I take it that Mephibosheth was the least understood man in the whole realm of David; the king himself misunderstood him, and in that David was in no way a type of Christ, for he said to Mephibosheth, "Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?<a name=42:10></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#19:29">2 Samuel  19:29</a>).<a name=42:11></a> <i>What</i> matters?<a name=42:12></a> David was far below his great antitype in that remark.<a name=42:13></a> But Mephibosheth answers, "Let him even take all, since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house" (verse 30).<a name=42:14></a> There was a lover; a lame man, a man of little account to anybody, but there was a treasure in his heart and it is that treasure the Lord values.<a name=42:15></a> It may be seen in one unable to move from a bed or to take up <i>public</i> service, but yet a lover of Christ.<a name=42:16></a>

		And now He goes to the temple.<a name=43:7></a> It is not here the shrine, but the general structure in which God was known and approached, and He looks round.<a name=43:8></a> Now, beloved, let us note this: "He looked round about upon <i>all things</i>".<a name=43:9></a> It is not only all persons but all <i>things</i>.<a name=43:10></a> There is not a thing in Christendom that He does not take account of.<a name=43:11></a> The things are doubtless attached to persons.<a name=43:12></a> Some of the things are of ancient origin.<a name=43:13></a> The lives of persons are comparatively short, but the existence of things may be very long.<a name=43:14></a> There are things that in themselves are positively wicked, but yet men are held by them and venerate them because of their antiquity; they are of the authority of darkness.<a name=43:15></a> Is the Lord indifferent to them?<a name=43:16></a> He beholds them.<a name=43:17></a> He looked round on all things.<a name=43:18></a> From the time of their leaving first love in Ephesus until the establishment of idolatry in Thyatira, the Lord has taken account of everything; not only of the persons who are responsible but of the things.<a name=43:19></a> There were those who taught the doctrine and then there was the doctrine itself; there were the idol sacrifices; there were "the depths of Satan".<a name=43:20></a> All these things come under his eye.<a name=43:21></a> "He looked round on all things".<a name=43:22></a> I would call special attention to this, because there is not a thing, ancient or modern, that is contrary to

	<div class="paragraph">
		On His next visit to the temple the following morning (these visits have a spiritual meaning) He deals in authority with these things and the persons responsible, and hence how serious it is for a believer to be found in the recognition of any of the things with which the Lord is dealing, or will deal with, in His power.<a name=44:8></a> Where shall I be then?<a name=44:9></a> We read here that merchandise and dove sellers were in the temple, and that packages were being brought through, but he "suffered not that any one should carry any package through the temple" (verse 16).<a name=44:10></a>

		Now is there any one of us who is associated with things that are positively contrary to Scripture, contrary to the Spirit and contrary to the truth?<a name=44:11></a> The Lord will effectually deal with all these things, as He says here, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations, but <i>ye</i> have made it a den of robbers".<a name=44:12></a> He is yet dealing with the house (thank God for that); the house exists, but what about the things that are tolerated?<a name=44:13></a> I do urgently appeal to any who are in any way revering or recognising the things God will have to deal with, and is dealing with, in judgment.<a name=44:14></a>

		In the second epistle to the Corinthians the apostle brings forward the truth of the temple.<a name=45:8></a> In the first epistle He spoke of them as God's temple, but in the second epistle he says, "<i>Ye</i> are the living God's temple" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:16">2 Corinthians  6:16</a>).<a name=45:9></a> What does that mean?<a name=45:10></a> It means that God will have a living state of things.<a name=45:11></a> If He is the living God, He will have a living state of things in His temple, as it is written, "I will dwell among them and walk among them".<a name=45:12></a> God dwells, beloved, in a living state of things.<a name=45:13></a> His praise is from those who live, as -Hezekiah says, and He walks in the midst of a living people.<a name=45:14></a> I apprehend that He dwells among us as we are assembled together and made to live of Christ, quickened together with Christ; brought to God in living affection.<a name=45:15></a> "He that abides in love abides in God, and God in him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:16">1 John  4:16</a>).<a name=45:16></a> God finds His joy in a living people.<a name=45:17></a>

		I have selected passages from the book of Job in order, among other things, to call attention to the testimony of God which this book contemplates, namely, that which nature or creation affords, having in view that, while no divinely authenticated records are appealed to, the testimony corresponds strikingly with what we have in the divinely accredited records in our possession, namely, the Holy Scriptures.<a name=58:1></a> Indeed, the witness which creation affords is but an index to the great testimony that has come out in our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=58:2></a> Further, the men contemplated in the book of Job are men such as ourselves, and in the person of Elihu, who, as he says, is made out of clay, we see one who was the expression of the testimony then available.<a name=58:3></a> He tells us of his righteous anger because of the self-vindication which marked the speeches of Job, and of the condemnation that marked the speeches of his three friends, and yet they were unable to convict Job.<a name=58:4></a>

		In speaking to you, friend, one would seek to be in the spiritual animation of Elihu, for one cannot avoid being righteously indignant as one, contemplates the character of the ministry which is abroad at the present time, and which fails to represent the mind of God, and which consequently fails to convict the sinner.<a name=58:5></a> Plenty of condemnation there is indeed, but little or no <i>conviction before God;</i> and the ministry that condemns without convicting the sinner is not a ministry of God.<a name=58:6></a> It is such as stands in the way of the ministry which God designed in the gospel, for the gospel is designed to convey the mind of God in regard to men, and in regard to Christ in such wise as to bring conviction.<a name=58:7></a>

		but conviction, in order that by conviction man may repent and turn to God and be saved, and the absence of the convicting authority of God in the speeches of Job's three friends was what aroused the anger of Elihu.<a name=59:1></a> On the other hand, the folly of Job in endeavouring to justify himself also aroused the anger of Elihu.<a name=59:2></a> It was righteous anger, and, beloved friend, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, one would express such righteous anger, an anger according to God in respect of the character of what pretends to be the ministry of God, but which fails to convict whilst condemning the sinner.<a name=59:3></a>

		On the other hand, if you are one of those who justify themselves rather than God, love, divine love, in the preacher, would be righteously angry, for you are your own greatest enemy.<a name=59:4></a> You are thwarting the overtures of God if you are in any way endeavouring to justify yourself in the presence of God.<a name=59:5></a> God would convict you.<a name=59:6></a> He has brought into this world, beloved friend, in the Person of the Holy Spirit, a convicting power.<a name=59:7></a>

		Well, now, I speak of Elijah for a moment, so that you may see how the man's hand appears there.<a name=75:4></a> Elijah represents the ministry that asserts the rights of God.<a name=75:5></a> That is what Elijah represents.<a name=75:6></a> He appears suddenly in Israel, and he asserts that there shall be no rain except at his word.<a name=75:7></a> He was a man of great authority, and, as the epistle of James tells us, he was a man of prayer.<a name=75:8></a> He represents the Lord Jesus Christ in his great solicitude for the welfare of man, and his ministry results in the recognition by all that "Jehovah, he is God".<a name=75:9></a> It is not now a question of judgment, dear friend.<a name=75:10></a> His assertion of the rights of God at the present time does not mean judgment.<a name=75:11></a> It means salvation.<a name=75:12></a> I thank God constantly that He asserted His sovereign right over me, and so can hundreds of Christians who are living today.<a name=75:13></a> You say: 'What does it mean to assert the rights of God?<a name=75:14></a>' Well, He has a right, as I said, to cast you into perdition, but that is not the assertion of the rights of God at the present time.<a name=75:15></a> God asserts His right over you in commanding you to repent.<a name=75:16></a> He commands all men everywhere to repent.<a name=75:17></a> It is not that He asks you to do so, but commands you to do so.<a name=75:18></a> Are you prepared to recognise His rights?<a name=75:19></a> That command belongs to the rights of God in mercy.<a name=75:20></a> That is a matter of the greatest importance to every sinner.<a name=75:21></a> If God has a right to judge, He has also a right to show mercy, and He does.<a name=75:22></a>

		quarrel with such rights as these?<a name=76:1></a> Think of what it means for us that God should assert His rights, even if He shuts up the heavens for three years and six months, to save you.<a name=76:2></a> As we read, Elijah prayed, and the heavens were shut up for three years and six months.<a name=76:3></a> It was a preparatory measure.<a name=76:4></a> There is not a Christian that would have been a Christian, were it not for the preparatory measures of God.<a name=76:5></a> Think of how He watches us from our very beginnings.<a name=76:6></a> He has ordered things for our blessing.<a name=76:7></a> Each of us has to say, "He hath hedged me about", as He did to Israel.<a name=76:8></a> Why?<a name=76:9></a> That we might turn to Him!<a name=76:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as I said, in the assertion of His rights God shows that He is God.<a name=76:11></a> "Jehovah", it says, "He is God".<a name=76:12></a> How has God come out to us, dear friend?<a name=76:13></a> In the gift of Christ.<a name=76:14></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>).<a name=76:15></a> How majestically He asserts Himself in the gift of His Son, so that we are made to say: "He is God".<a name=76:16></a> Elijah builds an altar, and in doing that He had in His mind everyone of God's people.<a name=76:17></a> The twelve tribes were all in it, but when we come to our altar, when we come to Christ, dear friend, not only did He die for that nation, but that the children of God that were scattered abroad might be gathered into one, yea, more than that; "He gave himself a ransom for ALL" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:6">1 Timothy  2:6</a>).<a name=76:18></a> So that everyone in the human race is in view on the altar on which Christ laid down His life.<a name=76:19></a> "He gave himself a ransom for all".<a name=76:20></a> Can anyone emphasise that too much?<a name=76:21></a> Every member of the race was in view when the Son of man, as it says, the Man Christ Jesus, gave Himself a ransom for all.<a name=76:22></a> It is one of the greatest statements that can be made in the gospel.<a name=76:23></a> Every member of the race, I repeat, was in view in that offering, and it brought out the greatness of God, not only the rights of God in mercy, but the rights of God in love.<a name=76:24></a> He has brought out the righteousness of God, the love of God, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, Elijah brought out, in asserting the rights of God in Israel that: "Jehovah, he is God".<a name=77:3></a> It is part of the gospel to make clear how that God has asserted Himself, and how that He stands out before men as a God that justifies.<a name=77:4></a> He justifies the ungodly.<a name=77:5></a> It is possible to justify the ungodly.<a name=77:6></a> He can do so.<a name=77:7></a> He has been glorified in the offering of Christ.<a name=77:8></a> As we see in type in Elijah's burnt offering, the fire, we are told, came down and consumed the offering and the water.<a name=77:9></a> Heaven accepted the offering.<a name=77:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One feels, in seeking to announce the gospel, how little one knows of it, for I know of nothing greater to present than to present God in His assertion of Himself according to His nature, in the death of Christ.<a name=77:11></a> No one can lift up a voice against Him.<a name=77:12></a> "Jehovah, he is God".<a name=77:13></a> How majestically it stands out in that hour of Israel's apostasy.<a name=77:14></a> God stands out in mercy in the sacrifice, and so Elijah says: "There is a sound of abundance of rain".<a name=77:15></a> Oh!<a name=77:16></a> there is, friend, not a sound of judgment, now, but of abundance of rain.<a name=77:17></a> The prophets of Baal were judged, and it was right, but God shows, in the assertion of Himself, that He means to bless, and so there is a sound of rain.<a name=77:18></a> All of us who have been through a drought understand it a little, but then it had lasted for three years and six months!<a name=77:19></a> Think of what that meant to man.<a name=77:20></a> I do not suppose any one of us has had any such experience as that.<a name=77:21></a> Think of a drought of three years and six months!<a name=77:22></a> The heavens shut up, no rain, and then think of the sound of rain?<a name=77:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh, I say, if your soul is thirsty, the sound of rain is sweet in your ears.<a name=77:24></a> But the sound of it is not enough.<a name=77:25></a> We need more than the sound of it, and, hence, the great agony of Elijah brings before us the great solicitude of Christ for the welfare of our souls.<a name=77:26></a>

		I selected these four passages from Matthew because they present a scriptural feature of the use of numerals.<a name=102:1></a> The- Lord in Matthew deals with <i>twos</i>.<a name=102:2></a> You will find that these same incidents as recorded in the other evangelists contain only one of each of the couples spoken of.<a name=102:3></a> Matthew has in view that the world-system has proven itself reprobate and opposed to God and therefore must be broken up morally.<a name=102:4></a> It is not yet broken up by external power.<a name=102:5></a> That will come in its own time: "At the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with the angels of his power, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#1:7">2 Thessalonians  1:7</a>, 8).<a name=102:6></a>

		We who believe understand that the Lord has the power to come out and take vengeance on those who know not God.<a name=102:7></a> It is appalling as we take into account how little God is known, but ignorance of God and disobedience of the glad tidings are culpable, and the Lord Jesus will come out, as we are told, in flaming fire, with the angels of His power, to take vengeance on all who know not God and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=102:8></a> But, as already remarked, Matthew has not only this in view, but the break-up of the world-system for believers at the present time; hence we have in this incident of the demoniacs an illustration of this very thing.<a name=102:9></a> There were two of them, which suggests collective power, and they come out of the tombs, not out of the city, as in Luke, but from the area of the dead, so to say; and they were exceeding dangerous, so that no one could pass by that way.<a name=102:10></a>

		That is all I have to say: The object before me was to show from these few passages how Matthew prepares for the working out of church principles, and these may be found in two or three, so we should be more concerned about the principles and the <i>quality</i> of the persons than about their number.<a name=111:17></a> The quality is determined by the word "Peter".<a name=111:18></a> You must look for that quality which is akin to Christ.<a name=111:19></a> It must be what is of Christ.<a name=111:20></a> As remarked, it is more important to see that right qualities and divine principles are present than mere numbers.<a name=111:21></a> One would not despise the numbers, but the great thing is the quality of the persons and the principles by which they are governed.<a name=111:22></a> When these are according to God we are invulnerable, for the Lord Himself is with us.<a name=111:23></a>

		I wish to speak this evening about Zion, desiring to show that it has relation to the <i>hearts</i> of God's people, that is, the people of God taken up in relation to God's sovereign ways, and to be employed in these ways.<a name=112:1></a> Zion represents also an abstract principle, but abstract principles are of little value to us unless we can see them worked out concretely; then they become practical and intelligible to us.<a name=112:2></a>

		Zion, as spoken of in the passage read, is in connection with David, who is a type of Christ as personally attractive.<a name=112:3></a> In order to get possession of hearts, there must be personal attractiveness.<a name=112:4></a> Zion did not appear in connection with Moses.<a name=112:5></a> It is true that Moses spoke of the mountain of Jehovah's inheritance and of the place that He would build for Himself to dwell in, but a place that God loved remained for David to secure.<a name=112:6></a> It was mount Zion that He loved.<a name=112:7></a> And so, as I said, David appears as an attractive person.<a name=112:8></a> He is introduced to us in this way.<a name=112:9></a> He was an obscure person in the family -- little taken account of, but as appearing in the midst of his brethren, he was ruddy and of a beautiful countenance.<a name=112:10></a> It is he who slays the giant, and he becomes the centre of those who loved him.<a name=112:11></a> So that he gained hearts.<a name=112:12></a> Jonathan was drawn to him, the maids of Israel sang about him, and all Israel loved him.<a name=112:13></a> He was loveable.<a name=112:14></a> I say all this, because I have in mind, that, Zion in a practical way, refers to the hearts of God's people as secured by Christ.<a name=112:15></a> This, as we shall see, leads us to the greatest elevation, for Zion includes heavenly relationships and places.<a name=112:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that the myriads who came to David at Hebron are all counted by tribes, but no person is signalised there save two.<a name=114:12></a> The one was the prince of the Aaronites -- a man who had acquired fame amongst the priests; and then a young man called Zadok -- a valiant young man.<a name=114:13></a> It is as if in this time of testing, and waiting, and anxiety, prayer predominated.<a name=114:14></a> They were having to say to God, the matter was serious.<a name=114:15></a> And so it is that in the corresponding position in the New Testament, namely Colossians, the matter was serious.<a name=114:16></a> We have hardly anything like it, for it is not simply prayer with the apostle in regard to things, but combat.<a name=114:17></a> The matter was in the balance.<a name=114:18></a> He could say much of the Colossians and it was no small matter that Hebron had been reached, but Hebron is not Jerusalem, nor is Colossians Ephesians.<a name=114:19></a> Things were in the balance and so there was great combat, because of the opposition.<a name=114:20></a> As usual, Abner and Saul's servants were against David, even as mighty powers were operating to prevent the Colossian saints reaching the point that God had purposed for them.<a name=114:21></a> The apostle prays, "that their hearts may be encouraged".<a name=114:22></a> It is a collective idea -- "being united together in love".<a name=114:23></a>

		In considering what might be particularly helpful at this time the subject of the word of God came forcibly into my mind.<a name=121:1></a> It is, of course, much wider in its bearing than can be treated of in one short address, for we are told that it was in action as the worlds were formed.<a name=121:2></a> It is said that "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>).<a name=121:3></a> According to another scripture, "<i>He</i> spoke, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#33:9">Psalm  33:9</a>).<a name=121:4></a> That speaking would convey all the <i>wisdom</i> needed for the framing or building of this great universe which is before our eyes.<a name=121:5></a> What God spoke at that time conveyed the wisdom needed, not yet indeed "the all-various wisdom", but nevertheless the wisdom that was needed.<a name=121:6></a> And the more we look at the worlds as they appear to us the more marvellous they become as the outcome of that wisdom, of that "knowledge, too wonderful" for us, by which they were brought into their present being.<a name=121:7></a>

		It is said indeed in Proverbs that wisdom itself was there.<a name=121:8></a> No doubt this looked on to Christ, for it is said, By whom also He made the worlds.<a name=121:9></a> Indeed they were made by Christ, as it is further said, By Him all things were made and not one thing that was made was made without Him; <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:3">John  1:3</a>.<a name=121:10></a> So that the word of God was then active; as I said, He spoke and it was done.<a name=121:11></a> I do not suppose there was any opposition, but He spoke and it was done, and then what was done by the speaking was held fast by the commandment.<a name=121:12></a> He commanded and it stood fast.<a name=121:13></a> So that all that we see, beloved friends, the marvellous phenomena before our eyes, is the outcome of the divine word and the divine fiat by which it is held, and by which it continues for the will of God.<a name=121:14></a>

		I have in my mind to call attention to the constitution of the priest.<a name=132:1></a> Every true believer in Christ is a priest.<a name=132:2></a> Aaron and his sons represent the saints in their priestly capacity, and Aaron's sons and daughters represent the priestly family.<a name=132:3></a> But the fact that we are priests is not enough.<a name=132:4></a> It is God's intention that we should have a priestly constitution, which in New Testament language may be described as the result of <i>the word of God and prayer</i>.<a name=132:5></a> These two passages suggest first how the word being received is assimilated.<a name=132:6></a> You will observe that the priest had as his portion from the people's sacrifices the jawbones, or cheeks, and the stomach, or maw, besides the right shoulder and other things.<a name=132:7></a> Then you will observe from the passage in Judges that Samson's great victory was achieved by the jawbone of an ass.<a name=132:8></a> Jawbones, as we well know, represent the power for mastication.<a name=132:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I desire to say is simple, namely, that believers on receiving the word of God have to rightly take it in.<a name=132:10></a> If we are to be priests the word of God must be rightly received; as it is said in the New Testament, "accept with meekness the implanted word" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:21">James  1:21</a>).<a name=132:11></a> It is to be rightly received.<a name=132:12></a> And so the Lord, as ever, is the Model for us, He being the great Priest; it is as Man that He is priest.<a name=132:13></a> As a divine Person He was the Word of God; He was so perfectly the expression of the mind of God.<a name=132:14></a> Not only the nature of God, and the attributes of God, but the thoughts of God found a perfect expression in Christ.<a name=132:15></a> This is one of the most interesting features of the gospel narratives -- the manner in which the Lord presented the thoughts of God.<a name=132:16></a> I say, the <i>manner in which He presented them</i>.<a name=132:17></a>

		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:17">Luke  4:17</a> says, that, standing up in the synagogue of Nazareth, Jesus took the roll of the Scriptures from the attendant and read out of it.<a name=133:1></a> "He found the place" from which to read.<a name=133:2></a> You may be sure it took Him but little time to find the text, although in those days texts were not so easily found as they are now.<a name=133:3></a> He <i>found</i> the passage that exactly fitted the moment in which He stood in the synagogue; and having read it, He handed the roll back to the attendant and sat down.<a name=133:4></a> There was perfect grace, and perfect ease too, in His manner.<a name=133:5></a> Then He said, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears".<a name=133:6></a> He let the Scriptures speak.<a name=133:7></a> One would ever seek to let the Scriptures speak for themselves.<a name=133:8></a> They have their own way of speaking; indeed, they preach, as Paul said, "The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations on the principle of faith, announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:8">Galatians  3:8</a>).<a name=133:9></a> They preached the gospel to Abraham.<a name=133:10></a> And so, the Lord being the perfect Model for us, let the Scriptures speak.<a name=133:11></a> He said, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears".<a name=133:12></a> It was not yet fulfilled in their hearts, alas!<a name=133:13></a> It is one thing to have the word fulfilled in your ears, and another to have it fulfilled in your heart.<a name=133:14></a> Unless the word is in the heart it bears no fruit.<a name=133:15></a> And so in another passage, the Lord says, speaking of the good ground, it represents the one who hears the word of God and understands it in his heart.<a name=133:16></a> <i>Understands</i> it.<a name=133:17></a> Such an one as that bears fruit, thirty, sixty, and an hundred-fold.<a name=133:18></a>

		Now, beloved, do we use the jawbones?<a name=134:5></a> It is not a question of natural ability.<a name=134:6></a> One might read Scripture, and read books on Scripture, and listen to ministry with natural intelligence, and many can go a great length on that line, gathering up much information; but the jawbones which the priest obtained were the jawbones of the sacrifice of the victim.<a name=134:7></a> In other words, the jawbones are taken up as out of death.<a name=134:8></a> Natural ability ends there.<a name=134:9></a> Everything must come out of death, for that is the divine way.<a name=134:10></a> As Paul says, "For <i>I</i>, through law, have died to the law, that I may live to God" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:19">Galatians  2:19</a>).<a name=134:11></a> Whatever it is, the principle of death has to come in, and if I read Scripture, or if I listen to ministry, it must be on that principle.<a name=134:12></a> From the very outset the believer is in that position; he has come out of death.<a name=134:13></a> Baptism is a token of it; indeed, the Lord's supper, and also circumcision; all these things denote that the natural ability or status of the believer have no place in Christianity.<a name=134:14></a> What is of nature in that respect has no place.<a name=134:15></a> One has to begin anew, and so in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a> we have newness of life after baptism.<a name=134:16></a> That is to say, we have to begin with the principle of newness; but it is newness out of death.<a name=134:17></a> "Even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so <i>we</i> also should walk in newness of life".<a name=134:18></a> In chapter 7 you have newness of spirit, and in chapter 12 the renewing of the mind.<a name=134:19></a> That is to say, the life and the spirit and the mind are to be brought into accord with the death of Christ.<a name=134:20></a>

		These scriptures present three persons who changed their minds.<a name=142:1></a> That is why I read them, because the reception of Christ truly implies a change of mind.<a name=142:2></a> Naturally our minds are otherwise, but acceptance of Christ implies a change of mind as to oneself -- not only a change of mind as to Christ, but also as to oneself.<a name=142:3></a> As born into this world, and as we grow up into boyhood and girlhood, manhood and womanhood, we all think well of ourselves.<a name=142:4></a> One young man of whom we have often heard, Saul of Tarsus, thought very highly of himself, and he had good reason, as men speak, for he was of exceptional ancestry, had exceptional attainments, and possessed exceptional character, and he valued all these things, as all men do, and himself accordingly.<a name=142:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If one has an ancestor of distinction, or if one has money or special ability or education, one thinks of oneself accordingly.<a name=142:6></a> All these things converge on an individual; indeed they all exist on account of him, because it is remarkable how each one focuses the view upon self, and makes the most of whatever enhances one's glory.<a name=142:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In truth, that is the world; and, as I said, this young man Saul had immense advantages from this point of view; and valued them as men do, but <i>he changed his mind</i>.<a name=142:8></a> In his account of his change of view, he says that he had been an "insolent, overbearing man" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:13">1 Timothy  1:13</a>), and that he was "not fit to be called apostle [although he was an apostle, and a great one] because I have persecuted the assembly of God" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:9">1 Corinthians  15:9</a>).<a name=142:9></a> He had changed his mind about himself -- he repented.<a name=142:10></a>

		WRITTEN MINISTRY AND ITS DISTRIBUTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Writing as a means for the communication of His mind has been used by God from the time of Moses.<a name=187:1></a> It is a feature of His service, as is speaking.<a name=187:2></a> Thus written ministry has a divinely recognised place, evidenced most strongly in its use for the <i>permanent</i> record, among men, of God's thoughts -- the holy Scriptures.<a name=187:3></a> Indeed, one important advantage of writing is that it constitutes what might be forgotten, or lost, permanent, for reference and meditation.<a name=187:4></a> The first recorded writing was for <i>rehearsal</i> (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>); it refers to the overthrow of Amalek -- Satan in the flesh -- and so is specially important for young believers.<a name=187:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is to be observed, however, is that in the testimony of God writing appears <i>after</i> oral ministry.<a name=187:6></a> This is attested, both in the Old and New dispensations.<a name=187:7></a> Moses' service began with speaking, and so generally; writing came later.<a name=187:8></a> In our Lord's ministry we have no writing, save on the ground (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>), and we have no writings from the apostles until long after Pentecost.<a name=187:9></a> Thus it is clear that writings sent to countries where there has been no oral testimony is not in keeping with the divine way of serving men.<a name=187:10></a> As the testimony is presented in an oral, or living way, then the written message has its place.<a name=187:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the above it will be seen that spiritual ministry in a written form is of immense value -- second only to what is spoken -- and its circulation should be as wide as possible.<a name=187:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The publication and distribution of written ministry is therefore an important part of God's service, and so should <i>not be conducted on a commercial basis</i>.<a name=187:13></a> Using a typical term, it is properly levitical, and while those engaged in it have much to do that may be regarded as "common", their work, generally,

		is that of Levites.<a name=188:1></a> We learn from the book of Numbers that the work of the Levites was graded, that of Kohath being the most sacred.<a name=188:2></a> The sons of Merari had the most onerous part of the tabernacle service, and so they had wagons assigned to them: the sons of Gershon also had wagons.<a name=188:3></a> From this we learn that while the distribution of printed ministry is not exactly on the level of the oral communication of it; yet it is part of the same service, and those engaged in it should be regarded in this light, and not simply as rendering common or mercantile labour.<a name=188:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that mere physical labour has to be employed, such as type-setting, book-binding, etc.<a name=188:5></a>, and that this labour may be performed by a Christian and paid for in the ordinary way, in no way interferes with the truth set out above; it is like a railway ticket that ensures the passage of a servant of the Lord to a town where he wishes to give an address to the saints there.<a name=188:6></a> Although he is carried by a train, his service throughout is entirely levitical.<a name=188:7></a> The engine driver on the train might be a Christian, but <i>his</i> work is not levitical.<a name=188:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reference in the Scriptures to books besides those which make up the Bible is remarkable; such as "the book of Jasher", "the book of the wars of the Lord", the books of "Nathan" and "Gad", also such writings as "the words of Nathan the prophet", "the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite", and "the visions of Iddo the Seer" and "the writings of David King of Israel", and "the writing of Solomon".<a name=188:9></a> All this literature would correspond to the written ministry of the present time, and the manner in which the Holy Spirit alludes to it indicates its great importance.<a name=188:10></a>

		For a good while the existence of the mere commercial element in the publication and distribution of written ministry has distressed many, and more recently attention has been called to it in a definite way, as wholly out of keeping with the service of God.<a name=189:9></a> Extensive enquiry was made and counsel taken, as before the Lord, among many brethren, very widely located, and it was apparent throughout that He was helping toward a mode of executing this important service, bearing a definite levitical stamp.<a name=189:10></a> A depot has been secured, where helpful ministry for the saints and suitable gospel literature for general distribution will, under the Lord, be published at cost, or as nearly so as possible; any profits made will be devoted to the free distribution of spiritual literature.<a name=189:11></a>

		I want to speak a little about what is inscrutable, having in view its bearing on what is known of God in Christ.<a name=205:1></a> It is of the first importance that in speaking of divine Persons, inscrutability, as attaching to them, should be steadily in our minds.<a name=205:2></a> I would like to distinguish between <i>who</i> Christ is and <i>what</i> He is, as Scripture presents Him.<a name=205:3></a> The idea can be applied to created things also, reminding us of our limitations and ignorance.<a name=205:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:19">Proverbs  30:19</a> reference is made to certain inscrutable things, four in number.<a name=205:5></a> That does not mean that they were absolutely inscrutable, but only that the writer accepted his limitations, and admitted there were things beyond <i>his</i> comprehension.<a name=205:6></a> But when we come to divine Persons we have a definite statement of inscrutability, and it is intended to bow our hearts in holy admission that limitations imposed, that there is that which is beyond creature ability to grasp.<a name=205:7></a> That is what the Lord had in mind in His remarks in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>.<a name=205:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was a crucial point, and the Lord turns to His Father and praises Him saying, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth".<a name=205:9></a> We are thus admitted to hear Him speak to His Father.<a name=205:10></a> He has in mind that His Father is Lord of heaven and earth, and that He disposes of them according to His pleasure.<a name=205:11></a> Then He goes on to say, "thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent".<a name=205:12></a> Things are hid from certain persons, a very solemn matter; and then He says, "Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight.<a name=205:13></a> All things have been delivered to me by my Father".<a name=205:14></a> So that at the very moment of His rejection by the Jews, the Lord with the utmost restfulness of spirit, indeed joy of spirit, for Luke in his account says, "Jesus rejoiced in spirit", introduces

	<div class="paragraph">
		These scriptures are familiar to us, I am sure, and the subject I purpose to treat of from them is also familiar to all, that is <i>motherly features</i>.<a name=214:1></a> The New Testament has these scriptures in view when it speaks of <i>our mother</i> -- the mother of Christians.<a name=214:2></a> What is presented in these scriptures, viewed spiritually, converges on the assembly; indeed, it is said that the ends of the dispensations come to us; the scriptures have the assembly in view; its calling out, its formation and the duration of its testimony on earth being unique and more extended than any other testimony.<a name=214:3></a> Its place too in the divine scheme which is about to be unfolded is unique.<a name=214:4></a> It has a place that no other family of God has or could have, and hence the numerous allusions to it throughout the Scriptures, as we now can understand them by the Spirit sent down from heaven; and not the least side is that which alludes to its motherly functions.<a name=214:5></a> So that the apostle says, as you will remember, "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:26">Galatians  4:26</a>).<a name=214:6></a> Although not yet literally above she is regarded as above.<a name=214:7></a> It does not say in that passage that Jerusalem is in heaven, but <i>above</i>, involving moral elevation and superiority which ought to have its effect upon us as in this world.<a name=214:8></a> God's intent is that this moral elevation should be with us, and it should affect particularly all who are mothers literally, as well as all local companies of God's people, for the idea works out in this latter connection.<a name=214:9></a> The need of mothering is very great at this time, more particularly as the enemy knows that the Lord is intent on assembly formation at the end, that there should be something of it, however obscure or small, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=215>[Page 215]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		without motherly qualities and instincts among the saints it is impossible that this formation should continue and reach its desired end.<a name=215:1></a> The end is in view and the Lord is intent on reaching it, so that the Spirit and the bride will be in unison to say, <i>Come</i>, as indeed they are in measure now.<a name=215:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is helpful to learn by contrasts, and in regard of this subject one may point out what was <i>not</i> motherly in persons who were literal mothers.<a name=215:3></a> For instance, the mother of Zebedee's children, for that is how the Spirit of the God regards her, but it is hardly to her credit that she was the mother of his children without saying that she was his <i>wife</i>, although she <i>was</i> his wife.<a name=215:4></a> It may be inquired, why it was not to her credit that she was the mother of his children.<a name=215:5></a> Well, the sequel shows.<a name=215:6></a> We have to go by results, as I hope to show in a positive way in the book of Judges.<a name=215:7></a> She brought her sons to the Lord, which you would all say was very good, and she made a prayer for them.<a name=215:8></a> But we may ask amiss; we may move to the Lord in a selfish way to gratify natural ambitions.<a name=215:9></a> It is not at all uncommon to find persons who, although they make much of the Lord and are perfectly orthodox, yet underneath they have ambition to shine amongst the people of God, instead of shining in the world, the idea being to be prominent.<a name=215:10></a> But the normal motherly instincts in a local company of Christians will never promote that principle.<a name=215:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case of the mother of Zebedee's children, she brought her two sons to the Lord and made a prayer that they should each have a place, one on His right hand and the other on His left hand in His kingdom.<a name=215:12></a> I merely refer to that.<a name=215:13></a> You will all remember the incident.<a name=215:14></a> It does not set forth a spiritual motherly quality; it is a quality, alas!<a name=215:15></a> often found in mothers, which works damage in the assembly.<a name=215:16></a> It did, indeed, on that occasion, for you will remember the ten disciples were indignant with

	<div class="paragraph">
		the two.<a name=216:1></a> It does not say they were indignant with her, for in truth any indignation should have been directed against her, but they were indignant with the two -- ten against two, that is to say, division in a meeting brought about by the ambition of a mother.<a name=216:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get another case in Leah, the wife of Jacob.<a name=216:3></a> We only read of one daughter of Jacob, and Leah was her mother.<a name=216:4></a> Jacob built a house at Succoth and settled down; he made booths for his cattle, and we are told that Dinah went out to see the daughters of the land.<a name=216:5></a> There is not a word about the mother granting her permission to do so or of her asking her mother's permission to do so.<a name=216:6></a> It is most dangerous for mothers to allow such liberty to their daughters: to go out as they wish to see the daughters of the land.<a name=216:7></a> No spiritual mother would permit of it.<a name=216:8></a> I need not enlarge on the results.<a name=216:9></a> They were very disastrous.<a name=216:10></a> The motherly qualities were not in evidence in Jacob's house.<a name=216:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then again with Hagar, who is over against Sarah in Galatians; although she was an Egyptian handmaid, she had a place in the household of faith; she had thus great spiritual opportunities, but she selected a wife for her son out of Egypt.<a name=216:12></a> That was not spirituality.<a name=216:13></a> It is most damaging for mothers to look abroad in the world for advantages for their children.<a name=216:14></a> On the other hand, Rebecca was grieved because Esau had married the daughters of the land.<a name=216:15></a> She was unable apparently to forbid it, but she <i>felt</i> it, and God has respect even for feelings.<a name=216:16></a> We may be unable to carry them into effect, but God has respect for right feelings.<a name=216:17></a> Well now, I have spoken of these illustrations of unspiritual motherhood.<a name=216:18></a> Better have no mothers at all if they are unspiritual, having a status of faith and yet wanting in faith.<a name=216:19></a> These are practical matters and most important.<a name=216:20></a>

		Now I want to go on to Sarah, who is also signalised indeed, she is alluded to in Galatians in this very connection -- she is the free woman, typifying "the mother of us all".<a name=219:15></a> The scene is different.<a name=219:16></a> Abraham makes a feast as the child is weaned.<a name=219:17></a> We are not told who weaned him, the idea being that this principle of the household of faith was there -- the principle of detaching the children from the natural and linking them on to the spiritual.<a name=219:18></a> On that day there was a great feast -- an auspicious time.<a name=219:19></a> I have no doubt the Lord alludes to it when He says, "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw it and rejoiced" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a>).<a name=219:20></a> It was Christ's day in type -- looking on to the day when He will be everything.<a name=219:21></a> We anticipate that now

		Dear brethren, I want to say in closing what I have more particularly in mind in this address, and that is, that God as God is the great end in view in all that He effects, and this is seen particularly in the higher features of the truth; when we get on to these high levels spiritually, the more God as God comes before us.<a name=276:1></a> It must be so.<a name=276:2></a> "Of him, and through him, and for him are all things" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:36">Romans  11:36</a>).<a name=276:3></a> Hence, when the Lord says "Father" here, He intends what He is saying to be progressive; He intends us to move in our minds from that precious appellation of God to the other one which covers the whole Deity, the fulness of It -- that is <i>God</i>.<a name=276:4></a> But what God?<a name=276:5></a> Not the God of Israel simply.<a name=276:6></a> It is the same Being, of course, the same God, but the truth as to Israel's God is necessarily narrower in its bearing.<a name=276:7></a> The new covenant is made with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, but we cannot restrict God to any nation or even nations.<a name=276:8></a> God is God.<a name=276:9></a> John impresses us with this from the outset.<a name=276:10></a> He says, "No one has seen God at any time" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>), and, again, he quotes the Lord as saying, "God is a spirit" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:24">John  4:24</a>).<a name=276:11></a> Why should he say that, save to accustom our minds to God.<a name=276:12></a> Paul speaks to us of the invisible God (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:17">1 Timothy  1:17</a>), and again of One "dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:16">1 Timothy  6:16</a>).<a name=276:13></a> Are these things written for nothing?<a name=276:14></a> No; they are some of the greatest things in Scripture, and God intends us to observe them, and to get alongside of Christ.<a name=276:15></a> If I am to know God aright, I must know Christ's God, how as Man <i>He regards God</i>.<a name=276:16></a> Christ is God, of course, having part in the Deity, as we have often remarked.<a name=276:17></a> Indeed, He is said to be "over all, God blessed for ever" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a>), and how we rejoice in that!<a name=276:18></a> We have to understand things as Scripture presents them, and this requires that He always retains His absoluteness.<a name=276:19></a>

		Hence, Paul goes on to tell us in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, that when Christ has subdued everything, He will hand over the kingdom "to him who is God and Father", and then that the Son Himself is placed in subjection to Him who has subjected all things to Him.<a name=277:1></a> And what for?<a name=277:2></a> "That God may be all in all" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:24">1 Corinthians  15:24</a> - 28).<a name=277:3></a> The preposition 'in' is one of power; God is all and is <i>in</i> all; He is <i>in</i> the universe <i>in power</i>.<a name=277:4></a> That is what is in view, and so the Lord, in speaking of the ascension -- for that is the point -- is leading us <i>up</i> in thought, not physically yet, but in thought: "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=277:5></a>

		As is known to most of us, and has been intimated in prayer, we are together not at an ordinary funeral service, but an extraordinary one.<a name=278:1></a> Although that of a child who, as we may say, did not know his right hand from his left, yet the circumstances of his removal from our midst -- the sorrow being occasioned instantaneously -- are such as to appeal to us, and draw out those deep sympathies of which we Christians are peculiarly capable.<a name=278:2></a> Our sympathies are not now with regard to the child himself.<a name=278:3></a> It has been remarked in prayer that David, as his child was taken, through death, said: "I shall go to him, but he will not return to me" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:23">2 Samuel  12:23</a>).<a name=278:4></a> He spoke with intelligence and resignation, but then he did more -- he arose from the earth, on which he had rightly lain in suitable humility and contrition of heart, and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel, and entered into the house of Jehovah and worshipped.<a name=278:5></a> He did a great thing.<a name=278:6></a> He acted as one who knew God, showing that grief occasioned by a governmental dealing of God may become power in the believer for worship.<a name=278:7></a> That incident encourages me in reading this scripture, although it has been on my mind since I heard of this great sorrow, and I mentioned it to our beloved brother for his comfort; and David's movement at that extraordinary time, to which I have referred, encourages me to take up this passage, because it is a priestly passage.<a name=278:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more circumstances such as these are calculated to affect us naturally, the more the urgency to introduce what is priestly; and so that I may be understood, I use the word 'priestly' in its spiritual sense, that is, as referring to Christ, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it was permitted the ordinary priests -- the sons of Aaron -- to mourn under certain circumstances in a limited way; but the high priest, never!<a name=279:5></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#21:10">Leviticus  21:10</a> - 12.<a name=279:6></a> That is to say, Christ has passed out of the circumstances of flesh and blood.<a name=279:7></a> Having died and risen He has gone into heaven, and is constituted a Priest for ever; and whilst He is capable of being touched with the feeling of our infirmities, it is not in a natural way.<a name=279:8></a> As here in the flesh, He was capable of tears; but it will be remembered by those who have read Scripture, that the Lord did not weep with regard to Lazarus, until He saw Mary weeping and the Jews that were with her.<a name=279:9></a> His perfect humanity was evidenced by the fact that He was capable of being affected by mourners.<a name=279:10></a> When He spoke of Lazarus's illness, He had no tears; when He spoke of Lazarus's death, He had no tears; because He was, speaking reverently, Priest, and had said that the sickness was not unto death, but for the glory of God.<a name=279:11></a> That was the priestly side.<a name=279:12></a> It was when He saw Mary's tears and those of the Jews that accompanied her, that He wept.<a name=279:13></a> He was a real Man; He was the Son of God; He was Himself God come down in real and holy incarnation: but He had already said that the sickness of Lazarus was not unto death, but for the glory of God.<a name=279:14></a> It was really unto death, but it was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having made these remarks, I would briefly direct your minds to the passage I read.<a name=280:3></a> As I said, in seeking to stress the spiritual, I am far from being oblivious of the actual circumstances in this sorrow: it is a <i>great</i> sorrow.<a name=280:4></a> Most of us have been to burial services before; but we are here today, not as business acquaintances of our beloved brother and sister -- not as neighbours -- not even as relatives in the flesh.<a name=280:5></a> There are indeed natural relatives here, also neighbours, and business or professional acquaintances; but most of us are here because we are Christians, because we are linked up vitally with our brother and sister, because we belong to the assembly: and it is said of those that if one member suffer, all suffer.<a name=280:6></a> Such is the living link among the people of God today.<a name=280:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I am speaking of all Christians.<a name=280:8></a> Every true believer in Christ has the Holy Spirit, speaking generally, and is vitally linked up with all other Christians and with Christ in heaven as their great Head.<a name=280:9></a> So the assembly is not only an organisation, but an organism -- that which is capable of being affected throughout, as the human body is, if one member suffer.<a name=280:10></a> If one member suffer, all do.<a name=280:11></a> We are here in that keen sensibility of sharing the sufferings with our dear brother and sister.<a name=280:12></a> We do share them, but what I have to remark now in a very brief manner, is that the spiritual is the chief thought.<a name=280:13></a> It <i>must</i> be, for it implies God's part in what is before us.<a name=280:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the passage I read records this remarkable experience of the prophet Ezekiel, which doubtless has struck some of you as very extraordinary; but, as I said at the beginning, it is a priestly matter.<a name=280:15></a> It is a passage calculated to lift us out of the natural
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=281>[Page 281]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		into the spiritual, to take us out of immediate natural surroundings into the wide realm of God and His purpose; for His government here has His eternal purpose in view.<a name=281:1></a> Ezekiel is one of the two prophets formally mentioned as priests.<a name=281:2></a> Jeremiah was a priest, but it is only said of him that he was one of the priests in a certain place; whereas, Ezekiel is <i>the</i> priest.<a name=281:3></a> He is said to be Ezekiel, <i>the</i> priest; so that in his book we are in the presence of ministry that is peculiarly priestly.<a name=281:4></a> This passage represents the book as much as any other in it, and so the word is that the desire of his eyes is to be taken away from him.<a name=281:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It might seem extraordinary that a wife should thus have to die in order that Ezekiel should be a sign -- a sign to Israel; In other words, the death of this woman -- evidently a wife to be desired, as it is said "the desire of thine eyes" -- a wife that would be missed, a wife whose death would be an irreparable loss, speaking naturally, has got to die, not on her own account, but on account of Ezekiel, on account of the testimony, that Ezekiel should be a sign to Israel.<a name=281:6></a> How remarkable all this is!<a name=281:7></a> How remarkable are the ways of God!<a name=281:8></a> If a child has to be sacrificed in the ways of God and a sign is established in Israel, in the assembly, as a result, how differently we must look at it!<a name=281:9></a> How different it is!<a name=281:10></a> We are not minimising the natural, no!<a name=281:11></a> The Lord Jesus did not at the grave of Lazarus; but He had already established what I am speaking of; that the great spiritual side of the death of Lazarus should be for the glory of God: and it <i>was</i>.<a name=281:12></a> And so here, this woman -- this wife -- has to die; and she dies the next day.<a name=281:13></a> And Ezekiel abides by the commandment of Jehovah; he does not depart for a moment from it.<a name=281:14></a> He refuses to mourn, to shed tears.<a name=281:15></a> He is just as he had always been and as God commanded, and the people <i>are noticing</i>.<a name=281:16></a> "Wilt thou not tell us what

		Now our dear brother is no less than a priest, let it be understood; our sister is no less than a priest, let it be understood; that is to say, they are Christians; they have the Holy Spirit, and not only this, but our brother is a minister of Christ.<a name=282:3></a> These things are of prime importance in heaven, and all the movements of heaven in regard to them have these things in view.<a name=282:4></a> "Wilt thou not tell us", the people say to Ezekiel; and he tells them exactly what the thing means; that he was to be a sign to Israel, and that Israel was to learn the mind of God from him.<a name=282:5></a> Israel now had an asset they did not have before; they had indeed in Ezekiel a priest before; they had a prophet, before: but they did not have the man who had lost his wife in these extraordinary circumstances, nor did they have a man who had such communications from Jehovah in regard to the loss of his wife; that the loss of his wife would make him a sign to the people of God.<a name=282:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The immediate lesson to be learned was that God was dealing with the temple in Jerusalem (verse 21).<a name=282:7></a> It was the desire of the eyes of Israel; they prided themselves in it; it was the ornament on earth in God's mind, too; but the circumstances required that He should deal with it judicially, and there was to be no mourning.<a name=282:8></a> Ezekiel was to be a sign with regard to all this.<a name=282:9></a> And so it is that this circumstance now before us may result similarly; that we may all learn not to value unduly what stands in a similar relation here, even although it may have had a spiritual setting at one time; that is to say, the <i>public</i> body, the assembly, has become such that God has had to deal with it judicially.<a name=282:10></a> There are those who cling to it; they cherish it, but they do not see that God is removing it judicially; and this is to be a sign.<a name=282:11></a> It may be some local matter; it

	<div class="paragraph">
		may be a general matter: but what is before us today is to be a sign that God is dealing with <i>something else;</i> in other words, that we are all to come round to the priestly position; and then how great the gain will be!<a name=283:1></a> Our brother and sister are suffering for us, if this is to be the case; they are to be the sign to us; and they are to be in the good of it and are to act in it; they are to prove that they are superior to the natural for the sake of the spiritual.<a name=283:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so at the end, as you will observe, it says, "In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb.<a name=283:3></a> So shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah".<a name=283:4></a> Is that not a wonderful result?<a name=283:5></a> I am not speaking theoretically, beloved; far otherwise.<a name=283:6></a> I know something whereof I speak, that these things are worth the while.<a name=283:7></a> God forbid that any should be hard in any way, but these things are worth the while if the saints of God come into such results as these; that a saint opens his mouth and is able to speak and the people come to know God, as it says: "Be no more dumb.<a name=283:8></a> So shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah".<a name=283:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what I had in my mind.<a name=283:10></a> What I am saying is not exactly the gospel.<a name=283:11></a> We are nearly all Christians here, and it is a question in the mind of God in these things -- what He has in view.<a name=283:12></a> And we are not to sorrow as those who have no hope.<a name=283:13></a> It is only a moment until all this is over.<a name=283:14></a> It is a question of looking things in the face.<a name=283:15></a> In the meanwhile, we shall have the sympathies of our great Head.<a name=283:16></a> It is only a moment until all is over, and in the meantime we are to be here with a sense of what is priestly; so that the people may come to know Jehovah; that is to say, they may know the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=283:17></a>

		I have before me the subject of <i>washing</i>.<a name=284:1></a> The apostle Paul refers to the Corinthians as washed -- "Ye have been washed" he says (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:11">1 Corinthians  6:11</a>); and in the book of the Revelation we have a remarkable series of passages dealing with this very subject; indeed it is one of the most prominent subjects in Scripture.<a name=284:2></a> So in Revelation we have the saints praising the Lord as to it.<a name=284:3></a> "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:5">Revelation  1:5</a>).<a name=284:4></a> They celebrate in that song what the <i>Lord</i> did for them -- He had washed them from their sins.<a name=284:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But later in the book (chapter 7) the prophet sees a large number of people, so large that they are innumerable, and one of the twenty-four elders inquires from him as to who these people were that were arrayed in white robes; he answers, "<i>Thou</i> knowest".<a name=284:6></a> And the elder says, "These are they who come out of the great tribulation", they had come out of every nation and tribes and peoples and tongues, and they had washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb -- <i>they</i> had done it.<a name=284:7></a> Primarily, Christ alone can do it, for God must be satisfied that the washing is effective, so that there should not be a stain upon us as before Him; but, on the other hand, this great number did it also.<a name=284:8></a>

		Then again, in the last chapter of Revelation, you have what refers to those who are mentioned in the other chapters I have alluded to.<a name=285:12></a> They are spoken of, not as <i>having</i> washed, but as <i>washing;</i> it is in the present tense -- "they that wash their robes", it says, "that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:14">Revelation  22:14</a>).<a name=285:13></a> That is a continuous thing; it is for Christians.<a name=285:14></a> They are, or should be, characterised by washing.<a name=285:15></a>

		In reading these scriptures I am thinking of how heaven regards what is <i>good</i>, and how it garners it, however little good there may be, or however much.<a name=296:1></a> The prophet Isaiah speaks about the righteous being taken and no one caring about it, ignoring that they are taken out of the evil to come.<a name=296:2></a> This is not always so, for Matthew would teach us that the evil is taken out of the good; that is, out of God's kingdom.<a name=296:3></a> What is good remains here to continue for God.<a name=296:4></a> What is evil is taken away for judgment.<a name=296:5></a> John and Paul would indicate that the good are taken, as in our verse in Revelation, taken, or kept, out of the great tribulation.<a name=296:6></a>

		Isaiah confirms Paul and John in that sense, saying that the righteous is taken out from the evil to come.<a name=296:7></a> He says, "He entereth into peace" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#57:2">Isaiah  57:2</a>.<a name=296:8></a> Not only shall they die, but they shall enter into peace, and "they rest in their beds".<a name=296:9></a> This is a very comforting thought of divine care in special circumstances -- resting on their beds, everyone "that hath walked in his uprightness", whilst the wicked remain in discomfort and sorrow.<a name=296:10></a> For whatever pressure we may realise now, it is not equal to what is coming.<a name=296:11></a> The Lord Himself stresses the character of what is coming.<a name=296:12></a> He speaks of the "hour of trial" which is to be general, to try those that dwell on the earth -- not the saints, but earth-dwellers (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>), and then He says of a certain tribulation, more limited in area perhaps, that there never was one like it, nor afterwards will there be one like it; and unless God shortened those days, no flesh would be saved, but for the elect's sake He will shorten them; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:21">Matthew  24:21</a>, 22.<a name=296:13></a> There is

		Ahijah had God's mind; he was a prophet of note; and had told Jeroboam that he would be king, so no doubt Jeroboam had a friendly feeling for the old prophet who had befriended him.<a name=300:6></a> But Ahijah's early acquaintance with Jeroboam does not warp his judgment of him now.<a name=300:7></a> Jeroboam is not what he used to be.<a name=300:8></a> When Ahijah received the word from Jehovah about him, that he was to be king of Israel, he was an acceptable young man; he came even under the notice of Solomon.<a name=300:9></a> But now he is a wicked man, and the prophet announces to his wife the terrible judgment of God about to fall on his house.<a name=300:10></a> We learn later that what Ahijah says was fully executed; and it is said to have been as spoken by Ahijah the prophet.<a name=300:11></a> So that God's announced judgments are sure.<a name=300:12></a> Jeroboam is said to have been a wicked man, and to have caused Israel to sin; and he is doomed.<a name=300:13></a> The word of God is, "Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat .<a name=300:14></a>.<a name=300:15></a>.<a name=300:16></a> for Jehovah hath spoken".<a name=300:17></a> None of his house should have a burial.<a name=300:18></a> Such is the divine wrath against a man who apostatises.<a name=300:19></a> But still, Scripture makes much of the fact that there is a boy in that house, and there is <i>some</i> good in him; "something good toward Jehovah the God of Israel".<a name=300:20></a> We are not to ignore any good in boys; we must watch for it.<a name=300:21></a> Boy flesh is very difficult flesh to manage; but when there is any good towards God it must be fostered.<a name=300:22></a>

		My remarks, dear brethren, will be brief This passage came to me as I arrived here, being reminded of the timidity that is apt to mark those on whom God is pleased to place special responsibility.<a name=394:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This book affords other examples of this, but Gideon is outstanding, as one who was a successful leader in Israel, and yet marked, especially at the beginning, by timidity.<a name=394:2></a> He came under the notice of heaven, and evidently it was because he showed, on his own account, very definite instincts of care for the people of God.<a name=394:3></a> He was doing something that would serve the people.<a name=394:4></a> It was only in a small way, which indeed is applicable to the service of most of us.<a name=394:5></a> He was threshing wheat.<a name=394:6></a> We are told that, "an angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth that was in Ophrah, that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite.<a name=394:7></a> And his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, to secure it from the Midianites" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#6:11">Judges  6:11</a>).<a name=394:8></a> You can readily observe that what he was doing would be relatively of small account -- what one man could thresh in such a circumscribed area as a winepress.<a name=394:9></a> Nevertheless he was doing something that tended to undo the work of the enemy at the moment, for the Midianites were despoiling the people of food.<a name=394:10></a> Gideon was thus marked off as discerning what was current on the part of the enemy and meeting it as far as he could.<a name=394:11></a> It was said of one by the Lord, "What <i>she</i> could she has done" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:8">Mark  14:8</a>).<a name=394:12></a> Such a one comes under the notice of heaven, and if one is to be used, it would be according to such uprightness and accuracy, therefore it behoves him to be subject, as another said, "Here am I; send me" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6:8">Isaiah  6:8</a>).<a name=394:13></a> It is thus that these features are provided for.<a name=394:14></a> It is said especially of one who

	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage says that an angel of Jehovah sat under the oak or "terebinth".<a name=395:3></a> I suppose this would remind us of stability; meaning that all is held divinely.<a name=395:4></a> Then it is said, in verse 12, "And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valour".<a name=395:5></a> The angel is a representative of heaven, so the leader, or servant he addresses is to be viewed according to <i>his</i> words.<a name=395:6></a>

		I make these remarks to preface what I have in mind.<a name=395:7></a> We know the story of Gideon; we should, at least.<a name=395:8></a> It is peculiarly instructive, rising, I might say, to a type of the service of God in Christianity.<a name=395:9></a> The chapter records one thing after another, tending to fortify this servant and qualify him for the great service he was to render; yet these verses I read indicate uncertainty and timidity in him.<a name=395:10></a> What has touched me, and what I think we all ought to take account of is, how these verses should enter into our prayers.<a name=395:11></a> There are those who say, Well, God will do the thing.<a name=395:12></a> Many of us speak about faith merely in a theoretic way, which only misleads.<a name=395:13></a> When faith speaks, it speaks with assurance.<a name=395:14></a> It is not in us as born, nor does it develop in us naturally.<a name=395:15></a> The Scripture says, "faith then is by a report, but the report by God's word" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:17">Romans  10:17</a>).<a name=395:16></a> It is very real; not mere theory.<a name=395:17></a> One ought to be able to give an account of the time when the report came into his soul and carried with it the idea of faith, enabling him to move on in a power that was not hitherto known.<a name=395:18></a> In the epistle to the Hebrews a whole chapter is devoted to what faith is and what it does.<a name=395:19></a> You may say, God will do what He wants

		Thus we have things in the heavens set before us in a spiritual way, so that it is said in this letter that the Lord came in connection with a greater and more perfect tabernacle, that is not of this creation, He came in connection with a great spiritual system that He unfolded in His ministry.<a name=441:4></a> Hence, dear brethren, the importance of paying attention to the Apostle -- considering Him -- and giving earnest heed to the things spoken.<a name=441:5></a> Then in the type the high priest was brought to the door of the tabernacle; that is to say, Christ Himself has taken up a place in resurrection as Priest in relation to all that He unfolded as the Apostle.<a name=441:6></a>

		In Simon's house, as you recall, He also spoke, and that in grace too, but He only spoke as occasion required it, but He was not free there; Simon's was not the environment for the unfolding of things in the heavens; a house full of religious pride and superciliousness is no house in which to open up the things of heaven.<a name=442:4></a> Think of what is in heaven, dear brethren -- all the Father's thoughts and the infinite holiness and brightness and glory of that place!<a name=442:5></a> How could you bring that into a house such as Simon's?<a name=442:6></a> It is wholly incongruous.<a name=442:7></a> Nevertheless, the Lord would speak in Simon's house, and He did; He rebuked Simon and He justified the sinner.<a name=442:8></a> He will do that, but the unfolding of the heavenly things required a suitable environment, as I said; and so, although Martha was not ready, Mary was; she was attentive, and hers was the privileged part of listening to His word.<a name=442:9></a> Whatever He said was of interest to her.<a name=442:10></a> Let us not think that any part of the tabernacle -- the great spiritual tabernacle -- is of minor importance.<a name=442:11></a> Every peg is indispensable although made of wood; every item of the great spiritual system unfolded and set up by the great Apostle of our confession is essential; and you want to hear every word, we must not miss anything.<a name=442:12></a> So Mary represents one who considers and listens to the Apostle of our confession, and I have no doubt that the next chapter sets before us the Priest.<a name=442:13></a>

		But Luke is also characterised by holiness in the priestly way in which he gives his narrative; he has in mind to bring in the priestly family.<a name=443:9></a> You will recall how he begins with a priest -- Zacharias -- and Elizabeth the daughter of a priest, and how in recording the birth of our Lord, His nativity, and His boyhood, he throws out, so to say, a priestly atmosphere, so that the natural mind should be rebuked in looking at the subject.<a name=443:10></a> And so, throughout, he has in view that the saints should become a company of priests.<a name=443:11></a> Hence, when you come to the end of his narrative you have the disciples led out as far as to Bethany by the Lord -- it is a beautiful and most touching scene -- and having arrived there

		There is an anti-priest who has access there too -- one who accuses the brethren day and night.<a name=444:2></a> But the Lord is there as Priest; He is there to uphold us, and not only us, but to uphold the whole system that He unfolded in His ministry; and it <i>is</i> upheld.<a name=444:3></a> Let us not think, for one moment, that there is any failure from that point of view; He is there, "Minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:2">Hebrews  8:2</a>).<a name=444:4></a> The Lord has pitched it, and He is there as a Minister of it, and the ministry is being carried on perfectly; were it not so we should not be here as we are.<a name=444:5></a> There is a great spiritual system that no effort of the enemy can touch -- it subsists in Christ.<a name=444:6></a> He is the great Priest; the disciples get a view of Him thus as He lifted up His hands and was carried into heaven -- they got a view of Him going in, and He remains there, and is supporting the whole system that He unfolded in His ministry.<a name=444:7></a>

		Well now, the passage in Luke shows us how the disciples, having seen the Lord exercise, as I may say, His priestly function, desired to be taught to do the same.<a name=445:10></a> It says that one of His disciples, having seen Him pray, said, "Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples".<a name=445:11></a> And the Lord immediately answered, "When ye pray, say, Father thy name be hallowed" -- that is the first principle of priestly service.<a name=445:12></a> Now, dear brethren, do we pray?<a name=445:13></a> The first thought in this prayer which the Lord taught His disciples is "Thy name be hallowed;" that is, I am thinking for God.<a name=445:14></a> A priest always thinks for God.<a name=445:15></a> I do not begin with my own needs; the priest thinks for God.<a name=445:16></a> So, in the Lord's wonderful prayer to which I have alluded, He says, "I have glorified <i>thee</i> on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:4">John  17:4</a>).<a name=445:17></a> He came in relation to God, and to carry out the will of God;

		The Lord Jesus was declared to be the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=446:8></a> You see how holiness marks Him from the outset.<a name=446:9></a> On the cross He says, "And thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:3">Psalm  22:3</a>).<a name=446:10></a> And so in resurrection He declares the Father's name.<a name=446:11></a> Hence the next thing is: "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee" (verse 22).<a name=446:12></a> If the One who inhabited the praises of Israel was holy, how much more so in inhabiting the praises of the saints.<a name=446:13></a> The divine habitation must be in holiness, so that the prayer here, simple though it is, begins, "Thy name be hallowed".<a name=446:14></a>

		You will remember how that when the apostle in his labours visited Thessalonica, he spent three sabbath days in preaching in the synagogue; and how that it is said that certain believed the word, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.<a name=453:5></a> The company, therefore, was made up of believing Jews and Greeks, among whom were some of the chief women.<a name=453:6></a> The apostle had to move on in his service, but he moved on with considerable concern as to the work at Thessalonica, lest he had laboured in vain.<a name=453:7></a> But the visit of Timothy brought to light that instead of his labour being in vain, it had been a great success.<a name=453:8></a> Not only had they believed savingly, but they had come to take account of each other in love.<a name=453:9></a> They had indeed taken form as an assembly, so that in writing to them Paul addresses them in that way, as an "assembly of Thessalonians", not a set of converts, but an assembly; they are addressed uniquely.<a name=453:10></a> There is no other company in the Scriptures addressed in this fashion, and it is because, as I understand it, that God would through

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one would not suggest that every saint is not beloved of God, because <i>we are</i>.<a name=454:3></a> Love in God rises above our ways, even as in Corinthians when their ways were fleshly.<a name=454:4></a> God loved the Corinthians, but Paul had to write to them in a corrective way.<a name=454:5></a> In the Thessalonians there was that which was <i>loveable</i>, and the exercise with one is as to whether one is loveable.<a name=454:6></a> Love in God takes account of each one, and sets itself upon us, even though unlovely in many respects, but this epistle indicates a state of loveliness in youthful Christians.<a name=454:7></a> In this letter, therefore, God lets us into His thoughts as to what He looks for in young believers, and one is free to address oneself to young believers.<a name=454:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that John in writing his first letter addresses himself to believers under three heads.<a name=454:9></a> The first set are called fathers, then he addresses young men, and then finally little children.<a name=454:10></a> The whole letter could be read by either set.<a name=454:11></a> I have no doubt the fathers could enjoy what was said to the little ones, and said to the young men, and thus the fathers would get more out of the letter than the little ones; but the little ones were not forgotten, and they are addressed as a class; and God has a great deal in the freshness and vigour that mark the young believer normally; He looks for it.<a name=454:12></a> If you have lost it through years, and grey hairs have come, He has not forgotten it; He says, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:2">Jeremiah  2:2</a>).<a name=454:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Thessalonians correspond in that way with the beginnings of Israel's history.<a name=454:14></a> We see in them the kindness of youth, and the love of espousals, and so I desire to dwell for a moment upon them

		It is a great thing to get a good start, and so you find it says in John that the Lord went away beyond the Jordan to the place where John baptised at first, and many believed on him <i>there</i>.<a name=455:4></a> See <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:40">John  10:40</a> - 42.<a name=455:5></a> That was a good place to believe on Him, where John baptised <i>at the first</i>.<a name=455:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an immense thing to get a right apprehension of God in Christ, for that is what this epistle indicates; it is God, but God in Christ.<a name=455:7></a> The light of the knowledge of God in Christ shone into their hearts, and they turned to that God.<a name=455:8></a> God came before their souls, and they turned to Him from idols, and then further it says, "to await his Son from the heavens".<a name=455:9></a> It was <i>God's</i> Son.<a name=455:10></a> You see how the babes are set up in the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, and the Christ who has made God known is His Son, not <i>the</i> Son, but <i>His</i> Son.<a name=455:11></a> You are thus in the light of holy relationships, the Father and the Son.<a name=455:12></a> As I said, many believed on Him where John baptised at the first.<a name=455:13></a> The first principles were dominant there, and so, as John says to the little ones, "If what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, <i>ye</i> also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:24">1 John  2:24</a>).<a name=455:14></a> That is how the little ones are set up, so that these Thessalonians, young believers as they were, had the Father, and they had the Son, and hence the work of faith; that is the next thing.<a name=455:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the picture the Spirit of God gives us of a company of Christians a few weeks old.<a name=456:11></a> And the apostle goes on in chapter 3 to introduce the subject of holiness, which I would dwell on for a moment.<a name=456:12></a> If you have life in activity the great thing is to give it a lead.<a name=456:13></a> Life springs up of itself, the principle of it is spontaneity, but it has to get a lead.<a name=456:14></a> There has to be formation, the growth has to be according to the pattern.<a name=456:15></a> So the apostle is that pattern primarily, and then the Lord Jesus, and then God Himself.<a name=456:16></a> And one of the most serious considerations I know of today for the elder brethren is that so many young ones are coming on.<a name=456:17></a> What kind of pattern are we setting?<a name=456:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the apostle calls attention in chapter 2 to what he was amongst them.<a name=456:19></a> He cared for them as a nurse her own children.<a name=456:20></a> We may be sure, as elder ones, that God holds us accountable for what has come to us.<a name=456:21></a> What comes to us has not come from our children but from our fathers.<a name=456:22></a> It has come in that way; "the father to the children shall make known thy truth" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:19">Isaiah  38:19</a>).<a name=456:23></a> Therefore it is a question for those who are elders as to whether we are exponents of what has come down to us.<a name=456:24></a>

		These young believers became models because they were patterned on a model.<a name=457:1></a> Who was the model?<a name=457:2></a> Paul was the model.<a name=457:3></a> "<i>Ye</i> became our imitators, and of the Lord".<a name=457:4></a> As they imitated the one through whom the light came, he passed them on to Christ.<a name=457:5></a> That is the principle of a model.<a name=457:6></a> This is important, dear brethren; it has to be taken up; God is graciously working, and young ones are getting light, and taking their stand with the saints; what about models for them?<a name=457:7></a> You say, Christ is the Model; thank God!<a name=457:8></a> He is, the Same yesterday, today, and to the ages to come, but He is in heaven.<a name=457:9></a> So the apostle John says, "I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning".<a name=457:10></a> To the little ones he says, "if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you: <i>ye</i> also shall abide in the Son and in the Father", but to the fathers he says, "ye have known him that is from the beginning".<a name=457:11></a> We are to be models as acquainted with Him; not simply with <i>that</i> which is from the beginning, but with <i>Him</i>.<a name=457:12></a> It is the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Himself as from the beginning, that constitutes us models for others, and so the apostle calls attention to the fact that he regarded the Thessalonians as did a nurse her own children.<a name=457:13></a> That is to say, he exercised the skill of the nurse with the affections of the mother.<a name=457:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may be sure that this is necessary at the present time.<a name=457:15></a> The young are coming in (thank God for it!<a name=457:16></a>), but the great point is the model, and then he goes on to say that he was like a nursing father.<a name=457:17></a> There was in his service in those few weeks among them the instincts of the mother and the skill of the nurse, the maternal side; but there was also the paternal side.<a name=457:18></a> So that he says, "as a father his own children" we admonished every one of you.<a name=457:19></a> And then he says, You became imitators of <i>God</i>, and lastly of 'the <i>assemblies of God</i>'.<a name=457:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=458>[Page 458]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I mention these facts for the young, because they show the development of life in us, and I would specially call attention to the imitation of assemblies, for we are so sectional and so national.<a name=458:1></a> Now the Thessalonians were Greeks, most of them, and as Greeks naturally prejudiced against the Jews.<a name=458:2></a> But the evidence of life was so present with them that the normal effect of it was that they overcame their national instincts, and they became "imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus".<a name=458:3></a> They might have gone elsewhere for assemblies to pattern themselves on, but the apostle says "<i>ye</i>, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus".<a name=458:4></a> These assemblies were not established by Paul, but doubtless, by the labours of the twelve.<a name=458:5></a> There is not much evidence that the Thessalonians knew Peter and John and James, so that there was clear evidence of the power of life, in that they overcame all national feeling and instincts, and so on, in order to pattern themselves on assemblies so far away as Judaea.<a name=458:6></a> There is in it the catholic principle which one feels is so important, because God in these days is calling attention to His house.<a name=458:7></a> The house of God naturally extends beyond all national boundaries, it includes all the saints, and the Thessalonians, young though they were, understood how to overcome national or social prejudices in imitation of the assemblies of God; <i>God</i> was their link.<a name=458:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The element of holiness is introduced, and I would remark on it for the young, because in our beginnings as believers our motives are apt to be very mixed; hence the importance of understanding holiness.<a name=458:9></a> We have the word in chapter 3, "the Lord make you to exceed and abound in love one toward another, and toward all, even as we also towards you, in order to the confirming of your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father, at the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints".<a name=459:1></a> The element of holiness must be present, and this leads me to say a word about Israel in the wilderness, because as the people took their position before mount Sinai in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>, the question of holiness necessarily arose.<a name=459:2></a> God was proposing to dwell with them, and if He is to dwell it must be according to His nature.<a name=459:3></a> Righteousness is present, and righteousness judges sin with authority; it faces sin, and deals with it.<a name=459:4></a> We have to learn that.<a name=459:5></a> It says, "The body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>).<a name=459:6></a> There is no more important lesson to learn, than that we have the Holy Spirit in view of righteousness; in the power of His presence we can judge sin with authority.<a name=459:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then holiness repels it, <i>shrinks</i> from sin, it shrinks from evil, hence God sets up an enclosure in which He is to dwell, but He is to dwell there in holiness, in holy love.<a name=459:8></a> The Lord Jesus is presented to us in the epistle to the Corinthians as bringing in the love of God to our hearts.<a name=459:9></a> The apostle says, God had made him and others competent as ministers, not of the letter, but of spirit, for letter kills, but the Spirit quickens.<a name=459:10></a> And he says, "Now the Lord is the Spirit".<a name=459:11></a> I would like you to understand that the Lord Jesus has not only made love effective in dying, He has not only attested it in His death, but He makes it effective in our souls.<a name=459:12></a> One of the most precious services the Lord renders to us at the present time is to make the love of God effective in our souls.<a name=459:13></a> In dying He said "Thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:3">Psalm  22:3</a>).<a name=459:14></a> He did not forget that God was dealing in righteousness.<a name=459:15></a> He was dealing authoritatively in righteousness when Jesus died, but He was dealing in holiness, and the Lord recognised that.<a name=459:16></a> He says, "Thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel".<a name=459:17></a> He said that on the cross.<a name=459:18></a> How then is He to praise in the

		midst of the assembly, to praise such a God as that?<a name=460:1></a> How, except by bringing the holy love of God into our hearts, so that we not only judge sin but we abhor it, we recoil from it.<a name=460:2></a> There is already in our souls by the administration of Christ, in the gift of the Spirit, a holy love.<a name=460:3></a> The love of God in us is a holy love -- "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given unto us" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>).<a name=460:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in virtue therefore of the administration of Christ, the love of God being shed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit, that we are constituted suited for the abode of God.<a name=460:5></a> And in keeping with that there is the administration of the Father, the Father of our spirits: "Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?<a name=460:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:9">Hebrews  12:9</a>).<a name=460:7></a> But how live?<a name=460:8></a> Live in holiness, so that we are chastened by the Father of spirits that we should live in holiness.<a name=460:9></a> Then it adds, without holiness no man shall see the Lord.<a name=460:10></a> Difficulties will arise, crises come up among the saints.<a name=460:11></a> Who knows His way?<a name=460:12></a> He who has holiness, and he who has holiness sees the Lord.<a name=460:13></a> It is a question of where the Lord is in the crisis, and who sees Him but he who has holiness so, beloved, the importance of holiness in a practical way is apparent, but it is specially apparent at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so he says, "You, may the Lord make to exceed and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also towards you, in order to the confirming of your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints".<a name=460:14></a> What a word that is!<a name=460:15></a> To have our hearts confirmed in holiness, confirmed in it, at a time when we shall need it -- that is to say, when the Lord comes with all His saints, for He is coming with them <i>all</i>.<a name=460:16></a> This thought appeared very early in Scripture, for it is said by Jude that Enoch prophesied of the Lord coming with the "holy

		Now I pass on to Ephesians, because we have there the full thought of God for us, and what you will see in Ephesians is that it is a question of what is <i>before the foundation of the world</i>.<a name=461:4></a> I do not suppose any one of us can take in the idea of eternity, I know we cannot, and God takes account of that.<a name=461:5></a> It is something to be realised, not defined, nor compassed, and so we have "before" here, as it says, "according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation".<a name=461:6></a> We are thus led into the thought of God in regard of us; He had in view that He should have an inheritance.<a name=461:7></a> I do not know of anything so interesting to contemplate as God's inheritance.<a name=461:8></a> The apostle recognising the difficulty of saints laying hold of it prays to the God of our ford Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.<a name=461:9></a> I would that I could convey to you something about that, the Father of glory.<a name=461:10></a> He prays to Him, that the saints might have the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.<a name=461:11></a> Not revelation, but the <i>spirit</i> of it in the knowledge of Him, "that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints".<a name=461:12></a>
