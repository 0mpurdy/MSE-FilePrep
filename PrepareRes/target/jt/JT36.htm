		I wish to speak, dear brethren, about the Holy Spirit as presented in this gospel, which treats of the Spirit in a way that fits in with its teaching, each gospel having its own feature.<a name=1:2></a> The gospels, taken as a whole, present the truth in a four-sided way, and no one has the truth according to God, save as he understands this full presentation of it.<a name=1:3></a> Matthew has in mind the great pressure involved in connection with the declaration of God in this world; those who espouse it are contemplated as facing very great pressure of opposition, and, among other things, the Spirit is presented in such wise as to fortify them in meeting the opposition and in enduring till the end.<a name=1:4></a> The pressure inevitably comes, and the Holy Spirit is presented with this in view.<a name=1:5></a> I have, therefore, read from the last chapter first, because it presents the position we occupy, that is, all believers today, who, as loving the Lord Jesus, care for His interests: the verse presents the position of the gentiles, those of us who are of the nations.<a name=1:6></a> Indeed, we have to see that now the supporters of the testimony of God are from among the nations almost exclusively; there are very few Jews.<a name=1:7></a> You will all remember how the apostle Paul, in arriving at Rome, called for the Jews; it was the end of the great testimony to God's patience towards them; they went away reasoning amongst themselves, Paul having said "one word" to them quoting <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6">Isaiah  6</a>-- saying the salvation of God was now sent to the gentiles, and, he added, "they also will hear it" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#28:28">Acts  28:28</a>.<a name=1:8></a> Thank God, they have received it, and many, if not all of us here, and thousands elsewhere, are today interested in the testimony of God.<a name=1:9></a> It is well to have in mind how it has come to us: for it has come, not

		only as a matter of light, but as a matter of <i>influence</i>, an element of great importance with God.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the very outset of His operations the idea of influence was pronounced, the whole physical system being involved in it, one body influencing another and all held together thus according to true proportions.<a name=2:2></a> John deals with influence in an astronomical sense, but Matthew contemplates it as among men, he contemplates it both in a good sense and in a bad sense.<a name=2:3></a> From Shinar onwards we see men combining in order to enhance or increase, their influence.<a name=2:4></a> To meet this Matthew would promote combination in a spiritual sense amongst the people of God.<a name=2:5></a> The influence that the saints have in this world is very much more than we are apt to think.<a name=2:6></a> God rules governmentally in this world on account of His people, for He loves His people, and all that transpires is regulated in relation to the testimony which they render.<a name=2:7></a> God acts angelically in this way, and with the most powerful results, for we could not subsist in this world as espousing the testimony of God, aside from the mighty forces that are at work outside of ourselves in our favour.<a name=2:8></a> As it says of angels, "Are they not <i>all</i> ministering spirits sent out for service?<a name=2:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:14">Hebrews  1:14</a>).<a name=2:10></a> Think of these vast numbers of ministering spirits!<a name=2:11></a> It is quite clear, therefore, that the angels are not spectators merely of what goes on here, they are in commission, "on account of those who shall inherit salvation" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:14">Hebrews  1:14</a>.<a name=2:12></a> But then there is the great influence that the people of God themselves exert in this world: there is <i>He</i> who lets, or hinders, and <i>that</i> which hinders the great anti-christian development.<a name=2:13></a> Is it not so, that in this great centre the people of God are holding in check the forces of evil?<a name=2:14></a> It <i>is</i> so.<a name=2:15></a> The combination of our prayers and moral influence in moving about among men effects much in holding back the forces of evil; a matter to be taken to heart because God would have us to understand that our presence in this world is used in that connection.<a name=2:16></a> So in this last chapter in the

		gospel of Matthew the Lord directs His disciples -- not to preach, for He does not say anything about preaching here (I do not say He did not have in mind that they should preach, Mark provides for that) -- but here it is, "make disciples of all the nations" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>.<a name=3:1></a> Now, dear brethren, I speak thus because it is well to bear in mind that whilst it is intended that we should influence, we have ourselves been helped into the position we occupy in relation to God and to Christ and to one another, by influence.<a name=3:2></a> Our position, therefore, is not only the result of light through the preached word, but of influence, The relation of the Spirit to all this in this gospel is obvious.<a name=3:3></a> Being influenced, and thus brought into the wonderful position that we are in, baptised "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>, there is suggested to us the means of our being held in this position.<a name=3:4></a> Divine Persons are presented objectively, even the Holy Spirit is not presented in a subjective way in this verse.<a name=3:5></a> It is a marvellous position into which the nations have been introduced and God would have us to understand it.<a name=3:6></a> "Baptising them", says the Lord "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>: that is the great environment into which we have been introduced, but as having been <i>made</i> disciples, as persons influenced by what the ministers were themselves, those through whom the light came.<a name=3:7></a> One can gather what they were, because in this gospel we have the idea that the apostles were "made" under the hand of Christ for their service.<a name=3:8></a> Hence Matthew closes with this objective position into which we hay been baptised, but baptised as having been influenced, as made disciples.<a name=3:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I want to show in detail, how the Holy Spirit as thus presented, takes a place in this gospel of peculiar activity in service.<a name=3:10></a> I feel it impressed upon me to stress the idea of the position He occupies, in this great environment in which we are set; He stands in relation to the Father and to the Son.<a name=3:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having dwelt on the Spirit thus presented objectively, to be understood and known and regarded as a divine Person, I proceed to say something about the other scriptures.<a name=4:1></a> What helps me is that the Holy Spirit is presented in Scripture as active from the very outset.<a name=4:2></a> We have no formal change of form in Him, He is presented at the outset as "the Spirit of God" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:2">Genesis  1:2</a>.<a name=4:3></a> If we take later utterances, He was employed in the garnishing of the heavens, and <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>presents Him as moving, or hovering, over the face of the waters -- but <i>He</i> was doing it, it was the Spirit of God!<a name=4:4></a> There is no idea suggested of any change of form, He is the Spirit of <i>God</i>.<a name=4:5></a> He is moving as expressing God, He is no less than God, the Spirit of God can be no less than God; it is God acting out of the exigencies of His holy nature.<a name=4:6></a> He is not explaining yet, explanation will come, but the telling fact is that He has taken up a position feelingly, and looking towards benign operations.<a name=4:7></a> He is hovering over the face of the waters, having in view all this wonderful development with which we are now conversant.<a name=4:8></a> And so in wonderful feeling God says, "My spirit shall not always strive with Man" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:3">Genesis  6:3</a>) -- "my spirit", it was <i>God</i>.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said so much as to the Old Testament, we come to this gospel, which is the beginning of the New, rightly so, and what we find is the same thing.<a name=4:10></a> A wonderful condition had taken place and the Holy Spirit is seen at once in relation to that.<a name=4:11></a> There is no previous announcement of the birth of Christ, as in Luke, no angelic visitation beforehand.<a name=4:12></a> The wonderful fact is that He is there, it is "of the Holy Spirit" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:18">Matthew  1:18</a>.<a name=4:13></a> It is the most marvellous fact that could be, involving, as it does, redemption; the most transcendently marvellous fact that could be conceived or which could occur, is related in this simple verse (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:18">Matthew  1:18</a>) and the explanation is, that it was <i>of the Spirit of God</i>.<a name=4:14></a> It is not now "the holy thing" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>, but the "child", a definite formation of the Spirit of God; the utmost pains being

		taken to make the position legal in regard of Israel, but at the same time to make clear that what was transpiring was of the Spirit of God.<a name=5:1></a> The Holy Spirit had operated and there was the tangible result -- that is the thing to see.<a name=5:2></a> That is the beginning of the New Testament, a much greater thing than explanation; the actual fact had occurred by the power of the Spirit, and the light given to Joseph confirmed it.<a name=5:3></a> One would love to able to enlarge on this; it is a marvellous matter.<a name=5:4></a> The enemy of our souls and of the testimony would becloud the magnitude of this wonderful transaction -- incarnation.<a name=5:5></a> We have two accounts, one in Luke and the other here: Luke's account is preceded by an angelic visitation, but not so here, where it is to bring in the great transcendent fact, that the thing which was happening was by the Spirit of God.<a name=5:6></a> And the Child was to be called "Emmanuel", "God with us" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:23">Matthew  1:23</a>.<a name=5:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to go on to chapter 3 to show the bearing of the Spirit's operations in regard of Christ as baptised.<a name=5:8></a> He is now about to enter on His service and He goes up out of the water.<a name=5:9></a> What wonderful grace in the Lord to enter into the water!<a name=5:10></a> Against the forbidding word of John He enters into the water, saying, "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:15">Matthew  3:15</a>.<a name=5:11></a> What quality there was there!<a name=5:12></a> Let us understand, that the Holy Spirit in this narrative has also ourselves in view as baptised.<a name=5:13></a> Baptism has become a mere empty rite abroad in the world; it is indeed a feature of the world, it has become enshrouded in darkness, with no idea of righteousness underlying it.<a name=5:14></a> The One baptised in Matthew, says, "it becometh us fulfil <i>all</i> righteousness" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:15">Matthew  3:15</a>; baptism has that in view; and we can see that "made" disciples are persons who understand that righteousness has to be fulfilled.<a name=5:15></a> Of what value is baptism aside from righteousness?<a name=5:16></a> It has no value.<a name=5:17></a> So, if we are to stand, as this gospel intimates, we are made disciples, and we profess righteousness and practise it, we seek to "fulfil all righteousness" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:15">Matthew  3:15</a>.<a name=5:18></a> Many of us, alas!<a name=5:19></a> whilst we have the idea of righteousness,

		limit it, we make our own standard, but not so Jesus -- He fulfils "all righteousness" -- and that Person looks up and He sees the Holy Spirit.<a name=6:1></a> I believe a great defect with us is, that we do not see what happens at the outset, and the secret of weakness is the want of righteousness in entering on our christian course.<a name=6:2></a> How perfectly the principle of "all righteousness" was wrought out on the cross in that blessed One as He said -- as He does in this gospel -- "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=6:3></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:46">Matthew  27:46</a>.<a name=6:4></a> If I am to be clothed with divine righteousness, it is as appreciating righteousness in Christ.<a name=6:5></a> So He sees the Holy Spirit coming down as a dove upon Him, and there is a voice, saying, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>.<a name=6:6></a> That is the position, and I think you will see that it stands on the principle of righteousness.<a name=6:7></a> There can be no disciples made save on that principle, the principle of righteousness.<a name=6:8></a> As I said, the baptism abroad today is a mere travesty of the truth, the element of righteousness is divorced from it, and thus the foundation has gone.<a name=6:9></a> The Lord would bring us back to the true foundation.<a name=6:10></a> If the thing that we are brought into is to stand practically, there must be the great principle in our souls of "all righteousness"; then we shall see -- there will be vision to see, the Holy Spirit's activity, and the pleasure of heaven.<a name=6:11></a> What can be more precious than the sense of the Father's pleasure, first in Christ, and now also in the saints?<a name=6:12></a> It is in relation to the waters of death that He says, "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:15">Matthew  3:15</a>.<a name=6:13></a>

		So in the next chapter He is carried up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, and with this I propose to connect the verses read in chapter 12 so that we may consider the array of evil with which we are faced.<a name=6:14></a> What combinations of evil there are in this world!<a name=6:15></a> And there is special opposition to those who, as seeking to walk in separation from evil, recognise Christ and the assembly.<a name=6:16></a> Let us not assume that if

		Well now, to indicate to you what the nature of the opposition is, I refer for a moment to the two demoniacs -- they are symbolic of the opposition in this gospel.<a name=8:12></a> There were <i>two</i> of them (suggestive of a combination), and they were so fierce that no one could pass that way.<a name=8:13></a> But then, if the way has to be passed, we <i>must</i> pass it, and if we are to pass it, we must understand how to fight and have courage to do so.<a name=8:14></a> We cannot turn aside -- the lion "turneth not away for any" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:30">Proverbs  30:30</a>.<a name=8:15></a> The psalmist says, "The Lord .<a name=8:16></a>.<a name=8:17></a>.<a name=8:18></a> teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#144:1">Psalm  144:1</a>).<a name=8:19></a> You will say I am seeking to enlist you for the army!<a name=8:20></a> I am.<a name=8:21></a> I know what I am saying, I know that one attack after another will come, and this gospel teaches us how to meet it.<a name=8:22></a> Let the

		There is that demoniacal combination -- no one can pass by that way (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:28">Matthew  8:28</a>).<a name=9:2></a> But the Lord Jesus cast out the demons.<a name=9:3></a> How did He cast them out?<a name=9:4></a> By the Spirit of God, as He tells us in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:28">Matthew  12:28</a>.<a name=9:5></a> It is only by the Spirit of God we can rightly meet evil, beloved brethren.<a name=9:6></a> The great military man of the Old Testament -- Joshua -- was nominated by Jehovah with this commendation: "A man in whom is the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:18">Numbers  27:18</a>).<a name=9:7></a> Joshua is the great military man before David, and he has the Spirit as Jehovah says.<a name=9:8></a> If I smell the battle afar off, I am ready: having the Spirit I know how to deal with the evil intelligently and in power.<a name=9:9></a> And so the Lord says in chapter 12: "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom God is come upon you" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:28">Matthew  12:28</a>.<a name=9:10></a> The kingdom of God, therefore, is not a mere ideal conception, it is a real thing.<a name=9:11></a> The expression is seldom used in Matthew -- the kingdom of the heavens is more general there.<a name=9:12></a> The kingdom of God is what is <i>here</i> where the evil is: the kingdom of heaven is what is <i>there</i>, the rule and influence of heaven on the earth.<a name=9:13></a> But the kingdom of God is what here in a powerful way: it "is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:17">Romans  14:17</a>).<a name=9:14></a> It is a real thing, no kingdom more real and practical ever existed than the kingdom of God.<a name=9:15></a> I often picture to myself that wonderful setting out of the divine position in the tabernacle in the wilderness -- Jehovah within, surrounded by the hosts of Israel.<a name=9:16></a> God Himself was there; the armies of Israel were there surrounding the camp, but <i>God was there</i> -- precious fact!<a name=9:17></a> So with the kingdom of God, the Spirit of God is down here available to the believer in meeting evil; as the Lord says, "If <i>I</i> by the Spirit of God cast out demons then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon

		I come back now to the baptism of the Spirit -- the positive side.<a name=11:2></a> I am sure you will all follow with pleasure as one turns from dealing with evil, which is a necessity, to dealing with good.<a name=11:3></a> In chapter 3 John the baptist says of Jesus that He would baptise "with the Holy Spirit and fire" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:11">Matthew  3:11</a>.<a name=11:4></a> Here we have a positive service rendered by the Lord to those who believe.<a name=11:5></a> He baptises with the Holy Spirit, and that fact underlies the church.<a name=11:6></a> There can be no realisation of chapters 16 and 17 until we understand this baptising with the Holy Spirit.<a name=11:7></a> It means that all the natural traits that can distinguish us amongst the brethren, have to go.<a name=11:8></a> We see they have to go, but the Lord deals with them in the most gracious way.<a name=11:9></a> The waters of baptism ought to have taught us that they have to go, it is a matter of righteousness; but the baptism of the Spirit implies that they are dealt with effectively.<a name=11:10></a> Fire accompanied it here -- a sure means to make it effective.<a name=11:11></a> It is a solemn thing that the fire is added here, but as we look back -- any of us who have tasted it and proved the gain of it -- we thank God for the fire.<a name=11:12></a> He baptises with the Holy Spirit as Paul says elsewhere, "in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>).<a name=11:13></a> This, as I said, lies at the foundation of the church in a practical sense.<a name=11:14></a> I know Christ is the foundation, but in a practical sense, we are merged by the Lord, it is His own doing; and a precious service it is to so merge us together that all the natural distinctions in which we pride ourselves disappear.<a name=11:15></a> And how?<a name=11:16></a> As baptised "into one body".<a name=11:17></a> It is not like Romans, where we are just said to be one body in Christ, that is we have that status in this world -- we are not Freemasons or the like, but are one body in Christ -- but in 1 Corinthians, we are all baptised by one Spirit into one body.<a name=11:18></a>

		I wish to speak about the Holy Spirit, encouraged in the assurance that there will be not only a readiness to hear, but a measure of capacity for taking in any thoughts presented as to Him.<a name=14:1></a> I believe that it is of God to emphasise the presence of the Spirit.<a name=14:2></a> Indeed, it has occurred to me of late that it would be a profitable inquiry to see how He is presented in each of the books of Scripture; and with this in view I have ventured to take up Luke, so that we might see how the Holy Spirit mentions Himself in this book.<a name=14:3></a> For we have to bear in mind that whilst the Lord says of Him, "he shall not speak from himself" <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:13">John  16:13</a>, that does not mean that He does not refer to Himself, for in truth He is the subject of testimony, as the Father is, and as the Son is.<a name=14:4></a> Indeed, we are said to be baptised to the name of "the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>, so that He has His own place in the testimony.<a name=14:5></a> I thought that the consideration of Luke, in this regard, would help us as to the dispensation viewed as in grace.<a name=14:6></a>

		Luke is concerned as to how the gospel should reach men; the vessels through whom it should come; and so you find with him great prominence given to heaven, that the gospel should come to men clothed with heavenly influence.<a name=14:7></a> Hence, he introduces at once a great heavenly dignitary; for it was to be expected, we being what we are, that in the service of the gospel there would arise a desire for personal distinction in it, such as painfully manifested itself at Corinth.<a name=14:8></a> So Luke would introduce the idea of personal dignity in Gabriel.<a name=14:9></a> Who of those at Corinth could measure up with him?<a name=14:10></a> The apostle in speaking to them refers to "the tongues of .<a name=14:11></a>.<a name=14:12></a>.<a name=14:13></a> angels" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13:1">1 Corinthians  13:1</a>, but here we have at the outset presented to us, not simply an angel, but a heavenly dignitary.<a name=14:14></a>

		Now I wanted to dwell upon the Spirit, as I said, and what impresses one at first is the <i>filling</i> by Him of persons.<a name=15:5></a> Indeed, Luke throws out at the beginning a sort of atmosphere which would disallow all corruption and render null all fleshly taint.<a name=15:6></a> The incoming of the Saviour was to be guarded thus; and so we have a remarkable set of vessels filled with the Holy Spirit; thus shutting out from the environment of the Lord's birth all taint of contamination; for a group of persons appear, <i>filled</i> with the Holy Spirit.<a name=15:7></a> It is an important matter; for a half-filled, or partly filled vessel is sure to be contaminated.<a name=15:8></a> Hence you find the first mention of the Spirit in this gospel is that He fills a person from the very outset of his being -- John the baptist -- a marvellous thing!<a name=15:9></a> There may be an inquiry as to its possibility; but how else can we explain the movements of an unborn babe, as the sound of the voice of the mother of Christ falls upon the ears of his mother?<a name=15:10></a> What can be the thought, but of wonderful divine preparation, so that the incoming of our Saviour in such lowliness and outward weakness, should be so greeted

		My thought is to speak of the Holy Spirit as seen in this epistle; and what one would say to all, and especially to young believers, is that the best Friend we have on earth is the Spirit of God, answering to what is in heaven; for what is there is here in principle; we can never limit a divine Person.<a name=85:2></a> So that in the presence of the Holy Spirit here we have, as I said, our best Friend on earth.<a name=85:3></a> It is important that He should be regarded in a personal way, that believers should become acquainted with the Holy Spirit.<a name=85:4></a> The Lord in His communications of love to His own at the supper table in Jerusalem, ere He died, spoke much of the Spirit as <i>another</i> Comforter; One who, by the term He uses, was to be known as taking charge of the affairs of the saints here.<a name=85:5></a> He spoke of Him as the Spirit of truth, sent by the Father in answer to His begging for Him; He spoke of Him as sent forth in the Son's name by the Father; He spoke of Him as proceeding forth from with the Father, meaning that He had perfect first-hand knowledge of the Father's thoughts about the Son, the Son being the subject of testimony, the Spirit should bear witness of Him; and then, the Lord would Himself send Him.<a name=85:6></a> As the Spirit of truth comes, He brings into this world a demonstration of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.<a name=85:7></a> You see, therefore, a divine Person is here, and His functions are in relation to the saints, He is <i>another</i> Comforter.<a name=85:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak about the Holy Spirit in relation to our <i>hearts</i>.<a name=86:5></a> The heart is a sphere in which you would expect Him to be especially interested, for God would secure His people through their hearts; through their intelligence, of course, but the highest intelligence is through the eyes of the heart; the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God is through the "eyes of your heart" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:18">Ephesians  1:18</a>).<a name=86:6></a> Hence the importance of recognising this first service of the Spirit.<a name=86:7></a> He knows that the end in view in the gospel is a heart matter; and so, in the type in Exodus that is what God would stress in speaking to His people.<a name=86:8></a> He says, "I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:4">Exodus  19:4</a>).<a name=86:9></a> This was after they had murmured, after they had complained, after they had talked about going back into Egypt.<a name=86:10></a> God knowing well our proclivities and how the things of the world cling to us, even after our conversion, delivers us out of them, bearing us on eagles' wings to Himself.<a name=86:11></a> What marks His early dealings with the people after they had passed through the Red Sea, after they had sung of His victory, is grace: on their side one complaint after another, but no reproofs, no punitive action on the part of God: it was the reign of grace; it was the era of grace.<a name=86:12></a>

		And then immediately Amalek attacks them, and the whole divine system, we may say, is engaged to give victory to the believer; for that is the idea.<a name=87:7></a> Moses and Aaron and Hur and Joshua, are all actively engaged, so that the believer, as having the Holy Spirit, should prove His power.<a name=87:8></a> The intercession of Christ on high in Moses, and the skill of Christ as a warrior in Joshua, are brought into action, so that the beginnings of the believer, as possessed of the Spirit, should be marked by victory; that the young believer should get a <i>taste</i> of it, and as he gets a taste, the thing will increase.<a name=87:9></a> That is to say, what began in the type in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>ended in Joshua, in the people being set in possession of the land.<a name=87:10></a> It was the same power, but in increased measure; and it is continually increasing, for there is no limit.<a name=87:11></a> It is a divine power here, given without measure.<a name=87:12></a>

		Now I pass on to chapter 8, a chapter, thank God, much read, and I hope understood; so that I do not intend to go into the details of the teaching relative to the Spirit, only that I would say that it answers in the types to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>and what follows.<a name=89:2></a> It is an experience well-nigh forty years after that of which I have spoken.<a name=89:3></a> But it is not contemplated that this should be the case with us.<a name=89:4></a> It is well, however, to note the number of years that elapsed between Horeb and Beer, the well of which it is said, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:16">Numbers  21:16</a>.<a name=89:5></a> It is well to note that; so that we might not be "objective" merely in our apprehension of the truth; but that we may see that while the objective side is presented to us in the gospel, to be received on the principle of faith, the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures would teach us that a time -- however short or long -- elapses between that and the full formation in us that corresponds with it.<a name=89:6></a> That as God worked on the principle of time in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, so He works on the principle of time in our souls; for we are still in time.<a name=89:7></a> Hence we find in Genesis that life does not appear till the third day.<a name=89:8></a> We have light on the first day; and then we have the heavens on the second day, all of which is what I may call objective; that is, what is <i>presented to</i> me, something outside of me, but which is intended to affect me and govern me.<a name=89:9></a>

		My subject, dear brethren, is the Spirit of God and of Christ, in this epistle of Peter.<a name=107:1></a> The understanding of the place He has in each book and epistle helps greatly in understanding the mind of God in it; and whilst references in Peter are not numerous, being covered practically by the passages read, they are very significant, especially as bearing on the government of God, as Peter's ministry does.<a name=107:2></a> In his epistle he directs our minds back to antediluvian times, and onward to the new heavens and the new earth in which righteousness dwells.<a name=107:3></a> I hope to show that the references to the Spirit enter into all this instruction; so that we may see that the testimony of God is one whole, and so also the government of God.<a name=107:4></a>

		I would stress the latter a little, because we are all subjects of it, but not always intelligently so, and thus much disappointment and discouragement enter into our experience.<a name=107:5></a> These would be eliminated were we more intelligent as to the government of God with us; for His government, like all else, is the outcome of what He is.<a name=107:6></a> Everything related to God proceeds from God, and God is love, so that His government is quite compatible with His nature.<a name=107:7></a> But the knowledge of the Spirit, as presented in these scriptures, enables us to link it up, whether it be in the entire extent of God's universal dealings or within the compass respectively of our own small histories.<a name=107:8></a> The knowledge of the Spirit and His part, enables us to understand, and to hear, and to profit, by what would otherwise appear to be against us.<a name=107:9></a> Jacob, as you will remember, thought that things were against him which in reality were for him, as intended to work out love in him.<a name=107:10></a> He, with certain other servants of whom we have life-sized pictures,

	<div class="paragraph">
		So Peter refers in the opening of his address to the "sojourners of the dispersion" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:1">1 Peter  1:1</a>.<a name=108:3></a> Why should they be dispersed?<a name=108:4></a> Why should they be where naturally they would not wish to be?<a name=108:5></a> Why should they not be in the land of promise?<a name=108:6></a> So it is, that in the government of God, we find ourselves in positions or circumstances contrary to our natural wishes.<a name=108:7></a> Perhaps there is not one in this audience who cannot attest to the reality of this.<a name=108:8></a> We have to learn from the outset that the government of God will not promote us in our natural thoughts and wishes and aspirations; it invariably cuts athwart these.<a name=108:9></a> So here the address is to the "sojourners of the dispersion".<a name=108:10></a> Dispersed where?<a name=108:11></a> Abroad among the nations.<a name=108:12></a> The land is not mentioned at all.<a name=108:13></a> Has then the love of God failed?<a name=108:14></a> Have the promises of God failed?<a name=108:15></a> Do my circumstances, which seem to be wholly different from my youthful aspirations, or my fondest desires, prove that love in God has failed?<a name=108:16></a> By no means!<a name=108:17></a> The Spirit of God addresses us in our <i>present</i> circumstances, whatever they may be.<a name=108:18></a> If they be such as we have worked ourselves into, by natural effort and manipulation, then the voice of the Spirit would be to leave them for they are not such as love would have me in; but if they be such as naturally I would recoil from, and as to which I have had no option, then evidently, the will of God has placed me in them, and I am safe, and God addresses me as "elect".<a name=108:19></a> Can I be safer, than as addressed as "elect .<a name=108:20></a>.<a name=108:21></a>.<a name=108:22></a> of God the Father" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>, although in circumstances which seem to be contrary to God, and to His love and a Father's best care?<a name=108:23></a> The fact is, that these circumstances which apparently are contrary and irksome, are the evidence of God's love and of His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as "elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>, it is not a matter of light merely, precious as is the light of the mind and election of God, and we should be well grounded in the thought of election, but light does not make it consciously certain.<a name=109:2></a> Our calling and election, according to Peter, are made sure by certain additions.<a name=109:3></a> "Add to your faith virtue" <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:5">2 Peter  1:5</a> and so on -- knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly love, love -- these things being in us and abounding, we shall never fail; we shall make our calling and election sure, and so an abundant entrance shall be ministered unto us into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name=109:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So here (verse 2), as is usual with Peter, he does not rest in light simply, but in substance.<a name=109:5></a> If I am called, foreknown, and elect of God the Father, it is by "sanctification of the Spirit" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>.<a name=109:6></a> That is the first thought.<a name=109:7></a> If we take the ground, as we should, in the government of God, as being foreknown and elect in Christ, it should not be merely because of light, but because of something tangible.<a name=109:8></a> The Holy Spirit is here to make things tangible.<a name=109:9></a> Faith indeed is said to be that; it is the "substantiating of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:1">Hebrews  11:1</a>).<a name=109:10></a> But without the Spirit, things can never be permanently real, and what God is forming is substance in His people.<a name=109:11></a> Then election is "by sanctification of the Spirit" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>.<a name=109:12></a> That is how Peter puts it.<a name=109:13></a> And so in his second epistle, if it be a question of what relates to godliness, "his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness"; and if He calls us, it is "by glory and virtue" <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:3">2 Peter  1:3</a>, and then he goes on to the "exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world" <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:4">2 Peter  1:4</a>.<a name=109:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see thus, that Peter in opening up to us the certainty of divine life deals in substance, in realities --

	<div class="paragraph">
		for these stand by us, if our calling and election are to be made sure to ourselves.<a name=110:1></a> And surely that is the point.<a name=110:2></a> It is a question of what is sure to us, not simply as a matter of light, but by these substantial things.<a name=110:3></a> So here, it is first by sanctification of the Spirit, and what for?<a name=110:4></a> "Unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>.<a name=110:5></a> You see how practical all this is; that the Lord Jesus entered into the sphere of divine government; He, who was ever in the position of command, took up the position of obedience, the position in which the government of God applied and in which the most perfect obedience was displayed in a Man, going on to the sprinkling of His blood, going on to death.<a name=110:6></a> That is to say, the Jewish christians are taken out of the realm of types and shadows -- "the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:13">Hebrews  9:13</a> -- and brought into the realm of the obedience of Jesus, and the sprinkling of His blood, and that as the outcome, mark you, of the sanctification of the Spirit.<a name=110:7></a> It is not simply that I have the Spirit.<a name=110:8></a> Peter, in his early ministry, made it plain that all who <i>obeyed</i> Christ, got the Spirit (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:32">Acts  5:32</a>), but now he is speaking, not of obtaining the Spirit, but of being sanctified by it, to this supreme thought of God, the obedience of Jesus.<a name=110:9></a> God has that standard before Him, and the Holy Spirit is operating in the believer so that he might be sanctified "unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>.<a name=110:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this is a most important matter, dear brethren.<a name=110:11></a> God has given us light (we can praise Him for it) but what He is looking for is substance in answer to it.<a name=110:12></a> Wisdom causes those who love her to inherit substance, but it is by the Spirit.<a name=110:13></a> What, in this sense, is substantial is by the Spirit, not simply by light.<a name=110:14></a> Light goes a long way and causes joy, as we see with Miriam and the women of Israel (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>).<a name=110:15></a> They represent the subjective effect in the believer of light.<a name=110:16></a> Miriam dies, according to the record of <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>, and in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>the Spirit typically appears as the means of permanent

		refreshment and support.<a name=111:1></a> Miriam's refrain was very little; it was but the first two lines of the song of Moses and the children of Israel, but it was something.<a name=111:2></a> But she dies, and what follows upon that is the <i>recognition</i> typically of the Spirit of God by Israel: "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:17">Numbers  21:17</a>.<a name=111:3></a> The well was dug "by the direction of the lawgiver" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:18">Numbers  21:18</a>.<a name=111:4></a> That is to say, it is a question of <i>obedience</i>.<a name=111:5></a> The princes digged the well -- those who knew the value of the Spirit.<a name=111:6></a> As soon as I begin to recognise the Spirit in this way, the sanctification begins to take place unto the obedience of Jesus.<a name=111:7></a> That is what goes into the land; it is the result of the sanctification of the Spirit.<a name=111:8></a> This is a practical word for the young people, because it is not only that I have the Spirit, but I am sanctified.<a name=111:9></a> Much might be said about sanctification, but I confine myself to this: that the Spirit taking hold of the believer inwardly, in his intelligence and affections, separates him from the world and attaches him to Christ.<a name=111:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing, in the order of the scriptures read, is the "Spirit of Christ", and the Spirit of Christ, not as given at the present time, but as in the prophets.<a name=111:11></a> As I have already remarked, I wish to show how the Spirit links us up, in this ministry of Peter, with the past and with the future.<a name=111:12></a> Take for instance, "For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:6">1 Peter  4:6</a>).<a name=111:13></a> Why was it preached to the dead?<a name=111:14></a> It was not surely as dead in their graves, but when they were here in responsibility -- for that is a feature of Peter's ministry; he shows that the preaching of Christ extended back, even to antediluvian times.<a name=111:15></a> Whoever the persons used in the testimony it was no less than the Spirit of Christ -- even Christ Himself, according to <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:19">1 Peter  3:19</a>.<a name=111:16></a> The gospel preached to those that are now dead was "that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:6">1 Peter  4:6</a>.<a name=111:17></a> God is a Spirit, and the gospel is preached that men might live in the Spirit.<a name=111:18></a> The millennial day will be marked

		Now we have the Holy Spirit "sent from heaven", but the preaching went on before, and when we come to chapter 3, we find that Christ, in Spirit, went back even before the deluge.<a name=112:12></a> I want to impress upon you, that as we are brought into the realm of divine government, we are linked up vitally, with the whole scheme of divine testimony; that the Spirit that we have, is the Spirit that operated before the deluge and after the deluge -- that operates now, and will operate, so that we might make room for Him; and that we might not only be in the realm of God's government, but the realm of His love, and the realm of the Spirit.<a name=112:13></a> See how love enters into all these operations from the very outset, and that in all God's operations

		There is a further thing in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:12">1 Peter  1:12</a>, and that is "the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven"; not now presented as the Spirit of Christ, but formally, as a divine Person here.<a name=114:17></a> Think of the magnitude of the preaching, of "the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven"!<a name=114:18></a> <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:12">1 Peter  1:12</a>.<a name=114:19></a> And what a word for every one standing up to preach the gospel -- whether he does so by "the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven"!<a name=114:20></a> The principle of being "sent" enters into the preaching.<a name=114:21></a> "How shall they preach except they be sent?<a name=114:22></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:15">Romans  10:15</a>).<a name=114:23></a> All this enters into the action of the Spirit in the preaching.<a name=114:24></a> As Peter stood upon the day of Pentecost, it was with the eleven,

		Well now, the final thing is in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:14">1 Peter  4:14</a>, where it is a question of <i>suffering</i>.<a name=115:9></a> It says, "If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you".<a name=115:10></a> It is reproach for the name of Christ.<a name=115:11></a> Is there any professed believer here who has never come into reproach -- reproach for the name?<a name=115:12></a> You will all remember the well-known passage in Hebrews where we read that Moses esteemed "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:26">Hebrews  11:26</a>).<a name=115:13></a> I believe that thought is implied in the word "Hebrew" in the early part of Exodus.<a name=115:14></a> In Egypt, that word implied reproach, and that is what Moses accepted; he identified himself with "an Hebrew, <i>one of his brethren</i>" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:11">Exodus  2:11</a>; he <i>esteemed</i> the reproach of Christ.<a name=115:15></a> Did "the Spirit of glory and of God" rest upon Moses?<a name=115:16></a> I think so, especially as he came back from Midian complete in identification with the Hebrews.<a name=115:17></a>.<a name=115:18></a> It was the reproach of Christ, and how the Holy Spirit loves to magnify Moses.<a name=115:19></a> "The man Moses", we are told, "was very great in the land of Egypt" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#11:3">Exodus  11:3</a>).<a name=115:20></a> God saw to that.<a name=115:21></a> We may put it down as a certainty, that where we are reproached, we shall be honoured of God; and what can be greater honour than that the "Spirit of glory and of God" should rest upon us?<a name=115:22></a>

		In due course we become trained military men, when we understand the captain of Jehovah's host, but that is not the book of Numbers; it is the book of Joshua.<a name=116:10></a> The book of Numbers, coincides with Romans, in that respect.<a name=116:11></a> Romans contemplates the young militarily, and so you do not get the "whole armour of God" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:13">Ephesians  6:13</a> in Romans, but the "armour of light" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:12">Romans  13:12</a>.<a name=116:12></a> You arm yourself with light in Romans and that is armour for the wilderness.<a name=116:13></a> It is a question of light, that is to say, you know where you are, and why you are there, and what is involved in your being there.<a name=116:14></a> Therefore, Romans says, "if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:9">Romans  10:9</a>).<a name=116:15></a> The confession with the mouth, of Jesus as Lord, and the belief in the heart that God raised Him, means salvation.<a name=116:16></a> It is not justification there although it is implied.<a name=116:17></a> Justification is chapters 3, 4, and 5, but salvation is chapter 10, and salvation involves what is

		The mention of the Spirit of God in the various books of the New Testament is a subject well worthy of enquiry; and I have selected this epistle believing that the Lord will graciously help, first, as regards the <i>teaching</i> of the Spirit.<a name=118:1></a> The idea of teaching is, I need not say, very extensive in the scriptures.<a name=118:2></a> As in nature, so in a spiritual sense; as born again we have to learn everything; and so we have many teachers.<a name=118:3></a> Even nature is accredited with teaching; and then God Himself teaches.<a name=118:4></a> Scripture speaks of Him teaching a "ploughman" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28:26">Isaiah  28:26</a>) -- showing how the idea enters into man's circumstances, for God as forming the creation, has not left it to work its own salvation; it is not something thrown out to evolve itself at its own expense -- God is in it.<a name=118:5></a> We are told that in Him we all live and move, showing how near He is to us, even as Creator, entering into man's circumstances, for man is His prime object in creation, and teaching him as I said, even how to plough and how to sow his seed.<a name=118:6></a> In a numberless variety of ways God enters into His own creation, imparting intelligence to it.<a name=118:7></a>

		John is taking young believers (I am speaking to them particularly now) out of the range of men, for it is a question of men as such in this chapter, he tells them that antichrist is coming, and that there are many antichrists.<a name=120:5></a> They are legion in our time, never has there been a time, I believe, yielding more antichrists.<a name=120:6></a> Young people, going to schools and offices may be unaware of the influences that are being exerted abroad -- subtle influences in many respects -- to shut out Christ from their minds by bringing in man, and the sayings and teachings of man.<a name=120:7></a> So the first word here in regard to the Spirit is "ye have an unction from the Holy One" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:20">1 John  2:20</a> -- not a degree, or degrees, according to man, but "an unction".<a name=120:8></a> A university degree gives a certain dignity to a man; the letters at the end of a name are intended to convey dignity and authority.<a name=120:9></a> Now, what we have here is that, only it is "an unction from the Holy One" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:20">1 John  2:20</a>; not that any christian would assume anything, but the point here is the dignity of the believer, even the youngest, as having the Holy Spirit; that the means of his learning and the character of his knowledge, are by the unction from the Holy One.<a name=120:10></a> Now that brings me down to what is very practical, and that is that all that is <i>merely</i> human, natural intellect and natural ability, is to be shut out from our mode of learning, and our mode of speaking one to another -- from our Bible readings, and above all from our ministry.<a name=120:11></a> The more the natural element has a place, the more degraded the teaching and the knowledge are; whereas where the anointing from the

		I am exercised, dear brethren, to speak about the Holy Spirit, especially in His operations by which He leads us into the enjoyment of our inheritance.<a name=156:1></a> He is the earnest of our inheritance.<a name=156:2></a> The subject of the Holy Spirit is necessarily a very extensive one, covering every part of the truth; indeed, there is a remarkable statement in John's first epistle, where the Spirit is said to be "the truth".<a name=156:3></a> So that He is to be regarded in relation to every part of the truth.<a name=156:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite clear that one could not deal with all that in a short address, but I desire to speak of His operations in connection with the believer's state, leading up to our having part in the inheritance.<a name=156:5></a> It is well for us to bear in mind that christianity stands publicly in relation to the Spirit, as well as to the Father and the Son; so that one may be quite free to speak of the Holy Spirit in this definite way.<a name=156:6></a> Indeed, the chapter in Romans from which I have read is occupied with this great subject of the Spirit of God, according to what He is to the believer.<a name=156:7></a>

		I would add to these preliminary remarks a word about 1 and 2 Corinthians, and the general bearing of these epistles on this subject.<a name=156:8></a> The first epistle, among many other things, may be viewed as setting forth the limitations which the will of God concerning the saints necessitates.<a name=156:9></a> God has seen fit to impose certain limitations on His people, viewed as His assembly.<a name=156:10></a> The epistle is marked by directions and commandments; and the test of one's spirituality is the recognition that the things which the apostle wrote are the commandments of the Lord.<a name=156:11></a> That is to say, the Holy Spirit in the saints here works out entire conformity to divine

		limitations; the Holy Spirit can never be in any movement amongst believers which transgresses the Lord's commandment.<a name=157:1></a> The Lord said, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me" <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>.<a name=157:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit in the believer operates on the line of producing complete conformity with all these ordinances, directions, and commandments.<a name=157:3></a> It is indeed the glory of the saints that they conform to these commandments.<a name=157:4></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:1">Psalm  19:1</a> that "The heavens declare the glory of God"; but in the incarnation -- that is, the Son becoming Man here -- we have the glory brought down to earth.<a name=157:5></a> In that psalm the sun in the heavens is likened to a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race; he makes a circuit of the heavens.<a name=157:6></a> Then in verse 7 we get the law of the Lord: this was taken up by Christ as having become a Man; He took it up, delighted in it, magnified it, made it honourable; so that the carrying out of the will of God, which marked the heavens, has now been seen on earth.<a name=157:7></a> The glory shone in every step of Christ, as He moved on in the path of God's will, but that will involved certain limitations here.<a name=157:8></a> The Lord in grace came into them, accepted them, and moved within them, and in so doing He glorified God.<a name=157:9></a> There was entire correspondence between the great and blessed truth that He was the Son of man in heaven, and the fact that He was here in the most humble circumstances.<a name=157:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>He is seen sitting "as he was" on the well; He was weary, and the will of God involved that.<a name=157:11></a> He says in that chapter that it was His meat to do the will of the One who sent Him, and to finish His work, and throughout His whole course the Lord moved in submission to the will of God, and delighted to do it.<a name=157:12></a> There is food in it for us; it is indeed the manna, the mighty's meat: "Man did eat angels' food" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:25">Psalm  78:25</a>.<a name=157:13></a> What is that food?<a name=157:14></a> It is Christ here in every circumstance of life, moving in relation to the will of God, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=158>[Page 158]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		involved certain limitations, which He accepted.<a name=158:1></a> He came down from heaven; indeed, He was "the Son of man which is in heaven" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a>, and He could return there, but He came to do the will of God.<a name=158:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in 1 Corinthians we see what corresponds with this in regard to the church.<a name=158:3></a> There are certain limitations made obligatory by the will of God, and the spiritual man observes them, and as a lover of Christ he has them and keeps them, they are not irksome to him; they remain in all their authority as the commandments of the Lord.<a name=158:4></a> The Lord manifests Himself to such an one as that, and the Father loves him.<a name=158:5></a> The whole point, as to our position here, is that we are for God's will, whether individually or viewed in relation to the church.<a name=158:6></a> The Holy Spirit would ever maintain us in accord with that.<a name=158:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit in us also links us with that which is outside the bounds of time: and the second letter to the Corinthians presents the accompaniments of this.<a name=158:8></a> That is, you have such expressions as, "we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:18">2 Corinthians  4:18</a>).<a name=158:9></a> One has often remarked, and it is worth repeating, that the feast of Pentecost in Deuteronomy is not bounded by time like other feasts, because it refers to the coming in of the Holy Spirit.<a name=158:10></a> The Spirit recognises all the bounds which are set about us by the Lord's commandments, in the time conditions, and the spiritual man recognises and keeps them all.<a name=158:11></a> But the Holy Spirit is also the link with what is outside time; He is the link with eternity; and so the apostle says, "If our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens .<a name=158:12></a>.<a name=158:13></a>.<a name=158:14></a> Now he that has wrought us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:1">2 Corinthians  5:1</a> - 5, New Trans.<a name=158:15></a>).<a name=158:16></a> We have the Spirit already in the way of earnest, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to connect these verses in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>for a moment with that.<a name=159:2></a> 2 Corinthians develops the accompaniments of this outlet from time limitations into eternal blessedness.<a name=159:3></a> Chapter 5 further states that "if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: and all things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:17">2 Corinthians  5:17</a>, 18).<a name=159:4></a> That is wonderful to think of; if any man be in Christ he is not only a new creature, but he is in a new creation, and in that new creation all things are of God.<a name=159:5></a> So in the power of the Spirit one may pass out of time limitations into eternal blessedness.<a name=159:6></a> Hence the apostle says further on, "I know a man in Christ" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:2">2 Corinthians  12:2</a>; he had the experience fourteen years before, of being caught up to the third heaven, to paradise -- to the place of eternal blessedness.<a name=159:7></a> Think of being caught up to that!<a name=159:8></a> He was let down the wall in a basket at Damascus, and in the next statement he can speak of being caught up to the third heaven.<a name=159:9></a> It was "a man in Christ"; he was not bound by bodily conditions, for he was quite unconscious whether in the body or out of it.<a name=159:10></a> But he knew something of the place; it was paradise -- a place of supreme blessedness.<a name=159:11></a> That is the prospect for the christian, and the Holy Spirit is in him to bring him to know something of it whilst he still has part in time limitations.<a name=159:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The verses in Romans that I have read treat of life.<a name=159:13></a> John does not in the main take us off the earth; it is a question of God coming here, and having His children here, who, as in the faith of the Son of God, have the victory, and are clear of death.<a name=159:14></a> So we do not get John employing the word "sons", with one exception in the Revelation; whereas Paul is occupied with the thought of sons because he would bring us to God; he would lead our souls to God in suitable dignity.<a name=159:15></a> So he first

		speaks here of life; he says, "if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:13">Romans  8:13</a>, and then he goes on, "ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption [or sonship], whereby we cry, Abba, Father" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:15">Romans  8:15</a>.<a name=160:1></a> You have received that Spirit, he says, and by that Spirit we cry, "Abba, Father"; it is not simply the employment of words; we cry, "Abba, Father" by the Spirit.<a name=160:2></a> Paul must bring himself in when it comes to enjoyment; he says, "<i>We</i> cry".<a name=160:3></a> You will recall that in Galatians the cry is the Spirit's; the Spirit of the Son coming into the believer turns to the Father and cries, "Abba, Father" <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a>.<a name=160:4></a> Then you will observe in this chapter, "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>.<a name=160:5></a> Romans gives us the operations of the Spirit in the believer, and brings in the thought of the Spirit leading, and that those who are led are sons of God.<a name=160:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to connect that with Numbers, and to touch on a point or two in that book.<a name=160:7></a> Most of you will recall that the Holy Spirit is viewed as having been received by believers typically in chapter 21, and it is in the light of that chapter that all that follows should be read.<a name=160:8></a> Hence when Balaam sees the people, he does not see them in relation to God's tabernacle; he says nothing about God's tabernacle; he sees the people in <i>their</i> tents; it was a question of what they had severally.<a name=160:9></a> It is the saints viewed as having the Spirit; their tents are worth looking at now.<a name=160:10></a> "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel".<a name=160:11></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#24:5">Numbers  24:5</a>.<a name=160:12></a> He saw them as having the Holy Spirit typically, and abiding in their tents according to their tribes.<a name=160:13></a> May God help us to lay hold of this!<a name=160:14></a> It is a question of families.<a name=160:15></a> The family feature is what the Holy Spirit would emphasise.<a name=160:16></a>

		I am thinking, dear brethren, about divine anointing, hoping that the Lord will help us as to the import of it.<a name=245:1></a> It is a familiar expression, but perhaps we may be helped further in our understanding of it.<a name=245:2></a> What comes out in scripture shows that it represents God's rights in administration or service, and thus correspondingly shuts out mere human ability; God from the very outset of His operations indicating that whatever the instrumentality or instrumentalities employed, <i>He</i> had had to say in the operations.<a name=245:3></a> We find, therefore, that the idea of the anointing has a very wide bearing, and brings God in authoritatively and in suited dignity in the instruments used.<a name=245:4></a> We find in the book of Ezekiel the idea connected with a great being whom we have to regard as now fallen, who is spoken of as "the anointed cherub that covereth" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#28:14">Ezekiel  28:14</a>.<a name=245:5></a> Thus before ever men were anointed the idea existed, and God anointed some great personage for a definite purpose.<a name=245:6></a> The king of Tyre is taken up as the immediate personage in <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#28">Ezekiel  28</a>, but the Spirit of God has more than the king of Tyre in view.<a name=245:7></a> So we have an inlet into angelic service, how God employed, and does employ, angels; but in the service rendered there was that which denoted that it was on God's part, it was not done independently, it was not done in the person's own power.<a name=245:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, in coming into our own realm, the creation of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, the creation as we are in it, we have the thought introduced in a very familiar and simple manner, in Abraham and others who are said to be God's anointed ones.<a name=245:9></a> Even in those early days what was being done bore the divine stamp.<a name=245:10></a> God said He reproved kings on account of His anointed ones, showing what they were to Him: "Touch not mine anointed ones" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105:15">Psalm  105:15</a>).<a name=245:11></a> They were moving under God, and God

		had an obvious part in their movements, they were not ordinary people.<a name=246:1></a> They had part in ordinary affairs outwardly like other people, and they prospered in material things too, but there was a distinctiveness about them that marked them off, even in the presence of kings, so that ultimately these anointed ones could bless kings, for their distinctiveness, their dignity, their moral authority, indicated the anointing.<a name=246:2></a> Thus God marked them off as His anointed, standing out in dignity and moral power, and in Abraham's case enabling him to rebuke a king.<a name=246:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking very simply, dear brethren, because I am impressed with this, that God would put dignity and power upon His people in dealing with men in this world.<a name=246:4></a> He has a hand in our movements, with the result that there is a constant rise in power and dignity in the saints before the eyes of those with whom they have to do immediately.<a name=246:5></a> So that as you see with Abraham, he could rebuke the king of the Philistines.<a name=246:6></a> So with Isaac.<a name=246:7></a> They were few and of small account in this world, but there was something that marked them off from men, and caused a gradual rise in power and dignity, so that they did not have to lend their shoulders to servitude; they were not brought under the power of this world, there was a superiority about them that lifted them above the current of the world.<a name=246:8></a> So that Isaac was able to speak on more than equal terms with the Philistine king, although he brought the general of his army and his friend with him, as an evidence of military power and social influence; but it was not enough to overwhelm Isaac.<a name=246:9></a> And then in Jacob you see the same thing; he stands before Pharaoh and blesses him.<a name=246:10></a> The Holy Spirit, commenting upon a similar occurrence, says that "the less is blessed of the better" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:7">Hebrews  7:7</a>).<a name=246:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, what comes out is that all this in Genesis leads up to a great position: Joseph is a fruitful bough by a well, and the branches run over the wall, and "from

		thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:24">Genesis  49:24</a>).<a name=247:1></a> That is the position in Genesis.<a name=247:2></a> Then in the typical books that follow you have the ministry or administration of it, and the way it is to be diffused and to reach men; that is the principle.<a name=247:3></a> So you have the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of the tabernacle and its utensils, with all that pertained to it; for God intends to shine out and to operate, and to show Himself in a domain dignified by the anointing.<a name=247:4></a> He has to say to every part of it; no other rights are recognised there.<a name=247:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is to reflect on our present position; there are no rights to be asserted among us, save God's rights.<a name=247:6></a> The anointing makes the position too dignified to admit of any assertion of human rights.<a name=247:7></a> God puts in His claim in the most positive manner in the anointing, so that in the tabernacle and its utensils anointed you get what typically represents the heavens and the earth; and then Aaron is anointed in relation to that, and you have a domain in which God's rights are asserted and maintained.<a name=247:8></a> The One who ministers there serves in the sympathy that belongs to the divine nature; for in Aaron it is a question of the manhood and priesthood of Christ.<a name=247:9></a> All that God <i>is</i>, embodied in a Man, in order that what God is may be brought in in the most sympathetic manner in that whole domain; and that God Himself may be served in it.<a name=247:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see what Exodus and Leviticus denote -- what a scene is presented -- and what a Person is anointed in that scene!<a name=247:11></a> So that we have the rights of God in every detail asserted in the priest, but in the most sympathetic manner, for they are not arbitrary.<a name=247:12></a> What can be better for us, dear brethren, than the rights of God?<a name=247:13></a> The more they are asserted the better; for what are they today but His rights in mercy?<a name=247:14></a> It is a question of His right to be merciful and gracious, and the more we admit these rights, both in ourselves severally and in the whole domain in which God is operating, the happier and richer we shall be.<a name=247:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to come to 2 Corinthians, because the anointing is specially mentioned there.<a name=248:1></a> It is not formally mentioned in the first epistle, though it is involved in the expression "the Christ" in chapter 12; but not as implying that the Corinthians were marked by it, for they were not; they were marked by the very opposite.<a name=248:2></a> Although having the Holy Spirit, and as in that sense anointed, they were marked by man's doings and sayings and party spirit, which is the very opposite of the anointing.<a name=248:3></a> That is simply the world, and walking according to men, and is, I need not say, degrading.<a name=248:4></a> But still, there it stands, "as the body is one and has many members .<a name=248:5></a>.<a name=248:6></a>.<a name=248:7></a> so also is the Christ" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>, "the Christ" alluding to the saints as anointed as in relation to Christ, but it is not formally applied to the Corinthians.<a name=248:8></a> But in the second letter it is applied, for they are included, as I understand, in the idea with the apostle himself: "he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:21">2 Corinthians  1:21</a>.<a name=248:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, dear brethren, I wish to seek to make clear the import of that statement, appearing as it does in the second letter, which is based on a certain effect in recovery from the first letter.<a name=248:10></a> It indicates that the anointing refers to something of God in the persons anointed; that it is intended to enable us in a dignified positive way to convey to others what we are enjoying.<a name=248:11></a> If God has saved me, has justified me, has given His Spirit to me, has brought me into the joy of the kingdom, "righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:17">Romans  14:17</a>, then I say, Well, I can speak of that, and indeed I should; but the anointing means that I have power to speak of it effectively, that I can speak of it rightly, and in force, so that it affects others.<a name=248:12></a> It is not a matter of incidental comment, but the thing impresses you, and you are enabled to speak of it effectively.<a name=248:13></a> But, as I said, we have to bear in mind that the anointing is in the second letter to the Corinthians, not in the first.<a name=248:14></a> Not that it could not be spoken of in the first in an
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=249>[Page 249]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		abstract way, but it is spoken of in the second in a positive way; and what follows is that He has sealed us and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.<a name=249:1></a> Underneath the anointing is the sealing, the fact that you belong to God, that God has put a stamp on you, that you are His; He has a right to you.<a name=249:2></a> But then, what have you got?<a name=249:3></a> Well, you have got in your heart the earnest of the Spirit -- that is something.<a name=249:4></a> And there I may liken you to Jacob in Bethel, for in this respect we may read these epistles into <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>.<a name=249:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of the anointing was already there; Abraham was one of the "anointed ones" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105">Psalm  105</a>), and that has to be borne in mind if we are to understand aright Jacob's action in pouring oil on the stone.<a name=249:6></a> It was but very little, the stone was hard, denoting hard circumstances; it was his own selection, he set it up himself; it was one of the stones of the place, and he took it and used it for a pillow.<a name=249:7></a> But you see there was something there, something had come into Jacob's soul that had never been there before.<a name=249:8></a> I cannot dwell on it; you all know the chapter; but it is so important for young people to lay hold of the idea of something coming into the soul, changing the whole texture of the person.<a name=249:9></a> Jacob was trammelled as yet by much of the flesh and nature, selfishness and natural ambitions, and other things, but there was something, perhaps indefinable by himself, which was there, and he was able definitely to take that stone and set it up and pour oil on it; there was spiritual intelligence and purpose in that action.<a name=249:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to show us the bearing of the anointing, dear brethren, in the next chapter you see the energy of the man on behalf of others.<a name=249:11></a> He went his way to Haran, and looked around and saw a well, and three flocks of sheep lying there.<a name=249:12></a> I only touch on that; I want to show you that the anointing of the stone spiritually alluded to Jacob himself, and was to show itself in his energy; he served "by love".<a name=249:13></a> He did not roll the stone from the

		well's mouth until Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, and then he rolled away the stone and watered the flock; he served by love, as I said.<a name=250:1></a> That is the divine way to serve, the effect of the anointing; and it is within the range of the youngest as well as of the oldest, to serve by love; it is heaven's way.<a name=250:2></a> You say, The world serves by love.<a name=250:3></a> No, it does not; you will not get any service by love in the world.<a name=250:4></a> Serving by love is a heavenly thing; it comes out of heaven.<a name=250:5></a> It is in the Person of Jesus that the thing is fully expressed, for Jacob was a type of Jesus.<a name=250:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have not far to go for objects of affection.<a name=250:7></a> Before Rachel arrived Jacob said, "My brethren, whence be ye?<a name=250:8></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#29:4">Genesis  29:4</a>.<a name=250:9></a> And they said, "Of Haran are we", and they knew Laban.<a name=250:10></a> Jacob could speak of the time of day, and that the flocks should be watered, but he did not do it; that is to say, he could speak of the need of things being done without doing them, but as soon as an object for his affections appeared, he rolled away the stone and watered the flock.<a name=250:11></a> He is a type of Christ.<a name=250:12></a> What he did is typically the product of heaven brought down, and brought within the range of the youngest believer -- to serve by love.<a name=250:13></a> The greatest power in the whole universe is love; and it begins in a small way; if you have a brother or a sister an object for your affection near you, you can serve by love.<a name=250:14></a> Jacob rolled away the stone without any apparent difficulty.<a name=250:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as he came back to Bethel twenty years later, he set up "a pillar of stone"; the idea is increased in his mind.<a name=250:16></a> That is why I am connecting this passage in Genesis with 2 Corinthians; it is very much like Jacob's second visit to Bethel.<a name=250:17></a> In this letter we have the new covenant.<a name=250:18></a> The apostle discerned a change in their state; self-judgment had taken effect.<a name=250:19></a> So he is able to open up to them the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, the new covenant, and then the ministry of reconciliation; he brings in the two thoughts.<a name=250:20></a> One reconciled, having the love of God in his heart, moves here pleasing to

	<div class="paragraph">
		God.<a name=251:1></a> You see a person who loves is like Jesus.<a name=251:2></a> "Hereby we have known love, because he has laid down his life for us; and we ought for the brethren to lay down our lives".<a name=251:3></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>.<a name=251:4></a> The love of God learnt in the heart leads to similarity to Jesus; and similarity to Jesus brings out the divine approbation.<a name=251:5></a> It is sure to do that.<a name=251:6></a> God has His own way of bringing to the heart the sense of His approbation, a most blessed thing.<a name=251:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the life of a person truly in the good of reconciliation is a life for the pleasure of God.<a name=251:8></a> It is a most practical thing.<a name=251:9></a> God has refreshment in every little bit of service rendered by a person who is truly in the good of reconciliation.<a name=251:10></a> Hence in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35">Genesis  35</a>Jacob sets up a pillar of stone; not now simply a stone that had been his pillow, or a mere piece of stone, but "a <i>pillar</i> of stone".<a name=251:11></a> The idea of a pillar is more permanent; and the substance of this is stone, it is something to remain; and Jacob is conscious in setting it up that he has been pleasing to God.<a name=251:12></a> And how pleasing?<a name=251:13></a> God came down and spoke to him, standing by him, not at a distance, as before, and Jacob so revered the spot that he set up a pillar there, and poured a drink offering upon it; that is why I linked it with 2 Corinthians, for there is no doubt that spiritually the stone pillar was there.<a name=251:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was something for God at Corinth.<a name=251:15></a> The Lord had said, "I have much people in this city" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>), and the stone, so to speak, was set up.<a name=251:16></a> But there had not been continued pleasure; the Corinthians retrograded and man got in.<a name=251:17></a> But now there is a change, and God speaks of the new covenant, and reconciliation, so that the idea of the anointing can be brought in.<a name=251:18></a> God was pleased with them as they were repenting as to the evil among them.<a name=251:19></a> Jacob was conscious in the second visit to Bethel that God was pleased with him, addressing him by name -- surnaming him -- and ennobling him.<a name=251:20></a> In effect God said to him, Your name is to be Israel henceforward, and My name is God Almighty.<a name=251:21></a> What a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will come back to that in relation to the passage read in Luke, but I wish to show how this principle is applied to our education, and that is what John dwells upon.<a name=252:6></a> The anointing here implies more than simply oil poured on, it is a sort of rubbing in.<a name=252:7></a> That is what we need; many of us take things on too lightly when it is a question of education, and that particularly applies to the young; but there is this thing that God, as it were, rubs in, so as to enable us to shut out all man's teaching.<a name=252:8></a> I do not mean the teaching that is necessary for ordinary service or to earn a livelihood, because for these things we need a certain education; but I am speaking of what relates to God, and of the superiority of the teaching of what is here called "the anointing", "the unction".<a name=252:9></a> It is received from the Holy One.<a name=252:10></a> It is not called the Spirit; it is something known, as received.<a name=252:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the question is, dear brethren, as to the use of it.<a name=252:12></a> This is addressed to little ones, not to the young men or the fathers, but to the little ones in John's family.<a name=252:13></a> The apostle addresses us as a class, "yourselves" -- a very suggestive expression!<a name=252:14></a> I think the Lord's supper brings that about; and as to this, one would speak specially to any one who is not a partaker of the Lord's supper.<a name=252:15></a> "Yourselves", as used here, is a very precious word, it refers to a special class of people.<a name=252:16></a> The Lord's supper brings us together in the most touching manner; it began with the Lord making a selection.<a name=252:17></a> He never

		Some of you may not have in mind that the Holy Spirit is included in the gospel, whereas He is.<a name=267:1></a> Not only is it preached by His power as Peter says: "by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:12">1 Peter  1:12</a>, but He is also a subject in the gospel.<a name=267:2></a> As here, He uses select vessels for the preaching, as we have recorded in this book, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them .<a name=267:3></a>.<a name=267:4></a>.<a name=267:5></a> They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit .<a name=267:6></a>.<a name=267:7></a>.<a name=267:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:2">Acts  13:2</a>,4).<a name=267:9></a> But then, whilst He is the power for the preaching, the preachers being anointed by Him, He also is included in the preaching, as necessary to all that the gospel proposes; He is necessary to salvation and life, and for the enjoyment of forgiveness.<a name=267:10></a> So that obviously He forms a very important part of the gospel testimony, of which believers need to take note specially, because, as I shall show, believers may be without the Spirit, and thus without practical salvation and life, and the joy they afford.<a name=267:11></a> They are, as has often been remarked, <i>safe</i> from the divine side, but not <i>saved</i>.<a name=267:12></a> The apostle Paul speaking about the word of the cross, says, "Unto us which are saved it is the power of God" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:18">1 Corinthians  1:18</a>, so that every one should question his heart as to whether he is among the saved.<a name=267:13></a>

		Now Peter in his first great address, recorded in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, was a witness.<a name=268:8></a> There were eleven others with him, and behind them there were many more competent witnesses: he speaks with authority, saying, "Hearken to my words" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:14">Acts  2:14</a>.<a name=268:9></a> As Elijah of old had said in Israel, "There shall not be .<a name=268:10></a>.<a name=268:11></a>.<a name=268:12></a> rain these years, except by my word" <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#17:1">1 Kings  17:1</a>, now here is one who had a word, and he calls upon Israel and the dwellers at Jerusalem to hearken, and as they hearkened he spoke and bore witness to the sufferings of Christ.<a name=268:13></a> So the prophets "testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:11">1 Peter  1:11</a>).<a name=268:14></a> The gospel relates to the glory that should follow; it relates to the unsearchable riches of Christ -- riches which God is prepared to lavish on men; for as He is lavish in giving witnesses, so too with His riches, as the prodigal proved so well when the best robe was brought out and the ring and the shoes were put on.<a name=268:15></a> What a wardrobe it is!<a name=268:16></a>

		I read these two scriptures so as to make some remarks as to spirituality.<a name=305:1></a> Two great features mark the dispensation; one is faith, and the other that the Holy Spirit is here on earth; so that it is not only a dispensation of faith, but of spirituality.<a name=305:2></a> I selected Simeon as representing the thought of spirituality, especially in the gospel of Luke.<a name=305:3></a> This gospel stresses this thought; it is not so much the question of energy on our part, but the fact of the Spirit's presence, and how He acts upon us; that finding us in a condition suitable, He acts upon us.<a name=305:4></a> Matthew contemplates the energy that is needed on our side, and records the Lord's remarks after He arose that they should go to Galilee and see Him, forbidding thus the idea of indolence, and stressing energy -- journeying.<a name=305:5></a> They have to go to Galilee to see Him: "there they shall see me" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:10">Matthew  28:10</a>).<a name=305:6></a> Whereas Luke quotes the Lord as saying, "tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:49">Luke  24:49</a>).<a name=305:7></a> That is not by any means inertness or laziness, but a state of restful <i>faith</i>.<a name=305:8></a> It is one thing, dear brethren, to believe on a certain day, in a certain year, and receive blessing, but it is another to be named by the Spirit as a <i>believing</i> person, such as Timothy's mother; it is not simply that she believed, but she was a "believing woman" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:1">Acts  16:1</a>).<a name=305:9></a> So that as a believing person I am restful and the power comes: "until ye be endued", the Lord says, "with power from on high" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:49">Luke  24:49</a>; but before one undertakes to serve he goes to Galilee as it were, or he will get nothing.<a name=305:10></a> It is a matter of soul exercise and travail; he goes to where the Lord is to be seen: "there they shall see me".<a name=305:11></a> But then according to Luke, the Spirit <i>comes</i>, that is to say, the two evangelists run together; both are necessary.<a name=305:12></a> As the service is undertaken the power comes; but prior

		to this, there is the exercise, as indicated in Matthew.<a name=306:1></a> Simeon represents Luke's side of the truth.<a name=306:2></a> He was a man "in Jerusalem" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:25">Luke  2:25</a>, that is, he was not a travelling man.<a name=306:3></a> The preposition does not even imply that he had come to Jerusalem, but he was there; he was in Jerusalem.<a name=306:4></a> "There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon".<a name=306:5></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:25">Luke  2:25</a>.<a name=306:6></a> He is ready for the smallest presentation of Christ; he discerns it, and is able to enlarge upon it; he is able to take account of it in the largest possible way.<a name=306:7></a> That is what I have in mind, that we may get the thought of "a man in Jerusalem" and what marks him in a spiritual sense.<a name=306:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will come back to this, but I wish to show first, the relations in which spirituality is developed in the people of God.<a name=306:9></a> It begins with instinct, and when I use the word 'instinct' I have in mind that which marks a subject of the work of God from the very outset, as illustrated in a babe; one of the things that marks a babe is instinct.<a name=306:10></a> You cannot speak of a babe as marked by acquired knowledge, or even intuitive knowledge, it has instinct.<a name=306:11></a> Thus if the importance of what I am saying is considered, it will be seen that spirituality is not something that comes in at the <i>end</i> of one's life on earth.<a name=306:12></a> I do not think God cares very much for the end <i>only</i>, although He values everything that is the evidence of His work, however tiny; that is a feature of John's gospel.<a name=306:13></a> But then God has a way of showing that He values what is normal.<a name=306:14></a> Gold is gold wherever we see it, but God has great respect for what is normal; that is to say, for the appearance of spirituality from the <i>outset</i> of the believer's history.<a name=306:15></a> Luke, indeed, gives us this feature in the Lord Himself, in whom, of course, perfection is always seen.<a name=306:16></a> Luke does not present the Lord in His infancy as Matthew does; he speaks of Mary and Joseph before he mentions the Babe; the shepherds, arriving at Bethlehem, "found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:16">Luke  2:16</a>); the Babe was in His normal place; the idea is not to present the Babe first

		as in Matthew.<a name=307:1></a> And so as He is presented in the temple He is just a Babe to outward appearance; whereas Matthew says that when the wise men arrived at the house, they found "the little child with Mary his mother" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:11">Matthew  2:11</a> New Translation); not a "babe", but a "little child", and the little child is mentioned first.<a name=307:2></a> That is the spiritual side; but Luke gives you normality, and God has great regard for it with us.<a name=307:3></a>

		So I have taken up this passage in Samuel because it gives that side of the truth of spirituality -- instinct, I need not enquire in the language of scripture, "Does God take care for oxen?<a name=307:4></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:9">1 Corinthians  9:9</a>.<a name=307:5></a> He is not thinking of the sagacity of cows in this passage: it is written "for our sakes" not to regard us as kine, but as typified in our beginnings, as having spiritual instinct; and there is nothing surer, nothing more reliable in its place.<a name=307:6></a> Persons that rely entirely upon acquired knowledge in the things of God are not to be trusted.<a name=307:7></a> We may be in the mind of God today and miss it tomorrow; but spiritual instinct is to be relied upon, and hence the great importance of it.<a name=307:8></a> The young people should begin in cultivating it.<a name=307:9></a> I refer to this passage because spiritual instinct appears so obviously; milch kine with calves, what will they do under these circumstances?<a name=307:10></a> I am converted to God as a member of a family, with affectionate parents, affectionate brothers and sisters, and one day I am tested as to Christ (here He is in Philistine hands where He is not respected) -- I am tested as to what I think of Him: whether I can identify myself with Him however small the way in which He is presented, or whether I prefer to be governed by what is natural, by natural affections.<a name=307:11></a> If I am governed by the latter, I shall have no part in the service.<a name=307:12></a> I may come to the meeting on Lord's day morning, and have part with the brethren, but I miss the spiritual part of it.<a name=307:13></a>

		My object in reading these passages is that we may see what the effect of the presence of the Spirit is here.<a name=323:1></a> Broadly speaking the effect of christianity, rightly apprehended, is to produce living conditions.<a name=323:2></a> It was the divine thought that what God would present in the way of teaching and preaching should be accompanied by living conditions -- the evidence of life, for only thus is the doctrine of christianity verified.<a name=323:3></a> We have the principle in our Lord, of whom it is said, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>.<a name=323:4></a> What He said was life, because He was altogether that which He said.<a name=323:5></a> There was the truth expressed in a living way in the Lord here; what He said, He was.<a name=323:6></a>

		I have read the verses in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>because they indicate how this is worked out in a day such as ours, when that which had boasted of being the divine system has become corrupt.<a name=323:15></a> The Lord, having spoken of the assembly in the earlier verses, uses the word "again" in verse 19, meaning it was a new subject,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=324>[Page 324]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		or the same subject in another development.<a name=324:1></a> The assembly in the previous verses is regarded as intact, as that which was to be heard, and woe to him who refuses to hearken to it.<a name=324:2></a> But in the verse I have read (verse 19) the Lord says, "Again I say to you" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>, as if to introduce a new development, and make provision for it; for there are no afterthoughts with God.<a name=324:3></a> Provision is made at the outset for every contingency; the breakdown of the assembly as a public body is provided for in these two verses, so that saints should not be hampered, but that the divine thought at the outset should be still operative.<a name=324:4></a> Hence the Lord brings the thing down to "two of you" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>, that is to say, not any two believers, but two of the assembly.<a name=324:5></a> Now Matthew, as some of you may have observed, deals in twos; where the other evangelists in parallel passages speak of one, he usually speaks of two.<a name=324:6></a> He had in view the breakdown of the world-system that was opposed to God, that had its centre in Jerusalem.<a name=324:7></a> It was a combination; the strength of the world lies in combination.<a name=324:8></a> Organised opposition is the most effective opposition to God, and so at Babel from the very earliest times, the world became organised, and from Babel onwards organised opposition was most damaging, and it is so still.<a name=324:9></a> But God met it by an organisation of His own, and Matthew introduces that.<a name=324:10></a> You find Matthew dealing with two demoniacs, with two blind men, and instead of one ass, he presents to us an ass and a colt; and so he deals with two of the assembly.<a name=324:11></a> Two of the assembly are the most important that can be found in the whole of the universe outside of divine Persons -- "two of you".<a name=324:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire that we may rightly estimate the value, potentially at least, of two of the assembly.<a name=324:13></a> Matthew brings forward the Lord's words in regard to them; He says that if there be unity, if there be agreement, two of the assembly shall receive from heaven anything they ask.<a name=324:14></a> There is no limit according to this passage to what may be received and obtained from heaven by

		In Ezekiel, as you will observe, the house is in view.<a name=325:8></a> Much is said about it in the chapters immediately preceding.<a name=325:9></a> You will remember that the prophet was brought into "the land of Israel" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#40:2">Ezekiel  40:2</a>, and set upon a very high mountain, and he sees the frame of a city towards the south; all very auspicious, portending blessing in the way of rule and light from God; but as he arrives at the place, it is not the city that is enlarged upon but the house; for it is house-wise, that the blessing comes.<a name=325:10></a> The city will have its place by-and-by; we recognise it, but God is dealing at the present time house-wise, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=326>[Page 326]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		so the prophet is engaged with the house, and that not an empty one.<a name=326:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The God of Israel comes in from the east, and enters the house; His glory fills it.<a name=326:2></a> But now, having that in view, the prophet is shown it, he is taken to it, and its aspect is eastward, We have to learn to take account of the points of the compass spiritually; the aspect of the house is eastward.<a name=326:3></a> The existence of the house of God here at the present time is provisional; for us it continues unto the coming of the Lord.<a name=326:4></a> We do not read of the house of God in heaven, it has a provisional existence here, it continues unto the coming of the Lord.<a name=326:5></a> It looks eastward.<a name=326:6></a> It is set up here according to wisdom, for "Wisdom hath builded her house" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#9:1">Proverbs  9:1</a>; it is in every way fitted to he the vessel of divine administration, and it points on and looks for the coming of the Lord; therefore the aspect is towards the east.<a name=326:7></a> It is "until he come", and what we find is that the waters flow out.<a name=326:8></a> There is nothing barren, nor dried up about the house of God.<a name=326:9></a> It is to be the source of everything of God in a provisional way, all coming down from heaven in the gift of the Spirit; for the Spirit of God came down once, and He has remained here.<a name=326:10></a> There were not two outpourings of the Spirit, it was one event; what occurred at Pentecost was not repeated.<a name=326:11></a> The Holy Spirit involves the presence of God Himself here, and thus everything operates house-wise, so the waters flow out from the right side of the house.<a name=326:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order that we might be duly affected by what it cost Christ in order that the waters should flow, the Spirit of God tells us that they flow from the south side of the altar; that is to say, the death of Christ in its results is favourable to man; and then lest we should forget the sufferings of Christ that the altar involves -- sufferings untold -- the prophet is led round by the way of the gate towards the <i>north</i>, as if to be reminded of the awful blast of divine wrath that was directed against the Lord, our sacrifice, as on that altar.<a name=326:13></a> As we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=327>[Page 327]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		enjoy the results of it, it is well to be reminded of the cost.<a name=327:1></a> The north -- the bitter, cold wind from the north -- refers to the judgment of God.<a name=327:2></a> We are to be reminded that what we enjoy, cost Christ the bearing of divine wrath; that sobers us.<a name=327:3></a> And so from that Ezekiel is led round towards the front of the house, which looketh towards the east, and the waters issue from the right side.<a name=327:4></a> We have had the south side, now it is the right side of the house.<a name=327:5></a> It is one thing for God to be favourable to us, but it is another thing for Him to use all His <i>power</i> for our help and blessing; and so it is that Pentecost was not only the indication of the favourable attitude of the administration, which it was, but God said virtually: 'In all my power I am for man'.<a name=327:6></a> It was the right side of the house.<a name=327:7></a> And so the river is flowing.<a name=327:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then the Spirit of God occupies us with its increasing depth.<a name=327:9></a> There is no allusion to tributaries in these symbols; nor is it a question of draining the land; it is the pure, holy source that is specially in view, and then the increasing depth.<a name=327:10></a> The Holy Spirit came down from heaven; there was nothing here to add to Him.<a name=327:11></a> He brought everything with Him.<a name=327:12></a> What comes to light in the river is its increasing depth.<a name=327:13></a> Take any other system in the world professing to he religious, and examine it, you will find nothing like this.<a name=327:14></a> Instead of drying up and becoming evaporated by the eastern sun, this river increases as it flows, until it becomes waters to swim in, a river that cannot be passed over.<a name=327:15></a> How we christians understand it!<a name=327:16></a> What a sense of victory we have in confronting present opposition; we know we are in that which is beyond the opposers; we know they are dealing with surface methods.<a name=327:17></a> We have to do with what is impossible to nature; it is waters to swim in, a river that cannot be passed over.<a name=327:18></a> I wonder if the young believers here understand the depth of it, what there is in it; there is more in it than you can ever take in.<a name=327:19></a> You may question and criticise,

		Having thus referred to the features of christianity as indicated at Pentecost, I want to show you a little of its results, because we want results, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>shows these are possible even in a day like ours -- a day of small things; and what you find is that the river has banks.<a name=328:4></a> The prophet is taken to the banks of the river, and on the banks are trees.<a name=328:5></a> Banks allude to limitations; not that the Holy Spirit is to be limited, but they indicate where the river flows.<a name=328:6></a> I have no doubt they allude to the doctrines of christianity; we must not he defective in doctrine, while dealing with the positive thing, that which produces life, we must be regulated.<a name=328:7></a> Paul says, "thou hast .<a name=328:8></a>.<a name=328:9></a>.<a name=328:10></a> known my doctrine" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:10">2 Timothy  3:10</a>.<a name=328:11></a> In his doctrine we have indicated what the things are, where the Holy Spirit is, where divine things are; and in connection with the banks you have trees, which are, as I apprehend it, men developed; they have grown there.<a name=328:12></a> We need men.<a name=328:13></a> The Corinthians had not arrived at that; the banks were hardly visible at Corinth, they were well-nigh obliterated.<a name=328:14></a> The apostle had to write in order to establish them, that it might be known where the river flows; it has its own way.<a name=328:15></a> So he says, "Brethren, be not children in your minds, but in malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:20">1 Corinthians  14:20</a>.<a name=328:16></a> I fear they were more developed in malice, in the fruits of the flesh, than they were in the graces of Christ; and so he urges upon them to be men in their minds.<a name=328:17></a> Ephesians goes further; ministry is to the end that we should arrive "at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>.<a name=328:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God comes back to the thought of trees -- men; having mentioned them in verse 7, we have them again in verse 12, so as to develop more fully what he has in his mind with regard to them -- that they should bear fruit, that there should be variety, that they should he evergreen.<a name=329:3></a> These ideas of fruitfulness, of freshness, of the energy of life are to be seen in men -- in the trees.<a name=329:4></a> How lovely is the picture!<a name=329:5></a> Scripture enlarges on it elsewhere.<a name=329:6></a> I only dwell on it here as the outcome, typically, of the operations of grace connected with the Spirit of God, within certain doctrinal limitations.<a name=329:7></a> I believe that what is needed in the gatherings of the Lord's people is just this growth; a growth from the babe-state into the state of manhood; and not simply that we are men in our minds, having the right thought of everything, but that there should be that holy state, that fruitfulness, that ever-greenness, which is delightful to God, and refreshing to man.<a name=329:8></a>

		I have been exercised in regard to this meeting to speak a little about the unity of the Spirit, and in thinking it over, it appears to me that in Scripture it is connected with the thought of princes.<a name=354:1></a> The unity of the Spirit is a universal thought.<a name=354:2></a> You may recall the word in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:16">Psalm  45:16</a> in regard to the saints: "whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth"; without a goodly distribution of princes universally, we can scarcely look for the unity of the Spirit, in fact we shall be little better than nonconformist communities, which means that we are non-catholic and in a great measure local independencies.<a name=354:3></a> Hence the importance, as I have said, of a goodly distribution of princes according to God abroad among the saints.<a name=354:4></a> The means of establishing princes is here on earth; and the psalm I refer to indicates that it is a divine thought that they should be in <i>all</i> the earth, which means a general or universal distribution.<a name=354:5></a> The Levites of old as a Levitical family were to be distributed throughout the land for the same reason, that there should be an equalisation and a generalisation of heavenly influence, so that the same traits, the same feelings, and the same sympathies should mark all the people of God.<a name=354:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of princes is very old, and you will remember that it is first set out in Jacob.<a name=354:7></a> As he was on his way back from Padan-aram God met him, and said that his name henceforth would be Israel, which means 'prince of God'; and there can be no princely state or dignity apart from a transaction with God.<a name=354:8></a> The power of lifting up is with Him; it is He who makes princes, lifting up the beggar from the dunghill and setting him amongst princes; so that we have the idea set out in Jacob, and once an idea is presented in Scripture,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope to work out these thoughts in the passages in the Acts; but at the outset, I want to make it clear how the princely feature shows itself in the wilderness.<a name=355:3></a> I refer now to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>.<a name=355:4></a> These twelve men, it says, came forward and offered on the day that the tabernacle was set up and anointed.<a name=355:5></a> They had the altar particularly in view; but first, they came forward with their offering for the Levites, for the first evidence of princely means will appear in the way in which the Levites are provided for.<a name=355:6></a> But I am not concerned, for the moment, with the provision for the Levites, but with the unity that marked those who made the provision.<a name=355:7></a> There were the covered waggons, as you will remember, six of them, each one offered by two princes, two are always better than one, and certainly this is so in the expression of love.<a name=355:8></a> Two would convey the idea of unity in principle, so that however reduced the people of God may be, we have the means, if there are but two of the assembly, of exhibiting the idea.<a name=355:9></a> We can never hope to present now the <i>complete</i> thought of anything, but what we may do is, we may present the thing in the principle of it, and we may do that even if there are only two of us according to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=355:10></a> The covered waggons (notice that they were <i>covered</i>), were to provide for the comfort of the Levites, they were in view of that; the Levites had to be considered, and we must not assume that <i>anything</i> will do for them.<a name=355:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Certainly if we think of them in regard to God and what they presented to Him, anything would not do; they were particular as to what they presented; they were not to present the fag end, but their very best.<a name=355:12></a> So we must ever remember that anything will not do; the comfort of the Levites has to be taken into account,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to point out briefly how the princely feature shows itself in the dedication of the altar; it is one of the finest features in the book of Numbers, because the altar itself has to be taken account of as distinct from what is presented on it.<a name=356:3></a> The fire was to be kept burning continually there.<a name=356:4></a> It had been anointed seven times; it stood out therefore as the most distinct of the more public appurtenances of the tabernacle.<a name=356:5></a> It was a public thing, and referred to the fulness of suffering in Christ; and the princes came to light in this chapter as taking account of that; that is, that the position they occupied had involved suffering.<a name=356:6></a> The greatest 'prince' in our dispensation wished to fill up that which was behind of the tribulations of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the assembly (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:24">Colossians  1:24</a>).<a name=356:7></a> He was not passing things on, although he called upon others to suffer as a matter of privilege, he himself led the way.<a name=356:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>what we find is that these men offered three vessels, all of them filled; signifying that they themselves typically were filled with the things that the types represent.<a name=356:9></a> Two vessels were of silver, and the third was of gold; the weight of one silver vessel was one hundred and thirty shekels, and that of the other seventy shekels, but they were both full; and then the vessel of gold was filled with incense.<a name=356:10></a> The first two vessels full of fine flour point to a great apprehension by the believer of the humanity of Christ; the apprehension of what is set forth in the fine flour mingled with oil, would become material for unity; but the incense was for the delight of God.<a name=356:11></a> It was contained in the smaller vessel, the golden spoon; it is what is presented to God, and it is in a convenient vessel, for what is to be presented to God is not in great bulk; indeed, whilst Scripture makes much of bulk for the priests and the people, the general idea is quality

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and not quantity.<a name=357:1></a> So that we have the golden spoon, a small vessel filled with that which is most precious, for if you speak to God, the point is not amount but quality.<a name=357:2></a> You are to pray with the spirit, but you are to pray with the understanding also; your spirit may be full of things, but your understanding qualifies and limits what you say, so that you present something definite that God can accept and which is a delight to Him; the incense was in a <i>golden</i> vessel.<a name=357:3></a> We do not worship simply as redeemed; but as redeemed, we are to <i>become</i> worshippers, that is, vessels filled with Christ.<a name=357:4></a> We are not redeemed to live as men and women in the flesh; the vessels of silver are filled with fine flour mingled with oil.<a name=357:5></a> Therefore, if we are redeemed, we are to be full of Christ viewed in the perfection of His humanity here; it is "Jesus Christ", as mentioned in the first part of Romans.<a name=357:6></a> It is Jesus Christ, meaning that <i>kind</i> of man, that is, the Man who did God's will, the kind of man that was brought here in Him, The first two vessels are full of that, fine flour mingled with oil, the perfect, holy humanity of Christ, energised by the Spirit.<a name=357:7></a> The gold refers to the divine nature.<a name=357:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides these vessels the princes offered sacrifices.<a name=357:9></a> The offerings all taken together denote youthful maturity; some are spoken of as a year old, "one yearling lamb"; others denote maturity, "one ram", but taken together they indicate that while these princes were in youthful energy, they were not babes.<a name=357:10></a> The Corinthians were babes; they could not conform to order like this.<a name=357:11></a> This belongs to the epistle to the Ephesians, and denotes appreciation in man according to Christ; it is humanity altogether above petty feelings, resentment, and rivalries; it is maturity, but maturity in energy, as I may call it, youthful maturity.<a name=357:12></a> You will find in Scripture that those whom the Spirit of God employs are generally taken up as young men; the great need is always for young men, but young men developed and marked by maturity, those who are full-grown.<a name=357:13></a>

		Now having said so much about princes characteristically, I want to show how these thoughts worked out in the Acts, because the Acts may be regarded not as a code for us, but as a book of precedents.<a name=358:1></a> We see there how things were worked out in persons; and I wish to connect the thought of unity in Acts, first with the work of God; secondly with the universal need, or need anywhere amongst the people of God; then with the service of God; and finally with the maintenance of doctrine, or right principles universally.<a name=358:2></a>

		They surnamed him "Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation)", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:36">Acts  4:36</a>.<a name=358:7></a> They were glad to see him; he appeared at an opportune time; he had lands, it says, and sold them.<a name=358:8></a> He did not give them away, he did not leave them, but exercised right judgment in the matter, for the more spiritual a man is, the more practical he is, and the less likely he is to be extreme or abnormal.<a name=358:9></a>

		I have in view to speak about the Holy Spirit, in regard to the great apostasy.<a name=400:1></a> Most of us are aware there is such a thing, and that it has long existed.<a name=400:2></a> It wag spoken of by Paul -- "a falling away" he calls it, but Jude and Peter write expressly in view of it, and as meeting it.<a name=400:3></a> Whilst both epistles contain much instruction relative to the apostasy, and which every believer should have, my thought is to confine myself to what is said of the Spirit and His relation to it.<a name=400:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak of the Spirit as a divine Person here on earth; one indeed, who is said to be the "Comforter", whom the Lord Jesus, as having entered into heaven as Man, asked for from the Father.<a name=400:5></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>, 17 the Lord says, "<i>I</i> will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth .<a name=400:6></a>.<a name=400:7></a>.<a name=400:8></a> he abides with you, and shall be in you" -- what a transcending fact for us!<a name=400:9></a> His presence here is not interfered with by any adverse circumstances arising in the history of God's people on earth, He abides with us.<a name=400:10></a> And so at the end, as remaining with us, He is here in relation to the apostasy, or in relation to us as surrounded by it.<a name=400:11></a> He is here as the Comforter in relation to the church, and He takes account of us in view of the apostasy which necessarily affects us.<a name=400:12></a>

		So I selected these two letters as dealing expressly with the apostasy.<a name=400:13></a> Jude had in mind to write of the "common salvation" <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#3">Jude  3</a>, but he had to turn aside from that because of the influx of evil.<a name=400:14></a> He writes of evil men having crept in unawares, and he describes their features, and in verse 19 sums them up as "natural men, not having the Spirit" <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#19">Jude  19</a>.<a name=400:15></a> It was quite obvious from what he had said before, that they had not the Spirit, but as saying that, it raises the question in our minds as to persons who have not the Spirit.<a name=400:16></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>,

		Our subject this evening is the Holy Spirit.<a name=432:2></a> This subject is very comprehensive.<a name=432:3></a> My thought is to show how the Spirit's activity makes itself felt in the local assemblies.<a name=432:4></a> As we have already considered the Lord's operations, both universal and local, I think it would help now to consider the Spirit's activity.<a name=432:5></a>

		One of the great basic truths of christianity is the presence of the Holy Spirit here personally.<a name=432:6></a> John presents in his gospel the truth of the Holy Spirit's presence in the saints, for their joy and help; and Luke presents the service of the Spirit as available for the furtherance of the testimony, as well as operating for the blessing of men.<a name=432:7></a> Only John speaks of Him as the Comforter.<a name=432:8></a> In general, John uses the title "the Spirit", but Luke usually says "the Holy Spirit".<a name=432:9></a> Luke has in view the public result of the Spirit's service, and says therefore in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:3">Acts  2:3</a> that the Holy Spirit "sat upon each one of them".<a name=432:10></a> The public vessel of testimony is in view in Luke's gospel, and is the vessel through which God, by the gospel, will speak to men.<a name=432:11></a> Therefore the added word "holy" is very significant in this connection, because men can very well understand that the power which is now active is a holy power, which cannot be linked with the flesh in man.<a name=432:12></a> It was never God's intention, when He sent the Holy Spirit, to give something to man that would exalt him.<a name=432:13></a> But, as I have said, John rarely uses the expression "the Holy Spirit".<a name=432:14></a> It is true that he says that the Lord would baptise with the Holy Spirit, but there it is in line with Luke's presentation, because this involves that the believer rejects the flesh and merges in the circle of the saints, But, as I

		The Lord speaks of the Spirit as "another Comforter".<a name=433:2></a> The Lord Himself has gone to heaven, and the Father has sent another Comforter to the saints, who would be with them for ever.<a name=433:3></a> Is it not wonderful that, just as there is One in heaven who serves as well as represents us there, a divine Person who is our Patron and takes up all our affairs there, so also is there another divine Person <i>down here</i> who in the same way looks after us and all our affairs here.<a name=433:4></a> He has been here since Pentecost in His wonderful service to the saints.<a name=433:5></a> It is wonderful to think that He actually has care of all the affairs of the saints and their needs.<a name=433:6></a> I do not say 'the assembly's needs', for John does not use that word.<a name=433:7></a> The scripture in question refers more to those who compose the assembly, and we, beloved brethren, who through God's grace belong to the saints, have such a Person amongst us.<a name=433:8></a> As such He has to do with the whole christian company on earth.<a name=433:9></a> There is not one among the saints on earth who is not the object of the Spirit's interest.<a name=433:10></a> So the Lord says that the world did not know the Spirit, "but ye know him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:17">John  14:17</a>).<a name=433:11></a> Beloved brethren, do we know the Spirit?<a name=433:12></a> Sometimes we make the mistake of taking Him for another spirit, and sometimes we take another spirit for Him.<a name=433:13></a> We must therefore be watchful so as to recognise and to acknowledge the Spirit.<a name=433:14></a> As the Lord said to His disciples, "ye know him, for he abides with you and shall be in you" <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:17">John  14:17</a>.<a name=433:15></a> I would therefore like to ask again if we know the Spirit, this Comforter, who has come down from the Father.<a name=433:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was thinking, dear brethren, of the Spirit of truth.<a name=448:1></a> The Lord Jesus is said to be "the truth" objectively; He says, "I am .<a name=448:2></a>.<a name=448:3></a>.<a name=448:4></a> the truth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a>) and the Spirit also is said to be "the truth" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:6">1 John  5:6</a>) as I may say in a subjective sense, in order that there should be correspondence here in the saints with Christ, while He is away; therefore the Spirit, as here, is said to be "the truth".<a name=448:5></a> The Spirit is also "the Spirit of truth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:17">John  14:17</a>), conveying what is spiritual in regard of the truth, and He enters into it in all its parts as worked out in the saints, so that what is amongst us is not merely verbal doctrine, but is quick and powerful with the Holy Spirit; He makes it living.<a name=448:6></a> So that it is altogether different from what scientific men may have from investigation.<a name=448:7></a> By investigation of the creation they obtain certain facts, but they are merely that; they are devoid of the Spirit, of the fulness and sap which the Holy Spirit would impart; but He is not here to unfold to us the creation.<a name=448:8></a> He could, of course, unfold a depth of knowledge entering into the physical system that is around us, but that is not His mission; He is here in regard of the truth in its hearing on men as it is unfolded, as I said, objectively in Christ; and He gives it power and pungency and buoyancy that cannot be found in ordinary science so-called.<a name=448:9></a> Scientific men have not stopped at investigating the handiwork of God; they have attempted to investigate Himself, and have intruded into things which they have not seen, and laid unholy hands on divine Persons, evolving a system covered by a scientific name, as such words go, called theology.<a name=448:10></a> What was evolved of necessity had to fit in with human thoughts and conceptions,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=449>[Page 449]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and they laboured apart from faith; not that one is accusing anyone, or denying that beloved children of God were engaged in it, but the whole principle is that of science so-called, and therefore it is not the Spirit of truth.<a name=449:1></a> Without the Spirit of truth we cannot have the truth according to God, however clear the letter may seem to be.<a name=449:2></a> Divine things, and especially divine Persons, must be treated of on the principle of faith, and by the Spirit of God; "for what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?<a name=449:3></a> even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.<a name=449:4></a> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:11">1 Corinthians  2:11</a> - 12); and, in verse 10, "the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God".<a name=449:5></a> Even as regards material things a true apprehension of them is on the principle of faith, for it is "by faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>).<a name=449:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, dear brethren, what opens up to us, is that the Spirit of truth is <i>come</i>.<a name=449:7></a> It is not simply an historical fact; it is an abiding fact.<a name=449:8></a> It is historical, but the point is that He is come, He is here, and He is here abidingly.<a name=449:9></a> He is here to guide us into all the truth, and to show us things to come.<a name=449:10></a> It is one of the most stupendous facts that can be stated, and bears on every true christian at this time that he may be freed from the error that is current.<a name=449:11></a> We are living in days marked peculiarly by error, and hence John's ministry emboldens us and renders us independent of and superior to the pretensions of man's mind at the present moment.<a name=449:12></a> John in his first epistle tells even the little children, "<i>ye</i> have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:20">1 John  2:20</a>).<a name=449:13></a> No scientific man can presume to that.<a name=449:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have this remarkable statement by the Lord Himself: "when <i>he</i> is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from

		himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming.<a name=450:1></a> He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:13">John  16:13</a>, 14).<a name=450:2></a> That is the great general position, dear brethren, which enters into this meeting, as it does into all such meetings: the Spirit of truth being here is available to open up things and to show us things -- the things of Christ.<a name=450:3></a> Over against that, as I said, is the working of error, of which the apostle warns the young Thessalonian christians; he says, speaking of some, that "because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved .<a name=450:4></a>.<a name=450:5></a>.<a name=450:6></a> God shall send them strong delusion" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:10">2 Thessalonians  2:10</a>,11).<a name=450:7></a> There is a moral reason for this for they "believed not the truth" (verse 12); but the apostle speaks to the Thessalonians as chosen through "sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth" <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:13">2 Thessalonians  2:13</a>.<a name=450:8></a> It speaks of that kind of belief, that lies in the sanctification of the Spirit, not merely what is acquired by earnest study, right enough as meditation and study are; but the belief of the truth which holds us and stands us in good stead against error is that which goes with the "sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth".<a name=450:9></a> So that the love of it is there; it is received, and believed in sanctification; it is held in holiness.<a name=450:10></a> As Peter says, "we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:69">John  6:69</a>).<a name=450:11></a> In no sense is holiness so imperative as in regard to the reception of the truth, for our minds are so treacherous, and we are so capable of receiving it mentally, that it becomes unholy; it becomes mixed with human thoughts.<a name=450:12></a> It is in the sanctification of the Spirit that belief of the truth has its true place.<a name=450:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>in order that we might see that not only is the truth unfolded by the Spirit, but that it may be accepted in a spurious manner, and not really received in the love of it or believed in through sanctification of the Spirit.<a name=450:14></a> The Lord has in mind that not only shall the truth be unfolded, and even

		shown, but that it should be <i>known</i>: "Ye shall know the truth" He says.<a name=451:1></a> This leads me to remark on how things are among the people of God, and how they should be, and how the Lord intended them to be.<a name=451:2></a> He intended that amongst His people there should be knowledge of the truth, such as I have been speaking of, so that His people should never have to ask, "What is truth?<a name=451:3></a>" that they should never be under the influence and power of laxity or indifference, but that the truth should be known amongst them, even though it may not be known in its fulness, for we only know in part, but that the truth should be known in principle where the Holy Spirit is, that there should be spiritual capability, a most important matter, for we have the instincts and the power which render us capable of knowing it.<a name=451:4></a> It is thus, in principle, that the truth as a whole is known.<a name=451:5></a> In virtue of the Spirit being "the truth" and "the Spirit of truth" there is that here, which, at least in principle, answers to the truth as presented in Christ.<a name=451:6></a> That is to say, the fruit and result of the epistles, and of the ministry of the apostle, correspond to the gospels.<a name=451:7></a> The gospels were intended to confirm the result of the ministry, showing that the ministry was such as it was designed to be, that the saints were left with the knowledge of the truth; they had it in their possession, The apostles under God left the truth among the saints; and that, as I said, is what John's ministry largely sets out.<a name=451:8></a> So this word of the Lord's is cited by John as being spoken to certain of the Jews which believed on Him.<a name=451:9></a> They had heard the wonderful unfolding recorded in this chapter.<a name=451:10></a> One of the most marvellous parts of Scripture is the eighth chapter of John.<a name=451:11></a> They had heard what He was saying, and many of them believed on Him.<a name=451:12></a> He said to those who believed on Him: "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:31">John  8:31</a>,32.<a name=451:13></a> You see, dear brethren, how another phase comes in here.<a name=451:14></a> "If ye continue in my word .<a name=451:15></a>.<a name=451:16></a>.<a name=451:17></a> ye

		shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:31">John  8:31</a>,32.<a name=452:1></a> It has to be admitted lamentably, that almost immediately after the wonderful ministry of the Spirit through the apostles, this verse was neglected; there was not the <i>continuance</i> in the word of Christ.<a name=452:2></a> It was the continuance in the word of Christ which would have saved the brethren, the early disciples, from that system of doctrine of which I have spoken; they would have known the truth, and the truth would have made them free; but instead of that a way was opened for men's minds; so we have theological christianity.<a name=452:3></a> It is not that the Holy Spirit has been wholly out of it, or we should not be here today; the Holy Spirit has graciously been with the assembly all the time right down to the present moment, and has made the most of what there was, and has brought about a wonderful recovery for us.<a name=452:4></a> But, dear brethren, there was the intrusion of man's mind, and consequently we have the spurious christianity that is current, and which has been so for centuries.<a name=452:5></a> Now the Lord would call us out of it and bring us back (if we have not been brought back) to the fact of the Spirit of truth; and as continuing in the word of Christ we know it.<a name=452:6></a> It is no question of saying that I think this and another thinks that; but we <i>know the truth</i>; "Ye shall know the truth" says the Lord, "and the truth shall make you free" <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:32">John  8:32</a>.<a name=452:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another thing that comes up in this respect is that the ministers that God has fitted to serve His people are obligated to see to it that believers, as they come into the faith, know the truth; it is their business.<a name=452:8></a> There is, of course, evangelical service, and Luke represents that; he it is of all the others that presents Christ evangelically; but his great concern was that Theophilus -- representative, as I may say, of new converts, young believers -- should be sure about things; and so he says that the things about which he is about to write are matters "fully believed among us" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:1">Luke  1:1</a>.<a name=452:9></a> They are not matters of question.<a name=452:10></a> It is not a tentative

		situation; there is a system of truth unfolded among us which is "fully believed".<a name=453:1></a> What does he allude to?<a name=453:2></a> He alludes, beloved, to the ministry of the apostles and how it was believed -- They are "matters fully believed among us".<a name=453:3></a> They are unquestionably true, and the Lord would lead us to that; that it is possible for the saints of God in dependence on the Holy Spirit, to arrive at the truth, that it is verily the truth, although it may not have been so regarded hitherto, it is now proved to be the truth.<a name=453:4></a> Is that not possible?<a name=453:5></a> If not, the whole position of the assembly here is untenable.<a name=453:6></a> Unless the truth can be determined, the position of the assembly is untenable.<a name=453:7></a> But it <i>is</i> possible.<a name=453:8></a> In the presence of the truth here, in the presence of the Holy Spirit, it is possible, and imperative, too, that the truth should be arrived at, so that we can say that it is "fully believed among us"; it is incontestably the truth.<a name=453:9></a> Not that the Spirit of God would not make it more fully known; He would, and does so constantly; but young believers require to be brought into these things, to be accustomed to them, and to be certain about them.<a name=453:10></a> Many are not; even as to the enjoyment of salvation there is great uncertainty and mixed feelings; and consequently there is poverty in testimony, and poverty in praise, and indefiniteness in the service of God.<a name=453:11></a> So that Luke's concern here is to make Theophilus certain.<a name=453:12></a> That is a most important matter, and every minister of Christ should take it to heart that the saints are to be assured, and assured of everything that is confirmed by the Spirit of God among us -- that it "is truth, and is no lie" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:27">1 John  2:27</a>).<a name=453:13></a> "That thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:4">Luke  1:4</a>.<a name=453:14></a> Let the young christians here take these things to heart particularly.<a name=453:15></a> Thank God if we have been instructed in any little way!<a name=453:16></a> But then we want to be sure about things and confirmed in them; and the word that enters into it pointedly says, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding

		Now, I wanted to show from the passage in the Old Testament how all this really works.<a name=454:7></a> It is a simple record of a man doing a certain thing during the period of Israel's sojourn in the wilderness.<a name=454:8></a> The position in the wilderness was peculiarly open.<a name=454:9></a> Although a goodly number went out of Egypt, and were cared for by God like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron in the wilderness, yet things were open, and any Israelite could be conversant with what occurred daily.<a name=454:10></a> They were not scattered abroad through the world; they were compacted together in the wilderness, as I may say, around the tabernacle.<a name=454:11></a> Things were open, so that any ordinary Israelite could be conversant with things that happened.<a name=454:12></a> That reminds us of the importance of keeping our ears open to hear what is current, and what are current happenings, and that we should not be indifferent as to them.<a name=454:13></a> Anything that concerns Christ or the testimony should be my concern, whether it happen here or the other side of the globe; it is all one thing; the testimony is one; it is outside of nationality.<a name=454:14></a> There is, as Scripture says, "one body, and one Spirit .<a name=454:15></a>.<a name=454:16></a>.<a name=454:17></a> one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:4">Ephesians  4:4</a> - 6).<a name=454:18></a> It is all one thing, and the divine thought is that we should be conversant with what is current, with what refers to Christ.<a name=454:19></a> For instance, the Lord says to the disciples at Caesarea-Philippi, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?<a name=454:20></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:13">Matthew  16:13</a>).<a name=454:21></a> Now they were supposed to be conversant with what men were saying about Jesus: they

		could tell the Lord what men were saying about Him.<a name=455:1></a> But then He says: "Who do ye say that I am?<a name=455:2></a>" It is not 'what do you think' but 'what do you <i>say</i>?<a name=455:3></a>'.<a name=455:4></a> In other words, What am I saying about Jesus?<a name=455:5></a> When I refer to His peerless Person, what do I say?<a name=455:6></a> May the Lord challenge us now as to what we are saying as to Jesus.<a name=455:7></a> If anyone is saying anything derogatory about the Lord, is that not a matter of my concern?<a name=455:8></a> It is: and, moreover, I should be able to tell the truth; having the Holy Spirit I should be able to say something about Jesus that counteracts the current derogatory things that are being said about Him.<a name=455:9></a> It is the business of every saint to guard the Person of the Lord Jesus, and that is seen in what we say about Him.<a name=455:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This event recorded in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#15">Numbers  15</a>was easily seen.<a name=455:11></a> Everyone in the camp might have seen this action.<a name=455:12></a> A certain man gathered sticks on the sabbath day.<a name=455:13></a> Indifferent people would say, 'Sticks are useful to make a fire', That is very often how the thing is neutralised by indifferent people; they bring in something that is certainly true, but which weakens other things that are also true, and have to be provided for.<a name=455:14></a> It is half the truth that is so dangerous and deceptive, and is usually advocated by persons who are indifferent.<a name=455:15></a> We want <i>all</i> the truth, dear brethren; and the types indicate that the truth has many parts.<a name=455:16></a> The idea of parts, or sections, is very prominent in the types, especially in Exodus; and one part may be set aside unless the saints are vigilant, for in the setting aside of it certain things may be brought forward to hide the error and shield it, but vigilance for all the parts or features of the truth will save the truth.<a name=455:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=459:1></a> Some of us have been occupied with some scriptures in <a href="../bible/2Samuel,andweconcludedthatwehaveantitypicallyinthatbookthegreatfeaturesoftheassembly.WehaveinitthethoughtofchangingoverfromonegreatfeatureofChristtoanother,ontheprincipleof"fromglorytoglory"(@.htm#2">2 Samuel, and we concluded that we have antitypically in that book the great features of the assembly. We have in it the thought of changing over from one great feature of Christ to another, on the principle of "from glory to glory" (@ 2</a>Corinthians 3: 18).<a name=459:2></a> These great features, first of all presented to us as light in the instruction we have as to the assembly, can only be experienced here by the Spirit.<a name=459:3></a> It has been remarked that the disciples scarcely understood anything the Lord said in His instructions while He was with them; it is doubtful whether they understood anything properly.<a name=459:4></a> It is by the Spirit that we understand.<a name=459:5></a> We are taught that no one knows "the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him .<a name=459:6></a>.<a name=459:7></a>.<a name=459:8></a> even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:11">1 Corinthians  2:11</a>).<a name=459:9></a> So that however much light we have as to the assembly, it will not become practical and workable apart from the Spirit and the place given to Him.<a name=459:10></a> We have in the section in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#5">2 Samuel  5</a>- 7, the idea of royalty in David and then the ark brought into a certain position in the city of David.<a name=459:11></a> Then we have the idea of sonship; then the position of the worshipper, sitting or tarrying before Jehovah within; all this involves the changing over from one feature of Christ, the royal feature seen in David, to the royal feature as in Solomon, in sonship.<a name=459:12></a> This change has to be understood, and we have to learn how to change when the time arrives in the assembly; but it has to be in spiritual power.<a name=459:13></a> So the Spirit of God as presented in Romans first brings in certain wealth, that is the love of God, and places it in the hearts of those who form the assembly; and then the Spirit gives a lead, as we are told in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>:

		I wish to speak, dear brethren, of the Spirit, the Spirit of God, in relation to the remnant of God's people.<a name=478:1></a> John, in his gospel, says more about the Spirit than any of the other evangelists, and whilst literally his gospel was circulated and read in early days, as the other gospels were, the fact that it came in latest of all, and the fact that it was written by one whom the Lord spoke of mysteriously (connecting him with His coming, spoken of in the last chapter of the gospel) suggests that it has a latter-day application.<a name=478:2></a> The great prominence given to the Spirit in it is therefore significant and interesting to us, who are in the last days.<a name=478:3></a> There can be no doubt about that.<a name=478:4></a> The last days, we are told, are perilous, perilous times shall be there.<a name=478:5></a> In <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>the apostle gives us the marks of the last days, so that by these marks we can readily tell, if we are at all spiritual, that we are in the last days, and understand their perilous character -- difficult times.<a name=478:6></a> Their perilous and difficult character renders necessary for us every bit of help that God may supply now, or may have supplied by forethought in the inspired record.<a name=478:7></a> The prominence given to the Spirit in John is therefore significant and encouraging.<a name=478:8></a> He is viewed in that gospel as One whose relations and work with any individual christian make him independent of the world, for He is seen in chapter 4 as a fountain of water springing up in the believer into eternal life.<a name=478:9></a> That is deliverance.<a name=478:10></a> However bad the world may be in a general way, or in any of our particular settings, there is this outlet, the power of the Spirit supporting us and lifting us consciously from the world into another realm, not exactly into heaven, but into eternal life; this has to be considered especially in its relation to the saints, to certain of the saints, for it is our privilege

		In all the epistles that may be called remnant epistles, the Spirit has a peculiar place, and I would stress that He ought ever to be before us in regard to the things the Lord gives us, the ministry from time to time.<a name=479:5></a> In 2 Timothy the apostle says to Timothy, "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:14">2 Timothy  1:14</a>).<a name=479:6></a> In that way we are enjoined to keep things not in a mental way, or in notebooks, but by the Spirit.<a name=479:7></a> They are thus kept in a holy way.<a name=479:8></a> I apprehend that is what is implied in the pound of ointment with which Mary anointed the Lord (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:3">John  12:3</a>).<a name=479:9></a> There is no alabaster box; the pure nard is kept from impurity by some other way or means.<a name=479:10></a> It is kept, too.<a name=479:11></a> She kept it.<a name=479:12></a> She was one who loved our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.<a name=479:13></a> Then in Revelation, which is a remnant book pre-eminently, the Spirit has a great place.<a name=479:14></a> He is mentioned as speaking to each assembly, and everyone who has an ear is enjoined to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies, not exactly 'to him', though that is included of course, but 'to the assemblies'.<a name=479:15></a> Now that speaking has peculiarly a remnant bearing, dear brethren.<a name=479:16></a> Seven times over in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3 we have that mentioned, and it comes powerfully to every exercised soul, at all times.<a name=479:17></a> From the days of Ephesus to the days of Laodicea that word is intended to affect powerfully everyone who has an ear to hear.<a name=479:18></a> The Spirit is speaking and I am obligated to hear.<a name=479:19></a> There is no suggestion in these chapters that any excuse is admissible.<a name=479:20></a> A direct unqualified obligation to hear is put on everyone who has an ear.<a name=479:21></a>

		Now the passage in 2 Timothy is very familiar to us and I read it because it introduces the fundamental thought in view of such days as those in which we are.<a name=491:5></a> This fundamental thought, of course, is prominent at the outset for the Lord had the foundation of the building in mind.<a name=491:6></a> It is spoken of typically in Solomon's foundation which alludes to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=491:7></a> What we have in the passages read is God's foundation, but <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>is Christ's foundation, Solomon's foundation, as I said.<a name=491:8></a> The idea in Solomon's foundation is, I apprehend, a foundation that cannot be improved upon.<a name=491:9></a> It is wisdom's foundation.<a name=491:10></a> Wisdom enters into christianity more than into any other thing or system.<a name=491:11></a> Not even does the physical system compare with, or equal, the wisdom that enters into christianity, which

		The point in our verse is that it is a <i>firm</i> foundation.<a name=492:4></a> It is <i>God's</i> foundation but the Spirit of God is not content with saying that -- it is God's <i>firm</i> foundation; so no one should be timid or tread on it as if it were going to give way.<a name=492:5></a> He laid the foundations of the earth; the morning stars were pleased and the sons of God were pleased.<a name=492:6></a> "The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>).<a name=492:7></a> Hannah in her prayer includes this thought, "For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:8">1 Samuel  2:8</a>); and in the Psalms we have, "like the earth which he hath founded for ever" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:69">Psalm  78:69</a>).<a name=492:8></a> All that suggests firmness.<a name=492:9></a> Let no one, therefore, tread lightly.<a name=492:10></a> There are things on which you should tread lightly and carefully, but the more heavily you tread on the foundation of God the more assured you are of it.<a name=492:11></a> Get your feet firmly on it.<a name=492:12></a> "The firm foundation of God" says the apostle, "stands, having this seal" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a>.<a name=492:13></a> A remarkable thing that, the foundation has a seal.<a name=492:14></a> It carries the seal with it, a two-sided one, as we have often said.<a name=492:15></a> Someone says, 'Well, see how few you are'.<a name=492:16></a> Why are there not more christians on earth now?<a name=492:17></a> The fact that there are only a few as far as you can see (after all, we see little), in no sense discredits the foundation.<a name=492:18></a> Were there only one on it, the foundation would be what it is.<a name=492:19></a> It can hold one or it can hold billions of people.<a name=492:20></a> What about these billions, or millions, or thousands, or hundreds?<a name=492:21></a> "The Lord knows" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a>.<a name=492:22></a> It says referring to the foundation, "having this seal", as if God foresaw that there would be this questioning.<a name=492:23></a> Look at the foundation and see what it has.<a name=492:24></a> It has a seal, not simply to say that God
