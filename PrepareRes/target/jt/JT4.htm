		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gospel gives the manner of the appearance of God's grace in the world.<a name=1:3></a> We have to note the kind of persons we meet in the opening chapter.<a name=1:4></a> We do not get here, as in Matthew, the opposition of man.<a name=1:5></a> Matthew and Luke present the birth of the Lord and the circumstances of His infancy, and a comparison of the two accounts will serve to emphasise the point of view given in Luke.<a name=1:6></a> In Matthew the birth of Christ elicits what is in the heart of man; Herod seeks to destroy the young Child.<a name=1:7></a> This is a dark picture.<a name=1:8></a> In Luke we get the bright side.<a name=1:9></a> Certain persons are brought forward who are already the subjects of divine grace; a prepared scene for the introduction of Christ.<a name=1:10></a> Zacharias is engaged in a most exalted service, offering incense to God.<a name=1:11></a> He and Elizabeth, his wife, walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<a name=1:12></a> The priesthood and the temple are owned.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The opening chapters of this gospel may be connected with the end of Malachi.<a name=1:14></a> The remnant that feared the Lord, spoken of by that prophet, reappear here.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is, that God had arranged a set of conditions which should enhance the entrance of His grace, in the birth of Christ, into this world.<a name=1:16></a> What we see here is not only the Lord's birth as a fact by itself, but God was intervening for the deliverance and blessing of man, and He would do this in a manner calculated to gain man's confidence.<a name=1:17></a> He comes in in connection with certain ones in whom beautiful traits of His grace appeared.<a name=1:18></a> Humanity

		is seen, not in its bad features, but as the subject of God's grace; and humanity is, as it were, accredited with what His grace has wrought.<a name=2:1></a> These bright traits are not to be found in man naturally, of course: in John's gospel we learn that he is utterly reprobate, and so has to be born again.<a name=2:2></a> If there is to be anything for God, it must be divinely produced, and this applies to those we are introduced to here in Luke.<a name=2:3></a> But here the power that produces what pleases God in man is not the point, but that these divinely formed traits were actually found here in men.<a name=2:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If you are to gain a man's confidence in approaching him in grace, you have to give him to understand that you fully recognise all that is commendable.<a name=2:5></a> This is an unvarying principle with God, and we see it in the epistles.<a name=2:6></a>

		Ques.<a name=2:7></a> Would you say that in the law God approached man from the other side?<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ans.<a name=2:9></a> Then it was a question of discovering to man what he was by nature; "by law is the knowledge of sin".<a name=2:10></a> Sin by the commandment became exceeding sinful.<a name=2:11></a> But here God is approaching man in grace, and so commendable things in him are prominent.<a name=2:12></a>

		In Matthew a different set of circumstances appears in connection with the Lord's appearance in manhood.<a name=2:13></a> Gentiles are in search of Him, and speak of Him to Herod.<a name=2:14></a> The king of the Jews was born, and this brought out a murderous spirit in Herod.<a name=2:15></a> The spirit of Athaliah <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#11">2 Kings  11</a>was present.<a name=2:16></a> She sought to destroy the seed royal.<a name=2:17></a> Matthew presents this side of things, and there can be no doubt that in Mark we may trace the spirit of Jezebel in opposition to Christ.<a name=2:18></a> She sought to destroy the <i>prophets</i> of the Lord.<a name=2:19></a> The Pharisees and Herodians took counsel how they might destroy Christ, <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:6">Mark  3:6</a>.<a name=2:20></a> Mark gives us the Prophet, but Luke presents the

		Ans.<a name=3:16></a> The Spirit makes prominent the character of John's parents and the circumstances of his birth.<a name=3:17></a> We have to seek to get at the significance of this.<a name=3:18></a> The same is true of Mary; the Spirit would show the character of her through whom the Son of God came into the world.<a name=3:19></a> The Spirit of God guards the Person of Christ in every way; "that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God", chapter 1: 35.<a name=3:20></a> In the cherubim in the tabernacle we have the indication, that from the moment of the Lord's birth the Father was taking care of Him.<a name=3:21></a> The cherubim of glory shadowed the

	<div class="paragraph">
		While the truth of the Lord's Person shines in Luke, and is guarded, yet, as in the type in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, what is immediately before the mind of the Spirit is that there should be a meeting place between God and man; "there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat".<a name=4:7></a> The meeting place is in Christ.<a name=4:8></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophetic utterance of Zacharias in chapter 1, coupled with that of Simeon in the temple, convey to us very largely the mind of God in regard to the birth of Christ.<a name=4:9></a> Zacharias speaks of the deliverance that had come in for Israel; Simeon goes out to the Gentiles.<a name=4:10></a> What they said, however, was not exactly in the nature of a new revelation; the prophets had abundantly testified to the things they spoke of Zacharias says, "Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, because he has visited and wrought redemption for his people, and raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of David his servant; as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began; deliverance from our enemies and out of the hand of all who hate us; to fulfil mercy with our fathers and remember his holy covenant, the oath which he swore to Abraham our father, to give us, that, saved from the hand of our enemies, we should serve him without fear in

		piety and righteousness before him all our days", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:68">Luke  1:68</a> - 75.<a name=5:1></a> Filled with the Holy Spirit, Zacharias was in the full light of the mind of God as indicated in the prophets.<a name=5:2></a> Simeon says, "mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples; a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel", chapter 2: 30.<a name=5:3></a> This is a wider view -- wider even in regard to Israel.<a name=5:4></a> Zacharias speaks of the breaking of the enemy's power, whereas Simeon views Christ as the <i>glory</i> of Israel.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke's object is not to show the dark side of things in the world at the time of the Lord's birth.<a name=5:6></a> Caesar Augustus had decreed that all the world should be taxed; a census should be made.<a name=5:7></a> The motives that may have been behind this are not in question.<a name=5:8></a> Jesus was to be born in Bethlehem, and we may say that the whole habitable world was moved to this end.<a name=5:9></a> Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem in humble simplicity, taking their place with the rest of mankind in recognising the established order of things.<a name=5:10></a> The conditions in which His parents were found were in every way accepted, there was no miraculous evading of them.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was no room in the world's inn for Christ.<a name=5:12></a> We have to note the difference between the inn here and that spoken of in chapter 10.<a name=5:13></a> The inn spoken of in this chapter is in man's world; that in chapter 10 belongs to God's world.<a name=5:14></a> The Samaritan, we may say, had influence in the latter; he had sufficient confidence in the innkeeper to commit to his care the poor man he had befriended.<a name=5:15></a>

		As we have been saying, the whole habitable earth was moved in connection with the birth of Christ.<a name=5:16></a> Augustus, doubtless, had personal motives in issuing his decree, but in heaven there was a sympathetic movement.<a name=5:17></a> It was a movement marked by intelligence and affection.<a name=5:18></a> He who is God had

		become Man; this was the most wonderful event that had ever taken place.<a name=6:1></a> God was seen of angels.<a name=6:2></a> What is remarkable about angels is, that they are always so in touch with God in what He is doing.<a name=6:3></a> At the creation "<i>all</i> the sons of God shouted for joy", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>.<a name=6:4></a> Here we have "a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying.<a name=6:5></a> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men".<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must distinguish between the angel who spoke to the shepherds and the multitude of the heavenly host; the former acted the part of an evangelist, for he was a bearer of glad tidings; the latter are moved in sympathetic and intelligent interest in what was transpiring.<a name=6:7></a> You feel that the angel who carried the glad tidings was wonderfully supported.<a name=6:8></a> There is in this affecting scene an analogy to the relation of the assembly to an evangelist.<a name=6:9></a> The evangelist is supported by the ardent sympathy of the saints.<a name=6:10></a> Here the angels are engaged in the most exalted service they ever rendered to God; they were praising Him in connection with a greater event even than the laying of the foundation of the earth.<a name=6:11></a> When the foundations of the earth were laid they showed their interest and sympathy in the divine counsels, and they followed along step by step as God's ways and testimony were unfolded, and here there is a burst of rapturous praise that the Lord had taken the form of a Babe in this world.<a name=6:12></a> It must have been marvellous to them to see a divine movement like this.<a name=6:13></a> The scene affords great light as to angelic nature: they are entirely unselfish.<a name=6:14></a> If there ever was a moment to call forth jealousy from the angels it was this, for their Creator had become Man, instead of taking a place as one of themselves; but instead of this we find rapturous delight in what was transpiring.<a name=6:15></a> Later, some of their number watch the Lord's grave.<a name=6:16></a>

		Becoming Man, Christ took a place relatively lower than angels for the suffering of death, but He is crowned with glory and honour.<a name=7:1></a> Whatever the <i>place</i>, of inferiority in which the Lord was found here it did not affect His Person; being a divine Person, He ever remains unchanged.<a name=7:2></a> Taking man's place, He was entirely for God's will, and God made Him a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death.<a name=7:3></a> But He proved Himself worthy of exaltation, and now man in His Person is rightfully in the place of greatest glory and honour.<a name=7:4></a> In the future angels shall be seen ascending and descending on the Son of man.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The service of the angels here is in every way exalted, and it is marked by intelligence.<a name=7:6></a> They appreciated what was involved in what had occurred at Bethlehem.<a name=7:7></a> God's glory should now be secured in man.<a name=7:8></a> Angels had not been charged with God's testimony on earth, but men had been; and in this they had utterly broken down, all had failed.<a name=7:9></a> The angels had witnessed this; but now they saw One in manhood who would answer to every thought of God.<a name=7:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the shepherds, there was moral correspondence in them to what was going on around them.<a name=7:11></a> Their occupation is suggestive of this.<a name=7:12></a> They were qualified both by position and heart to receive such a visitation and message.<a name=7:13></a> "Let us make our way then now as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us".<a name=7:14></a> They came and saw, and then they became evangelists: "They made known about the country the thing which had been said to them about this Child".<a name=7:15></a> Finally, they were engaged in praising God, verse 20.<a name=7:16></a> They came under the influence of the heavenly multitude in every way.<a name=7:17></a>

		Simeon represents a priestly state in the temple.<a name=8:1></a> He was there to receive, as it were, the true Ark of the testimony.<a name=8:2></a> "It was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ.<a name=8:3></a> And he came in the Spirit into the temple", verse 26.<a name=8:4></a> The scene was divinely arranged, for God would have a true priest to receive the Ark.<a name=8:5></a> Simeon received the Babe into his arms.<a name=8:6></a> Every divine thought was embodied in that Infant.<a name=8:7></a> The true Ark was there in the temple in the arms of one who valued Him, and who had light as to what was involved in His presence.<a name=8:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Exodus the cherubim come before the priest.<a name=8:9></a> They represent the Father's care for Christ, and this appears in the gospels even before His birth; the priest, or priestly state, corresponds with this on man's side.<a name=8:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>we see the cherubim, and in chapter 28 the priest is introduced.<a name=8:11></a> In a sense, Simeon has the wave offering of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>in his hands.<a name=8:12></a> The priestly state is produced in us by the Spirit.<a name=8:13></a> In all that Simeon does here he is under the influence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=8:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Simeon sees in Christ God's salvation, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel".<a name=8:15></a> It was a more extended view than that of Zacharias.<a name=8:16></a> Then he says to Mary, "Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel".<a name=8:17></a> The <i>fall</i> must come in our history before the <i>rising again</i>.<a name=8:18></a> The Lord should be a sign spoken against, and a sword should go through Mary's soul.<a name=8:19></a> The accomplishment of God's thoughts of grace did not lie in connection with a path of outward glory and worldly favour, but of reproach, and death at the end.<a name=8:20></a> This would reveal the thoughts of many hearts.<a name=8:21></a>

		We have now to consider the boyhood and manhood of our Lord.<a name=9:7></a> What the Spirit emphasises here in verses 40 - 52 is the genuineness of His humanity.<a name=9:8></a> First, we have, "the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him".<a name=9:9></a> Then in verse 52, "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man".<a name=9:10></a> Becoming incarnate, true humanity is seen in the Lord in every stage of it from infancy to mature manhood.<a name=9:11></a> Every phase was real and perfectly set forth.<a name=9:12></a> There was nothing, we may say, which was not normal.<a name=9:13></a> Whether infancy, boyhood or manhood, each was genuine.<a name=9:14></a> It is the vessel of grace that is before us in Luke, and He touched man at every point or stage of man's existence.<a name=9:15></a> Only the Spirit of God could present in such simplicity what is fraught with such infinite depths of meaning and results.<a name=9:16></a> It is the outward, every -- day history of the Lord that is presented, and all is infinitely perfect, but set forth in such ordinary circumstances that the most lowly and uncultured could easily understand and appreciate.<a name=9:17></a> In this way God would make Him, in whom He was approaching men in grace, interesting and attractive to all.<a name=9:18></a>

		The providential circumstances in which the Lord's parents were found were fully accepted; although His wonderful "understanding and answers" would secure Him a place among the doctors at Jerusalem, He returned with Joseph and Mary to Nazareth, and was in subjection to them.<a name=10:12></a> Nazareth was obscure and despised, but this mattered nothing to Him to whom God's will was everything.<a name=10:13></a> In Nazareth "he was brought up"; the quiet grace and gentleness, and every lovely feature that came out in Christ, were displayed in outwardly mean surroundings in an obscure spot.<a name=10:14></a> And all foreshadowed the marvellous testimony of grace that was to follow.<a name=10:15></a> The divine way of reaching the hearts of men with the gospel is thus seen; suspicion as to God's nature, which ever lurks in our natural hearts, is overthrown when we apprehend that God

		CHAPTER 16
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The bearing of these chapters is as adjusting the position of Jew and Gentile in relation to the testimony.<a name=79:1></a> The unjust steward indicates that the rejection of the Jews is contemplated.<a name=79:2></a> While the parable has a moral bearing now, yet the primary view-point is that the testimony had been committed to the Jews, which involved that God was to have a place with them, but it had come about that man had usurped the place.<a name=79:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The steward expresses the idea that the wise and prudent in Israel take the opportunity of providing for the future, while the mass of the nation act foolishly.<a name=79:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The presence of the Lord brought in the thought of eternal life; the nation would be cast out, but He opens up a place in the eternal order of things and the wise take advantage of it.<a name=79:5></a> They were wise for the future.<a name=79:6></a> Barnabas is an illustration of one who used what he had here with regard to heavenly things.<a name=79:7></a> Money cannot help you in eternity, but can be of value while saints are in the body.<a name=79:8></a> There would be no money or exchange but for the incoming of sin, but they are necessary things now while we are in the body in view of the present condition of things.<a name=79:9></a>

		The end of chapter 13 shows the house left desolate, the Jews are not now privileged as a nation.<a name=79:10></a> The gospel is not specially presented to them.<a name=79:11></a> The Lord had opened to them the eternal system, and He points out their folly in not embracing such an opportunity.<a name=79:12></a> The sons of this world were Jews who had the position of being sons of fight, but were not true to it.<a name=79:13></a>

		Two masters cannot be served, but Israel chose mammon instead of God.<a name=80:3></a> The Christian is called to the service of God, mammon cannot be preferred to it.<a name=80:4></a> It is significant that the connection between covetousness and idolatry is very intimate, they are really the same.<a name=80:5></a> The important thing both for Israel and the assembly is to discern the call to the service of God in its full meaning.<a name=80:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The parable of the rich man and Lazarus emphasizes the eternal end of the man who elects mammon instead of God.<a name=80:7></a> It is characteristic of Luke to give the view of what is eternal; Matthew and Mark present more the present aspect of the testimony.<a name=80:8></a> In the end of chapter 16 the Jew is shown as the despiser of the grace of God, no matter what the dispensation.<a name=80:9></a> The rich man is seen as providentially possessing everything here, but only uses it in the present, while the poor man lay at his gate desiring the crumbs; this refers to the place of the Jew and Gentile.<a name=80:10></a> The poor man in Abraham's bosom showed that the Gentile had secured a better place than the Jew, for whom there was no better place than earth, but Abraham was no longer on earth, so that a place in heaven is indicated.<a name=80:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Lazarus in a way shows a pressing into the kingdom (verse 16); it was a very unwelcome position to be laid at the rich man's gate.<a name=80:12></a> Pressing into the kingdom is a different thought from access to heaven; we are carried into heaven.<a name=80:13></a> There was that here which the Lord introduced which has to be forced into in the face of determined opposition; the thought of the kingdom of God is moral, and one has to see the position the Lord occupied here.<a name=80:14></a> "The kingdom of God is among you", but nature is

		In verses 7 to 10 we have very valuable instruction for all who serve the Lord; we cannot take credit for what we are ordered to do, the question is whether we even do so much.<a name=82:6></a> The Lord is not here telling them what He is actually thinking of their service, but He <i>is</i> thinking.<a name=82:7></a> We, however, cannot take account of our own service.<a name=82:8></a>

		Now, John is not on that line.<a name=187:6></a> John is not concerned about the race exactly, although he is intensely evangelical.<a name=187:7></a> What he is concerned about is that those who had confessedly believed through the official gospel were drawing back; they were giving up things and this is a condition exactly corresponding with our own; wonderful light has been vouchsafed by God and received widely, but, alas!<a name=187:8></a> many are going back.<a name=187:9></a> Hence John states the effect of Christ's ministry, as recorded in chapter 6, where He is said to be the "bread of God".<a name=187:10></a> He tells us how Jesus spoke and what He said.<a name=187:11></a> He tells us that Jesus said, that His words were spirit and life, and he tells us that many of His disciples went back and walked no more with Him.<a name=187:12></a> Now note!<a name=187:13></a> "Many of his <i>disciples</i>;" those who had professedly believed.<a name=187:14></a> There was "a hard saying", and they went back.<a name=187:15></a> I refer to that because of present conditions.<a name=187:16></a> It is a time, not exactly of gathering.<a name=187:17></a> God <i>has</i> gathered wonderfully; the testimony has had a wonderful presentation, thank God, and many have responded to it.<a name=187:18></a> But, alas!<a name=187:19></a> in many respects it is a time of "going away", turning back and "walking no more" with the truth.<a name=187:20></a> The Lord says, "Will <i>ye</i> also go away?<a name=187:21></a>" To my mind that is a most touching appeal; and the ready response of Peter is, "to <i>whom</i> [note the <i>word whom</i> not to <i>what</i>] shall we go?<a name=187:22></a>"

		Well, now, the question is, beloved friends, whether we <i>believe on the Son</i>.<a name=188:12></a> You will find that all through in John's gospel the result of the miracles is that somebody believed; and after recording all the signs John says Jesus did many more than these.<a name=188:13></a> "Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples".<a name=188:14></a> Not in the presence of the world, but in the presence of His <i>disciples</i>, the point being the holding of those who professed to believe.<a name=188:15></a> He did the signs in the presence of His disciples.<a name=188:16></a> The first is in chapter 2, and the result of it was that His <i>disciples</i> believed.<a name=188:17></a> So John says: "These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name".<a name=188:18></a> Hence the importance

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will observe that the descent of the Spirit on Christ in John's gospel is not to anoint Him.<a name=189:3></a> In Matthew and in Luke it is to anoint Him; but in John, where the Spirit descended and abode upon Him, it was simply to designate the Person; not to qualify Him for service, but to call attention to the Person.<a name=189:4></a> That Person was qualified inherently.<a name=189:5></a> In His own Person He is the Son, and He is supreme, hence John the baptist tells us: "I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptise with water, the same said unto me.<a name=189:6></a> Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptiseth with the Holy Ghost.<a name=189:7></a> And I saw, and bear record that this is the Son of God".<a name=189:8></a> In other words, the coming of the Spirit on the Son, according to John's gospel, is to designate the Person, and that to one who ought to have known Him if He could have been known after the flesh.<a name=189:9></a> <i>But the Son cannot be known after the flesh</i>.<a name=189:10></a> If any one could have known Christ after the flesh it would have been the Baptist.<a name=189:11></a> He was his relative, contemporary with him, of the same age, and yet John did not know the Son.<a name=189:12></a> Unquestionably he knew Jesus, the reputed son of Joseph and Mary, but the Son of God he did not know; he became introduced to the Son -- to the Person, by the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him.<a name=189:13></a> So in John's gospel the Spirit of God brings forward the Son to meet conditions such as those in which we live.<a name=189:14></a>

		My thought on this occasion is to seek to point out the importance of the preaching, so as to enlist your sympathy in it, and when I speak of the preaching I include in my thought not only that which meets the need of man, but also that which unfolds the "unsearchable riches of the Christ".<a name=267:2></a> The thought of preaching is very prominent in the Scriptures, so prominent, indeed, that we cannot but see that it is of great importance with God; of such importance that in a certain sense the power of the kingdom is subordinated to it.<a name=267:3></a> I would cite as a proof of that the book of Ecclesiastes.<a name=267:4></a> In that book, as many of you will recall, the speaker opens by introducing himself as "the preacher", and he tells us that he was David's son, and he was king in Jerusalem; and then further, by way of confirmation of the ground upon which he stood, he says, "I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem".<a name=267:5></a> That is to say, the <i>preacher</i> was king.<a name=267:6></a> In the minds of most the idea of a king is much greater than that of a preacher, but according to the book which formally introduces to us "the preacher" we are told, not that the king is a preacher, but that the preacher was king.<a name=267:7></a> In other words, that as preacher he had all the advantages of his position as king.<a name=267:8></a> His official capacity as king and the power involved in it afforded him an open door everywhere.<a name=267:9></a> Now that is a very great conception, and it only shows what the preaching is in God's account, and how desirous He is that the preaching should reach all.<a name=267:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying, the idea of the preacher is very prominent in the Scriptures.<a name=267:11></a> The first preacher was Noah; he was not a king.<a name=267:12></a> One would not judge that he had much power in the world to which he

		preached.<a name=268:1></a> My impression is, that he was under great reproach, and in that way greatly limited.<a name=268:2></a> The preaching also continued, as we know, to Abraham's time, and we find in Jonah a preacher, a man who was hardly equal to his message.<a name=268:3></a> I need not dwell upon Jonah; he was not a king.<a name=268:4></a> He was a man between whom and his preaching there was a great disparity; he was not fully sympathetic with what he preached.<a name=268:5></a> Instead of going to Nineveh he would go to Tarshish; but God had the preaching in view, and He wished that the preaching should go to Nineveh, and the preacher whom He designed to carry the preaching there <i>must</i> go, hence Jonah has to be qualified for his mission by death and resurrection, so that he carries his message to the Ninevites as one who had, in principle, passed through death on to the ground of resurrection.<a name=268:6></a> But Jonah was not a king.<a name=268:7></a> The man who is formally called "the preacher" in the scripture I have referred to is Solomon, and, as I said, as preacher he was king.<a name=268:8></a>

		Now I would desire in a very special way that each one here should get into his soul the conditions under which the gospel has been announced, and is being announced.<a name=268:9></a> In referring to Old Testament personages one is apt to eulogise them because of what they were personally, but that is not according to the Spirit.<a name=268:10></a> In order to get the benefit of an Old Testament type, whether it be a thing or a person, we have to transfer our minds to Christ.<a name=268:11></a> Hence, if I refer to Solomon I refer to him as a type of Christ, and what I see is that in the preaching of today the preacher is Christ, and that whilst the kingdom is of great importance in other respects, for the moment it is subordinated to the preaching; so that instead of its being preached now that Solomon was king at Jerusalem, it is preached that Christ is Lord at the right hand of God; that is the position.<a name=268:12></a> I am not for the moment dwelling upon what is preached.<a name=268:13></a>

		Well, now, the appeal that I would make to you, especially in regard to that which has opened up to us during these meetings, is that there might be sympathy in the testimony of Christ; that is really what characterises the "virtuous woman" of <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>.<a name=270:10></a> She is hard to find, for we are told "her price is far above rubies", and what she represents is faithfulness to Christ during His absence, really those who care for and maintain His interests while He is away.<a name=270:11></a>

		Saul of Tarsus was the avowed antagonist of Christ; we are told that he left Jerusalem with a letter from the high priest.<a name=271:7></a> The chief priests were the <i>professed</i> representatives of God in Jerusalem, but in reality they were but agents of diabolical energy against Christ.<a name=271:8></a> That is what they were, and they had found a man after their own heart.<a name=271:9></a> They had in Saul a man who in his very inner being was antagonistic to Christ and the testimony of Christ.<a name=271:10></a> We are told he was <i>breathing</i> out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord.<a name=271:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to show you the wonderful triumph of the great Preacher, and the great Defender of the church, for Christ is both.<a name=271:12></a> He meets Saul by the way, and He meets him, beloved friends, with heavenly light.<a name=271:13></a> What a marvellous way to meet an antagonist!<a name=271:14></a> "A light from heaven" shines down on Saul; and words fall from the lips of Jesus: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=271:15></a>" And what is the answer from Saul?<a name=271:16></a> "<i>Lord</i>, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=271:17></a>" What a complete triumph!<a name=271:18></a> so that Saul, instead of entering Damascus as the emissary of the high priest at Jerusalem, as the

	<div class="paragraph">
		enemy to Christians, enters it as one who is subdued to Christ, as one into whose soul had shone the light of heaven.<a name=272:1></a> That is the result of the Preacher being King.<a name=272:2></a> In His kingly authority Christ brings that man to the ground; and as the Preacher He takes him by the hand, and sets him up as <i>His</i> preacher; so that instead of being an emissary of the high priest to Damascus, he becomes Christ's great preacher to the Gentiles; he becomes the vessel of heavenly light from a glorified Christ to a Gentile world.<a name=272:3></a> What is it that gives lustre to Paul's preaching?<a name=272:4></a> It is the light from heaven.<a name=272:5></a> Into his soul came light, the light of a Man who is God's Son in heavenly glory; and Paul was so impressed with the revelation that immediately he announced in the synagogue that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=272:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want you to ponder especially the result of the intervention of the authority of Christ.<a name=272:7></a> It was not only that the gospel preached by the twelve was secured, but additional light was vouchsafed.<a name=272:8></a> You will find that every divine victory involves an increase of light.<a name=272:9></a> Not only was the gospel which the twelve preached secured, but the precious truth of God's Son in heaven, as unfolded in Paul's gospel, was added.<a name=272:10></a> Well, now, the other feature of the testimony upon which I would dwell for a moment is that which is contained in the following chapter; and here we get further light from heaven.<a name=272:11></a> Now that the Lord has His own preacher we are led into the understanding of the extent of the congregation.<a name=272:12></a> The congregation is the whole race of men.<a name=272:13></a> Peter is on the house-top at Joppa, and the sheet with four corners descends from heaven.<a name=272:14></a> Already we have had the thought before us today that <i>four</i> is a numeral that suggests what is universal; now nothing can prove that more forcibly than the four-cornered sheet.<a name=272:15></a> What was signified was, that the mind of God, the mind of heaven, for it came from heaven,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=273>[Page 273]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is universal in its bearing.<a name=273:1></a> The mind of heaven comes into view in the four-cornered sheet.<a name=273:2></a> I do not enlarge upon it; I only want to show that now that the Lord has His preacher He indicates that all men are in His mind for blessing.<a name=273:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, there is just one other thought, and that is, that the preaching is the means, as we have already seen today, by which Christ secures the treasure of His heart.<a name=273:4></a> Are you not sympathetic with Him?<a name=273:5></a> If there was one thing that marked the apostle Paul it was his desire to present to Christ the assembly as a chaste virgin.<a name=273:6></a> John the baptist heard "the voice of the bridegroom", but Paul got nearer to Christ than that.<a name=273:7></a> I liken Paul to the mighty men of David who discerned the longings of his soul when he said "oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!<a name=273:8></a>" they broke through the host of the Philistines and presented the water to David.<a name=273:9></a> Paul was the great "mighty man" in Christianity; it was he who got so near to the heart of Christ that he discerned the beatings of His heart, and his energy took character from it.<a name=273:10></a> He ever had in view to present the assembly to Christ as a chaste virgin.<a name=273:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these three things I have noted you may gather up something as to what is involved in the preaching, and if you see the importance of it, and if your heart is touched by the love of Christ, what will mark you will be sympathetic activity.<a name=273:12></a> I am very far from wishing to put you under bondage, or from heaping responsibility upon you; but I do see this, that the appeal for the "virtuous woman" is in order that there should be absolute devotedness to the interests of Christ during His absence.<a name=273:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when we come to 2 Timothy, one thread running right, through the epistle is Paul's faithfulness to the testimony.<a name=273:14></a> He stood unflinchingly by the testimony, even when he appeared before the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=274>[Page 274]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		emperor, before him who represented the combined power of the world.<a name=274:1></a> He says, "At first my answer no man stood with me"; all forsook him.<a name=274:2></a> But he adds, "The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known".<a name=274:3></a> That is, Paul stood unflinchingly for the preaching, and as he stood by it the Lord stood by him.<a name=274:4></a> There is nothing to fear, beloved friends, the Lord will unfailingly stand by what is of God.<a name=274:5></a> Christ is King, and He uses His power to support the preacher, so that the preaching might be fully known and that the Gentiles should hear.<a name=274:6></a> Now notice, it was not only that the preaching should be fully known, and that all the Gentiles should hear, but that they should hear by the appointed preacher.<a name=274:7></a> The Lord would not allow Satan one iota of advantage.<a name=274:8></a> It is as if He said, 'Paul is the preacher, and the preaching is to be heard through him'.<a name=274:9></a> The apostle says, "that by me the preaching might be fully known".<a name=274:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another thing that I would call attention to in Timothy, and which ought to appeal specially to us, for Timothy represents the kind of ministry that would replace the apostle's, is that the instruction comes to Timothy from Paul in terms of the most intimate affection; he is addressed by Paul as "son".<a name=274:11></a> Christian obligation thus involves peculiar pleasure.<a name=274:12></a> I do not enlarge upon it.<a name=274:13></a> You may all recall how Paul addressed Timothy as "My dearly beloved son".<a name=274:14></a> Do you think that is only for Timothy?<a name=274:15></a> No; it is in such language that the Spirit of God would stir up the hearts of God's people <i>now</i>.<a name=274:16></a> All obligations are pressed upon us in terms of endearing affection.<a name=274:17></a> So that in appealing to you tonight it is in no wise to put you under bondage; but I do say this, that it is sorrowful to consider the people of God gathered together and enjoying the things of God, and yet to turn away and enter upon pursuits

		and paths of selfishness and ambition in this world.<a name=275:1></a> It is sorrowful, and may God preserve us from it!<a name=275:2></a> The Spirit of God would appeal to us as to what stand we are going to take in these evil days; and He presents to us Paul as the great model servant.<a name=275:3></a> He sets him before us as the servant who stood unflinchingly by the testimony in the presence of all the power of evil; and shows us that there was complete deliverance.<a name=275:4></a> He says, "And the Lord <i>shall</i> deliver me".<a name=275:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I close I will point out one other thing, and that is, that the Lord will not throw you aside when the testimony is over.<a name=275:6></a> We all know how vessels may be taken up and used and when they no longer interest us are thrown aside.<a name=275:7></a> In His government God may use wicked men, or even Satan himself, and they come under His judgment at the end; but in the service of the gospel He uses clean vessels, and these are preserved.<a name=275:8></a> Paul says, "he shall deliver me, and <i>will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom</i>".<a name=275:9></a> The Lord will not throw the vessel aside.<a name=275:10></a> No, beloved friends, the fact is, that before He deigns to use you here He shows you that you are already a vessel <i>prepared for glory</i>.<a name=275:11></a> He has prepared us for that.<a name=275:12></a> He uses us down here for the moment.<a name=275:13></a> He uses us, as we have been saying, during the provisional period, and when this is ended we enter into eternal rest and glory.<a name=275:14></a> He has formed us for glory; the very Spirit which we have received from Christ is the Spirit of glory, for "whom he has justified, these also he has glorified".<a name=275:15></a> We are used down here for the moment in connection with the testimony, and we are preserved in connection with the testimony, but not only that, we are preserved for a heavenly position.<a name=275:16></a> As Jude puts it, He is "able to present us faultless in the presence of his glory with exultation".<a name=275:17></a> Such is the great end which the Spirit of God holds out before us, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=276>[Page 276]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		great end of the path we are on as connected with the testimony of God.<a name=276:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is all I have to say, and, as I said at the beginning, my aim is to induce among us sympathy in the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=276:2></a> As Paul said to Timothy, "Be not ashamed of the testimony of our Lord".<a name=276:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God grant that not only what I have said tonight, but what we have dwelt upon during these meetings, may have a lasting effect upon us and that nothing may divert our hearts from the sympathy with the testimony of our Lord until He comes.<a name=276:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to say a few words in regard to the King and the virtuous woman.<a name=277:2></a> I think I may be able to show that they go together; that is, God's King, who is Christ, and the virtuous woman, who is the assembly, are bound up together.<a name=277:3></a> The book of Proverbs, as we know, is the book of wisdom, and it is a very fitting conclusion that we should find in the last chapter an expression of wisdom in the virtuous woman.<a name=277:4></a> The chapter to my mind agrees in a sense with the teaching of 1 Corinthians and Ephesians.<a name=277:5></a> In 1 Corinthians you get Christ as wisdom.<a name=277:6></a> He is said to be the wisdom of God and the power of God.<a name=277:7></a> Whereas in the epistle to the Ephesians we are told that the all-various wisdom of God is now witnessed in the assembly by the angels.<a name=277:8></a> So in the ending of God's ways, all of which set forth wisdom, you get wisdom expressed livingly.<a name=277:9></a> First of all in Christ, and, secondly, in the assembly.<a name=277:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to my mind it is a most interesting chapter in that way; for king Lemuel undoubtedly alludes to Solomon.<a name=277:11></a> Solomon is, in a sense, the ideal king in Scripture, and it is imperative that every one should become acquainted with the king.<a name=277:12></a> So I feel it proper to call attention to Lemuel, taking him as alluding to Solomon, who is a figure of Christ.<a name=277:13></a> You will never understand Christianity until you know the King, and I think what is said in regard to this personage would convey to us who the King is.<a name=277:14></a> We cannot fail to see Christ in what marked this king.<a name=277:15></a> It says in the eighth verse, "Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction".<a name=277:16></a> Now I think that this passage answers to Christ exactly.<a name=277:17></a> And another

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=278>[Page 278]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thing I would say in regard to the King is that salvation stands connected with Him.<a name=278:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer for a moment to the gospel of Luke: a gospel which, as we all know, presents Christ in relation to man.<a name=278:2></a> There can be no question that man in his natural state is deprived of speech, and, moreover, he is appointed to destruction.<a name=278:3></a> The gospel of Luke presents to us Christ as intervening on the part of man.<a name=278:4></a> You get that in Zacharias in the first chapter of Luke.<a name=278:5></a> He, by the way, was dumb; he had been stricken dumb, as you will remember, because of his unbelief; but directly his mouth is opened he speaks of Christ.<a name=278:6></a> As able to speak again he calls attention to this, that God had raised up a horn of deliverance in the house of His servant David; that is to say, salvation for man is connected with the King.<a name=278:7></a> He did not say that God had raised up a horn of salvation in the house of Abraham, nor in the house of Jacob, but in the house of David.<a name=278:8></a> Now that gives you a clue as to the mode by which God has effected salvation.<a name=278:9></a> The horn in Scripture is symbolical of power, and in this instance it refers to Christ.<a name=278:10></a> Christ was God's Horn of salvation, and He was raised up in the house of the king.<a name=278:11></a> David was the king and God intervened in the house of David and raised up a Horn of salvation.<a name=278:12></a> I refer to that to show that in order to know salvation you have to become acquainted with the King.<a name=278:13></a> Zacharias in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>goes on to say, "that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him .<a name=278:14></a>.<a name=278:15></a>.<a name=278:16></a> all the days of our life".<a name=278:17></a> As obtaining salvation from our enemies at the hand of Christ, we should serve God without fear, all the days of our life.<a name=278:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want, therefore, to call your attention to the King, and I am greatly encouraged in what is stated here of Lemuel.<a name=278:19></a> He was to open his mouth for the dumb in the cause of those who were appointed for destruction.<a name=278:20></a> Now here we get a class of persons

		that the Lord Jesus Christ intervenes for.<a name=279:1></a> He intervenes for those who are dumb.<a name=279:2></a> Can He not speak?<a name=279:3></a> I know of nothing that is more intensely interesting for man than the gospel of Luke, which is Christ here upon earth in manhood in relation to man before God, and I want you to place yourself, as it were, in the midst of humanity and regard yourself in that light as related to Christ.<a name=279:4></a> You have One that can speak.<a name=279:5></a> He has taken up a place in relation to man Godward and He can speak.<a name=279:6></a> Man is dumb.<a name=279:7></a> He cannot articulate naturally a single syllable Godward.<a name=279:8></a> He is utterly incapable of pleading his cause in the presence of God.<a name=279:9></a> The Lord Jesus Christ became Man, and He is perfectly capable to take up the cause of man here upon earth and plead it in the presence of God.<a name=279:10></a>

		Now you will never understand the gospel until you see Christ in relation to man before God.<a name=279:11></a> Directly you do see it your heart is relieved and unbounded confidence fills it.<a name=279:12></a> You have a Man as Head who is qualified to speak to God in regard to you.<a name=279:13></a> That was what marked Christ.<a name=279:14></a> He can speak to man, but He also can speak to God.<a name=279:15></a> Everybody else is dumb.<a name=279:16></a> It is not that people do not endeavour to speak, but if you do, God shuts your mouth, and if you really know yourself in the presence of God, you put your hand upon your mouth.<a name=279:17></a> You have nothing to say; you are perfectly unqualified to speak to God.<a name=279:18></a> You have no footing before Him; and even if you had you could not speak.<a name=279:19></a> Christ can speak.<a name=279:20></a> The Lord Jesus Christ has taken up the cause of humanity, and in the presence of God He speaks on behalf of humanity.<a name=279:21></a> He speaks to God.<a name=279:22></a> He opens His mouth for the dumb.<a name=279:23></a> Have you arrived at the stage where you feel you are utterly without a word?<a name=279:24></a> You have nothing to say to God?<a name=279:25></a> The Lord takes your place.<a name=279:26></a> He opens His mouth for the dumb.<a name=279:27></a> He takes up man's cause in the presence of God and

		Then it says, "in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction".<a name=280:4></a> I need not say that that refers to man.<a name=280:5></a> It may be that you are not aware of the fact, but it is true that you are appointed to destruction; this is what Lemuel was to do.<a name=280:6></a> And, moreover, it says, "Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy".<a name=280:7></a> I cannot enlarge upon these things, but I commend them to you that you might understand how these things are seen perfectly in Christ.<a name=280:8></a> He takes up the cause of those who are appointed to destruction.<a name=280:9></a> Has He not taken up our cause?<a name=280:10></a> <i>The</i> Lord Jesus Christ took man's place as appointed to destruction.<a name=280:11></a> He took up your cause and mine before God.<a name=280:12></a> He went to Calvary.<a name=280:13></a> He went to the cross, and there He exhausted the judgment.<a name=280:14></a> The judgment that was duly ours He took upon Himself vicariously as man.<a name=280:15></a> The judgment that lay upon us who were appointed to destruction, the Lord Jesus Christ has borne.<a name=280:16></a> And now our place, the place of the believer, is assured by His place in the presence of God.<a name=280:17></a> I do wish I might be able to convey to every heart here the position that Christ occupies at the present moment before God in relation to humanity.<a name=280:18></a> Directly it enters into your heart you have light, you have confidence.<a name=280:19></a> Peter tells us that God "has raised him from the dead and given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God".<a name=280:20></a> Directly you see that the One who took your place on the cross has been taken up by God, and placed in heaven in

		Now, you will find that at the outset of God's special dealings on the earth after the flood, that in the souls of those who had faith He created need; He created the sense of the need of a man to live before God.<a name=299:1></a> He withheld children from those who were the early depositaries of the light of the testimony, as we see in Abraham and in Isaac; hence you find that Abraham had longings; he desired to have an heir.<a name=299:2></a> He says to Jehovah "Behold, to me thou hast given no seed; and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>.<a name=299:3></a> That was a bitter contemplation for the patriarch; and then, subsequently, at the instigation of Sarah, he undertook to bring in an heir after the flesh.<a name=299:4></a> I refer to this to show you how God, as it were, caused to be produced in the heart of Abraham the sense of the need of a man to continue.<a name=299:5></a> Abraham knew that he was not to continue: he accepted that death lay upon man; it is a cardinal principle of faith to accept the divine sentence.<a name=299:6></a> In fact, faith is always accumulative of light that preceded it.<a name=299:7></a> So that the light that had been revealed was embraced by Abraham.<a name=299:8></a> He bowed to the fact that death was upon him; he was not to continue; he was to pass away in death.<a name=299:9></a> Hence the great desire for one to continue.<a name=299:10></a> So he brought in Ishmael.<a name=299:11></a> Ishmael is a remarkable product.<a name=299:12></a> Although he had a place with God on account of Abraham, he was not to continue: there was no covenant made with Ishmael.<a name=299:13></a> Abraham brought him in.<a name=299:14></a>

		into our souls if we are to understand the order of man that is to live before God, is that he is not as Adam, a product simply of God's <i>creatorial</i> power.<a name=301:1></a> God formed the man out of dust and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.<a name=301:2></a> That does not convey to us the idea of the man that is to remain before God: the man that is to continue before God is a man out of death; and in order to come out of it, he has to go into it.<a name=301:3></a> Now, that is what I want specially to dwell upon.<a name=301:4></a> You will find in the Scriptures that those who had faith laid hold upon divine principles.<a name=301:5></a> Take, for instance, the prophet Hosea; you will find in his prophecy the acceptance of the conditions in which man (Israel) was found as the result of sin, and a record of the exercises of those who had faith.<a name=301:6></a> Now, what were these exercises?<a name=301:7></a> "Come and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up; after two days will he revive us; in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight;" <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:1">Hosea  6:1</a>, 2.<a name=301:8></a> "Come, let us return to the Lord;" that is one exercise.<a name=301:9></a> There had been departure from God, and God's hand in discipline was upon them.<a name=301:10></a> "He has torn us and he will heal us, and then after two days will he revive us".<a name=301:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must bear in mind that the prophets are an addition to the Law.<a name=302:3></a> There was the Law; it was a testimony from God, asserting His authority over the souls of men; but the prophets bring in His wondrous patience in waiting for men; and then, moreover, they announce the principle, as wrought out in the soul, of life from among the dead.<a name=302:4></a> You will find in Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, and others of the prophets, that they bring in a measure of light for the encouragement of the remnant bringing out that God would intervene and accomplish His purpose on the principle of life from among the dead.<a name=302:5></a> Hence, Hosea is enabled to bring forward the expression of the exercises of those who had faith.<a name=302:6></a> He says, "Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.<a name=302:7></a> After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:1">Hosea  6:1</a>,2.<a name=302:8></a>

		We do well to ponder the exercises that they went through.<a name=303:13></a> I have ventured to select Hezekiah as giving expression to these exercises in a remarkable way.<a name=303:14></a> He had been down into death in principle; all his hopes were shattered; but he turned to God.<a name=303:15></a> It is a great thing to learn to turn to God in everything.<a name=303:16></a> I know of no outlet from pressure but in turning to God: you may try other remedies, but you will find that there is really no outlet from pressure in this world but to turn to God; and He will never fail you.<a name=303:17></a> Take Jonah, for instance; ho went down to the bottom of the mountains; he says, "All thy billows and thy waves passed over me;" but he cried from the whale's belly; he cried from the lowest point, and his voice was heard, and

		Now, I want to allude to the principle of it.<a name=304:5></a> He prayed to God on the ground of what he was, on the ground of what he had been for God; he said, "Remember, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight".<a name=304:6></a> Now, God did not spurn this; there is not the least indication that there was any resentment on the part of God; the ground that Hezekiah took was just; it was, in other words, <i>Christ</i>, in the principle of it.<a name=304:7></a> Who could turn to God on the ground of his personal merits but the Lord Jesus?<a name=304:8></a> No one, beloved friends.<a name=304:9></a> What I wish to call attention to is this, that the principle on which life is brought in for man is founded on human merit in Christ, only made good to man, of course, through Christ's death.<a name=304:10></a> The Lord Jesus Christ was here as man in the midst of death, and He established a claim with God, on the ground of personal merit, on the ground of the delight that He afforded to God.<a name=304:11></a> He established a claim upon God.<a name=304:12></a> As Son of man He has come in and inherited all the obligations that rested upon man; and as Son of man He has made all good.<a name=304:13></a> In this way He has set forth the order of man that answers to the mind of God.<a name=304:14></a> But in order that others should have part in this He must die, so as to remove sacrificially the order of man that had sinned.<a name=304:15></a> Thus He has practically established for us a title to life.<a name=304:16></a> But we do not get into the good of it apart from the exercises that we have recorded here.<a name=304:17></a>

		and may find an expression in each one of us.<a name=305:1></a> I may sum them up briefly under two heads; the first having reference to the pressure and the divine penalty, the just unerring government of God in what might be deemed adverse circumstances; then on the other hand, there are the exercises and affections cultivated in the unclouded light of what God is as revealed to us in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=305:2></a> Hezekiah summed all up in the light of the great result he had reached.<a name=305:3></a> He said, "by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit".<a name=305:4></a> What a conclusion to arrive at!<a name=305:5></a> Look back on your history from the time you were brought into the world; for, remember, God's governmental dealings began then.<a name=305:6></a> Look back, as now delivered and in the full light of the presence of God revealed, and see what is the sum total of it all; the adverse things, the bitter things, the humiliating things that you have been in?<a name=305:7></a> Hezekiah says, "By these things men live".<a name=305:8></a> He spoke for others as well as for himself; once he had light in his soul he knew that others lived; he was only one among many; he says, by these things <i>men</i> live; in other words, all these things are simply messengers of God for the help of souls.<a name=305:9></a> So with each of us, God's great thought is not only that we should be in the light of life, but that our souls should enter into it; and He sends all these special messengers to us to aid us to this end.<a name=305:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Hezekiah goes on further and says, "thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;" and then, "The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day".<a name=305:11></a> He is getting on now to what I might call the up-line.<a name=305:12></a> There are, as it were, in our experiences horizontal lines in which we move here under the government of God, where we are called to taste the bitterness of death in our spirits; all these things afford us help, so that we may live.<a name=305:13></a> Then he goes on to the up-line, as I may

		call it, which ends in the house of God.<a name=306:1></a> Now, you may wonder why I use that expression <i>the up-line</i>.<a name=306:2></a> Well, I recall for the moment the fact that one had to ascend to the house of God; it is reached on the line of ascension.<a name=306:3></a> You remember the queen of Sheba was affected when she saw the ascent by which Solomon went up into the house of Jehovah.<a name=306:4></a> It made a great impression on her, so that there was no more spirit in her.<a name=306:5></a> It does not speak of the ascent to his throne, but the ascent to the house of Jehovah.<a name=306:6></a> So Hezekiah here touches the love of God; "thou hast in love to my soul", he says, "thou hast .<a name=306:7></a>.<a name=306:8></a>.<a name=306:9></a> delivered it".<a name=306:10></a> Then he says in effect, 'It is just that I might praise Thee'.<a name=306:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, that is the end I had in view.<a name=306:12></a> I wished to show you that the order of man that is to continue in the presence of God is a man formed after Christ; and that thus he has to go through the exercises occasioned by conditions in this world under the government of God; and on the other hand he is formed by the love of God.<a name=306:13></a> If I were to be asked for a definition of a Christian, I would say he is a man formed in the light of the love of God; he knows God revealed in love and answers to God; hence Hezekiah here says, "The living, the living, shall praise thee, as I do this day".<a name=306:14></a> Here was a man healed, delivered and free, and what for?<a name=306:15></a> To praise God in His house.<a name=306:16></a> If you are to be made to live, you are to live for God; every movement of your heart henceforth is to be Godward.<a name=306:17></a> Christianity involves a company of persons on earth relieved from the pressure of death, quickened in their affections and answering in every way to God; they are free for God; so there is the outgoing of quickened affections Godward.<a name=306:18></a> Hezekiah says further, "The Lord was ready to save me; therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord".<a name=306:19></a>

		I think it is very beautiful to see how Hezekiah here brings in the plural -- he says, "therefore we will sing my songs".<a name=307:1></a> He had composed songs, and he brings in others to join in singing them.<a name=307:2></a> "<i>We</i> will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord".<a name=307:3></a> Well, there is the great end that God had in His mind in regard to life.<a name=307:4></a> We dwell upon the terms eternal life, and life, scriptural expressions which have to be understood, but we need to understand the order of man to which they apply.<a name=307:5></a> The first man by his discrepancy only enhances the greatness of the second.<a name=307:6></a> The second Man is out of heaven.<a name=307:7></a> He comes into our circumstances, goes through all the exercises that the pressure of death occasions, and brings in life, establishing a title through His death for others to have part in it.<a name=307:8></a> Then He sings, for indeed Hezekiah in this may be taken as a type of Christ.<a name=307:9></a> He sings the song he composes, but he associates others with him in it.<a name=307:10></a> "We will sing my songs in the house of Jehovah all the days of our life;" and we may say that is for ever.<a name=307:11></a> It would be a great thing if the saints were brought into the understanding of life, and as understanding it to render to God that which He seeks, and that is praise.<a name=307:12></a> "The living, the living, he shall praise thee".<a name=307:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is in the light of all that, that we stand; and in connection with that the Lord has brought in a system of things into which every divine thought fits.<a name=309:2></a> I do not enlarge upon that; but I think it is of great interest to us to see that there was a place in the divine system for every divine thought.<a name=309:3></a> The unfolding of the divine mind in the Son necessitated a system of things in connection with which every thought should be set forth.<a name=309:4></a> Well, now, the Son has done all that, and I believe it may be accepted as a principle that what He does is unalterable; it is permanent.<a name=309:5></a>

		Now, as believing in the Son you have come to that which is permanent and immutable; but then it is also needful for us to see, and to be very clear about the fact that the Son became Man.<a name=310:1></a> We want to <i>confess Jesus Christ come in the flesh</i>: and I think, in the main, that is the object of John's epistle that we should confess Jesus Christ come in flesh.<a name=310:2></a> You will remember how Philip preached Jesus to the eunuch; he had brought <i>the Christ</i> to the Samaritans, but he preached <i>Jesus</i> to the eunuch.<a name=310:3></a> Nothing can exceed the grace, and I may say, nothing can exceed the food for the soul of man, that is embodied in "Jesus Christ come in flesh".<a name=310:4></a> Think of the embodiment of every divine grace in a Man!<a name=310:5></a> and think of that as seen in the wilderness, in the midst of what was in every way contrary!<a name=310:6></a>

		Now, I wish to dwell for a moment on the thought I had before me specially, and that is to show you that on the ground of all I have been saying as to Christ as Man, there is the immutable foundation on which the new system rests.<a name=316:11></a> Noah instantly recognised that which was due to God; so he built an altar, and offered up a burnt offering to God.<a name=316:12></a> It is one thing to see the Lord going down into death, and in His death terminating, in principle, the world that was in rebellion, and another thing to see Him as the burnt offering.<a name=316:13></a> Would that one could unfold the full force of the burnt offering.<a name=316:14></a> You cannot understand the burnt offering unless you see what Christ was here on earth.<a name=316:15></a> It refers to the Lord getting a body and saying, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God"; "a body hast thou prepared me".<a name=316:16></a> So that we have to ponder the Lord's life here upon earth in order to see the full import of the burnt offering.<a name=316:17></a> He goes into death; He goes into it voluntarily.<a name=316:18></a> Noah's name signified "<i>Rest</i>".<a name=316:19></a>

		The thought in my mind in reading this scripture was, that there might be exercise as to enlargement, that room might be made for the development of church principles, that there might be scope for the working out of the divine principles.<a name=321:2></a> The divine principles may be identified with church principles; and my exercise, dear brethren, is that we might be enlarged, so that there may be room for the development and the working out of these.<a name=321:3></a> God has been pleased to set His testimony in connection with what is spoken of in Scripture as the assembly, and room should be made for it.<a name=321:4></a>

		In the Old Testament God was pleased to set His testimony in connection with the nation of Israel.<a name=321:5></a> He opened up His mind and deposited His thoughts with Abraham as to what He would do for Abraham's seed; and in due time He fulfilled His promise and took Abraham's seed out of Egypt.<a name=321:6></a> Egypt was not the scene for the development of God's testimony; there was no room for it there.<a name=321:7></a> So in taking the nation out of Egypt He intended that it should be the vessel of His testimony here in the world, and for that He must make room.<a name=321:8></a> It is true that the testimony had its place in the wilderness, but the wilderness did not involve the conditions which existed in Egypt.<a name=321:9></a> The conditions existing in Egypt did not exist in the wilderness: the wilderness was in that respect a very great advance on Egypt; but the thought of God in regard to the nation necessitated that they should be in the land; that is to say, the land of Canaan, in the mind of God, was essential to the full setting forth of His testimony in the nation; so that, room had to be made for the nation; and hence God <i>did</i> make room for it; He cast out

		Well, now, when we come to the New Testament we find the same principles at work directly the Lord announced the assembly.<a name=322:3></a> You will remember in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, that the Lord asked the disciples the question, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am?<a name=322:4></a>" and Peter's confession of Him that He was "the Christ the Son of the living God".<a name=322:5></a> That was Peter's confession.<a name=322:6></a> We have often dwelt on that, beloved brethren, and we <i>need to</i> dwell upon it, because, apart from the understanding of that confession, it is evident that we do not understand the assembly, for there you get the <i>foundation</i> of the assembly.<a name=322:7></a> The Lord goes on to say, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath pot revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.<a name=322:8></a> And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church".<a name=322:9></a> The idea of the church, the assembly, is a spiritual idea; it proceeds from the Father.<a name=322:10></a> The very suggestion of that, beloved brethren, conveys great thoughts to us; it is a spiritual conception.<a name=322:11></a> The Lord says, "flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father".<a name=322:12></a> It is a spiritual conception, which proceeds directly from the Father; and then the Lord says, "Thou art Peter".<a name=322:13></a> Oh, what a name, what a designation to receive from the Lord, "Thou art Peter".<a name=322:14></a>

		sovereignly appointed.<a name=324:1></a> The Lord apportions the work according to His sovereign wisdom.<a name=324:2></a> We cannot exactly say why such and such a thing is so, but we do know that everything is appointed according to the sovereign wisdom of God.<a name=324:3></a> Thus, the Lord gave Peter, not the commission to build the church, but the keys to administer the kingdom; and what I understand by it is, that in giving Peter that commission, the Lord's thought was that he should use it to make room for the church.<a name=324:4></a> The Lord's thought was to have an official clearance so that there might be room for the church.<a name=324:5></a> Peter was distinctly official.<a name=324:6></a> The Lord said, "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven".<a name=324:7></a> Now, that was a very great commission.<a name=324:8></a> No other man ever received such a commission from the Lord.<a name=324:9></a> He was given the keys of the kingdom, a very much greater kingdom than was David's, I need not say, or than any other kingdom; it was the kingdom of the heavens, and Peter was commissioned to administer it, and for this he had the keys; and more, the Lord says, "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven".<a name=324:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, that was Peter's commission; and I believe the Lord's thought was to clear the ground, as it were, for the church; there was to be an official clearance so that there might be room for the new structure, which the Lord was about to build.<a name=324:11></a> What I mean by an official clearance is that there had been an official system on earth, and God had ended it.<a name=324:12></a> Judaism had been divinely appointed; and to that moment God had observed it.<a name=324:13></a> Israel had special privileges, and the Gentile was necessarily restricted.<a name=324:14></a> As a matter of fact, the Gentile was "far off, without

	</div>

		<a name=326>[Page 326]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		formed in the light of the full revelation of God, it is due to God and should be recognised, that if He comes out into the light, as He has come, the light must be universal.<a name=326:1></a> The candlestick must be free from national distinctions, it must be free from distinctions of every kind that control men here.<a name=326:2></a> God had Himself imposed restrictions, and until these were lifted off there could not be the full development of the assembly.<a name=326:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the light of the assembly had been disclosed; and when the time arrived the Lord commands Peter, and gives him power formally and officially to set aside these distinctions.<a name=326:4></a> You all remember how difficult it was for Peter to come to it; how God had to let down the sheet filled with all kinds of animals so as to render Peter sympathetic with his commission.<a name=326:5></a> It is a wonderful thing to get a command from the Lord, and it is still greater to be equal to it.<a name=326:6></a> God graciously dealt with Peter, until He brought him to the point of complete sympathy with the commission which the Lord had given to him as recorded in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=326:7></a> Peter goes to Caesarea to the house of one of the Gentiles, and God gave the Spirit to the Gentiles; they were actually brought into the assembly before the governmental restrictions were removed; and Peter acts in accordance with God's action.<a name=326:8></a> He says, as it were, Why should I be behind God; the Gentiles have received the Holy Spirit as well as we.<a name=326:9></a> Seeing this, Peter commanded them to be baptised.<a name=326:10></a> I understand that action to signify that the governmental restrictions that lay upon the Gentiles were formally and officially removed by Peter; but more, they were not only removed, but room was made for the assembly; protection was given to the assembly; the wing of the Lord was extended over the Gentiles who believed.<a name=326:11></a> Peter commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord.<a name=326:12></a>

		Now, that is the position of the Gentile in regard to the assembly.<a name=327:1></a> God has given to us the Spirit; He has brought us into the assembly in that way, and the act of baptism has removed the governmental restrictions that lay upon us; and in connection with that we have the Lord's protection.<a name=327:2></a> In that way we are under the protection of the kingdom, and as under the protection of the kingdom we are free to enter into the assembly; the object of it is that the Gentiles might be free for the assembly.<a name=327:3></a> It is extremely happy when you see the place that the assembly has in the mind of God, and the Lord graciously relieves your spirit of every pressure to the end that you might be free for the assembly.<a name=327:4></a>

		Now, I think the church at Corinth was taken up in a special way, the conditions there necessitating it, so that in writing, the principles, or law, that should govern the church as a whole might be unfolded.<a name=327:5></a> You must not think for a moment that the church is without a law; the church is governed by divinely appointed laws.<a name=327:6></a> In the Old Testament there was a law; in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>you get what was called "the law", but there was also the law of the house which was distinct from <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>.<a name=327:7></a> I think that the saints at Corinth were singled out by the Lord as a Gentile company of believers that He might set forth in connection with them the law of the house.<a name=327:8></a> I cannot dwell on it at all in detail, but only call your attention to it.<a name=327:9></a>

		Now, in the first epistle to the Corinthians commandments are prominent; for that epistle shows that there was departure; and the apostle wrote to correct the departure; whereas, the point in the second epistle was to set them at rest.<a name=328:2></a> The apostle's thought was that the Corinthians were restored, and that there might now be expansion in their affections; he says, "Be ye also enlarged".<a name=328:3></a> The thought I wish to leave with you is that the great need among God's people is enlargement in our affections.<a name=328:4></a> You can see how God has acted in regard to the church and the world, and if the principles of God in the church are to be operative, there must be deliverance from all that restricts us; These restrictions from which we suffer are not divinely imposed; they are <i>self-imposed</i>; and our wisdom is to dismiss them; they have no title to be there.<a name=328:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The third chapter of the second epistle shows how we are set at liberty in the presence of God; and now the apostle says, as it were, If you are straitened it is not on my side.<a name=328:6></a> "Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections".<a name=328:7></a> The light of the ministry was perfect; the difficulty lay with the Corinthians; they were straitened in they own affections.<a name=328:8></a> Where there are restrictions now, they are self-imposed; and where there are such restrictions there is no room for the development of the affection and principles which should mark the church.<a name=328:9></a> Where the love of God is flowing; where it affects our hearts, then we are free for church principles.<a name=328:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to make clear the peculiar import of this chapter; my thought being to show how irrepressible the spirit of evangelisation is during the present dispensation.<a name=329:2></a> I desire to emphasise that, so that our hearts may be encouraged as those interested in the gospel.<a name=329:3></a> It is a great thing to see that the spirit of evangelisation continues.<a name=329:4></a> If there is anything that the wicked one is set against, it is the gospel; it is an immense encouragement to see that at what we may call the darkest period of the church's history; that is, the darkest period of its history as threatened from without, not from within, the evangelical spirit there was irrepressible.<a name=329:5></a> It should be an immense cheer to us to see it.<a name=329:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think it is the Lord's mind that there should be apathy in regard to the gospel, I believe on the contrary that His thought would be to promote interest in, and sympathy with, it; and so I think this chapter is set here to show how irrepressible it is; and even in the period, darkest from divisions arising within the church, you will find that when the Lord through the apostle makes provision for evangelical work, he enjoins Timothy, while not specifically naming him as an evangelist, to do the work of one.<a name=329:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not say, beloved friends, that the injunctions to Timothy are intended to regulate, and to stimulate, all those who would be engaged in the testimony, in view of the apostle's removal from the scene of it; hence it applies to our own day.<a name=329:8></a> While one would deprecate the thought of persons assuming to be evangelists, it is plain that the Lord would encourage the spirit of evangelisation.<a name=329:9></a>

		Saul stood there <i>deliberately</i>, not actuated by zeal to take up a stone, others did that; but he stood and held their clothes; there was <i>deliberate intent</i> in that man; he was unmoved: he stood there and he held the clothes of those who put the martyr to death, for he was consenting to it.<a name=330:17></a> Saul was no ordinary man, he was a man of tremendous self-will;

		So, beloved friends, I dwell now on the spirit of evangelisation.<a name=331:7></a> I believe the chapter, as I said, is specially designed to show how irrepressible that spirit is; it is provided for in the admonitions to Timothy; and in the close of the church's history on earth, the spirit of evangelisation is apparent; "whosoever will, let him come, and take of the water of life freely;" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>.<a name=331:8></a> The evangelical spirit continues on to the coming of the Lord.<a name=331:9></a> I have spoken of all this to the Lord's people who are present; for it is easier to speak to the saints, than to sinners, for the simple reason that there is more sympathy; and so I have ventured to dwell on these things so as to arouse or increase your interest in the gospel.<a name=331:10></a> Now, Philip is, I think, the only person in the Scriptures <i>formally</i> spoken of as an evangelist.<a name=331:11></a> There were many evangelists, doubtless the apostles were all evangelists, and there were others; but, I

		believe, Philip is brought in here as the representative of the evangelical spirit; he is spoken of as "Philip the evangelist", and the whole chapter, we may say, is devoted to his ministry; he is specially marked by zeal in the gospel.<a name=332:1></a> These things may be very simple for most of you, but I think it is worthy of note that here, between the death of Stephen, and the calling out of Paul, the evangelical spirit is seen in activity; and, before going on to the passage I have read, I would call attention to Philip's work in Samaria.<a name=332:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told that Philip went down to Samaria, and preached Christ.<a name=332:3></a> Now that is worthy of note.<a name=332:4></a> Samaria was rival to Jerusalem.<a name=332:5></a> The Lord had been there in His ministry, and He had a remarkable experience there.<a name=332:6></a> I think the incident relating to the Lord's visit to Samaria is one of the most remarkable in Scripture.<a name=332:7></a> He met there a woman of Samaria, who was a sinner, and a remarkable conversation, a remarkable interchange of thought, took place between the Lord and that woman.<a name=332:8></a> I do not enlarge upon it; but she came to the conclusion that He was the Christ.<a name=332:9></a> She says, "Is not this the Christ?<a name=332:10></a>" The Messiah of Israel was there, and she was looking for Him.<a name=332:11></a> She said, "when he comes, he will tell us all things;" and the Lord says, "I that speak unto thee am he".<a name=332:12></a> I do not remember that He ever presented Himself in that way to any other.<a name=332:13></a> Think of His grace!<a name=332:14></a> Think of how He deals with souls.<a name=332:15></a> One wonders why He should have touched on such wondrous things in speaking to that woman; the very highest truths, beloved friends, in relation to Christianity were treated of between the Lord and the woman of Samaria.<a name=332:16></a> She says, "I perceive thou art a prophet;" but when she went to the people of the city, she says, "Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I did, is not this the Christ?<a name=332:17></a>"

		J.T.<a name=356:2></a> The thought before us is to see the character of that into which the Gentiles were introduced, and that it is not exactly what was established at Jerusalem, but what was established consequent on the connection between God and Israel being definitely broken.<a name=356:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=356:7></a> Yes; and what that change involved was that authority was formally transferred to heaven as a centre, and that henceforth all operations on the part of God would proceed from heaven, not from Jerusalem.<a name=356:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=356:9></a>S.<a name=356:10></a> And that was indicated by what Stephen saw?<a name=356:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=356:12></a> Quite so.<a name=356:13></a> Jesus and the glory <i>ought</i> to have been accepted at Jerusalem, because that was God's city on earth.<a name=356:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=356:18></a> So that now instead of Jerusalem being recognised and the glory being installed there, the glory is seen in heaven without a cloud.<a name=356:19></a> The fact that the Son of man was seen in heaven in the glory of God laid the basis for the universal character of the testimony, because the Son of man is necessarily related to man as such, not to any family of man.<a name=356:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=356:21></a>S.<a name=356:22></a> I should like that we might get the glory of the Son of man plainly before us.<a name=356:23></a> Stephen looked up into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus, and said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God".<a name=356:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=357:6></a> Then what follows upon that is that the full character of the earthly city as opposed to Christ is exemplified in Saul; so that there could be no doubt at all as to what the city was morally at that time, or of the justice of God in breaking the link with the city.<a name=357:7></a> Saul issues from it, not only as expressing its hatred of Christ within its own sphere, but that it would exert its influence beyond its own sphere to the Gentile world.<a name=357:8></a> That was indeed "sin abounding".<a name=357:9></a> The hatred against Christ exceeded all bounds in Saul.<a name=357:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=360:13></a> Exactly.<a name=360:14></a> It is not the kingdom in Jerusalem.<a name=360:15></a> You will always find in scriptures which refer to Jews especially that heaven in emphasised; for instance, Matthew, Hebrews and Peter's epistles.<a name=360:16></a> That is to show what Christianity is in contrast to what the nation of Israel had lost through the rejection of Messiah.<a name=360:17></a> Their rejection of the gospel has opened up a much wider field of blessing, but the patience of God is specially evidenced in the history.<a name=360:18></a> Even if it be said that Paul missed the mark in going back to Jerusalem, it was the spirit of Christ that led him back; it was his affection for the people.<a name=360:19></a> And when he went to Rome, it was the <i>Jews</i> he sent for.<a name=360:20></a> This shows how God followed the Jew even to the capital of the Gentile world.<a name=360:21></a> There they rejected the gospel definitely, and the salvation of God was sent to the Gentiles.<a name=360:22></a>

		My thought is to seek to show the character of the ministry through which the light of God has come to the Gentiles, and correspondingly to show the product of it; that is, it began with glory, and the product of it becomes the vessel of the glory, so that what I may have to say will fit in between these two points.<a name=425:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more exhilarating to us than that we belong to a glory system, and nothing is more important than that we should rightly understand that we belong to such a system.<a name=425:3></a> Now as I have called your attention on a previous occasion to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>, I would again refer to it for a moment as intimating to us what God had in His mind in the formation of the present physical universe.<a name=425:4></a> He had set there a testimony to what was in His mind to effect; namely, a system of infinite variety of glory.<a name=425:5></a> "The heavens", the psalmist tells us, "declare the glory of God".<a name=425:6></a> The apostle tells us in writing to the Corinthians that there are celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies, and the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.<a name=425:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what came to pass was that the <i>true</i> glory of the terrestrial disappeared when lawlessness obtained a footing upon earth.<a name=425:8></a> Adam was really for the glory of God and he was placed upon earth.<a name=425:9></a> There was a glory there, but it was an earthly glory, a glory that God will return to, for He never surrenders any thought of His.<a name=425:10></a> He will return to it, but for the moment it disappeared with the entrance of lawlessness into the scene.<a name=425:11></a> So that all earthly glory, passing by for a moment what was typical in Israel,

		<a name=426>[Page 426]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is now the product of lawlessness.<a name=426:1></a> It is the outgrowth of man's ambition as away from God.<a name=426:2></a> So that, in the types, <i>for the cleansing</i> of God's people it was necessary for the,"scarlet" to be cast into the burning.<a name=426:3></a> That is, all that order of glory has to go in judgment; but then there is the terrestrial glory, and the law was the demand for it.<a name=426:4></a> It was as if God, as it were, missed it, and He makes His demands upon man which, if answered to, would result in the re-establishment of the terrestrial glory.<a name=426:5></a> In other words, if the law was answered to in man when it was promulgated there would be a vessel here answering in every way to God.<a name=426:6></a> Man would be moving about on earth under the direction of the divine will just as the heavenly bodies move in their orbits.<a name=426:7></a> That is what we should have had, if the law of God had been complied with.<a name=426:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when the psalmist places both together, the heavenly and the earthly glory, he speaks of the perfection of the heavenly glory.<a name=426:9></a> There the glory of God was declared, but when he turns to the earth all he could say was to eulogise the law, not the man who kept it.<a name=426:10></a> As yet that man had not appeared.<a name=426:11></a> He eulogised the law and its qualities.<a name=426:12></a> But it awaited the presence of the Lord, of the true Man upon earth, to have it exemplified.<a name=426:13></a> Now what I understand by the presence of the Lord upon earth is, that the heavenly glory took form upon earth.<a name=426:14></a> The heavens hitherto had declared the glory of God.<a name=426:15></a> His will had never been contravened there.<a name=426:16></a> That testimony remains for every man to see.<a name=426:17></a> The declaration of the heavens abides.<a name=426:18></a> The psalmist tells us, "Their line is gone out through all the earth".<a name=426:19></a> There is the universal testimony of the heavens.<a name=426:20></a> They have remained under the influence of the divine will, and I may add that the heavenly bodies which are visible to us are but an index to what is beyond them.<a name=426:21></a> They are but an index to the moral system that lies

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when Christ became Man the heavenly glory came to earth, for the second Man is out of heaven, and He brought to earth the essence of obedience to God.<a name=427:3></a> That is what He brought to earth, so that for once we have the will of God done upon earth as it is in heaven.<a name=427:4></a> After He is publicly proclaimed to be the Son by the Father out of heaven, He is driven by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<a name=427:5></a> That was the crucial point, and there, beloved friends, was brought to light infinite perfection in Man here below.<a name=427:6></a> He maintained in every possible way what man's place was, and that is, that man was not to live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God.<a name=427:7></a> That was what came to light in the wilderness.<a name=427:8></a> He expressed in man's place here on earth infinite perfection.<a name=427:9></a>

		Paul was the vessel to carry all that wonderful light into the Gentile world, and I wish for a moment to call attention to him as a minister.<a name=431:2></a> He says, "having this ministry, .<a name=431:3></a>.<a name=431:4></a>.<a name=431:5></a> we faint not".<a name=431:6></a> And he describes himself thus: "But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4">2 Corinthians  4</a>.<a name=431:7></a> Now that is the minister.<a name=431:8></a> In chapter 3 he dwells on the ministry, and he tells us that it is a ministry of the Spirit, a ministry of righteousness, and hence he says if the first was inaugurated with glory, much more does the second abound in glory.<a name=431:9></a> The fact is, that the glory of the first is completely eclipsed by reason of the surpassing glory of the ministry of the second.<a name=431:10></a> The apostle's heart bounds with delight in the presence of the marvellous ministry which he had received.<a name=431:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that was the ministry, and chapter 4 shows us how Paul corresponded with his ministry; he was in every way in keeping with the ministry of glory that he had received, so he says if our gospel be veiled, referring to the veil on Moses' face, we are not veiling it.<a name=431:12></a> One has to confess that at the present time we <i>do</i> often veil the ministry.<a name=431:13></a> Those who are in the place of ministers, alas!<a name=431:14></a> often veil the ministry; there is not a clear shining, but it was not so with Paul.<a name=431:15></a> He says, if our gospel is veiled, we are not veiling it.<a name=431:16></a> Moses had to put a veil on his face.<a name=431:17></a> The people did not put it on.<a name=431:18></a> That marked the character of the dispensation, but he says, if ours is veiled, we are not veiling it.<a name=431:19></a> If there is a veil, it is on the heart of the lost.<a name=431:20></a> Solemn word!<a name=431:21></a> It shines resplendent in the vessel without a veil.<a name=431:22></a> There was no veil there.<a name=431:23></a> If there was a veil, it was on the heart of the lost.<a name=431:24></a> The god of this world put

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul was the vessel through which the ministry of all that wonderful system of glory came into the Gentile world.<a name=432:4></a> The apostle further shows why Satan casts a veil over the hearts of men; "that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them".<a name=432:5></a> Satan does not want the light of that to shine into hearts; it is the light of Him who is the image of God.<a name=432:6></a> If the light of the glory of Christ shines into your heart, it forms you after Christ.<a name=432:7></a> The image is reproduced by the Spirit in you, and Satan hates that image.<a name=432:8></a> He would obliterate the image of God in the world.<a name=432:9></a> He did it in Adam, but he could not do it in Christ.<a name=432:10></a> It remained radiant in Christ in spite of the enemy's temptation.<a name=432:11></a> And now it is the radiancy of the glory in the face of Christ who is the image of God, which is to shine into the souls of men, and the effect is that there is an order of man here patterned after Him who is the image of God.<a name=432:12></a> Now what is Satan doing at the present time?<a name=432:13></a> He is endeavouring to prevent the light of Christ from shining into the souls of men.<a name=432:14></a> It shone brilliantly in Paul, and without a veil.<a name=432:15></a> He tells us that he did not preach himself.<a name=432:16></a> He preached Christ as Lord.<a name=432:17></a> We announce, he says, "Christ Jesus, Lord", and as to ourselves, we are your servants for that Man's sake.<a name=432:18></a> And then he says, "it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=432:19></a> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>, 7.<a name=432:20></a> Such was Paul.<a name=432:21></a>

		character of the vessel through which the light has come into the Gentile world, I want to show you just for a moment that the heavenly city was the great product of that.<a name=433:1></a> I think it has been said that the city is the result of the covenant, and I believe that is so.<a name=433:2></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4">Galatians  4</a>shows that the allegory of Hagar and Sarah, and Ishmael and Isaac, refers to the two covenants, the first one beginning at mount Sinai, which, he says, gendereth to bondage; it produced bondage.<a name=433:3></a> That is the working out of it, and the apostle says it answers to mount Sinai in Arabia; "for Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which is now, for she is in bondage with her children".<a name=433:4></a> That is also seen in the present religious world, which is the product of the legal system.<a name=433:5></a> Referring to the second covenant, the apostle says, "Jerusalem above is free".<a name=433:6></a> What does she gender to?<a name=433:7></a> She gendereth to liberty.<a name=433:8></a> She produces liberty.<a name=433:9></a> Her children are children of liberty, children of promise; they are born of a free woman.<a name=433:10></a> In other words, the wonderful ministry, the ministry of the glory, has brought into effect that order of city, and Jerusalem above is <i>free</i>.<a name=433:11></a> One could dwell at length on that if one had time, for it not only depends on the covenant but also on relationship.<a name=433:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the latter, I would like to make clear to you the relation that exists between a system involving sonship and the idea of righteousness as seen in the true Man here upon earth.<a name=433:13></a> Both are seen in the church.<a name=433:14></a> The will of God is carried out in the church here, and at the same time the church knows the relationship of sonship with God, and that is the secret, as I understand it, of the liberty in which the church is in heaven.<a name=433:15></a> Jerusalem which is above is free, and she is our mother.<a name=433:16></a> I take it that the apostle Paul's ministry, whilst not excluding the ministry of the twelve, really introduced the idea

		Of the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=434:1></a> The idea came into evidence when the bond between God and the earthly city was severed; then the necessity for the heavenly city came to light, and this was by the apostle Paul's ministry; he preached the Son of God.<a name=434:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to go one point further, to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, where the city that the apostle alludes to in Galatians is seen coming down from God out of heaven and she has the glory of God.<a name=434:3></a> You will find that there are wonderful thoughts bound up in that when you reflect upon it, for the Spirit of God is presenting ourselves to us in the vision.<a name=434:4></a> Put yourself in that city.<a name=434:5></a> Nothing can be more encouraging to us than that the Spirit should bring into evidence in the vision what we are to be.<a name=434:6></a> Hence our position at the present time.<a name=434:7></a> There is a sort of double light thrown in upon us; the light of what the city was at the beginning, and then the light coming from the heavenly city as seen in the future.<a name=434:8></a> Both these lights, as one may say, are focused upon us.<a name=434:9></a> Her light is like a stone most precious.<a name=434:10></a> Is it not precious to you, the thought of the wonderful position of the church in God's counsels?<a name=434:11></a> Then will be seen, I believe, fully, what <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>indicates; that is, how the heavens declare the glory of God.<a name=434:12></a> What a declaration there will then be publicly!<a name=434:13></a> But then in whom?<a name=434:14></a> In those who have been the product of Paul's ministry.<a name=434:15></a> It is formed of persons who are the reflection of the image of Christ, and Christ is the image of God.<a name=434:16></a> That is what the church will be God's thought in the gospel is that each one of us shall be the reflection of Christ, who is the image of God.<a name=434:17></a> That is the idea of the glory of God; God is reflected in those who are formed after Christ, who is His image.<a name=434:18></a> The heavens will declare in that day God's glory.<a name=434:19></a> Out of heaven shall come, not a multitude of angels that do His will, but a multitude

		Well, we might say much more about that, but I think that what I have said indicates to us the great result of the obedience of Christ who effectuated God's will.<a name=435:14></a> May the Lord encourage us.<a name=435:15></a> I feel that He has been reminding us of the importance of obedience as marking that in which Christ is reflected.<a name=435:16></a> As formed in obedience we become practically vessels of glory.<a name=435:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=436:2></a> The thought is especially to dwell on the second half of the book of Isaiah, beginning with chapter 40.<a name=436:3></a> It would be very helpful if we could get more clear on the sovereignty of God.<a name=436:4></a> I think it might be found that all God effects, He effects on the ground of His sovereignty, and that what He effects sovereignly is for the accomplishment of His counsels.<a name=436:5></a> The prophet begins, "thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth", and then what is enlarged upon in the chapter is, that all that God does He does in connection with a certain centre, and that centre is mount Zion.<a name=436:6></a> Mount Zion stands for God's sovereignty.<a name=436:7></a> He selects <i>that spot</i>.<a name=436:8></a>

		The previous chapters, from 13 to 23, are engaged with God's judgment with regard to the different nations; then in chapter 24 we have a summary of it all.<a name=436:9></a> The world is turned upside down, and God punishes "the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth".<a name=436:10></a> He does all that, and then the Spirit of Christ in the remnant, in those who have faith, celebrates what He does, and they recognise that what He does is in connection with His counsels of old, which are faithfulness and truth.<a name=436:11></a>

		It is a very precious thought that He acts for His people.<a name=438:1></a> He acts primarily for the carrying out of His own counsels so that He punishes the satanic hosts on high, and the kings of the earth He punishes also.<a name=438:2></a> There is a complete overthrow, and then it says, "the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously"; chapter 24: 23.<a name=438:3></a> That is what God has in His mind, Christ is to reign in mount Zion gloriously, and all natural light shall be confounded.<a name=438:4></a> So that the divine end is reached there; and then in chapter 25 there is a song, so that that chapter takes the form of the celebration of God's intervention.<a name=438:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think chapter 24 shows what God effects from Himself with a view to Christ sitting on mount Zion, and then it shows that all this is in accordance with His counsels of old, and that He effects His counsels on principles of sovereignty; and then at the end of chapter 35 we find that there is complete deliverance for the people.<a name=438:6></a> There, I think, we get the people brought into the good of what is stated in chapter 24.<a name=438:7></a> God has His own thoughts of Christ.<a name=438:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=457:12></a> I think the Spirit now has the new generation in view, and Christ is the pattern of that.<a name=457:13></a> It is very interesting to see how comfort is brought in.<a name=457:14></a> The testimony to Jerusalem is "Comfort ye".<a name=457:15></a> The first epistle to the Corinthians teaches that all flesh is as grass; the second brings in comfort.<a name=457:16></a> Comfort supposes that there has been the judgment of the flesh in us; then God comforts us.<a name=457:17></a>

		What I desire to dwell upon is the sovereignty of God, and I have chosen this Scripture because it intimates that God proposes to do everything on the ground of His sovereign rights.<a name=504:1></a> In this way it pleased Him to accomplish certain things on a.<a name=504:2></a> certain mountain alluded to here.<a name=504:3></a> He chooses the place and the time.<a name=504:4></a> I think it will be found that in our hearts we quarrel with that.<a name=504:5></a> If you search your own heart you will probably find there a very quarrelsome disposition in regard to the sovereign rights of God.<a name=504:6></a> Even if you decide to come to terms with Him, you are disposed to do so according to your own thoughts.<a name=504:7></a> I wish to show you that for blessing you must come to God's terms.<a name=504:8></a> God determines the <i>place</i> of blessing, and He determines the <i>manner</i> of the blessing, and He determines the character and the extent of the blessing.<a name=504:9></a> All must be left unqualifiedly in the hands of God.<a name=504:10></a> I hope to be able to show further that it is our wisdom to do that because we shall discover in result that God can do very much better for us than we can do for ourselves, or than we could propose doing had we a thought in the matter.<a name=504:11></a>

		Now notice the setting in which this passage is found.<a name=504:12></a> You will observe that the chapter is a song.<a name=504:13></a> You know the saints of God of old learned how to sing.<a name=504:14></a> What I understand by that is, that they learned how to celebrate God's ways, for a song is a celebration; they learned how to celebrate a divine intervention, and to celebrate it in a song.<a name=504:15></a> As Christians we too should be singers in this sense.<a name=504:16></a> The saints of God of old were singers; they appreciated divine interventions, and their appreciation of them was of such a character that they would

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One could cite several instances in the Old Testament of the characteristic celebration of a divine act of intervention, such as the fifteenth chapter of the book of Exodus; there the people of God were in the enjoyment of deliverance from the hostile power and they celebrated it.<a name=505:4></a> In one respect it was the highest and proudest moment of their history, when in the full light and in the full enjoyment of God's wonderful intervention for them, as in the presence of God on the banks of the Bed Sea, they were with God.<a name=505:5></a> He had borne them on eagles' wings, wings of power, and brought them to Himself.<a name=505:6></a> There they were, the Egyptians destroyed in the waters of judgment, and they themselves were with God.<a name=505:7></a> A wonderful thing to be with God!<a name=505:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the gospel, rightly apprehended in your soul, sets you in relationship with God, and the effect of it is that you celebrate it, you celebrate God.<a name=505:9></a> "The Lord is a man of war;" "the Lord hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea".<a name=505:10></a> That is the song of the young believer; old believers or fathers are taken up with "him that is from the beginning", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2">1 John  2</a>, but the young believer celebrates God's intervention for him in Christ.<a name=505:11></a> The gospel sets forth God's intervention for you in Christ, and in the light of it you celebrate God, "the Lord hath triumphed gloriously".<a name=505:12></a> If you apprehend that God has done something for you, you celebrate it; that is God's portion.<a name=505:13></a> God's portion is the responsive result produced in the heart

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter the prophet is engaged in that way.<a name=506:3></a> If you recall the teaching of the prophet in this book, you will remember that in chapter 12 there was a celebration, and then following upon that God undertakes to deal with the Gentile world.<a name=506:4></a> We are now in the midst of a world that is alienated from God; it is ruled by influences upon earth and influences in heaven; it is a very great system of things built up by long experience, the outcome of long and tried experience; it is a system of long and patient growth.<a name=506:5></a> We must not under estimate what it is; the world is a system built up by a master hand behind it.<a name=506:6></a> That master hand is the wicked one, and he has wonderful intelligence; in that sense he is the master hand behind the world system, and he has controlled its construction, he has designed and watched over it.<a name=506:7></a> You need not suppose for a moment that the world has been built up haphazard; the world is a <i>growth</i>, and it has been built up by the wicked one in order to annul and overthrow everything that is of God, and that is what is all round about us.<a name=506:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#24">Isaiah  24</a>we learn that God undertakes to deal with that, and the prophet is quick to discern what God effects.<a name=506:9></a> It is said, "The Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof".<a name=506:10></a> That is what <i>God does</i>.<a name=506:11></a> The earth is full of people at the present time, there is probably the largest population it ever possessed, but the Lord "maketh the earth empty".<a name=506:12></a> I cannot undertake to tell you how it will be accomplished, but the

		I always feel encouraged to turn attention to the world in preaching the gospel, because it is essential that you should see the character of the world in order to appreciate the necessity for the gospel.<a name=507:8></a> The prophet here sees God intervening; there is the world, and in his day the world was very powerful; the Assyrian was there, and the prophet sees God intervening; that is, God intervenes on the earth, He deals with things, and we believers, who have got light from God, ought not to be ignorant of the conditions that exist around us.<a name=507:9></a> Men are having their way apparently, but what do you see, and what do I see?<a name=507:10></a> I see that God is going to intervene in all this, and that is what the prophet sees here.<a name=507:11></a> Read on in the end of chapter 24.<a name=507:12></a> There God touches what is on high; in verse 19 we read, "The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.<a name=507:13></a> The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again".<a name=507:14></a> Now that is the outlook.<a name=507:15></a> Does it discourage you that such things are going to take place?<a name=507:16></a> Are your ambitions in connection with the earth?<a name=507:17></a> Are your hopes built up, are your cherished hopes in connection with this earth?<a name=507:18></a> If they are, that is a dark prospect for you; this is the end of the earth as it stands; but then.<a name=507:19></a> God is going to touch the higher influences: in verse 21 we read, "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth".<a name=507:20></a> There is the seat of the trouble; the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is essential that young people should see this.<a name=508:2></a> If you set your hopes in connection with this present world, there would be no greater folly, for God is going to break it up root and branch: He touches the high ones, He punishes the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth, and "they shall be gathered together as prisoners in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited".<a name=508:3></a> In that day "the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem".<a name=508:4></a> I want you to think of the great end that God has in view in intervening in this world: "In that day", says the prophet, "the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed"; think of those great luminaries in the heavens that have been the guide for things in the heavens, regulating things in the earth.<a name=508:5></a> What causes the confounding of the moon and the shaming of the sun?<a name=508:6></a> "The Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously".<a name=508:7></a>

		What it means spiritually is that God has raised Christ out of death and He will not be diverted from that.<a name=512:1></a> Christendom is all on wrong lines, it is really an endeavour to divert God from Christ, but God will not be diverted from Christ.<a name=512:2></a> That is the spiritual signification of mount Zion, it is the spot upon which God will act, and when you have reached that spot in your soul you will discover the wisdom of it.<a name=512:3></a> Everything God does He does in wisdom; wisdom is the handmaid of love, and therefore wisdom does everything perfectly; yon cannot add to it.<a name=512:4></a> Now, as I have said, mount Zion is spiritually Christ risen.<a name=512:5></a> In Him God sets forth His sovereign right to bless.<a name=512:6></a> Think of that!<a name=512:7></a> Is it not well worth your while to submit to the sovereign rights of God, when you see that His sovereign rights signify that He is going to bless you.<a name=512:8></a> Read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>see the blessing that comes in there: "I will satisfy her poor with bread.<a name=512:9></a> I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy"; and then in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>also, "there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=512:10></a>

		Then we find in verse seven, "He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations".<a name=512:11></a> Darkness prevails everywhere; Christendom is dark; it has more light than heathendom, but it is dark in regard to God.<a name=512:12></a> The "veil" is there.<a name=512:13></a> Why is that?<a name=512:14></a> It is because they do not recognise God's rights.<a name=512:15></a> Why are souls dark?<a name=512:16></a> I believe the explanation of it is that they do not recognise the sovereign rights of God in Christ risen.<a name=512:17></a> Christ risen is God's centre, and if you refuse to recognise that, you are dark, and you remain dark; but directly you recognise it in its true light, everything is adjusted for you, you apprehend God, and you apprehend everything in relation to God; the veil is gone!<a name=512:18></a>
