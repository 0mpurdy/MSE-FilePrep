	<div class="paragraph">
		I have the thought, among others, of stressing representation.<a name=1:5></a> Only God really is entitled to representation, and this is found in Christ, who is said to be "the image of God".<a name=1:6></a> It is a mediatorial thought, and extends from God to Christ, and from Christ to those whom He may select, and right down even to a righteous man, or to a disciple, for the Lord Jesus Himself says, "And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:42">Matthew  10:42</a>.<a name=1:7></a> Such is the extending chain of representation of which Scripture speaks, and I have selected this book because it affords copious material for such an address.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, .<a name=1:9></a>.<a name=1:10></a>.<a name=1:11></a> and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a>.<a name=1:12></a> You will notice by the pronoun <i>His</i>, that the angel belonged to the Lord Jesus; it was not any <i>angel</i>, for there are myriads of them; other angels are alluded to in this book.<a name=1:13></a> The bondman is His too; it is the bondman of Jesus, and he proves that he is indeed such, in that he "testified the word of God", as we are told, ".<a name=1:14></a>.<a name=1:15></a>.<a name=1:16></a> all things that he saw".<a name=1:17></a> The Lord made a selection on the ground of experience, as we might say.<a name=1:18></a> Of course He knows all, and needs not in one sense to have any experience in order to know things; but He puts the selection of servants on this basis, and He had that great experience with this bondman.<a name=1:19></a> The Lord allowed him to be very familiar with Him.<a name=1:20></a> Indeed one marvels at times at the liberty accorded by the Lord to His disciples.<a name=1:21></a> John had the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		liberty of being in the bosom of Jesus and of leaning on His breast.<a name=2:1></a> The preposition <i>in</i> implies acceptance.<a name=2:2></a> John would not have taken the liberty if it had not been there, it flowed out from what was in Christ; liberty flows out from what is in Christ.<a name=2:3></a> Moreover, he leaned on His breast, indicating support, which John also took advantage of.<a name=2:4></a> So that trustworthiness in John was of long standing; and if age is of any value at all, it is in this, that it affords long-standing confidence between the Lord and the bondman, seasoned confidence; confidence that has stood the test of every weather.<a name=2:5></a> So that the Spirit may well say of John, "his bondman".<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as I was saying, the thought of representation is here in that sense, and John in his prefatory remarks, which run on to the end of verse 8, embodies this point, that there was good reason for the use of the word <i>His</i>.<a name=2:7></a> He would say, The Lord has indicated to me that I am His, not only through redemption, but through long-standing trustworthiness.<a name=2:8></a> So he says: "John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; .<a name=2:9></a>.<a name=2:10></a>.<a name=2:11></a> and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.<a name=2:12></a> To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages.<a name=2:13></a> Amen", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:4">Revelation  1:4</a> - 6.<a name=2:14></a> What richness in the bondman!<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to point to the book as setting out this great principle of representation.<a name=2:16></a> This book is indeed a great holy and spiritual drama; it is unique.<a name=2:17></a> And, of course, there must be a personnel to set this out.<a name=2:18></a> So John, in order to bring the saints into it, addresses the assembly under the symbol of seven -- seven assemblies in a certain province.<a name=2:19></a> The whole book is written to them, to those seven assemblies; and the personnel in

	<div class="paragraph">
		the scenes depicted is supposed to be understood by them.<a name=3:1></a> One would like to be drawn into the current of the book.<a name=3:2></a> Although one whole, it is a series of great prophetic subjects largely represented in persons; and what is set out in such a wonderfully symbolical way is already current.<a name=3:3></a> Indeed, from the time the revelation was given the actual scenes represented had a certain existence.<a name=3:4></a> The assembly is to be in this; it is a question of selected assemblies under a symbolic form, seven of them, designated by the Lord Jesus and made prominent throughout; a letter being written to each of them by the Lord, showing that the saints of our day are included.<a name=3:5></a> Thus we all are addressed, and this makes the book of special interest and importance.<a name=3:6></a> At any given time, it is the current saints that are in mind in this book.<a name=3:7></a> We belong to one of the assemblies, and hence the book is for us.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What John saw was to be written in a book and sent to the seven assemblies; each is to have a copy, as it were.<a name=3:9></a> So John puts himself alongside of us, saying in verse 9, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>.<a name=3:10></a> That is how the New Translation reads.<a name=3:11></a> John is in isolation, he is on an island; but he is in "the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=3:12></a> They are one idea: "the tribulation and kingdom and patience" are all governed by one article; your New Translation will show you that too.<a name=3:13></a> It is an idea that attaches normally to a true follower of Jesus, to a true witness of Jesus; although he may be isolated he is in "the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus"; not <i>of</i> Jesus, but <i>in</i> Jesus.<a name=3:14></a> These things are in Jesus; they are fixed; they cannot be affected by any public condition.<a name=3:15></a> The severest conditions are included in the first word, "tribulation"; and the kingdom in Jesus is immutable.<a name=3:16></a> Other kingdoms may fall, and some may rise, but this one never falls; it is immutable; it is in Jesus.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, John puts himself alongside of us in that way, and he says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:10">Revelation  1:10</a>.<a name=4:1></a> He is a real christian, a real follower of Jesus, a bondman of Jesus; but he is a fellow-partaker, a companion of the saints in these things.<a name=4:2></a> He is assuming that the saints are in these things: "the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=4:3></a> It is the tribulation in Jesus, it is the kingdom in Jesus, and it is the patience in Jesus; and he is assuming that the saints are in them all, associated with him in holy bonds never to be dissolved.<a name=4:4></a> That is the position in this book.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day" -- recognising that the Lord Jesus has to do with time, and that He can select a day to call His own day.<a name=4:6></a> His own authoritative day.<a name=4:7></a> How can I recognise the authority of Jesus more than by being in the Spirit?<a name=4:8></a> He says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=4:9></a> The Spirit here and Jesus on high at God's right hand are correlative, and John was exactly in his orbit; he could not be more so than he was at this moment.<a name=4:10></a> He was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and in his orbit.<a name=4:11></a> You say, How could he move?<a name=4:12></a> He is limited as on an island, and no doubt in a prison, but he moves spiritually, unlimited by the island, or the prison, or the cell.<a name=4:13></a> That is what christianity is.<a name=4:14></a> And he says, "I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet".<a name=4:15></a> It is like Samuel called up out of his rest.<a name=4:16></a> Samuel complained, asking why he should be called up out of his rest.<a name=4:17></a> He came up to speak a word about Saul; he condemned Saul.<a name=4:18></a> John is called back here to condemn what corresponds with Saul in our own day, the man after the flesh in the place of rule.<a name=4:19></a> This book calls attention to that man and shows how he is to be dealt with finally, as seen in the man of sin; for that is what he is, the full development of sin.<a name=4:20></a> He is seen as taken, and the false prophet too, and cast alive into the lake of fire.<a name=4:21></a> That is what this book brings

	<div class="paragraph">
		out; it is one of the last things you get before you get the heavenly city.<a name=5:1></a> John is called out from the holy enjoyment of the Spirit on the Lord's day, to see all this; very different from what he had been engaged with "in the Spirit".<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is only one feature of the Apocalypse; the book is enchased by the most glorious representations of divine Persons; also of the assembly and other families of the redeemed.<a name=5:3></a> And in this respect it is remarkable that the first thing John sees is the assembly.<a name=5:4></a> He says, "And I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden lamps", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:12">Revelation  1:12</a>.<a name=5:5></a> These lamps represent the assembly, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:20">Revelation  1:20</a>.<a name=5:6></a> Someone may say.<a name=5:7></a> You are beclouding Christ; you are putting the assembly before Christ.<a name=5:8></a> Well, the Spirit of God does here, verbally anyway.<a name=5:9></a> The truth is that the assembly belongs to Christ, and if it is brought into view first, it is that Christ might be there.<a name=5:10></a> She is His bride and witness and she makes way for Him.<a name=5:11></a> God is bringing out assembly truth, and in order to make assembly truth practical He needs to get assembly material.<a name=5:12></a> Assembly truth is one thing, but assembly material is another; and then assembly material must be put into form and built up.<a name=5:13></a> When that is done there is a place for Christ.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So John says, "I saw seven golden lamps, and in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:12">Revelation  1:12</a>,13.<a name=5:15></a> I need not say more about that, but if there is anybody here who does not understand assembly truth, I would advise you to make inquiry.<a name=5:16></a> There are a good many here who could tell you something about it, thank God!<a name=5:17></a> The next thing is assembly material, and if you began sincerely to inquire about assembly I truth, those who are in the assembly will conclude that you are assembly material, and they will soon make room for you.<a name=5:18></a> There is a place for you; it is waiting.<a name=5:19></a> Your seat is empty.<a name=5:20></a> There is a place for you, and as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		soon as you take your place you will see something of the Lord Jesus, that is, in the assembly.<a name=6:1></a> That is where He is to be seen.<a name=6:2></a> Of course, we see Him crowned with glory and honour at the right hand of God, but He is to be seen in the assembly.<a name=6:3></a> In this book He is seen in the assembly, not exactly sitting or standing, but walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important in the understanding of this book to see that the first thing John saw was these seven lamps, meaning the seven assemblies, and in the next two chapters, the Lord writes letters through John to each of these assemblies.<a name=6:5></a> They are all written in the same book; it is all one book, but a letter to each assembly is in the book.<a name=6:6></a> That brings me to the end of chapter 3.<a name=6:7></a> And again I would appeal to any here who may not understand what I am speaking of, to inquire about it.<a name=6:8></a> If you are a christian at all, inquire about the truth of the assembly.<a name=6:9></a> You see, it is at the very forefront of the book, in the prefatory part, and now it is in the body of the book.<a name=6:10></a> In the beginning the first thing seen by the prophet is the assembly; and in the next two chapters it is addressed in the writing of the Lord Jesus to the seven assemblies.<a name=6:11></a> I do say, dear brethren and young people here, that this ought to be attractive to you.<a name=6:12></a> The holy scenes of which I have spoken are wonderful, and we all, as of the assembly, are essential to them.<a name=6:13></a> Why should you not be in this great scene?<a name=6:14></a> You are essential to it.<a name=6:15></a> The Lord comes to Ephesus and knows every saint that should be at the meeting.<a name=6:16></a> He knows every saint in Ephesus.<a name=6:17></a> If He comes there and misses certain faces, He takes account of that; they are essential to what He has in mind.<a name=6:18></a> Each one is essential to what is in mind, so that if there are those here who do not understand what I am speaking of as to the assembly, I would urge you to inquire as to the truth of it.<a name=6:19></a> The Scriptures are available, and the Holy Spirit, as we seek it, guides into all the truth.<a name=6:20></a> There are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		also books which He has aided others to write, which help in the understanding of the Scriptures.<a name=7:1></a> The next thing is, are you material?<a name=7:2></a> And then, Are you in your place as a stone in the building?<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the end of chapter 3.<a name=7:4></a> In chapter 4 we have a new scene, or at least another phase of the book.<a name=7:5></a> Then chapter 5 is another one; chapter 6 another; chapter 7 another; chapter 10, particularly, another; chapter 11 another, etc.<a name=7:6></a> One scene after another is brought before your eyes in the most holy way; they are presented in persons; certain principles or things represented in persons.<a name=7:7></a> In that connection we have the angel of Jesus, and the angel, or angels, of the assemblies; and we have angels otherwise designated.<a name=7:8></a> Now that brings out what I am saying in a very specific way -- angelic representation.<a name=7:9></a> In speaking of the Lord, John says, "his angel"; and He says Himself at the end, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>.<a name=7:10></a> Are the assemblies all to be dissolved?<a name=7:11></a> No.<a name=7:12></a> The final and great result is one great thought, namely, the bride.<a name=7:13></a> In all these varied glories in this book the result is that the saints in the assemblies are all saying to the Lord Jesus along with the Spirit, "Come".<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end of the book the assembly is brought into view for a purpose different from that at the beginning.<a name=7:15></a> It is now the bride.<a name=7:16></a> When the bride appears there is no blemish; there is no reproof, there is no criticism on the part of the Lord; but in the early chapters we have criticisms.<a name=7:17></a> Nevertheless the assemblies are before the Lord, and He says each one has an angel, "I Jesus have sent mine angel", the Lord says, "to testify these things to you in the assemblies".<a name=7:18></a> Each of the assemblies has an angel, and that brings up a very important matter, as to whether I am representative of the assembly that I am in.<a name=7:19></a> If God be working in the city in which I reside I should come in for that, and for the very best

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of it.<a name=8:1></a> Why not?<a name=8:2></a> It is for me.<a name=8:3></a> Each assembly has its own distinction; but if that distinction is of any value, it is because of the work of God there.<a name=8:4></a> Character in a natural sense taken from the locality is of no value at all.<a name=8:5></a> If there is a distinctive characteristic in the town in which I am living, I am apt to imbibe it.<a name=8:6></a> That is detrimental.<a name=8:7></a> One great thought of the assembly is that it is heavenly, and that is what comes out concretely in chapter 21.<a name=8:8></a> It comes down out of heaven from God.<a name=8:9></a> I need to get that great thought into my soul if I am to get the gain of what is before us.<a name=8:10></a> And so, if I live in this town I must be representative of what is here.<a name=8:11></a> If there is anything of God in this town, I do not want to be behind in that; I want to be fully in it.<a name=8:12></a> Sometimes we hear brethren referring to those who are leading, those who are holding things for the Lord, as <i>they</i> and <i>them</i> instead of <i>we</i> and <i>us</i>.<a name=8:13></a> The sooner you begin to say <i>we</i> and <i>us</i> the more quickly you will come into the front rank in the work of God.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I trust all understand that I am trying to make things practical.<a name=8:15></a> The Lord is seeking to bring us into the great idea of the assembly, and this book is remarkable as to how it presents the assembly.<a name=8:16></a> It presents it in concrete things; whether it is the local gathering in Ephesus, or whether it is the bride, the ideas presented are concrete.<a name=8:17></a> They are not beyond my understanding.<a name=8:18></a> A great city is not beyond my understanding; nor is a local company of saints; nor is a bride.<a name=8:19></a> These are all spiritual thoughts, but also practical, and I want to be in the current of them.<a name=8:20></a> If I am in this town in relation to the local company, I want to be representative of it wherever I go, but representative only of what is of God.<a name=8:21></a> What is the good of carrying anything else?<a name=8:22></a> Phoebe went to Rome; she had never been there before, I suppose.<a name=8:23></a> It was a long way.<a name=8:24></a> She went to Rome from Cenchrea, which was near Corinth.<a name=8:25></a> She is connected with the assembly in Cenchrea; that is the point the

	<div class="paragraph">
		apostle makes.<a name=9:1></a> Who is she?<a name=9:2></a> She is in a sense the angel of the assembly there.<a name=9:3></a> Picture her in Rome, in the house of a spiritual sister, and another sister goes to see her.<a name=9:4></a> Will Phoebe bring out the latest social ideas in Cenchrea?<a name=9:5></a> No!<a name=9:6></a> She will not.<a name=9:7></a> She is a servant of the assembly at Cenchrea, and she will talk about the saints in Cenchrea.<a name=9:8></a> In Rome she will represent the assembly at Cenchrea; that is what she would wish to do, I am sure.<a name=9:9></a> She had the apostle Paul's recommendation.<a name=9:10></a> What better could she have?<a name=9:11></a> She was a representative; she was an angel, you might say, in that sense.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will see what I am seeking to make clear.<a name=9:13></a> God intends the heavenly character of the assembly to be reflected in the localities where the saints are, and as each one in a given place reflects that, he is a representative of the work of God there.<a name=9:14></a> All that is embodied in the seven epistles.<a name=9:15></a> That principle runs through them all.<a name=9:16></a> If we link them all together we shall see how the golden thread of angelic representation is unfolded.<a name=9:17></a> When the Lord Jesus says, <i>Mine angel</i>, that is a literal angel that represents Him, but when He says "To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write": that is the assembly's angel, -- some person or persons in the town that the Lord takes account of in that way.<a name=9:18></a> If the representative is poor, then He will rebuke him.<a name=9:19></a> If the representative is acceptable and according to heaven, He will praise him.<a name=9:20></a> Alas!<a name=9:21></a> there are only one or two assemblies free from rebuke!<a name=9:22></a> I am speaking of representation, in this way, so that God might have, through His work in His people, representatives on earth at the present time.<a name=9:23></a> I believe He has them.<a name=9:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To confirm what I am saying, it is noteworthy that the saints in the beginning had the idea of representation.<a name=9:25></a> You see it in the house of Mary when Peter was released from the prison, a most interesting story.<a name=9:26></a> James was killed with the sword and Peter was put into prison, and the whole assembly began to pray about Peter.<a name=9:27></a> That is

	<div class="paragraph">
		one encouraging thing about the present time, that the saints all over the world are praying about the same thing, and you may be sure God will do something about that.<a name=10:1></a> The assembly was praying unceasingly about Peter.<a name=10:2></a> Presently Peter was released and came to Mary's house.<a name=10:3></a> A maid came to listen and recognised his voice.<a name=10:4></a> Peter was there at the door.<a name=10:5></a> Those inside thought they knew better than Rhoda; they said, It is his angel.<a name=10:6></a> I speak of this in connection with angelic representation.<a name=10:7></a> Where did they get the thought?<a name=10:8></a> It is plain enough that the thought of angels in those days included representation.<a name=10:9></a> The Lord Himself says that even "little ones" have angels representing them in heaven.<a name=10:10></a> Rhoda said, It is Peter!<a name=10:11></a> Peter has just been speaking to himself; sometimes it is wholesome to talk to ourselves; it is indeed.<a name=10:12></a> We are told that he was asleep in the prison and an angel of the Lord came and smote him on the side.<a name=10:13></a> Why did he not smite him on the cheek?<a name=10:14></a> I suppose the angel was thinking about the side of the Lord Jesus, which had been smitten.<a name=10:15></a> Peter would understand that.<a name=10:16></a> He awakened Peter, telling him to put on his upper garment and his sandals, and follow; and he did.<a name=10:17></a> They passed one guard after another and nobody said anything.<a name=10:18></a> They went to the outer gate and it opened of itself; then they went down one street and the angel left him.<a name=10:19></a> Peter spoke to himself then.<a name=10:20></a> What a scene that was!<a name=10:21></a> What an experience!<a name=10:22></a> "Peter, being come to himself, said, Now I know certainly that the Lord has sent forth his angel and has taken me out of the hand of Herod", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12:11">Acts  12:11</a>.<a name=10:23></a> It was an accurate conclusion.<a name=10:24></a> He spoke to himself.<a name=10:25></a> He just says that and goes to Mary's door, and the people inside say, "It is his angel".<a name=10:26></a> They did not believe in such an intervention, although evidently they had prayed for it.<a name=10:27></a> This reminds us that we might pray for things we do not expect to get.<a name=10:28></a> In spite of unbelief God answered the prayers of the assembly, and Peter was at the door.<a name=10:29></a> Rhoda insisted

		J.T.<a name=13:1></a> Before proceeding to dwell on the service of God in the difficult times of which the Scriptures speak, times illustrated in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#13">2 Chronicles  13</a>, it is thought well that we should look at it under <i>normal</i> circumstances.<a name=13:2></a> This chapter in Leviticus depicts the consecration of the priests; it is the disclosure of the mind of God as to Christ and the saints; Christ as the true Aaron, and ourselves as the sons of Aaron.<a name=13:3></a> The mind of God as to the priests is depicted in the chapter so that we might have understanding of the priesthood.<a name=13:4></a> As the consecration takes place, the verses read show that Aaron and his sons were to abide at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night, seven days, to keep the charge of Jehovah.<a name=13:5></a> Then we are told in the last verse that "Aaron and his sons did all things that Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses".<a name=13:6></a> Thus we have the position from the divine side and the service inaugurated under favourable circumstances.<a name=13:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=15:14></a> I thought that the consecration means being wholly occupied with this thing, filled full.<a name=15:15></a> The apostles said, for instance, "It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:2">Acts  6:2</a>.<a name=15:16></a> They had in mind that they should keep to the one thing; although Paul served tables, but clearly the apostles had in mind that they should be occupied with one thing, the word of God.<a name=15:17></a> Here, of course, it is the charge, "keep the charge of Jehovah".<a name=15:18></a>

		I wish to speak about strangership, and I think I have selected the most suitable passages for such a subject, believing they will aid me in what I have to say.<a name=92:1></a> The first scripture speaks about Moses in this respect.<a name=92:2></a> He represents the service of God, the ministry.<a name=92:3></a> Of him God says, "he is faithful in all my house", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:7">Numbers  12:7</a>.<a name=92:4></a> Having part in the house of God tests us much; the apostle was concerned that those who served in it should know how to behave; saying to Timotheus that he wrote to him, pending the time of his coming, "in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>.<a name=92:5></a> Then, so as to make clear what that meant, that the house was not like the temple at Jerusalem built by Herod or Solomon or Zerubbabel, he says, "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth".<a name=92:6></a> Such is the great and glorious designation of the house of God; and so great, correspondingly, is the necessity for knowing how to conduct ourselves in it.<a name=92:7></a> For in truth it is composed of the saints, not of stones cut out with hands, but of living stones, who are marked off as coming to Christ who is the Living Stone; and as having come, they "are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".<a name=92:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that Moses fittingly comes in at the beginning of the subject I have chosen, and he brings in this question of strangership as soon as his first child is born.<a name=92:9></a> It is very significant that this characteristic of true believers is written in indelible letters on the household of this great servant of God.<a name=92:10></a> Previous to this Moses had not been the head of a house.<a name=92:11></a> He had been brought up as a foster-child in the leading royal house of the world, really as a son in it, and was sophisticated according to the learning of that house, skilled in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.<a name=92:12></a>

		What I have in mind is in relation to <i>speaking</i>.<a name=104:1></a> It is peculiarly a time of speaking: God is now speaking from heaven, and Luke has in mind the quality of the speaking.<a name=104:2></a> It belongs to the priestly state, for the priests' lips should keep knowledge, as Scripture says, It is to be observed that he who prefigured Christ as Priest, he who became the first high priest of Israel and the father of the priestly family, is introduced in the Scriptures as one who could <i>speak well</i>: that is, Aaron.<a name=104:3></a> Impediments in speech are not rare, and where they exist they occasion discipline; but God made man's mouth, inclusive of all the organs of speech, and made it perfectly.<a name=104:4></a> It is this very fact that He brings forward, when one who was to be a great servant complained that he could not speak.<a name=104:5></a> Inability to speak, therefore, is not to be put forward as an excuse for non-speaking, for silence.<a name=104:6></a> Luke records of the young man of the city of Nain who was raised from the dead, that he sat up and began to speak.<a name=104:7></a> We have to make a <i>beginning</i> in speaking.<a name=104:8></a> The voice of a risen young man, and the theme of his speaking, would be of deep interest.<a name=104:9></a> Lazarus, who also was raised from the dead, is never said to have spoken, another singular thing.<a name=104:10></a> Yet he was the occasion of many believing on Jesus.<a name=104:11></a> So that speaking is not everything in service; something more than speaking is needed.<a name=104:12></a> Without other essential things speaking is in the way and may become a trial to the saints.<a name=104:13></a> There are those who think they are heard because of much speaking, which the Lord rebukes.<a name=104:14></a>

		Well now, I shall lean on my four scriptures to aid me in bringing out this matter.<a name=105:13></a> The first shows that speaking is based on and is the outcome of faith.<a name=105:14></a> The second shows that it is the outcome of seeing the glory of Christ; not simply reading about Christ, but seeing the glory of Christ.<a name=105:15></a> The third declares that "oracles of God" are to be enunciated.<a name=105:16></a> And fourthly it is stated that the saints characteristically speak one to another.<a name=105:17></a> They have no discrimination, as preferring one to another; the mutual feelings in the saints of God are in view characteristically as having love amongst themselves; that is, the most honoured brother speaks to the simplest, if I may so classify them.<a name=105:18></a> They "spoke often one to another".<a name=105:19></a> The divine system affords such condescension, humility in listening to perhaps the least, as he might be estimated.<a name=105:20></a> The Lord Jesus listened to two speakers: one was

		Now the next thing is not with regard to faith, but to the glory of Christ.<a name=108:1></a> One of the greatest thoughts in Scripture is the glory of Christ.<a name=108:2></a> There is the glory of God too; there is the Father of glory, and the Lord of glory, but this is the glory of Christ.<a name=108:3></a> Well, if that comes into my soul, and I am going to speak about Him, it is because I have seen that glory.<a name=108:4></a> Thus John says, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:41">John  12:41</a>.<a name=108:5></a> It dissipates any thought of glory as to myself that I may have in my service of speaking, one of the greatest dangers in serving is to have any thought of personal glory in the service; it is a dead fly in the ointment of the apothecary.<a name=108:6></a> How often it breaks through the screen!<a name=108:7></a> So John the evangelist, quoting by the Spirit from <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>says, "Lord, who has believed our report?<a name=108:8></a> and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?<a name=108:9></a> On this account they could not believe, because Esaias said again, He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal them", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:38">John  12:38</a> - 40.<a name=108:10></a> A terrible judicial sentence!<a name=108:11></a> "They could not believe".<a name=108:12></a> As quoted here, it is the second time Esaias spoke.<a name=108:13></a> But my verse is, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him", verse 41.<a name=108:14></a> Now one rejoices in the great increase of ability in service, but I would urge on all of us who serve, to seek to understand and get a view of the glory of Christ.<a name=108:15></a> Where is that glory to be seen?<a name=108:16></a> It is in the sanctuary as one retires there, for if one is to speak to men, he must speak to God first.<a name=108:17></a> If I cannot speak to God I cannot rightly speak to men.<a name=108:18></a> Of one it is said, that he had power with God and men; and according to this verse the need is to see the glory of Christ if one is to speak to men rightly of Him.<a name=108:19></a> For that we need the power of elimination; the ability to govern our minds, so as to eliminate from them at a given time all that is extraneous to the moment, and to

		The next thing, dear brethren, is the oracles of God.<a name=109:8></a> It is said of Israel that they had much advantage because to them were committed the oracles of God.<a name=109:9></a> Oracles are speakings from an oracle; in Scripture they are speakings from the temple of God.<a name=109:10></a> That is more than my closet, my retreat before my service: it involves the assembly, it involves the saints, that is to say, those who have the Holy Spirit.<a name=109:11></a> I can speak much better to those who have the Holy Spirit than to those who have not.<a name=109:12></a> The latter need the gospel.<a name=109:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14">Acts  14</a>Paul spoke to those who had not the Spirit, as I have already said.<a name=109:14></a> The more spiritual the auditors, the more elevated the ministry; for there is a drawing out, instead of forcing it back.<a name=109:15></a> And why should it not be so?<a name=109:16></a> As we are together as of the temple there should be scope for the ministry of the Spirit.<a name=109:17></a> "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God?<a name=109:18></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>.<a name=109:19></a> We may well take the words to ourselves: "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=109:20></a>" The Holy Spirit has liberty in the saints and thus there is a spiritual current, that is the idea of the oracle; it is a place of immediate communication from God, not what I get in my closet, but what I get when I am on my feet

		And so it is here that the apostle Peter says, "<i>we</i> have believed and known that <i>thou</i> art the holy one of God".<a name=145:1></a> The saints are called "holy brethren"; but <i>He</i> is <i>the Holy One of God</i>, the true Aaron of God; He, who is the Minister of the sanctuary, who officiates in the holy places.<a name=145:2></a> Peter says, We know that; we <i>have</i> believed, and we believe it now.<a name=145:3></a> This implies that those who had left the Lord and walked no longer with Him did not know Him.<a name=145:4></a> Maybe there is somebody here who has turned away from the Lord.<a name=145:5></a> "From that time many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him", verse 66.<a name=145:6></a> Think of the solemnity of that!<a name=145:7></a> Think of going back from the holy and blessed Person of Christ!<a name=145:8></a> They "walked no more with him"; it is a settled thing, and we must say, for ever.<a name=145:9></a> How solemn!<a name=145:10></a> Peter says, "<i>we</i> have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God".<a name=145:11></a> Would Peter not know how to take part in the assembly when the time came?<a name=145:12></a> When the Holy Spirit came down from heaven and entered into Peter and the others, they would serve in the assembly in the recognition of the Lord as the "minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:2">Hebrews  8:2</a>.<a name=145:13></a> Peter would know how to take part in the service of God.<a name=145:14></a> As the saints in those early days came together in assembly, Peter would rise up and speak to God; he would know that the Lord Jesus, and not the high priest at Jerusalem, was Minister of the sanctuary.<a name=145:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>it is said the Lord "assembled with them".<a name=145:16></a> Peter would apprehend then that the Lord was the Holy One of God, the true Leader in the assembly.<a name=145:17></a> And so it is today in the spiritual sense: as coming together in assembly, we are to understand, not only by the Scriptures but by experience, that Christ is the Holy One of God, and that He is the Minister of the sanctuary, of the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man.<a name=145:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=147:1></a> The brethren will be generally aware that the subject proposed for these monthly readings is that of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that is to say.<a name=147:2></a> God, the economy into which He has come and the names by which He is spoken of in Scripture, by which the three Persons of the Godhead, indeed, are spoken of.<a name=147:3></a> It is thought that we should begin with the Father, the special title in which God is known to christians, and then later take up other titles from the Old and New Testaments.<a name=147:4></a> Father is the name in which God is revealed in christianity.<a name=147:5></a> In Matthew He is seen generally in relation to the kingdom, that is, in the exercise of care for His people down here; whereas John in one passage quoting the Lord Jesus, connects us with the Father as Christ is with Him.<a name=147:6></a> The Lord says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=147:7></a> That is not a kingdom connection but a <i>family</i> connection, in which we know God in the most exalted and intimate way of any of the families in heaven or on earth, because it is in <i>association</i> with Christ -- He being the Son, we being sons.<a name=147:8></a>

		The passage in Corinthians shows how christians as thus baptised regard God -- "to us", it says, The knowledge spoken of is confined in phraseology to the saints of God -- "to us there is one God, the Father", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>.<a name=148:1></a> So that we begin with God <i>known</i> to us, at least professedly known to believing through the Holy Spirit.<a name=148:2></a> Of the three Persons spoken of in the formula in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>, the Holy Spirit is the power in us of knowledge and in this power we can call God our Father, for it is said, "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:18">Ephesians  2:18</a>.<a name=148:3></a> So that we should be able to converse about this great matter as of a God known to us, we might say humbly and reverently, in a personal way, as the Father.<a name=148:4></a>

		Then another thing, one ventures to say for the sake of clarity is that all truth is authoritative, and the apostles represent the authority of the truth known to us in the New Testament, as Moses represents the authority of God in the Pentateuch.<a name=148:5></a> Moses received at mount Horeb light from God as to Himself.<a name=148:6></a> He said, "I am Jehovah.<a name=148:7></a> And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as the Almighty God", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6:2">Exodus  6:2</a>,3.<a name=148:8></a> But now He is taking on a new name, which is Jehovah.<a name=148:9></a> In writing the Pentateuch, Moses uses the name Jehovah from the outset, but He uses it as in the light of the revelation that he had.<a name=148:10></a> He uses the title Jehovah from the outset in Genesis, and he uses it according to the light that <i>he</i> had, the revelation made to him.<a name=148:11></a> He does not enlarge on it at first, but when we come to Exodus, the second book he wrote, Moses tells us about this revelation, and not only having the revelation but being commissioned of God as the mediator between Him and the people, he has authority in what he says, hence the Pentateuch is the beginning of divine authority in Scripture, the written mind of God; and so the apostles in the New Testament occupy the same place as Moses.<a name=148:12></a> They had a revelation.<a name=148:13></a> Peter had a revelation from the

		J.T.<a name=221:1></a> At our last reading we were dwelling on <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a>.<a name=221:2></a> It is thought we should begin there tonight -- considering the names of God in the Old Testament.<a name=221:3></a> In the originals of these three scriptures, the first is Elohim, which we have already touched on; the second is El, chapter 14; and the third is Eloah or Elah, the same under two different original words, one Hebrew and the other Chaldee.<a name=221:4></a> There are other names of God in the Old Testament, which we may consider at the next meeting.<a name=221:5></a> We noticed before that Elohim is God's creative name; at least, the name by which He is spoken of as Creator.<a name=221:6></a> He is the Being with whom men have to do; to whom they are responsible; He is to be worshipped.<a name=221:7></a> This is the appellation by which He is most frequently spoken of in the Old Testament.<a name=221:8></a> Why there should be so many names of God in Hebrew is a matter to be specially noted, for in the earlier western languages, especially Greek and Latin, there is only one title in each language.<a name=221:9></a> It would seem as if faith in its earlier stages laid hold of God in different features, each title conveying some distinctive one, as if love would multiply names.<a name=221:10></a> But in general the names in the Old Testament carry the idea of power.<a name=221:11></a> So that if we think creationally, faith would, as following the Old Testament custom, think of God under this great general title of Elohim.<a name=221:12></a> We have the attributes of God used as names too, such as the Almighty.<a name=221:13></a> The pronoun 'He' is used to designate the Deity.<a name=221:14></a> All these titles culminate in the name Father in which God is revealed to christians.<a name=221:15></a> We do well to look into these various designations of God and see whether our minds may not become enlarged as to Him, our affections, too; for the ultimate of all these considerations of the Scriptures should lead to a greater love for God.<a name=221:16></a> It is said that in

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=222:4></a> Yes.<a name=222:5></a> And the accumulative designations largely refer to attributes; that is, God known in various ways, and all brought down in the New Testament as included in the appellation God, whom the only-begotten Son has declared.<a name=222:6></a> It is one term, whether it be in the Greek or Latin parts of the western world.<a name=222:7></a> Then He says that He has become Father to us: "and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:18">2 Corinthians  6:18</a>.<a name=222:8></a> So all really merge in the great relation in which He stands to christianity as the Father.<a name=222:9></a> Of course.<a name=222:10></a> He is God -- "yet to us there is one God, the Father", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>.<a name=222:11></a> So our considerations of this great subject ought to lead to increased appreciation of God, and especially as our Father, because all these attributes enter into the name of Father.<a name=222:12></a>

		From the passages read in Exodus we will see that Jehovah is a special name taken with Israel.<a name=263:5></a> God Almighty was a name taken especially with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, so that we are now in the realm of revelation.<a name=263:6></a> How the name Elohim or God as used in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a> came into currency is not stated in Scripture.<a name=263:7></a> It is used in that verse of course, but it was evidently already in use.<a name=263:8></a> But these names 'God Almighty' and 'Jehovah' are special, involving revelation, God making Himself known to His people in a special way, and that indicated in the appellation used.<a name=263:9></a> This prepares us for what runs through Scripture, the idea of revelation, and finally in the Lord Jesus' own remarks that the Father is revealed by Him and that no one knows the Son but the Father.<a name=263:10></a>

		J.S.<a name=264:6></a> Do you think it is because of special circumstances that this name is introduced?<a name=264:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=264:8></a> It has in mind that God is entering into covenant with His people and delivering them.<a name=264:9></a> As taking them out of the world they are to be His people and He is to be their God and He is to dwell among them, so that He holds back nothing from them so far as it applies to them.<a name=264:10></a> He would have them to understand that He is disclosing Himself in His secret Being, which always ought to touch us.<a name=264:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=265:8></a> Yes, only some of the attributes are stressed.<a name=265:9></a> The attribute of power is stressed in the name 'God Almighty', as we had it this afternoon; but when you come to 'Jehovah' it is the Being Himself, I AM.<a name=265:10></a> The root really implies 'to exist'.<a name=265:11></a> That is His name, that He exists eternally.<a name=265:12></a> "THAT I AM" goes further, implying <i>what</i> He is without stating it, but it would come out in effect.<a name=265:13></a>

		F.H.<a name=265:14></a>L.<a name=265:15></a> Is that the name of <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>?<a name=265:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before reading the Scriptures it might be well to remark that there are several divine titles that we shall not have time to look at, but they are particularly titles that stand related to Jehovah, such as the pronoun 'He', which is used, as many of us know, either rendered 'He' or 'the Same'.<a name=286:7></a> It is employed several times in the Old Testament and very significantly as calling attention to essential, unchangeable Deity, an idea that ought to be in our minds as in a changeable world.<a name=286:8></a> The first mention of it is in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:39">Deuteronomy  32:39</a>, I believe, and we are there directed in a note to several passages in which it appears.<a name=286:9></a> Another name that God takes in the Old Testament is 'Jealous', <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:14">Exodus  34:14</a>, very significant, too, warning us against idolatry.<a name=286:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=310:1></a> For the sake of our visiting brethren, it may be remarked that in these monthly meetings we are considering the great subject of Divine Names.<a name=310:2></a> We have so far considered the <i>Father</i> -- in the first reading, in subsequent meetings we considered God as in the names peculiar to the Old Testament, such as, Elohim, the Highest, and the Almighty, and above all, Jehovah; so that at our last meeting, we considered that we reached the end of the Old Testament.<a name=310:3></a> There are four readings remaining, so it is thought that we might look into the New Testament again with regard to the names or titles of our Lord Jesus and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=310:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The proposal now is that we might consider Jesus, and Jesus Christ, and Christ Jesus, and Messiah at this reading -- referring to sections in Matthew and Luke.<a name=310:5></a> It is thought well to begin with Matthew in our subject, because it gives the <i>legal</i> side of our Lord's position as become Man.<a name=310:6></a> The genealogy establishes that He was Son of David, Son of Abraham, and in the course of the angel's remarks to Joseph (Joseph is more prominent in Matthew than in Luke) we have the remarkable statement that Jesus implies Deity.<a name=310:7></a> It is said, "For he shall save his people from their sins", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:21">Matthew  1:21</a>.<a name=310:8></a> The 'for' there is sequential in that it alludes to the meaning of the name Jesus, which we get in the Old Testament -- "Jah, the Saviour".<a name=310:9></a> The word 'saviour' is alluded to.<a name=310:10></a> It is the enlarged name of Joshua, and the first name given to him; although it was literally given to him as he searched out the land, the first mention of him is not as 'Hoshea' but Joshua, which means, Jah, the saviour.<a name=310:11></a> That is a clear statement of His deity.<a name=310:12></a> The name Jesus designates Him as Man, but it also involves His Deity.<a name=310:13></a> This is a point that each of us should understand, because it greatly enhances in our minds the Person of Christ -- who He is.<a name=310:14></a>

		Another thing that confirms that, and it is very significant in Matthew, is what was said to the prophet, "Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord, through the prophet saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us'", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:22">Matthew  1:22</a>,23.<a name=311:3></a> So these two allusions to the Old Testament are very significant here.<a name=311:4></a> There are no more significant statements really as to our subject, because they point directly to the deity of Christ: first, as Saviour of His people, meaning God's people, and then Emmanuel, that Person is with His people.<a name=311:5></a> And it is said further, in Luke, that Mary was to call His name Jesus.<a name=311:6></a> The angel in Luke would put it on Mary to do this, but significantly it is Joseph here, the male side, establishing the full position of Christ as in manhood, that He is God, and that He has people, and that He saves them and that He is <i>with</i> His people, the word 'Emmanuel' meaning this.<a name=311:7></a> What we have, therefore, in this chapter is on a sure footing.<a name=311:8></a> It is well to have all this before us, because it is very establishing and confirming as to the ground we are on as gathering to the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=311:9></a>

		C.A.<a name=312:16></a>M.<a name=312:17></a> It throws light on the gospel of Matthew to my mind, that God Himself should come into those matters, giving the idea of government and our responsibility as to it.<a name=312:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=312:19></a> I think we shall see that as we consider the matter in going through Matthew how the legal side is established; not legal in the sense of enslavement, but establishing everything as of God, what God enjoins; and how it bears on the assembly, and the position

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=313:9></a> Quite so.<a name=313:10></a> It is the royal side.<a name=313:11></a> God had gone to great pains to establish the house of David, and David says, "thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:19">2 Samuel  7:19</a>.<a name=313:12></a> That "great while to come" implies eternity; and that book shows that the Lord Jesus is the promised son of David, not Solomon.<a name=313:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=313:16></a> And for good moral reasons.<a name=313:17></a> He is a <i>righteous</i> man.<a name=313:18></a> You do not get that in Luke.<a name=313:19></a> The angel takes account of and honours a righteous man, and so in Matthew you get later that if you do something for a righteous man, you get a righteous man's reward.<a name=313:20></a> "He that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:41">Matthew  10:41</a>.<a name=313:21></a> The book is on those lines.<a name=313:22></a> Things must be right, and Joseph is morally right in his position.<a name=313:23></a> It was right for him to have those exercises, but the angel respects that and adjusts him thoroughly, so that Joseph is brought into accord with God.<a name=313:24></a>

		with.<a name=314:1></a> I would say Luke is what a <i>sinner</i> needs.<a name=314:2></a> Luke is the most evangelical of all the gospels, and of course what we all need is the gospel to set our souls right; so that the angel says to the shepherds, "For today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:11">Luke  2:11</a>.<a name=314:3></a> That is what we need.<a name=314:4></a> I would say that Luke is the gospel of the grace of God -- which every sinner specially needs.<a name=314:5></a> But then the next thing would be whether he is going to be an assembly man, and every christian should be fit for the assembly; and I think Matthew is specially the gospel for the assembly.<a name=314:6></a> If I am to be an assembly man, if I am to be in fellowship, I must be a righteous man.<a name=314:7></a> One who is assembly material does not seek to justify himself in any matter by saying, The Lord knows my heart.<a name=314:8></a> That will not do for Matthew; in cases needing adjustment more than that is needed.<a name=314:9></a> The saints need to know something about your conduct and your associations and what you are saying.<a name=314:10></a> Matthew demands all these things.<a name=314:11></a>

		Then, the next thing is the ministry, and Mark has that before him.<a name=314:12></a> So that he begins with "Jesus Christ, Son of God".<a name=314:13></a> It is a question of the ministry, and then finally, the greatest thing of all, the deity of Christ.<a name=314:14></a> What He is from John's point of view; formally stated to be God: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>.<a name=314:15></a> And the creation was by Him; that is, John goes back to the beginning of everything and establishes who Christ is in relation, not only to the creation in Genesis, but that which is before it.<a name=314:16></a> Whenever there was a beginning, He was there.<a name=314:17></a>

		NAMES OF DIVINE PERSONS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To be balanced in considering so great a subject as divine Names, we must distinguish between God in absoluteness and in relativeness.<a name=426:1></a> The Deity has to be regarded by Itself, so to speak, that is, as before and outside relations with time and creation.<a name=426:2></a> In this aspect no one has seen or can see God.<a name=426:3></a> He is altogether beyond the grasp of the mind of the creature.<a name=426:4></a> To assume that the declaration of God implies that men may now see God as He existed eternally, is a mistake; it makes Him cease to be invisible, which, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> and <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:15">Colossians  1:15</a>, is not the truth.<a name=426:5></a> He is still the invisible God.<a name=426:6></a> That Christ is God, and that all the fulness dwelt in Him, and that God was seen in Him, is, of course, true, but this is in manhood, not in His eternal form and essence.<a name=426:7></a> In the latter sense He remains in infinite inscrutability.<a name=426:8></a> His form and His mode of existence are beyond the understanding of the greatest creature.<a name=426:9></a> Being creatures, we can think and speak only in finite terms, whereas the Absolute is infinite, and the relations between divine Persons, and the names by which they may be known to Each Other in Their infinitude, are above our understanding.<a name=426:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While God is thus absolute, He has been pleased also to take up a relative position.<a name=426:11></a> He has created and He has entered into relation with His creatures; and the names He has taken, as presented in Scripture, contemplate this relativity.<a name=426:12></a> They do not convey, as their several meanings show, the relations of the Persons of the Godhead viewed in absoluteness; that is, as between Themselves.<a name=426:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of those names in the Old Testament, <i>Elohim</i> comes first.<a name=426:14></a> It is plural, signifying the Supreme, the object of worship.<a name=426:15></a> <i>Elah</i> and <i>Eloah</i> (both singular) also signify God as the object of worship.<a name=426:16></a> Then <i>El</i> and <i>Shaddai</i> convey strength.<a name=426:17></a> It is obvious that all these contemplate

		God as in relation with creation, not the Deity in its absolute or abstract relations.<a name=427:1></a> No One of the Persons would be an object of worship to the Others, for instance; nor can One be regarded as stronger than the Others.<a name=427:2></a> <i>Jehovah</i> may seem to be exceptional as indicating eternal self-existence, like "I AM"; but again it is clear that it would not have force as between the divine Persons Themselves, each being self-existent.<a name=427:3></a> It points, too, to a covenant relation with Israel, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6:3">Exodus  6:3</a>.<a name=427:4></a> <i>Adon</i> and <i>Adonai</i>, signifying Lord, Master, are, needless to say, relative; also <i>Jealous</i>, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:14">Exodus  34:14</a>, and <i>Most High</i> -- <i>Elyon</i>.<a name=427:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the New Testament, <i>Theos</i>, God, the object of worship, etc.<a name=427:6></a>, is relative.<a name=427:7></a> Father, Son, and Spirit are names divine Persons take as declared or revealed.<a name=427:8></a> Here they are relative to Each Other, but clearly as unitedly relative to the creation through redemption.<a name=427:9></a> Thus it is God or the Godhead, <i>relatively</i>, not absolutely.<a name=427:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		While these designations involve mutual affection in the Persons so made known, their general presentation in Scripture proves unmistakably that an economy is conveyed in them.<a name=427:11></a> Relationships have been taken by the divine Persons in which the nature and attributes of the Godhead are presented intelligibly to men, and at the same time, in the most gracious and tender way, such as is calculated to win their hearts.<a name=427:12></a> In John's gospel we have the economy formally stated: "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand"; it is also stated in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:27">Matthew  11:27</a> and in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:22">Luke  10:22</a>.<a name=427:13></a> What follows in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>is the gift of living water -- the Holy Spirit -- proposed by the Son.<a name=427:14></a> This is enlarged on in chapter 7.<a name=427:15></a> Then in chapter 14 the Comforter is given by the Father as asked for by the Son.<a name=427:16></a> The Trinity is thus seen throughout.<a name=427:17></a> In chapter 20 the Lord breathes into the disciples, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit", after having said, "as the Father sent me forth, I also send you".<a name=427:18></a> The blessed economy or administration

		The other evangelists agree with all this.<a name=428:3></a> Each brings the three Persons of the Trinity into view at the Lord's baptism.<a name=428:4></a> Matthew also presents Them at the end of his gospel in the baptismal formula.<a name=428:5></a> The nations through baptism were to be introduced into the blessed light of God as now revealed or declared -- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<a name=428:6></a> To insist that this order, and the relation of the Persons to One Another, including the names attaching to Them thus seen, are the same as existed in the pre-incarnate absolute (this word is used as the converse of relative) conditions of Deity, is to force or disregard Scripture, and is intruding into things we have not seen.<a name=428:7></a> Moreover, we are implying, whatever we may say to the contrary, that the Persons were not co-equal, for this is conveyed in the order in which They are presented, and in the names taken; that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<a name=428:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be objected, 'But the Persons must be co-equal, even as revealed'.<a name=428:9></a> True, as viewed abstractly in their absolute relations of Deity, for They do not change; but viewed relative to creation.<a name=428:10></a> They do at least change in attitude, for in love They have come into relations in which They are known to the creature, One of Them having become Man.<a name=428:11></a> He has taken another form.<a name=428:12></a> The Father and the Spirit have not another form, although They have taken an attitude toward men in the economy of grace in keeping with what Christ has taken.<a name=428:13></a> The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are <i>working together</i> for the salvation and blessing of men, and for the accomplishment of Their own counsels of love.<a name=428:14></a> While God remains in impenetrable absoluteness, yet in the economy of grace the Trinity is seen <i>serving</i> men.<a name=428:15></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>sets this fact before us most touchingly, as is well known.<a name=428:16></a> All is in the spirit and grace witnessed in the incarnation and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=428:17></a> This attitude of service

		The Spirit being <i>sent</i>, is in keeping with the position Christ has taken up as Man sent by the Father.<a name=429:4></a> The peculiarly lowly attitude the Spirit has taken maintains the full import of the incarnation.<a name=429:5></a> That the Persons of the Deity viewed in Their absoluteness existed in Oneness is true, and that They may have borne names in relation to Each Other is possible, but those names would express Their unchangeable infinite equality; whereas the names by which <i>we</i> know Them are relative to creation, as already said.<a name=429:6></a> 'God' -- the Supreme, the Being to be worshipped -- is relative to creation, and does not apply to the Persons as between Themselves in Their absoluteness; that is, apart from creation.<a name=429:7></a> They are not 'God' to Themselves.<a name=429:8></a> This is a matter requiring the strictest attention if a clear understanding is to be had of the great subject we are considering.<a name=429:9></a> The Deity must be thought of by Itself; then as in relation to creation and redemption.<a name=429:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The hesitation to apply names to divine Persons as in Their absolute form -- that is, before creation -- has occasioned the charge of Tritheism, meaning that if one does not hold that the Persons were bound in the unity expressed in the relation of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, he must regard Each as a God.<a name=429:11></a> What, among other things is fatal to this charge, is that Tritheism, although false, is necessarily a term relative to creation, whereas the condition of the Deity contemplated is that which existed apart from and before creation.<a name=429:12></a> Is that condition, with names expressing it, revealed?<a name=429:13></a> Clearly not.<a name=429:14></a> That three infinite, co-equal, co-eternal Persons existed, is unquestionable, and that relations and affections suitable to Them existed is owned, but Scripture does not disclose to us these relations or the names that

	<div class="paragraph">
		express them.<a name=430:1></a> Whatever they are, they remain in their own setting of infinitude and so are beyond the creature's power to grasp.<a name=430:2></a> Not that there is no link between the absolute and the relative which the creature can take hold of: there is -- it is love, for God <i>is</i> love.<a name=430:3></a> This is absolute, and so the Lord Jesus says to the Father, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world".<a name=430:4></a> The Persons are the same in the absolute as in the relative, but the latter involves graded relations <i>taken</i>, in the former the Persons are taken account of, so to speak, in Their natural or normal relations.<a name=430:5></a> The instructed believer recognises, not three Gods, but one God in the Trinity, as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and he assumes that nothing inconsistent with this ever existed, but he does not admit that graded relations, involving relative inferiority in two of Them, existed between the divine Persons prior to the incarnation.<a name=430:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be said that the writer is inconsistent in using the designations God, Godhead, and Deity, when speaking of divine Persons in absolute conditions, if these designations are relative; but it is obvious that we must so speak of Them, for no other names are furnished in Scripture; the creature must speak in terms intelligible to him, and those are necessarily the ones God provides -- those involving God's relations with the creation.<a name=430:7></a> The designations "I AM" and "The Same" suggest absoluteness, but close examination shows that their use is comparative as of divine Persons with others; they could have no force or application to the Persons in relation to Themselves.<a name=430:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, I would say that I believe relations suitable to Themselves always existed between the divine Persons.<a name=430:9></a> Any other thought would be incompatible with love.<a name=430:10></a> God is love, and this is absolute.<a name=430:11></a> It is now known relatively in that Christ has laid down His life for us, <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>; but it ever marked the nature of God.<a name=430:12></a> As already noted, our Lord speaks of the Father loving

		Him before the foundation of the world.<a name=431:1></a> Some will insist that, because the Lord spoke thus as Son to His Father, the relation in which They then were, was the same as that in which They existed before the incarnation; but this is simply ignoring the difference between absolute divine conditions and relative ones.<a name=431:2></a> Moreover, it involves confusion in the use of appellations given to Christ as Man to suggest that titles used in Scripture to designate Him when in absolute Deity, must have applied to Him <i>then</i>.<a name=431:3></a> There is really no means, as said before, of distinguishing the Persons in absoluteness save as by employing the relative names furnished in Scripture.<a name=431:4></a> Spiritual simplicity accepts this obvious fact, but controversy -- in some -- will insist, as it suits its purpose, on making certain titles or names retrospective.<a name=431:5></a> Those that do so forget that, to be consistent, they must hold that Christ was Son of man before He became Man, see <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a>;<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:62">John  6:62</a>, and that our Lord bore the name "Jesus Christ" before He became flesh, see <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:2">1 John  4:2</a>.<a name=431:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Coupled with this most regrettable attitude, there is the inability or disinclination to acknowledge the inscrutable; for while it is a blessed fact that the three divine Persons co-equally and co-eternally existed, and, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, existed in relations of ineffable love, yet these relations are not defined; they are inscrutable, beyond the creature's power to grasp.<a name=431:7></a> God <i>dwelling</i> in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen nor can see.<a name=431:8></a> There is no heresy in this; it is imperative to insist on it, Instead of detracting from the Trinity, it honours it by ascribing to the Holy Persons the co-equal and co-eternal dignity that belongs to Each, humbly owning at the same time our creature limitations.<a name=431:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assumption that the declaration of God involves that the veil is removed, so that men may look on the Deity in its pre-incarnate relations, is unwarranted from Scripture and is false, as making the finite equal to the infinite.<a name=431:10></a> The creature is not capable of looking at the

		In view of the foregoing scriptural facts, it is clear that while the designation <i>Spirit</i> conveys what God is essentially, it cannot be regarded as a name of <i>One</i> only of the divine Persons viewed in the conditions of absolute Deity, for this would be to assume that the other two divine Persons were not spirits, which, of course, is not true, for God is said to be a spirit, as we have noted.<a name=433:14></a> The <i>title</i> is taken by one of the Persons in relation to the declaration of God.<a name=433:15></a> The Holy Spirit is called "the eternal Spirit", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:14">Hebrews  9:14</a>, as God is said to be

		An examination of theological history will reveal that soon after apostolic times certain ideas as to <i>Logos</i>, found in heathen teaching, were adopted by christian teachers and read into <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>.<a name=437:5></a> The <i>Believer's Magazine</i> would have us understand that the apostle John used the name <i>Logos</i> in this heathen sense, but there is no scriptural evidence of it.<a name=437:6></a> The notions that prevailed, largely borrowed from the Greeks, were developed by Philo, a Jewish-heathen philosopher who flourished about the time of our Lord.<a name=437:7></a> In his view the agent of action in the universe was a combination of certain qualities or attributes of the Supreme God, who Himself was infinitely apart from material things, and by this combination the world was made; at the same time it was held that the <i>Logos</i> had a separate existence.<a name=437:8></a> That the Spirit of God should have employed a term with any such meaning to designate our Lord as in pre-incarnate condition, is to a spiritually instructed believer, unthinkable.<a name=437:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This use of it, however, is founded mainly on <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>.<a name=446:5></a> Indeed that chapter is generally interpreted to mean that wisdom was a name attaching to our Lord before the world was.<a name=446:6></a> Such a use of the chapter involves disregard of certain facts which stand out in it, and which if accepted, entirely refute the above interpretation.<a name=446:7></a> First, wisdom is said to be possessed by Jehovah in the beginning of His way.<a name=446:8></a> 'Possessed' is given in concordances to mean 'acquired', 'set up', and the word is used in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:6">Deuteronomy  32:6</a> for "bought".<a name=446:9></a> Then "brought forth", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:25">Proverbs  8:25</a>, refers obviously to birth, the original word signifying 'pain', 'travail'.<a name=446:10></a> To apply these thoughts to a divine Person in pre-incarnate Deity is clearly wrong and derogatory.<a name=446:11></a> The following remarks on <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>indicate how this application came into orthodox currency:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'When in christian times it was observed how well the description of Wisdom in Job and Proverbs harmonised with that of God the Son in the New Testament, such passages as this (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>) were universally applied to Him, and the present one was interpreted as describing His eternal generation from the Father, such was the view, for instance, of Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian.<a name=446:12></a> But when the Arian controversy arose, this phrase was seized upon by the opponents of our Lord's Divinity, and claimed as teaching that He was, though the highest of created beings, still only a creature.<a name=446:13></a> The Catholics then changed their ground .<a name=446:14></a>.<a name=446:15></a>.<a name=446:16></a> applying the term

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But though the Catholics 'changed their ground' to combat Arian blasphemy, the application of wisdom as an appellative of our Lord in pre-incarnate Deity, with the corresponding belief that He was 'begotten of His Father before all worlds', remained in orthodox doctrine, the former being currently advocated in support of eternal sonship, and this by those who would rightly refuse the latter.<a name=447:3></a> But both are unscriptural.<a name=447:4></a>

		The truth is that in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>wisdom speaks as on earth, active in a world of sin.<a name=447:5></a> She speaks as a person and refers to prudence in a personal way.<a name=447:6></a> "The foolish woman" of chapter 9, as occupied in wickedness, is set over against wisdom as engaged in promoting what is of God.<a name=447:7></a> Wisdom as working on earth was embodied in Christ, and its all-various features are now made known in the church to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>.<a name=447:8></a> In Proverbs her activities are seen making a way for faith out of the labyrinth of confusion which sin has brought to pass in this world, and in chapter 8 she furnishes us with her own origin and history.<a name=447:9></a> As already noted, the terms she employs denote that, viewed as a personality, she had a beginning: she was brought forth -- born.<a name=447:10></a> It is not implied that wisdom, viewed as a quality or attribute of God, is not eternal, but that as the divine operations were contemplated, it assumed this personal character, God thus seeking to impress all with its prominence in all His works.<a name=447:11></a> It is inherent in Himself and was brought forth as the need for it existed.<a name=447:12></a>

		here how to deal with it as it acts.<a name=454:1></a> If the person in whom it acts cannot control it then the saints have to do it, and in doing that they have to control him or her.<a name=454:2></a> Thank God, there is power for that!<a name=454:3></a> The epistle to the Corinthians furnishes us with instruction how to deal with persons in whom leprosy is active, who have not dealt with it in themselves, for it is said, if we judge ourselves we shall not be judged.<a name=454:4></a> And these chapters deal with this thing.<a name=454:5></a>

		The examples of lepers that we have in the Scriptures are not so extensive as we might expect, in view of the great place that the thing has as a type of sin.<a name=454:6></a> The first leper mentioned is Miriam, the sister of Aaron, and she becomes a leper <i>judicially</i> -- a most solemn thing, especially in one having a reputation in the things of God.<a name=454:7></a> Gehazi is another who became leprous judicially.<a name=454:8></a> He was covetous; that is another working of sin that brings out this judicial dealing of God.<a name=454:9></a> That is to say, the sin that shows itself is, in the government of God, made leprosy in the person.<a name=454:10></a> We may not think that envy is as bad as covetousness, but God in Miriam shows that it is leprosy.<a name=454:11></a> And then in Uzziah, a king, who took on a service that did not belong to him, the same thing appears  -- he became leprous by a judicial act of God.<a name=454:12></a> He usurped the holy service of priesthood, although not a priest.<a name=454:13></a> This sin is prevalent today.<a name=454:14></a> The priest has access within whereas one who is not a priest, even a king, does not have that liberty, and Uzziah entered into the sanctuary, so that he became a leper judicially.<a name=454:15></a> There are three persons who definitely were made leprous judicially, but the real leprosy was there before it became manifest; it is God dealing with the thing, and exposing it in the sinner in its true character.<a name=454:16></a>

		In the New Testament ten lepers are seen together and they were all cleansed by the word of Christ -- but one only returned to give glory to God.<a name=454:17></a> Another one, definitely called a leper is Simon, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:6">Matthew  26:6</a>; he

		represents those whom although they have been leprous, have judged the leprosy and are cleansed.<a name=455:1></a> The Lord Jesus was with Simon the leper in his house, and received the service of love there, showing the leprosy was dealt with, but what he <i>had</i> been was attached to the man; the more you thought of the attachment of the word to him, the more you would think how thoroughly he had judged the evil; there is not a stain of it, a trace of it.<a name=455:2></a> You may tell him that he had been a leper, but he does not resent it because he would say, I know that, and am humbled because of it, but I am cleansed.<a name=455:3></a> Paul would say, I am chief of sinners.<a name=455:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I wish to point out that leprosy may be in a garment, whether in the warp or the woof of it.<a name=455:5></a> It is not the style of the garment, nor is it its size, but whether it is wool or linen, as to the material, or whether it is skin: ".<a name=455:6></a>.<a name=455:7></a>.<a name=455:8></a> in a woollen garment, or a linen garment, either in the warp or in the woof of linen or of wool, or in a skin, or in anything made of skin".<a name=455:9></a> That is, it could be a pair of gloves, or a pair of shoes -- anything made of skin.<a name=455:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this opens up a good deal, and it is a searching matter.<a name=455:11></a> But what is particularly in mind is to call attention to the difference between the warp and the woof; and what I have observed, as among the brethren in many parts of the world is, that we are generally ready to accept right principles.<a name=455:12></a> In the Bible readings brethren generally are ready to join in in the setting out of the truth; and of course the Lord is with us in all that, so far as we are saying what is true, governed by the Scriptures.<a name=455:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I liken that to the laying out of the warp.<a name=455:14></a> In weaving, the warp is laid out in the loom in long stretches of yarn, carefully set in the beam; it is usually stronger yarn than the woof, for there is more pressure on it as the weaving, proceeds.<a name=455:15></a> The Spirit of God takes all this up here as a symbol; we have our Bible readings and our

		ministry meetings, and the Spirit is with us in developing the truth.<a name=456:1></a> The best translation of the Bible is in our hands; God helped the translator with it, and He helps us now; the Holy Spirit is with us in our meetings for mutual help, and according to what the Lord says, He guides us into all the truth; that is, according to our type.<a name=456:2></a> He lays the warp out on the beam.<a name=456:3></a> The Lord was occupied largely in doing that as seen in the gospels.<a name=456:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we leave the meeting room normally we should begin to fill in the woof, using the shuttle, as it were; that makes the cloth.<a name=456:5></a> You cannot have cloth without both the warp and the woof, and whilst the warp is clear, there is not a particle of leprosy in it, all being agreed on the principles; but when we get outside the door and stand around we find that we have judgments different from what we supported at the reading inside.<a name=456:6></a> Disciplinary actions have taken place according to Scripture, but we are not in agreement with them; we talk about them; we are in agreement with the things as we speak of them in the Bible readings, but not as we come to deal with the persons.<a name=456:7></a> We cannot have the weft inserted, the cloth woven, without one another; principles are abstract.<a name=456:8></a> All eastern religions and even Judaism are largely a question of principles, but christianity is very definitely not only principles, but practice; the truth worked out in a concrete way in relation to one another, that is in our intercourse with the brethren.<a name=456:9></a> One whispers at the corner of the room something that is entirely in disagreement with what was said in the meeting -- that is leprosy in the woof.<a name=456:10></a> You have had the warp; the principles set out are to your mind right, but your practice is not right.<a name=456:11></a> And so there may be coteries, parties differing secretly from the brethren and from what is taught publicly -- well, dear brethren, such have a garment, but a garment with leprosy, and that is what this passage is intended to rebuke.<a name=456:12></a>

		Another thing in the chapter is a garment of skin.<a name=457:1></a> You may say, that means that death has come in, because you cannot have skin without the death of an animal; that is the principle.<a name=457:2></a> God made the first garment, and it was of skin; there was no leprosy in that.<a name=457:3></a> Abel followed that up; he brought the firstlings of his flock with the fat and offered it; that is to say, the death of the animal had taken place; he offered it up an acceptable offering to God.<a name=457:4></a> He evidently followed the light afforded in what God had done for his father and mother, in making garments of skin.<a name=457:5></a> If Eve had a wardrobe, no doubt you could see the coats of skin there; they would have been very interesting; I should like to have seen them.<a name=457:6></a> God made those first clothes; He made them of skin.<a name=457:7></a> In our chapter the garment of skin typifies the profession of christianity; that is to say, I come to the gospel meeting; I hear the gospel; I agree with every word that is said as to the gospel, the death of Christ alone as the means of salvation.<a name=457:8></a> But then when I come to practice, to work out my own salvation, I carry on much as I have always done; I do not walk according to the truth of the gospel.<a name=457:9></a> My <i>profession</i>, as owing to the death of Christ, is good, but my practice is not in keeping with it.<a name=457:10></a> What God requires in such a garment is the correlation of the truth of the gospel which I profess to accept -- and my practice.<a name=457:11></a> If my walk is out of accord with the gospel which I say I have accepted, my garment is leprous.<a name=457:12></a> Even the apostle Peter, who accepted and preached the gospel, was, for a time, guilty in this way, <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:11">Galatians  2:11</a> - 16.<a name=457:13></a> He was affected by human influence.<a name=457:14></a> This always tends to leprosy in our garments.<a name=457:15></a> It is most important as walking in the truth, to disallow personal preferences and party affiliations.<a name=457:16></a>

		There is nothing more to say except that each of us should look into this passage and see how the truth is worked out, how cleansing takes place.<a name=457:17></a> We have, for instance, "if .<a name=457:18></a>.<a name=457:19></a>.<a name=457:20></a> the sore is greenish or reddish in the
