		WATER OF PURIFICATION (1)

		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> I wish to speak of the water of purification as presented in the writings of John.<a name=1:2></a> In his gospel and his first epistle he presents the two elements of purification.<a name=1:3></a> In the gospel he relates that, the Lord being already dead, "one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water".<a name=1:4></a> In the gospel the blood is mentioned first, whilst in the epistle the water is first.<a name=1:5></a> We read there, referring to Jesus, "This is he that came by water and blood" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:6">1 John  5:6</a> - 8), "And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth.<a name=1:6></a> For they that bear witness are three: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood".<a name=1:7></a> John was surely thinking that in the last days there would be a need of washing with water, the witness of the blood being more generally received than the witness of the water.<a name=1:8></a> Many are enjoying the forgiveness of sins by virtue of the blood without ever having understood the significance of the water, which relates to our state, so that we may be purified in a practical way from the activity of sin in us.<a name=1:9></a> The subject in mind, the water of purification in John's gospel, begins with these stone waterpots filled with water; then in chapter 3 water is referred to in connection with new birth, "born of water".<a name=1:10></a> In chapter 9 the blind man on whose eyes the Lord had put mud, was sent to wash in the pool of Siloam.<a name=1:11></a> Then in chapter 13 the Lord Himself poured water into a wash hand basin in order to wash the feet of the disciples.<a name=1:12></a> I thought that the first two passages mentioned, chapters 2 and 3, would be sufficient for this morning.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:14></a> Is purification by blood necessary first, before being washed with water?<a name=1:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:1></a> The water of new birth would be the exception to that, since new birth precedes any understanding of the value of the blood; but in general the washing of purification is of persons who already know the value of the blood.<a name=2:2></a> These six stone vessels therefore represent believers who have not yet appreciated the value of the water.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:4></a> Is it of any importance that they are stone waterpots?<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>

		J.T.<a name=2:6></a> Stone represents something permanent.<a name=2:7></a>

		Rem.<a name=2:8></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>the Lord called Peter "a stone".<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:10></a> We have the principle there that a believer is a stone: it says there, "Thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone)".<a name=2:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, we read, "Thou art Peter", so it is evident that the Lord's words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>were uttered prior to those in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, but this establishes the principle that a believer is to be called a stone.<a name=2:12></a> Stone would probably be used as a foundation, or in the structure of a building, but here it is a vessel which contains something.<a name=2:13></a> In chapter 4 the woman of Samaria became spiritually a recipient, for the water that Christ gives will be in a believer "a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life".<a name=2:14></a> In chapter 2 the vessel is of stone, but empty.<a name=2:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:16></a> Why are there six water vessels?<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:18></a> It is probably an allusion to millennial conditions; for this chapter refers to the millennium, a period which will be marked by power, but which will not be a perfect state of things.<a name=2:19></a> The numeral five refers to man in weakness; six is more than five, but less than seven.<a name=2:20></a> The numeral six often occurs in Solomon's kingdom; while the number of the anti-christ is six hundred and sixty-six.<a name=2:21></a> This latter represents what is more in a bad sense -- superhuman, as men speak, while the numeral six may apply, in a good sense, to what is more than man's weakness.<a name=2:22></a> The millennium will not be a perfect condition of things, but it is of God.<a name=2:23></a> There are six days of creation in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>.<a name=2:24></a> These

		six vessels would represent young believers who are secure for eternity, yet are entirely lacking in purification, and so are not fulfilling the purpose for which they are destined.<a name=3:1></a> When the tabernacle was set up each part had its own function, so in the same way amongst saints in fellowship each should be fulfilling his function.<a name=3:2></a> They are not merely members of a congregation, but belong to a great organism pervaded by the Spirit of God, so each one ought to function in his own setting.<a name=3:3></a> This subject is enlarged upon in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=3:4></a> When the ark is referred to in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#40">Exodus  40</a>, the tables of testimony were in it, the candlestick was lit, and the shewbread was on the table.<a name=3:5></a> All this is most instructive for young believers; so these six water vessels, being empty, were not fulfilling their function.<a name=3:6></a>

		Ques.<a name=3:19></a> Are we not sometimes more exercised about the question of washing with water than with filling the vessels?<a name=3:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:21></a> Yes, that is referred to in verse 6 of chapter 2.<a name=3:22></a> It comes before chapter 3, and is a millennial scene; it is the first sign recorded by John, and thus gives us the general idea.<a name=3:23></a> The Lord said, "Fill the water-vessels with water", then, "Draw out now, and carry it to the feast-master".<a name=3:24></a> And they carried it; the servants exactly obeyed the Lord's instructions.<a name=3:25></a> The Lord's mother was not in accord with Him at first, but she was quickly restored, for she at once says to the servants, "Whatever he may say to you, do".<a name=3:26></a> This is a figure of a latter day

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:11></a> The servants knew what had happened.<a name=4:12></a> It is important for all who serve the saints to be intelligent and to understand what is taking place.<a name=4:13></a> The feast-master also recognised the quality of the wine; spiritually he was a connoisseur.<a name=4:14></a> It is greatly to be desired that we should know how to judge the quality and value of what is presented to us in the things of God, otherwise we may accept poor ministry while perhaps believing it to be excellent.<a name=4:15></a> It is important that saints should be capable of discerning quality; the Galatians, lacking in this, accepted poisoned ministry as though it were good.<a name=4:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:23></a> It is remarkable that it says here, "When the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine (and knew not whence it was, but the servants knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the bridegroom, and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and when men have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine till now".<a name=4:24></a> He tasted the water; the idea of water is maintained; it is when the water is tasted it is found to be wine.<a name=4:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> Applying it to the believer, it would imply that the testimony of the death of Christ has effected something in him.<a name=5:2></a> The vessel is filled; that is, the person is affected by the death of Christ, so that something that corresponds with the wine is produced in him.<a name=5:3></a> How refreshing it is to see a believer who has remained silent since his conversion, now a cause of joy to all by his taking part.<a name=5:4></a> Instead of remaining seated without exercise, without any spiritual activity, he is active and becomes a source of joy; he brings his contribution which can be drawn upon.<a name=5:5></a> It is not a result of mental activity; for the water is there always.<a name=5:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:9></a> That is similar.<a name=5:10></a> The waters were bitter and Jehovah commanded Moses to throw into it a certain wood, and they became sweet.<a name=5:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=5:14></a> Just so.<a name=5:15></a> The vessels were there, but were useless; now under the influence of Christ they have become useful.<a name=5:16></a>

		WATER OF PURIFICATION (2)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=10:1></a> We read chapters 2 and 3 of John yesterday, in connection with the water of purification.<a name=10:2></a> In chapter 2 we noticed that the six water vessels that had been placed there to hold the water of purification were empty, but were at the Lord's disposal, and He ordered them to be filled.<a name=10:3></a> When believers are filled with that which is the witness of the death of Christ, they become useful, and cause joy to the brethren; when the water in the vessels was drawn out, it became wine.<a name=10:4></a> In chapter 3 we spoke about the application of water in new birth; one born of water and of Spirit can enter the kingdom of God.<a name=10:5></a> Water and the Spirit exclude what is corrupt and the almighty power of God produces that which cannot be touched by corruption, "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit".<a name=10:6></a> It is the work of God which is first produced in a believer, enabling him to receive the gospel; without it no one can see the kingdom of God, nor enter it.<a name=10:7></a> What is begotten, or produced, is called <i>spirit</i>, implying that the believer is completely changed, and is in harmony with God; the believer himself is not called <i>spirit</i>, but there is something in him which is called <i>spirit</i>, which will eventually make him a spiritual man.<a name=10:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=10:9></a> Would you say that one must first be born of water and of Spirit before receiving the gospel?<a name=10:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=10:11></a> Without it we should be obliged to admit that the flesh is of some use; whereas "flesh profits nothing".<a name=10:12></a> We are all born after the flesh and have nothing that is of pleasure to God apart from new birth; this is a fundamental truth to which we should pay great attention.<a name=10:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=10:14></a> Is it the sovereign work of God who operates in new birth to make possible our entry into the kingdom of God?<a name=10:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=11:3></a> What is the difference between seeing and entering the kingdom of God?<a name=11:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:5></a> The first statement is general, taking in the whole truth, "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:3">John  3:3</a>; it excludes natural man as incapable of seeing the kingdom of God; then the second reply of the Lord to Nicodemus goes into detail.<a name=11:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=11:7></a> Is it not usually the Spirit who enables us to see and enter the kingdom of God?<a name=11:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:9></a> It is not a question here of having the Spirit, but simply of the work of God making man capable of seeing what He is presenting to him.<a name=11:10></a>

		Ques.<a name=11:11></a> Has every believer entered the kingdom of God?<a name=11:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=11:15></a> Could it be said of the man born blind that first he saw, then that he entered when he obeyed the Lord Jesus?<a name=11:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:17></a> I should like all to be clear about this, before speaking of chapter 9.<a name=11:18></a> In chapter 3 the Lord is speaking of <i>an initial work effected sovereignly by God</i>; the negative side is stressed showing what man cannot do unless born anew.<a name=11:19></a> This teaching shuts out man in the flesh, however great his ability; then, when man as such is put aside, something is introduced which allows such a one entry into the kingdom of God.<a name=11:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=11:21></a> There are two distinct thoughts; firstly born of water, and then born of Spirit.<a name=11:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:23></a> Water excludes what is corrupt; it is negative, in view of what is positive, what is termed "spirit", being free from the element of corruption.<a name=11:24></a> It is the basis of John's ministry; in his epistle he says, "Every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:18">1 John  5:18</a>), and "his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:9">1 John  3:9</a>.<a name=11:25></a> The believer is seen here apart from what he is in the flesh; our

		enjoyment of our relation with God and our spiritual progress, depend upon the way we abstract ourselves from what we are according to flesh.<a name=12:1></a> In this epistle a believer is viewed, normally, as having the Holy Spirit.<a name=12:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=12:3></a> Do we learn this in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:17">Romans  7:17</a>, "It is no longer <i>I</i> that do it, but the sin that dwells in me"?<a name=12:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:5></a> That helps us to understand the teaching of John's gospel.<a name=12:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>the believer is analysing himself morally, and is separating himself in his mind from what he is in the flesh, "So then <i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law".<a name=12:7></a> That shows what the flesh is worth; it only serves the law of sin.<a name=12:8></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>alludes to the millennium, and to millennial joys, but we also see typically a believer as a vessel for the water of purification.<a name=12:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=12:10></a> Has a believer seen thus passed through the experience of chapter 3?<a name=12:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:12></a> Chapter 2 outlines the general thought, whilst chapter 3 is fundamental, and shows <i>how</i> one may become a vessel capable of containing water of purification: if the six stone vessels represent believers, the stone would suggest that new birth had taken place.<a name=12:13></a> We were remarking yesterday that Peter was called <i>stone</i>; that is not connected with what he was in the flesh, but with his state as having been born anew; christians also are called "living stones".<a name=12:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may now look at chapter 9.<a name=12:15></a> We should first notice that this man's blindness was not governmental; it was not the result of his sins or of those of his parents; the Lord says, "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents".<a name=12:16></a> So in looking at the change wrought in this man, we must exclude from our minds the thought of any special sin for which he was responsible.<a name=12:17></a> We should see in this chapter the sovereignty of God, who allowed it in order that the works of God might be manifested in him.<a name=12:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=13:6></a> The epistle to the Romans does not exactly treat of this subject; this chapter can be compared with Adam's deep sleep and the forming of Eve; that is to say a state exists for the accomplishment of God's thoughts.<a name=13:7></a> The blindness of this man is only mentioned here in order to show how the works of God were manifested in him.<a name=13:8></a> Here the washing is not to remove defilement, but to enable the man to emerge from a state which does not answer to the purpose of God.<a name=13:9></a> The blind man had to wash from his eyes in the pool of Siloam that which the Lord had put on them, and this mud, made of earth and of the spittle of the Lord Jesus, was not unclean.<a name=13:10></a> It is not a question of defilement, but of the state of things existing when the Lord Jesus was here in flesh, a state of things which was necessary in order that God might manifest His works, but which was not to continue.<a name=13:11></a> Some christians believe that the Lord Jesus came down here in order to better things in this world.<a name=13:12></a> In the gospel of John some wanted to make Him King, and when He entered Jerusalem sitting on the ass's colt, He was acclaimed by the people, and then the Greeks came up too.<a name=13:13></a> Why then did the Lord not take power immediately and reform the world?<a name=13:14></a> Instead of doing so He said to Andrew and Philip, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified" <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:23">John  12:23</a>.<a name=13:15></a> The Jews saw Him as the One who had performed the miracle referred to in chapter 6; and the Greeks had come up desiring to see Him, so then, why not reform the world?<a name=13:16></a> The Lord answered at once, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:24">John  12:24</a>.<a name=13:17></a> His presence here in flesh made men still more blind, and a divine operation was necessary if man's eyes were to be opened on another world -- a world

		J.T.<a name=14:17></a> Well, suppose you were living in Jerusalem at that time, and had heard of the miracles, performed by the Lord, that the eyes of the blind had been opened; you would doubtless say, 'We are privileged to have such a man amongst us'; you would like to have a world governed by Christ in the flesh -- like the Jews you would wish to make Him King.<a name=14:18></a> In chapter 6 John relates how He fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fishes, and it might be thought that a world in which such things happened would be a marvellous place.<a name=14:19></a> But this chapter teaches us that such thoughts are vain, and do not at all answer to God's thoughts.<a name=14:20></a> A world in which Christ in flesh was king would not answer to the thoughts of God; even if every nation on earth had come into subjection to Him

		J.T.<a name=15:6></a> That is the thought exactly.<a name=15:7></a> Siloam means <i>sent</i>, so this man in going to Siloam, is moving in accord with the thoughts of God; as following this path he arrives in soul history at the death of Christ.<a name=15:8></a> Then the mud is removed and his eyes opened, signifying that this world no longer exists for him.<a name=15:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=20:1></a> We were noticing yesterday that in chapter 9 of this gospel, the man was not blind as a result of his own sin, nor of his parents' sin, but in order that the works of God should be manifested in him.<a name=20:2></a> The thought in this incident therefore does not refer to what has been brought into the world through sin, but rather the fact that the man provided an opportunity to manifest the works of God.<a name=20:3></a> The Lord spat on the ground, and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes; the man was then told to go to the pool of Siloam and wash.<a name=20:4></a> What was removed by washing was not unclean in itself, on the contrary it was what the Lord Himself had made with His spittle and earth.<a name=20:5></a> It is a type of the humanity of Christ and its effect on men.<a name=20:6></a> Apart from the death of Christ men would be in a worse condition than before, for His presence here rendered them more blind than ever, so that were it not for His death there would be only darkness.<a name=20:7></a> The washing in Siloam and the opening of the eyes of this man imply that he sees into another world.<a name=20:8></a> His eyes being opened, he can speak of what the Lord has done to him; at the time it happened he was unable to see what the Lord was doing, but now his eyes have been opened, he can speak about what has been effected and can say how he was cured.<a name=20:9></a> That is to say, he represents a believer who has been enlightened and who recognises that the Lord became a man in order to die; that the world itself, Christ having come into it, would come to an end, and that the condition of flesh and blood that the Lord had taken would not continue.<a name=20:10></a> John says in his epistle that Jesus "came by water and blood"; that is to say, that in becoming a man, He had His death in view.<a name=20:11></a> He did not come in order to continue the order of man who was on earth, but to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony that this man renders to the world results in his being cast out; it is then that the Lord finds him, and makes Himself known to him, so that he did Him homage as the Son of God; his eyes having been opened in order that he might see Christ in relation to another world.<a name=21:2></a> The Son of God is inaugurating another world which He calls, "that world, and the resurrection", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:35">Luke  20:35</a>.<a name=21:3></a> "They who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection from among the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage"; they are "sons of the resurrection".<a name=21:4></a> In this remarkable passage the Lord indicates the character of the world He is inaugurating.<a name=21:5></a> The man whose eyes had been opened is viewed in chapter 10 as included in the assembly which is alluded to as the flock.<a name=21:6></a> The world that the Son of God is inaugurating is taking shape now in the assembly.<a name=21:7></a> In chapter 10:14 He says, "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father".<a name=21:8></a> What a blessed thing that is; the knowledge we have in the assembly is as the Father knows the Son, and as the Son knows the Father.<a name=21:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=21:17></a> These are two thoughts connected with sonship.<a name=21:18></a> Firstly, He makes Himself known to us; He asks the man if he believes on the Son of God, saying to him, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he".<a name=21:19></a> The man has already seen Him without knowing Him, so now the Lord tells him openly that

		J.T.<a name=22:12></a> That is the normal desire of a believer.<a name=22:13></a> We ought to understand clearly that this One who has died for us and saved us is the One we are to know as Son of God.<a name=22:14></a> This is expressed in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>, where the Lord says, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he"; he had seen Him without knowing who He was, so the Lord made Himself known to him.<a name=22:15></a> It may be that the Lord is asking us this question, "Who do ye say that I am?<a name=22:16></a>" and is awaiting our reply.<a name=22:17></a> Peter could say, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God", and each one of us should be able to say it too, not just because others have said it, but because the Lord has made Himself known to us in this character.<a name=22:18></a> It is as we apprehend things spiritually that we are constituted assembly material; so the Lord immediately says to Peter, "Thou art Peter [a stone], and on this rock I will build my assembly".<a name=22:19></a> This disclosure of the Lord's fits in with what we were speaking of, the Son of God in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>, and the assembly in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>.<a name=22:20></a> The Son is the

		J.T.<a name=23:7></a> In a certain way that might be said, but what is more in mind here is rather the truth in relation to the Person of the Lord; He said, "He that speaks with thee"; a precious thought, if we think of the passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:30">Luke  9:30</a>.<a name=23:8></a> It says, "Two men talked with him", suggesting there the liberty we have in participating in sonship with Christ.<a name=23:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>, where the transfiguration is recorded, the Lord sends Peter to catch a fish saying, "When thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee".<a name=23:10></a> He thus links Peter with Himself.<a name=23:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=29:1></a> It is in mind to look into these passages, and others as well, where the Holy Spirit is presented in types of substantial character, as well as in doctrinal.<a name=29:2></a> In this gospel the Lord is viewed particularly as a Teacher, and it is evident that His teaching is of the greatest importance.<a name=29:3></a> We need doctrine; "sound teaching", which is involved in the faith of which Jude speaks, "the faith once delivered to the saints", <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#3">Jude  3</a>.<a name=29:4></a> We are exhorted to cut "in a straight line the word of truth" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:15">2 Timothy  2:15</a>), and it is evident that the Scriptures are the basis of all doctrine.<a name=29:5></a> At the same time, in John's gospel, there is that presented to us in Christ which is substantial or tangible.<a name=29:6></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a> it states that "in him (the Word) was life", and in John's epistle we read, "That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we have contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life; (and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us)", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:1">1 John  1:1</a>,2.<a name=29:7></a> This alludes to what could be seen substantially in Christ.<a name=29:8></a> In chapter 2 of John's epistle he says, "Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you"; thus this thought of what is tangible is carried forward to the saints, "which thing is true in him and in you", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:8">1 John  2:8</a>.<a name=29:9></a> So, in agreement with what we are saying, the truth relating to the Spirit is set out in a tangible way all through the gospel of John; firstly as a dove; then in chapter 3 as the wind; and as water in chapters 4 and 7; then as the Comforter in chapter 14, and as breath in chapter 20.<a name=29:10></a> All these are tangible thoughts, not theoretical.<a name=29:11></a>

		The Holy Spirit is often alluded to by us as though He is something we do not know how to speak of; yet we should be able to speak about the Spirit if we have received Him.<a name=30:1></a> Paul asked the twelve men at Ephesus in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:2">Acts  19:2</a>: "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=30:2></a>" indicating that they should have been able to answer at once if they had received Him.<a name=30:3></a> In connection with these remarks attention is drawn to the fact that John the baptist <i>beheld</i> the Spirit descending as a dove, and abiding on Jesus.<a name=30:4></a> It is evident that the dove is a type, but there is in it the idea of something tangible being presented, John having been able to see the dove.<a name=30:5></a> It is not said in the other gospels, that anyone else saw the dove except the Lord Himself, so that the fact that John the baptist says here that he saw it confirms what we are saying.<a name=30:6></a> John in his gospel is occupied with what is substantial in christianity, and in chapter 20:31 he says, that these things "are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life" -- something evident -- "in his name".<a name=30:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=36:1></a> In choosing this subject, I desired that we might be occupied with the substantial character of christianity, the Spirit being presented in forms which suggest what is substantial.<a name=36:2></a> In chapter 1 John the baptist saw Him as a dove; he says, "I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him".<a name=36:3></a> In chapter 3, the Spirit is spoken of as wind which "blows where it will"; then in chapters 4 and 7 He is presented under the figure of water; in chapter 14, He is brought before us in a personal way as the Comforter; then in chapter 20, He is referred to in figure as breath.<a name=36:4></a> All these references remind us of something that is substantial, that can be felt and experienced by the believer.<a name=36:5></a> It is in mind to look at them not as features of doctrine; although clearly doctrine is very important and essential.<a name=36:6></a> Hence we see the Lord, especially in John's gospel, as the Teacher, but the substance itself existed before the doctrine had been formulated in writing, as in the gospels and epistles.<a name=36:7></a> This applies similarly to the Old Testament, for the Pentateuch was not written until long after the events related in Genesis, those things happening so long before are therefore of all importance.<a name=36:8></a> In this connection, another great feature of the ministry of John is brought out in chapter 1:4, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men", that is to say, light emanates from substance, namely life.<a name=36:9></a> Hence it says in the epistle of John, "That which was from the beginning" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:1">1 John  1:1</a>); that alludes to Christ personally, but it is the substance that was there.<a name=36:10></a> In the reading yesterday, we spoke of the Spirit descending in a bodily form as a dove, and

		When the Lord Jesus became Man, it says, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>), which indicates that angels were not the immediate objects of the light, but that men were in view in the light which was shining.<a name=95:5></a> These three passages show that it is not only a matter of men on earth -- they will be blessed, and the knowledge of God will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.<a name=95:6></a> Indeed, all shall know God from the little one among them unto the great one among them, not in any superficial or temporary way, but this knowledge will be abidingly impressed upon men, truly written in their minds and in their hearts.<a name=95:7></a> But these three passages have in mind the heavenly order of man; as it is said, "As we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:49">1 Corinthians  15:49</a>.<a name=95:8></a> Heaven will therefore be inhabited by men, and they will enter there in the order presented in these passages.<a name=95:9></a> First we shall be raised or quickened.<a name=95:10></a> In writing to the Corinthians the apostle says, "Behold,

		The two men in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>were witnesses of this great occurrence; no doubt they were angels, but they are not referred to as such, for God presents them as men.<a name=96:6></a> He did not bring forward Moses or Elias at the sepulchre, but they were reserved for a higher thought -- that of representing the heavenly saints; they are representative of glorified men having bodies like Christ's body of glory.<a name=96:7></a> These two men at the sepulchre are witnesses to the fact that there must be <i>men</i> there, and that they must be 'raised men'.<a name=96:8></a> We must take account of their clothing described as "shining raiment", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:4">Luke  24:4</a>.<a name=96:9></a> When we are raised we shall shine like this, these bodies of humiliation will be transformed into conformity to His body of glory.<a name=96:10></a> This does not mean that the shining should not exist now; it should exist; the divine thought is that in our testimony down here we should reflect the radiance of heaven.<a name=96:11></a> Alas!<a name=96:12></a> that it should not always be so; it should be a matter of exercise to us to "appear as lights in the world", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:15">Philippians  2:15</a>.<a name=96:13></a> It may not always be true of us now, but it will be true of us for ever when we have received our bodies as raised from among the dead.<a name=96:14></a> As raised, we shall be conformed to Christ risen and glorified.<a name=96:15></a> The bodies which we shall receive will take character from Christ, not only as risen, but glorified.<a name=96:16></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a> we are told that "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet

		In the first passage read, a young man is referred to who had been associated with the world in opposition to God and His people.<a name=108:6></a> He says he is an Egyptian young man, servant of an Amalekite, at war with the people of God.<a name=108:7></a> Perhaps amongst my hearers are some young people like that; under the influence of others, serving the flesh; attacking the Cherethites who were serving God.<a name=108:8></a> The Amalekites also attacked what belonged to Judah; and Judah speaks of what God gives sovereignly to His people.<a name=108:9></a> Doubtless this young man did not personally hate either the Cherethites or Judah, but he represents one who is under the influence of the world and the flesh; he is under the power of the enemy and so speaks evil of God's people and of His sovereign choice.<a name=108:10></a> It then states that they attacked the south of Caleb.<a name=108:11></a> Now Caleb represents the saints as heavenly; as a young man he was not satisfied with the wilderness, nor did his thoughts return to Egypt, but he was determined to enter upon his heavenly part, and now the Amalekite army, of which this young Egyptian formed part, had attacked his territory.<a name=108:12></a> Why attack God's people who are taking possession of their heavenly

		Now David's men found this young Egyptian in the field and brought him to David.<a name=109:9></a> It is not said that David found him, it is the privilege of the saints to find such young men or women and bring them to Christ.<a name=109:10></a> They brought him to David; that seems to suggest that they were going to pray for him, commending him to the Lord.<a name=109:11></a> But it is noticeable that David did nothing to help this man in any direct way, showing what the saints can do in such circumstances.<a name=109:12></a> We are told, that they "gave him bread and he ate, and they gave him water to drink"; the saints provide such with whatever they need for strength.<a name=109:13></a> Jesus said as to Himself, "The bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world", <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:33">John  6:33</a>.<a name=109:14></a> It is a matter for us to see if we have such bread which could be eaten by a young man like that; it was <i>bread</i>, and he ate.<a name=109:15></a> What a victory when a young person gains some thought of Christ.<a name=109:16></a> Then it says "they gave him water to drink"; that is to say, something satisfying, for the world could satisfy him no longer.<a name=109:17></a> How good to have "water to drink" when one is thirsty.<a name=109:18></a>

		The second passage read is well known, often being used, very justly, to illustrate the gospel preaching.<a name=110:12></a> It should be noticed here that the child was given to his mother without her asking for him.<a name=110:13></a> If you will allow it, I will speak of this woman as a figure of a local assembly.<a name=110:14></a> She was a wealthy woman; a local gathering like Valence can be spiritually wealthy.<a name=110:15></a> She was rich, but she thought of the man of God; that is, of Christ, in type; she spoke of him to her husband, and they built a room for him.<a name=110:16></a> This room was occupied only by Elisha; the prophet did not simply live in the house with this woman and her husband.<a name=110:17></a> This signifies how Christ may have a place in a believer's house, but not the entire place.<a name=110:18></a> The feminine side dominates, it is a question more of the woman than her husband.<a name=110:19></a> Things should be in order in the assembly, so we should see

		that Christ has His due place.<a name=111:1></a> That is what the husband represents here; he had little influence in his house, and if the husband has little influence, it implies that the woman has too much; local gatherings should watch that.<a name=111:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The child is promised, and given; that is to say, there is an addition to the assembly; then the child dies.<a name=111:3></a> One day, he went out to his father who was harvesting in the fields.<a name=111:4></a> It appears that the father had authority there, although he had little in the house, and the child said, "My head, my head!<a name=111:5></a>" His intellect had developed abnormally, in an unbalanced way; the trouble was in his head, and his father could do nothing for him.<a name=111:6></a> That does not mean that the Lord can do nothing, but the father was powerless; the state of things existing in the house did not allow the father to have the place due to him, so he sent the child to his mother -- what a poor state of things!<a name=111:7></a> -- but neither was she able to do anything.<a name=111:8></a> If that continues the meeting will die out; the child died at noon; he died at the very time he should have been most energetic.<a name=111:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, there is need to take account of a very salutary element in a local gathering; that is, a real knowledge of the man of God.<a name=111:10></a> The husband says, "Why wilt thou go to him today?<a name=111:11></a> it is neither new moon nor sabbath".<a name=111:12></a> Why should he speak of the sabbath when his son was dead?<a name=111:13></a> Should we wait until there is a special meeting like this in order to bring a child back to life?<a name=111:14></a> Should we not take up the matter immediately?<a name=111:15></a> This woman decides she will not allow herself to be dissuaded by her husband and has an ass saddled to enable her to reach the man of God.<a name=111:16></a> In such circumstances we must not be wrongly advised.<a name=111:17></a> The husband's suggestions are inspired by what is found in general around us; religious duties are only performed on certain feast days, new moon or sabbath; but faith says, 'It must be today, and only the man of God can meet the situation'.<a name=111:18></a> She knows where he is and goes to find him immediately.<a name=111:19></a> He is on mount Carmel, the place

		Elisha is a type of Christ, although as a man he was marked by weakness, which we must not forget for one moment.<a name=112:13></a> He sent Gehazi with his staff, which represents his experience, but one may be as old as Methuselah and yet be quite incapable of awaking a child in this state.<a name=112:14></a> Experience is not enough, it is a matter of life, and of the power of God.<a name=112:15></a> Elisha therefore came himself and went up to the room; the staff had had no effect whatever, the child still had not revived.<a name=112:16></a> It is useless for elderly brothers or sisters to come and say ineffectual things, for it is a question of life; the kingdom of God is in power, and the excellence of the power must be of God.<a name=112:17></a> The death of Christ is necessary, and the power by which He was raised from among the dead.<a name=112:18></a> Elisha therefore "went in and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to Jehovah".<a name=112:19></a> There you are, dear brethren, that is what he did first; he closed the door, remaining alone with the child.<a name=112:20></a> The dead child is identified with Christ, for if he is to be raised, it is by the power of Christ, and then his progress will be normal.<a name=112:21></a> So Elisha "went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands".<a name=112:22></a> This young

		It then says that the prophet "returned, and walked in the house to and fro" as if to show that all this was the result of the state existing in the house.<a name=113:3></a> Death had been caused by what was happening inside the house; it is not a matter only of the young person, but of the influence found amongst the saints.<a name=113:4></a> Perhaps there were bad books in the house, for the prophet "walked in the house".<a name=113:5></a> The Lord Jesus is seen as walking in the midst of seven golden lamps; He visits every locality, and nothing escapes Him, and if something of this kind exists He will show us its cause.<a name=113:6></a> The prophet himself "walked in the house to and fro; and went up and bent over him"; first he lay on the child, then he bent over him, and finally "the lad sneezed seven times, and the lad opened his eyes".<a name=113:7></a> If there is some young person here in this state, Christ, represented here by Elisha, is very near to you, to serve you in love.<a name=113:8></a> What affection the prophet shows in bending over the child; this should be seen amongst the brethren, an older brother or sister going to a young man or woman and bending over them in love.<a name=113:9></a>

		In the last passage read, Jacob is an old man, representative here of a believer who has become marked by weakness; in verse 26, "his heart fainted, for he did not believe them".<a name=114:3></a> This passage, as I understand it, refers to young brothers growing in the truth, but whose conduct has not been such as has inspired confidence in them by others; time is needed to overcome such lack of confidence.<a name=114:4></a> Jacob's sons had deceived him, and their behaviour to Joseph was cruel toward their father.<a name=114:5></a> If such conditions exist between young and old brethren, time is needed for it to be set right.<a name=114:6></a> These young men had a marvellous message for their father, and we can say too to our aged brethren that the Lord is giving us marvellous ministry; but if the older ones have no confidence in us, they will not believe us.<a name=114:7></a> Jacob's "heart fainted, for he did not believe them".<a name=114:8></a> It is a great matter to inspire confidence in our ministry, dear brethren; so we read that "they spoke to him all the words of Joseph, which he had spoken to them".<a name=114:9></a> They did not speak of their own thoughts, but they carried the message from Joseph.<a name=114:10></a> Is there a believer whose heart would not be touched by the word of Christ?<a name=114:11></a> They spoke to him <i>all the words</i> of Joseph.<a name=114:12></a> Is your heart hardened?<a name=114:13></a> the Lord's message is for you, it is for the elder brothers and sisters here; you must wake up from your spiritual lethargy, in order to be marked by life and to take part with your brethren in the meeting wholeheartedly.<a name=114:14></a>

		In the epistle to the Corinthians, God addresses a company of christians in that city as "the assembly of God".<a name=124:4></a> It was composed of men and women, and doubtless young people too, who had been converted through Paul's ministry; they formed therefore what is termed, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=124:5></a> Before they were converted, the Lord had said to Paul, "Fear not .<a name=124:6></a>.<a name=124:7></a>.<a name=124:8></a> because I have much people in this city" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:9">Acts  18:9</a>,10); at an opportune moment, these people were called by the gospel, so that they are qualified to be "called saints".<a name=124:9></a> God's call reached them in the gospel, and they left the world, and as having the Spirit were constituted an assembly: "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=124:10></a> Although only a few members of the assembly may be available to God, there is here in Marseilles the assembly of God.<a name=124:11></a>

		Whilst it says in Ezra that they prophesied to the Jews, it says here that the word of Jehovah came to "Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest".<a name=143:2></a> What is emphasised is that Haggai's message was for those who were particularly responsible.<a name=143:3></a> In Ezra, where the message was to the Jews, all the people were included, but in Haggai, as we remarked, it was for those particularly responsible, Zerubbabel who was the governor, and Joshua who was the high priest.<a name=143:4></a> The counterpart to Zerubbabel today would be the leading brothers who take the responsibility of things amongst us; while those corresponding to the high priest are those who sympathise with the saints, sisters being included as well as brothers.<a name=143:5></a> The high priest evidently had as much authority as Zerubbabel, priestly power being a matter of spiritual intelligence and sympathy.<a name=143:6></a> Holiness, too, should characterise priests.<a name=143:7></a> Aaron, the great high priest, being called "the saint (holy one) of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#106:16">Psalm  106:16</a>), indicating that he was a holy person.<a name=143:8></a> The priesthood represented by Joshua involves the most spiritual amongst us, indeed all of us.<a name=143:9></a> You can thus see, dear brethren, that Haggai's message is addressed to the oldest brothers, as being the most responsible, and to all, whether young or old, who are spiritual and intelligent.<a name=143:10></a> The saints in their entirety are also included, as we see by what follows (verse 12), "Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God", and "Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people".<a name=143:11></a> Hence the message, while addressed to the most responsible, is for all.<a name=143:12></a>

		Those who were responsible, and all the others too, had become rather negligent and selfish: they were thinking of their own houses rather than of the house of God.<a name=144:1></a> What a state of things!<a name=144:2></a> yet, alas, dear brethren, how often it is found amongst the saints.<a name=144:3></a> We are all inclined to be selfish, that is to say, we think of ourselves, our homes, our families, our farms, and the house of God has a secondary place with us.<a name=144:4></a> Where such a state of things exists, this book specially applies; in verse 4 the prophet asks, "Is it time for you that ye should dwell in your wainscoted houses, while this house lieth waste?<a name=144:5></a>" This is a very direct question, followed by the injunction in verse 5, "And now thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways".<a name=144:6></a> The word 'consider' is important, according to the note it means literally, 'Set your heart on your ways'.<a name=144:7></a> We are invited to examine our ways for a moment, to give them our undivided attention, not that we should become occupied with them, but it is a matter of searching and analysing them to see if they are such as are suitable to those whom God loves, and who love Him.<a name=144:8></a>

		As though He would help us in considering our ways, and bring us to see how defective they are, God says in verse 6, "Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but are not satisfied; ye drink, but are not filled with drink; ye clothe yourselves, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages for a bag with holes".<a name=144:9></a> Dear brethren, God would help us to arrive at a true judgment about our ways, and would say to us, as it were, 'Things are not going as you would like'.<a name=144:10></a> There are young people who set out with certain plans before them; you only think of your own interests; no doubt you have it in mind to be in fellowship, as we speak, but the fellowship and the things of God have only second place with you, and now you find that things are not all as you had thought.<a name=144:11></a> Why is that?<a name=144:12></a> Simply because God loves you.<a name=144:13></a> Around you, you perhaps see unconverted young people who appear to

		These passages give instruction as to conditions bearing upon the assembly; it is a very wide subject as the Scriptures contain much instruction concerning the assembly.<a name=158:1></a> Hence I do not propose to attempt to cover all the ground, but to limit myself to three features: firstly, obedience, which necessarily excludes independence; secondly, ability to take up matters relating to the assembly; and thirdly, life.<a name=158:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of the assembly, I should like to remark that every believer should recognise that if the Lord has given him light, He has done so in order that he may take his place in the assembly.<a name=158:3></a> The gospel testimony was never to be confined to the relief that it gives to men; it announces deliverance from the coming wrath and from Satan's power; it also proclaims that which liberates the consciences of men, delivering them from the fear of judgment to come, from the world and from the flesh.<a name=158:4></a> Each has need of this deliverance, and most of us know that the gospel offers men deliverance from all these things on the principle of faith.<a name=158:5></a> But it also has in view that the persons who are thus delivered should take their place relative to Christ as Head, and to the assembly which is His body: that excludes individualism, and also collective independency.<a name=158:6></a> Moreover, what flows from that is that where two or three believers reside in a locality, there should be something of a collective nature for Christ.<a name=158:7></a> I say 'two or three' to reduce it to the smallest possible number; two or three of the assembly obeying divine principles can enjoy assembly privileges, and as enjoying these privileges and blessings which are linked with the assembly, they are qualified to render public testimony.<a name=158:8></a> Whilst most of us know this, it is of immense importance in a town like this which has had a history in connection

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To reach this end, dear brothers and sisters, the great principle of the recognition of divine authority must be observed, none other can be accredited in the assembly.<a name=159:4></a> In this country there are the authorities who govern, as throughout the world, and we pray for them.<a name=159:5></a> These authorities are concerned in the public government of God in the world, and all true believers pray for such, but they do not govern the assembly, which is under the direct authority of Christ.<a name=159:6></a> This authority was set out in the beginning by the apostles, so I read <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>, so that we might see how the early believers immediately recognised His authority.<a name=159:7></a> Some three thousand souls were converted through a single gospel preaching (a result which has possibly never been equalled since), but this preaching was in the freshness and power of the Holy Spirit who had just been sent down from heaven.<a name=159:8></a> In one of his letters, Peter tells us that there were those who announced the gospel in the power of the Spirit sent down from heaven; the gospel itself thus bore all the authority of heaven, brought here by a divine Person, the Spirit of God.<a name=159:9></a> Peter standing up on that memorable day, said to the people of Jerusalem, "Give heed to my words", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:14">Acts  2:14</a>.<a name=159:10></a> Here was a man who outwardly was looked on as a fisherman of Galilee, lacking the religious refinement and instruction which existed in Jerusalem, but the words uttered in the burning power of the Spirit of God sent down from heaven, produced such

		results that many were convicted amongst his hearers, and those who believed said not only to Peter, but to the other apostles, "What shall we do, brethren?<a name=160:1></a>" It is to be noticed that those who were convicted, recognised them as representing the authority of heaven; they not only took account of Peter's authority, but also of that of the other apostles.<a name=160:2></a> In other words, whatever the authority may be, if it is of God it must be acknowledged.<a name=160:3></a> What is said of these three thousand persons is that they <i>persevered</i> in the teaching of the apostles; it is noticeable that it is a question of the teaching of the <i>apostles</i>, because they are representative of what I am speaking of -- Christ's authority.<a name=160:4></a> Note also the word 'persevered'; how important it is for us to be marked by perseverance today.<a name=160:5></a> The strong current of evil is absolutely contrary to us and the tendency is to give up and to let go; but these three thousand who were converted, persevered.<a name=160:6></a> In what did they persevere?<a name=160:7></a> In the teaching of the apostles.<a name=160:8></a> We may rest assured that in doing so, they did not overlook what Moses and the prophets had taught them; the Old Testament Scriptures retained their authority over them.<a name=160:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some weeks before, the Lord Jesus, when raised from the dead, had interpreted in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself, so that there was no question of putting aside the Old Testament.<a name=160:10></a> When it says that they "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles", it means that the Lord had raised up those men as His representatives, so that what was done was as if the Lord had done it.<a name=160:11></a> The enemy will always oppose what the Lord is doing, so his efforts were directed to get rid of these men, but those in whom God was working paid attention to their words, persevering in their teaching, and not in their teaching only (for I may easily hold the teaching yet remain as an individual) but in the fellowship which had been inaugurated.<a name=160:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter we notice that not only did they continue in the fellowship, but in the breaking of bread, and they did not make it a monthly or quarterly matter, as happens in certain denominations.<a name=161:3></a> The context shows how great importance was attached to the breaking of bread, which was done in their houses.<a name=161:4></a> I suppose that at that time in Jerusalem there may well have been a hundred small companies breaking bread -- what a sight!<a name=161:5></a> what delight for heaven to see those dear disciples in their affection for Christ, persevering in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and prayers.<a name=161:6></a> You can be sure that they prayed together more than once a week, and the seal of divine authority was upon all they did.<a name=161:7></a>

		In the second passage, it should be noted that Peter is brought before us again; from chapter 6 up to this point he is scarcely referred to, but now we are told that Peter passed through all quarters.<a name=161:8></a> He was not an idle servant; it is not the time for idleness, the need is so great in the Lord's service.<a name=161:9></a> It then records that he "descended also to the saints who inhabited Lydda".<a name=161:10></a> He descended to them and the Spirit of God relates that there was a man in the town "who had been lying for eight years upon a couch".<a name=161:11></a> That is what the Spirit mentions first; it is not recorded simply to occupy us with this one fact, but with the spiritual thought it conveys.<a name=161:12></a> It is quite possible for us to pray while lying in bed; the psalmist records how he arose in the night to give thanks to God.<a name=161:13></a> During the night watches we can turn to God in prayer, while lying on our beds,

		The final thing in the second part of this chapter, begins at verse 36.<a name=163:3></a> It is not a question of a man, but of a woman.<a name=163:4></a> In its public setting the assembly needs men and women.<a name=163:5></a> Obviously women are not called upon to teach or to preach, but they can live in a spiritual way; that is what we have to learn in the case of Tabitha.<a name=163:6></a> She was a remarkable woman, but she died; as I have said already, we do not have to be occupied with the material side of this case, but with its spiritual significance.<a name=163:7></a> That such a woman should die is quite natural, hence the Spirit of God does not relate the incident to give us material facts, but with spiritual instruction in mind.<a name=163:8></a> This woman was very kind, she made clothes for needy people; it says of her that "she was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did".<a name=163:9></a> Such a sister in this city or in any other would be considered a good sister, but she fell ill and died, that is to say, that these outward kindnesses did not of themselves promote spiritual life.<a name=163:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This incident shows, dear brethren, that sisters should be more than outwardly kind.<a name=163:11></a> There are societies in the world bearing the name of this woman, but their meetings are not always marked by spiritual life, things being spoken of there that are far from being spiritual.<a name=163:12></a> This incident shows that something else is needed for spiritual life than works only; hence the Spirit of God says, she "grew sick and died", signifying spiritually that she became gradually weaker, which finally resulted in coldness, and death.<a name=163:13></a> We can see how this happens to many people around us.<a name=163:14></a> Why does it happen?<a name=163:15></a> The cause should be ascertained, for when persons become cold, and die morally in this way, there is some underlying reason, some secret matter, so Peter

		When the Lord Himself went to raise Jairus' daughter, there were women there and flute-players (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#9:23">Matthew  9:23</a>), to help, I suppose, in the mourning, all of which is quite valueless, so the Lord then put them all out.<a name=164:11></a> Are we prepared, dear brethren, to be thus treated by the representative of Christ's authority?<a name=164:12></a> You may be like these women who are weeping, but Peter put them all out, as much as to say, they were a hindrance.<a name=164:13></a> In the things of God natural sentimentality is only an obstacle; what he did may seem hard, nevertheless it was the apostle Peter who did it.<a name=164:14></a> It might have seemed hard when the Lord turned out those who were weeping in Jairus' house, but it was the Lord who did that, and who can question what He does?<a name=164:15></a> In this instance, two men had been sent, and if we call for Peter, he will put out such women when he arrives.<a name=164:16></a> This is a most exercising matter, dear brethren, to know if we are perfectly content with a kind of religious sentimentality, without having the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=164:17></a>

		Let us now see what happens.<a name=165:1></a> In speaking of what Peter did to the woman, we must not forget that when Dorcas died, she had been washed and put in the upper room.<a name=165:2></a> I think the washing implies what is spiritual, something which was necessary in spite of her good works and alms-deeds; there is a spiritual suggestion too, in the fact that they put her in the upper room.<a name=165:3></a> Then Peter "putting them all out, and kneeling down, prayed": the fact that he knelt down is important, as indicating deep exercise.<a name=165:4></a> The Lord knelt down in Gethsemane, and Paul said, "I bow my knees to the Father", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a>.<a name=165:5></a> If we become aware of such spiritual weakness amongst us, the way to overcome it is here indicated.<a name=165:6></a> He prayed, and turned to the body, as if the Lord would say to each of us, 'I am thinking of your body as of each of my members, and it is to be a living vessel'.<a name=165:7></a> It is important that our bodies should be for the Lord; we are told in Corinthians that our bodies are the members of Christ; you can understand the meaning of that.<a name=165:8></a> Peter then, turning to the body, said, "Tabitha".<a name=165:9></a> The Lord was calling her by name, as if to say, 'I want you, no longer for making clothes for the needy, but as a vessel to serve Me, and to express Me in your body'.<a name=165:10></a> "Tabitha, arise.<a name=165:11></a> And she opened her eyes".<a name=165:12></a> The Lord would like to open our eyes in order that we might see what it is to be a member of Christ in this town, to express Christ.<a name=165:13></a>

		Joseph was the last but one of Jacob's sons, which is very significant as connected with the subject we now have before us; His mother had desired a son for a long time, so, when he was born, she called his name Joseph, saying that God would add another son.<a name=167:3></a> Joseph is a type of Christ, and when he was born his father determined to leave Padan-Aram where, far from his own father and his kindred, he had been for twenty years, like so many christians today who are far from the place of their privilege.<a name=167:4></a> But God, in His own time, causes the light of Christ to shine into their soul and causes them to begin to think about leaving the world and its associations.<a name=167:5></a> Then, when the one is born who typifies Christ, Jacob leaves Padan-Aram and returns to the land of Canaan, and Joseph's mother says, "Jehovah will add to me another son".<a name=167:6></a> It was not a matter of adding glory in the land of Padan-Aram, but "another son" with no link at all with that place, so, in actual fact, Benjamin was born in Canaan.<a name=167:7></a> Rachel's remark involves the thought of a perfect number, Benjamin being the twelfth.<a name=167:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=247:7></a> The exhortation there is as to how the company at Philippi, or any local assembly, works out its own salvation.<a name=247:8></a> The instruction is intended to enable us to do this, so that it says, "So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed" -- he had been speaking of the obedience of Jesus -- "not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure".<a name=247:9></a> The apostle was not there, although he hoped to come, but they had always obeyed; and now further thoughts had come in as to obedience, and they are enjoined to work out their own salvation in fear and trembling.<a name=247:10></a> But then, God was there; God was working in them.<a name=247:11></a> It is involved in "ye have always obeyed".<a name=247:12></a> In Christ, He has brought in the great thoughts of obedience and humility, and these are to enter into our experience and history in the testimony; for as ministry comes to us, the intent is that it should be worked out, and that it should greatly augment our future walk and testimony.<a name=247:13></a> The section beginning with verse 12 has this in mind.<a name=247:14></a> It is a question now of the brethren moving together after all this, and what he has in mind is the increase of the testimony.<a name=247:15></a> He says, "it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure".<a name=247:16></a> That is, both in the willing and the working, God is there.<a name=247:17></a> What the apostle has been saying is to enlarge the saints and to accelerate their pace in the testimony, and he further exhorts them: "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings, that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among

		J.T.<a name=276:6></a> Involving, as was remarked, what the Lord had in mind in His sanctification.<a name=276:7></a> It is the present position He has taken up, pending the working out of other things which the Lord touches in the first part of <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>.<a name=276:8></a> He does not sanctify Himself in view of millennial things, but in view of our position involving "the truth", as He calls it.<a name=276:9></a> The truth involves that position, and is unfolded by the Spirit as come from that position, so that the saints should understand the magnitude of christianity, what the assembly's place is as compared with other circles of blessing, with other families, a thought we do not dwell much upon.<a name=276:10></a> From necessity the ministry coming to us is very largely general.<a name=276:11></a> This is the top stone of Paul's ministry, what he aimed at for himself and what he was unfolding to the saints.<a name=276:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=277:15></a> When he left the prison, he went to Lydia, and if she had made any remarks about the heavenly calling it would have brought the discrepancy home to him.<a name=277:16></a> She would not fail to notice any remarks that he might make about it, and it would be difficult for him to make things square with what he had said to the magistrates.<a name=277:17></a> But one does not like to say anything about the apostle, only as to its bearing on ourselves and our occupation with any political feeling.<a name=277:18></a> When Paul and Silas were brought before the magistrates, the men of the city had said they were Romans, and now he says he is a Roman.<a name=277:19></a> Well, he is in their company, and one can understand how he would feel that.<a name=277:20></a> What he said was literally true, of course, that he was a Roman, but his claiming it certainly does not tally with "<i>our</i> commonwealth has its existence in the heavens".<a name=277:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=328:1></a> I was thinking of divine ownership, and we may look at it before proceeding in the chapter.<a name=328:2></a> We rightly speak of the Lord's creatorial rights of ownership of the saints, and His redemptive rights, but perhaps have not thought much of ownership from the standpoint of counsel and election; these, I believe, form the highest plane on which the thought stands, and it fits in peculiarly with John.<a name=328:3></a> He has in mind the most exalted relations of the saints, and the Lord touches these in this chapter and speaks of ownership -- the Father's ownership of the disciples so as to give them to Him.<a name=328:4></a> If we took account of ourselves as owned in this way, it would elevate our thoughts to what the Lord is aiming at, to lead the brethren on to the divine level, not only as to divine Persons Themselves, but as to ourselves, and John's gospel particularly has this in mind.<a name=328:5></a> I do not think many get beyond being purchased through the death of Christ, but ownership extends back to counsel and election.<a name=328:6></a> The Lord says, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world.<a name=328:7></a> They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word.<a name=328:8></a> Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee; for the words which thou hast given me I have given them, and they have received them, and have known truly that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou sentest me.<a name=328:9></a> I demand concerning them; I do not demand concerning the world, but concerning those whom thou hast given me, for they are thine, (and all that is mine is thine, and all that is thine mine,) and I am glorified in them".<a name=328:10></a> If we trace divine ownership of the saints back to the eternal counsels of God, I think the effect would be to elevate us.<a name=328:11></a> Not in any way detracting from God's

		I have in mind to speak about priesthood, and I felt it appropriate to read from Revelation -- a book that is addressed to the seven assemblies, and so to ourselves -- for, whilst those seven assemblies in the province of Asia are used to symbolise the whole assembly at <i>that</i> time, they also symbolise the whole assembly of <i>all</i> time, that is, the assembly down here.<a name=347:1></a> The book contemplates the assembly, too, in heavenly places, coming down from God out of heaven, but it is its militant or testimonial circumstances that are in view, and John writes as a prophet, but as one known otherwise in the more exalted office of apostle, and in the more exalted place still of the bosom of Jesus.<a name=347:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These form the background of the book and lend peculiar glory to the writer, seen especially as he opens the book with buoyancy -- I may say, with jubilance.<a name=347:3></a> Notwithstanding the dark things around and in the distance, he is stimulated, and shows that the pending events in no way hindered him from enjoying his own portion.<a name=347:4></a> That is, he was "in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=347:5></a> I suppose that is how he spent his Lord's days as in prison.<a name=347:6></a> Were he free he would join with the brethren as he had opportunity, and share the privileges of the assembly with them.<a name=347:7></a> One often pictures these great servants in their movements, how they could take their places with their brethren and each be a brother among the brethren.<a name=347:8></a>

		These things enter into this first chapter.<a name=347:9></a> John speaks of what Jesus has done for us and has made us, in relation to what was pending.<a name=347:10></a> He worships, showing, as often appears, how prominent the thought of worship was with the great servants at the beginning; it was always present, you might say; whenever an occasion offered, it was there, to spring up as in the power of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 we have a like statement.<a name=348:7></a> According to the best authorities, the word in chapter 1 is "a kingdom", and not "kings", but those alluded to in chapter 5 are said to be "kings and priests".<a name=348:8></a> But here, it is "a kingdom, priests to his God and Father", but not to ours.<a name=348:9></a> That is, John does not rise to the level of the well-known twentieth chapter of his gospel.<a name=348:10></a> It is <i>His</i> God and Father, and that He has provided Him with a kingdom of such persons; He has made such persons as ourselves, with all the saints of the dispensation, a kingdom.<a name=348:11></a> It would be the saints at any given time on the earth.<a name=348:12></a> Moreover, He has made us "priests to his God and Father" -- He has provided Him with priests.<a name=348:13></a> So you can see, dear brethren, that what is in mind is available to God in view of the contingencies that had arisen and would arise, especially the terrible things anticipated in the book.<a name=348:14></a> What a great thing it is for God to have a kingdom of such persons!<a name=348:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a kingdom involves power, and power where it is needed.<a name=348:16></a> It is wonderfully ramified and furnished, for it could not subsist save with certain furnishings, and these furnishings lie in the Spirit; they lie in the authority of Christ as Lord, but in the Spirit.<a name=348:17></a> No ordinary kingdom can exist, save in name, without power, such as an army, navy, police, courts, prisons, and so forth.<a name=348:18></a> The body politic is supported by all these ramifications.<a name=348:19></a> Well, that is what the Lord Jesus has made us -- a very great matter in view of what is transpiring, that there is a kingdom here that is no mere matter of name or profession, but in power: "not in word, but in power", says the apostle (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:20">1 Corinthians  4:20</a>), and the more we are together in affection and

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a second thought, and that is the priesthood, and it is "<i>unto</i> God", as you will observe in this passage, as also in chapter 5:10; but in chapter 20 it is "<i>of</i> God".<a name=349:4></a> The saints are contemplated in chapter 20 in three classes, and it says that "they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years" (verse 4); that is the general statement.<a name=349:5></a> And then the Spirit of God refers back to this great thought, saying, "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years" (verse 6).<a name=349:6></a> They are priests, not "unto", but "of God and of Christ".<a name=349:7></a> It is well to anticipate these things and rest in the immensity of the thought of those who have part in the first resurrection and what are their privileges, but it does not go beyond the thousand years; the mind of God is set for the moment on that period.<a name=349:8></a> He has great thoughts in regard of that period, and He needs a priesthood in it.<a name=349:9></a> I do not apprehend there is any need for priesthood in the eternal state of things: where there will be no unholiness, no evil to be dealt with, no enemy of God.<a name=349:10></a> Priesthood is in view of contingencies arising from the flesh in us or outside of us, the state of things in the world; it is in view of these things that a priesthood is necessary.<a name=349:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thousand years are a period in which God is completing His testimony, showing what He can do in this world; it is not a perfect state of things, and hence

		there is priesthood, and thus the saints are said to be priests "of God".<a name=350:1></a> They are His priesthood; the millennial reign will be marked by this class of persons known as "priests of God and of the Christ".<a name=350:2></a> The second statement is not that they live with Him, but simply that they reign with Christ a thousand years.<a name=350:3></a> The passage says first, "they lived and reigned", but secondly, that they "reign" with Christ; He has them; they are not only "priests of God", but priests "of the Christ".<a name=350:4></a> Christ is the One into whose hands God has put everything, and He has His priesthood, and God has His priesthood, too.<a name=350:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these great facts exist, dear brethren, and my object in this word is to bring the thought down to the present time, for the first passage contemplates the present time, that Jesus has "washed us from our sins" -- precious thought -- but He has made us these two things.<a name=350:6></a> The point here is not that we are sons -- we are, as we learn elsewhere -- but He has made us "a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=350:7></a> Surely the tribute of praise is suitable: "to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever"; we all would say Amen to that, but the point is as to this priesthood and the need for it.<a name=350:8></a> It will be needed, as I have said, in the millennium, but it is needed now pre-eminently.<a name=350:9></a> In these last days, when conditions are so complicated and darkened by man's innovations in christianity, how essential it is to fall back on this great fact that we are made by Jesus "priests unto God and his Father".<a name=350:10></a> God, as it were, at any time, can point to us and say, They are My priests.<a name=350:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One might refer to many passages to fill out what I have in mind, but it does not always help to multiply passages.<a name=350:12></a> It honours the brethren to assume they know something about Scripture.<a name=350:13></a> Ezekiel has a large place in this subject; he is himself called, not simply a priest, or one of the priests, like Jeremiah, but he is called "<i>the</i> priest", in the beginning of the book; and

	<div class="paragraph">

		Well, I have digressed to speak about time, Ezekiel giving so many dates, and every time he spoke about dates, he would be bowed in the dust and say, Why do I have to date in regard to this captivity?<a name=351:16></a> He would bow to the government of God -- a great matter in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention all that about Ezekiel because he is worthy as a priest, and it is becoming that he should be brought into this great subject of priesthood.<a name=352:7></a> He is like Ezra, who is another priest the Spirit of God dwells upon, giving us his genealogy.<a name=352:8></a> His line is traced back to Aaron, through Zadok, Phinehas, the famous priest of <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#25">Numbers  25</a>, and Eleazar.<a name=352:9></a> What a priestly line reached Ezra!<a name=352:10></a> And we are told that "This Ezra went up from Babylon".<a name=352:11></a> You may be sure that such a man will go up from Babylon as the way out is opened to him.<a name=352:12></a> And he went up freighted with divine thoughts and things.<a name=352:13></a> He brought the precious vessels of God back, weighed and counted, and delivered them safely, in spite of enemies, at Jerusalem.<a name=352:14></a> That is Ezra.<a name=352:15></a> And, as I said, Ezekiel is correspondingly worthy of being brought into this great subject.<a name=352:16></a> He is brought into it by the Spirit of God, and chapter 44 speaks about Zadok.<a name=352:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Zadok is the priest that I intend to dwell upon, and speaking of him I wish to point out that things that are exemplified in Scripture, the great principles of God, cannot be said to be exemplified by all the people of God.<a name=352:18></a> What you find is that they are usually exemplified in certain ones, and what is exemplified is accredited to the whole.<a name=352:19></a> That is important, because I believe the Lord, in speaking to Philadelphia, for instance -- a well-known assembly representing the remnant -- would have us discern He is speaking, not simply to the remnant, but to the assembly.<a name=352:20></a> He calls her the assembly at Philadelphia, but He is speaking to the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that is one of the important things to the Lord at the present time, that there are intelligent listeners to what He says, and they know what He means.<a name=353:4></a> Were I speaking to a number of persons who were not converted, they would not understand anything I am saying, but I am speaking to persons who have ability to understand the mind of Christ.<a name=353:5></a> "I speak", says the apostle, "as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:15">1 Corinthians  10:15</a>) -- a great matter.<a name=353:6></a> It is thus the truth comes out; you cannot open up the truth of God to persons who are not sympathetic, who cannot understand.<a name=353:7></a> But God has given us an understanding that we might know, and so the Lord, in speaking to Philadelphia, speaks about the assembly.<a name=353:8></a> He says, "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>.<a name=353:9></a> Is He thinking of that assembly alone?<a name=353:10></a> No, He is thinking of the whole.<a name=353:11></a> Again, "the Spirit and the bride say, Come", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>.<a name=353:12></a> Well, who are speaking?<a name=353:13></a> Is every saint on earth saying, Come?<a name=353:14></a> I do not believe it.<a name=353:15></a> Some are, and what they say is accredited to all.<a name=353:16></a> It is the bride, the bride's voice, and that is enough for Christ.<a name=353:17></a> The Spirit is speaking, and also the bride.<a name=353:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as I was saying, this thought of priesthood is exemplified in Moses and Aaron: "Moses and Aaron among his priests", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#99:6">Psalm  99:6</a>.<a name=353:19></a> They were true in the main.<a name=353:20></a> Levi was true: he stood for God, and the Thummim and Urim were with him, according to <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>.<a name=353:21></a> The Thummim is put first there, showing that the perfection indicated in it was there, it had been effected in Levi.<a name=353:22></a> Perfection was there in some

		sense, and where that is according to God there is the Urim.<a name=354:1></a> This was seen in Moses and Aaron: "Moses and Aaron among his priests".<a name=354:2></a> But, as to this, the Spirit of God has Phinehas specially in mind.<a name=354:3></a> The thought of the priesthood is exemplified in him at a critical time.<a name=354:4></a> It shines out in a crisis; it is what a man is in a crisis, not in the Bible reading, but when something has to be met and adjusted; that is where you get priesthood.<a name=354:5></a> It is strikingly seen in Phinehas.<a name=354:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the Spirit of God gives us the genealogy of Israel in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6">Exodus  6</a>, and as you will all remember, He proceeds from Reuben to Levi, and stops; there is nothing about the remaining tribes.<a name=354:7></a> He takes up Levi, pursuing the line through Aaron until He comes to Phinehas -- and no more; as much as to say, I have reached a man that exemplifies what I have in mind.<a name=354:8></a> What a great thing that is: God, at any time, saying, I have reached the thought for the moment, a man that knows what is in My mind!<a name=354:9></a> You do not want to be out of that; it is open to us to be in it, and God can count and rest on one man or on more who understand what is in His mind.<a name=354:10></a> That is Phinehas, and God says, I will make an everlasting covenant with that man, that he shall be a priest for ever.<a name=354:11></a> I believe that is what is alluded to in Malachi.<a name=354:12></a> Malachi is another prophet who deals with the priesthood, and he is worthy to be brought in here.<a name=354:13></a> The priesthood had broken down disastrously, and God charges them with this, and He calls attention to Levi: "My covenant was with him of life and peace" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2:5">Malachi  2:5</a>); but in truth that covenant was with Phinehas.<a name=354:14></a> You see how God's mind rests on the man in whom the thing stood out in a crisis.<a name=354:15></a>

		Levi; he represented the idea, and then the Spirit of God tells us what Levi was, as thus portrayed in <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2">Malachi  2</a>.<a name=355:1></a> I call attention to it -- in connection with what is stated in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20">Revelation  20</a>, that what is in mind there, "priests of God", is seen in Levi -- a priesthood that God has here and that He looks to.<a name=355:2></a> "The law of truth was in his mouth", and righteousness was with him; and then the passage goes on to say, "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge".<a name=355:3></a> The mind of God is always there, even on his lips; there is no room for the poison of asps under the priest's lips.<a name=355:4></a> How can a man who is constantly speaking about things in this world give advice about the things of God?<a name=355:5></a> The priest's lips have to be kept clean; they <i>keep</i> knowledge; not only his mind and his bookshelf, but his <i>lips</i>.<a name=355:6></a> The mind of God can be sought at any time; he is always ready to give an answer.<a name=355:7></a> That is what Malachi suggests.<a name=355:8></a>

		Well now, as regards Ezekiel, he is considering the priesthood.<a name=355:20></a> Malachi was considering a priesthood that was needed at the moment.<a name=355:21></a> I suppose it was found in such as Simeon in the gospel of Luke; Luke opens with the great subject of priesthood.<a name=355:22></a> There were two worthy persons, Zacharias and Elizabeth.<a name=355:23></a> Zacharias was a priest of the order of Abia, but he was wanting,

		he was unbelieving, but we find later that he is a true priest and he speaks as a priest.<a name=356:1></a> And so his wife Elizabeth and Mary are priests, and Anna is a priest, and so is Simeon, a "man in Jerusalem".<a name=356:2></a> I have no doubt those dear people answered to the need expressed in Malachi.<a name=356:3></a> The need was met in those whom Luke presents, and no doubt there are such today.<a name=356:4></a> I am far from saying that there are no priests.<a name=356:5></a> There are, but let them come forward.<a name=356:6></a> They came forward in the beginning of Luke; that is what ornaments the gospel of Luke, and the service of God can only be promoted and ornamented by priestly brothers and sisters amongst us.<a name=356:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Ezekiel is intended to bear on the current time, but he contemplates a future priesthood, and he takes up, not Phinehas, but Zadok.<a name=356:8></a> He is the one the Spirit of God has in mind, and like Phinehas, Zadok shone in a crisis.<a name=356:9></a> I believe God even allows things to happen amongst us to bring out His priests, and we do not forget them.<a name=356:10></a> You say, as to a certain difficulty, I remember that nobody but a certain brother had the mind of God.<a name=356:11></a> Zadok shone in David's time, when Absalom rose against him.<a name=356:12></a> He was a true man, and David does not call him a priest only but a seer, and he said, You are the kind of man needed in Jerusalem; Absalom is to be there, to be in the palace and in sway in Jerusalem; what is needed there is a man who sees things; and David calls him a seer.<a name=356:13></a> He does not call Abiathar his colleague a seer; although he was also a priest and worked faithfully at that time with Zadok.<a name=356:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is wanted is a seer, a person who sees the good and the evil, but promotes the good.<a name=356:15></a> Zadok was of immense value in that dark day, when David had to flee from Jerusalem and leave it in the hands of the enemy.<a name=356:16></a> But in the seer, the priests, his <i>friend</i> Hushai, and the two young men, the sons of those priests, David left there a system that would overthrow Absalom and his kingdom; and they did.<a name=356:17></a> I am speaking of Zadok

		because the Spirit of God takes him up in Ezekiel.<a name=357:1></a> The Spirit links the things together in the Scriptures, although much time may intervene.<a name=357:2></a> So here, Zadok, a man that stood when Israel went astray.<a name=357:3></a> Let me warn the young people here not to follow a multitude to do evil.<a name=357:4></a> Very often we are governed by the <i>many</i>: this and that one sees that way, why should I not see that way?<a name=357:5></a> Well, Zadok was different from that; he saw things differently, and he stood by what he saw, and through him, and others like him, the great victory over Absalom was secured, and David was restored to his kingdom.<a name=357:6></a> So God says, This is the kind of priest: "the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok" -- they are the ones.<a name=357:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show you how the garments prescribed for them have a present application.<a name=357:8></a> It says "But the priests the Levites" -- they are not here distinguished from the Levites -- "the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God: they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge".<a name=357:9></a> Let all our young brothers and sisters just range themselves here and say, I would like to be like them; I would like to be amongst those priests; what privileges attached to them!<a name=357:10></a> It is not the brothers; it is a question of the <i>saints</i>; the Spirit of God has them in mind, for all are included in the "holy priesthood" of which Peter speaks.<a name=357:11></a> It is a question of having the Spirit of God, and what privileges are opened up to us, as it says in those verses: "they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge".<a name=357:12></a> What an appeal that is to all the young people here!<a name=357:13></a> The need is great, and God here is holding out what is most attractive spiritually, that He would have us near to Him, a people near to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the next thing is, "And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments".<a name=358:2></a> Now we are dealing with the inner court, that is, where we draw near to God "in assembly", applying it to ourselves; and the Spirit of God refers to the garments, and says, "they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within".<a name=358:3></a> I want the brethren to take note of all this.<a name=358:4></a> It is the inner position, applied to ourselves, the assembly.<a name=358:5></a> The anointing is there as we begin, but inside, in the inner court, it is the kind of <i>clothes</i> you are to have on.<a name=358:6></a> No wool, nothing that causes sweat, as it says here; that is to say, no <i>natural</i> feelings stimulated by singing, by tunes, etc.<a name=358:7></a> We are to be balanced, we are to be sober, we are to be <i>holy</i>.<a name=358:8></a> And so the very bonnets they were to wear were to be of linen.<a name=358:9></a> I do not think that is said elsewhere.<a name=358:10></a> The bonnets refer to our <i>minds</i>.<a name=358:11></a> The human mind is ordinarily agile, and apt to show itself in this way in divine things; thus the need of sobriety and holiness.<a name=358:12></a> The cap is to be of linen -- that I keep cool, as it were, balanced, in what I am saying, that my words in the presence of God are measured.<a name=358:13></a> Be "slow to speak" we are told, when approaching the house of God.<a name=358:14></a> "I had rather", says the apostle, "speak five words with my understanding" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:19">1 Corinthians  14:19</a>); "I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also" (verse 15).<a name=358:15></a> All that refers to a cool linen bonnet that, as it were, keeps the mind steady, for God is resentful of the intrusion of the mind in His holy things.<a name=358:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, just to finish, in the closing verses it says, "And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.<a name=358:17></a> And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according

		to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies".<a name=359:1></a> It is not here a mere local matter, but a question of what is general.<a name=359:2></a> That is to say, the priesthood of God is never contemplated as local.<a name=359:3></a> It may be that some priests reside in this town, for every true christian is a priest, as I said.<a name=359:4></a> A priest may reside in this town, but his influence is to be universal; he is one of those who keep the charge of Jehovah.<a name=359:5></a> So, in this verse, it is not so much "priests unto God", but "of God", that is, they are His priests, and they are looking after His affairs.<a name=359:6></a> In teaching or whatever it be, they represent God here, and everything is to be settled by them.<a name=359:7></a> The judgments are to be according to the mind of God, but these men are so furnished, so kept, so dependent, so prayerful, that their judgment is the judgment of God.<a name=359:8></a> Is it not so?<a name=359:9></a> Can we not arrive, dear brethren, at the present time at a judgment that will carry the consciences of God's people?<a name=359:10></a> We can.<a name=359:11></a> From time to time this has happened, and no doubt it will happen again.<a name=359:12></a> In every controversy, their word is to be listened to; every stroke and controversy is to be according to the word of the priests, the sons of Levi (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:5">Deuteronomy  21:5</a>).<a name=359:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind this evening, dear brethren, to speak about the assembly in its local setting, though one can scarcely speak of it in this connection without having the universal setting in mind, otherwise the tendency would be to independency, at least in thought.<a name=360:1></a> Detachment in thought in a locality from what is general or universal is always to be avoided.<a name=360:2></a> I would beg of the brethren to be assured that what I have to say is intended for general help; for what I have in mind is the truth governing the subject before us.<a name=360:3></a> I do not intend to confine my remarks to current local conditions, but hope that we shall all be drawn to the divine side through the ministry of the word and so be better able to look at any given current local conditions from that moral altitude of mind, as I may call it.<a name=360:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul, in dealing with the low condition of things, as at Corinth, tells us that he was caught up to, or, <i>as far as</i>, the third heaven, as if he was to prove by experience what heaven is and what spiritual altitude is.<a name=360:5></a> The point in this reference is not so much <i>entrance</i> into the sphere, to stay there, but to go as far as that.<a name=360:6></a> Jesus went further; we are told He "ascended up above all the heavens", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:10">Ephesians  4:10</a>.<a name=360:7></a> Paul did not go beyond all the heavens; he only went as far as the third, and thus had opportunity to prove by experience what heaven is; he went past the first and the second, and reached as far as the third heaven.<a name=360:8></a> He says, "whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows".<a name=360:9></a> Nevertheless it was reached, and he knew that.<a name=360:10></a> He could count; he was conscious enough, he was in his senses.<a name=360:11></a> And then he goes on to say, such a one "(whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows;) that he was caught up into paradise", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:3">2 Corinthians  12:3</a>, 4.<a name=360:12></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=361>[Page 361]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is a matter to be noted in dealing with low conditions -- and let it be observed, brethren, that there are very few conditions other than low in christendom.<a name=361:1></a> We cannot say very much; the position at best is extremely weak, and we do well to bear that in mind.<a name=361:2></a> In dealing with a low state of things, the apostle brings forward at a suitable time, that he went as far as the third heaven, and he went <i>into paradise</i>; that word, as is well known, meaning the place of delight.<a name=361:3></a> One can understand what moral power that afforded to the apostle during all those fourteen years, and how, in dealing with the most distressing circumstances, he could always look <i>down</i> -- he could always take up that altitude in his soul, that exaltation, having proved that a creature can go as far as the third heaven.<a name=361:4></a> He was caught up, of course -- he did not ascend in his own power.<a name=361:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is important, dear brethren, because we are bound to come to it; it is a question of the purpose of God, and the purpose of God is going through.<a name=361:6></a> If I hover below the clouds and content myself there, I am simply putting off what is in the mind of God for me.<a name=361:7></a> I may do that, but normally I am bound to come to it.<a name=361:8></a> Divine love will bring us there, the purpose of God regarding us cannot be stopped, it will go through, and we can only deal effectively with the harrowing things here below by taking up that spiritual altitude.<a name=361:9></a> In that way we are superior to what we are dealing with, and so able, in our little measure, to deal with it as God deals with it.<a name=361:10></a> The Spirit being here, as He is, ensures that everything is known in a first-hand way, just as it is and where it is, because the Spirit is come down and searches, as we are told.<a name=361:11></a> He searches us so that everything is known first-hand, and well-known and handled in infinite moral superiority to the conditions down here in which the conflict may be.<a name=361:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with these thoughts before us, I want to speak about the assembly in its local setting -- first as to its
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=362>[Page 362]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		initial features, as to which the Spirit of God gives us the approach to the subject in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>.<a name=362:1></a> The approach is carefully laid out so that as drawing near to this great subject we may arrive at it, and be in it, and serve in it according to God.<a name=362:2></a> One thing to be noted is that Paul, the great architect of it, as in this city of Corinth, is first of all occupied in it with ordinary toil and as a tradesman.<a name=362:3></a> That is not a mere incident to be passed over, but it is to call attention to what is essential to a local setting, what the everyday life and occupation of the inhabitants may be, because his occupation is pretty sure to affect him, and God takes this into account when taking him up in relation to what He is doing.<a name=362:4></a> So the apostle is seen at the very outset working as a tent-maker.<a name=362:5></a> He could tell you something about the life and work and experience of an ordinary workman; he would hear at his trade what passed from the ordinary tent-maker, and then, moreover, he lodged with two persons who were of the same trade; their conversation would naturally turn on what they did during the day, not that it would not rise far above this; he and Aquila and Priscilla would have communion as to the things of God, but they were of the same trade, we are told, and he lodged with them because they were of the same trade, not because they were christians; so they were in a position to understand the circumstances of persons of that status.<a name=362:6></a> Now that is the idea.<a name=362:7></a> I mention it because it is important to bear in mind what the general working conditions are in any given city, and Paul takes account of them as used of God in forming the assembly in that city.<a name=362:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another item which I would mention as initial, is that the workman is affected by the presence of certain persons.<a name=362:9></a> If he is to work in a meeting in which spiritual stature is low, the mind of the saints full of the things that belong to this world, he is hampered.<a name=362:10></a> We are told that Paul reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks, but that when Silas

		<a name=363>[Page 363]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		and Timotheus came to Corinth, "Paul was pressed in respect of the word"; implying that, whatever the word is, it is urgent, it must come out unhampered; there should be conditions to make it possible for the Spirit to bring out the truth.<a name=363:1></a> The truth is not like ordinary matters that men deal with; the truth of God requires the Spirit to bring it out and it requires scope in order to bring it out fully.<a name=363:2></a> These are two great essential local features.<a name=363:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we are told that some of the Corinthians believed, and that Crispus believed; he was the ruler of the synagogue; a great result in one person is indicated in this.<a name=363:4></a> Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house.<a name=363:5></a> Another thing we learn is, that Paul departed from the synagogue and entered into a believer's house, that of Justus; that is an important item.<a name=363:6></a> The state of the believer's household enters into the local situation.<a name=363:7></a> The synagogue refers to judaism, an effete religion, but it is holding on, and today it is simply the religious element in ourselves, using what may be right in itself, for selfish ends and thus missing the spiritual import of it.<a name=363:8></a> The believer's house is a most suitable place; in fact, I do not know of a better place for a meeting than a spiritual believer's household.<a name=363:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to make clear here, dear brethren, that there is no information or instruction as to Corinth until we are in Corinth.<a name=363:10></a> There is not a word about Paul's exercises as to it until he is <i>in</i> Corinth, and then we get all this; all these conditions existing, the Lord comes into the matter and what a triumph it is when He shows His hand!<a name=363:11></a> Should He not come in?<a name=363:12></a> Shall we not let Him in?<a name=363:13></a> Is it not His matter?<a name=363:14></a> Is Corinth not His matter?<a name=363:15></a> Certainly!<a name=363:16></a> All that had been going on was His matter, but now the time had come for Him to come in.<a name=363:17></a> He spoke to Paul by night, and His word was to the end that Paul might be free.<a name=363:18></a> He said, "Fear not, but speak and be not silent; because <i>I</i> am with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I pass on.<a name=364:14></a> It says in the last verse I read, "And he remained there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God".<a name=364:15></a> Mark that word "<i>among</i>" them; all through these verses we read of what happens <i>in</i> Corinth; everything that happens there; and Paul is there for eighteen months <i>among</i> them.<a name=364:16></a> It is the local setting and Paul is teaching the word of God; he is the great architect of what is to be constructed for God, and he is opening up the mind of God.<a name=364:17></a> The people are there, but can they be secured?<a name=364:18></a> Can they be built into this wonderful structure that God has in His mind?<a name=364:19></a> Paul had the pattern.<a name=364:20></a> He laid hold of the Lord's mind exactly; he stayed there eighteen months, which was a good proportion of the years of his service, for he did not serve comparatively long.<a name=364:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=365>[Page 365]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It does not say that the Lord told Paul to stay there for a year and a half.<a name=365:1></a> He did so because he knew what was in the Lord's mind; he understood the Lord had a treasure in the place and he says, as it were, I will stay here until I get it.<a name=365:2></a> Anyone there could have seen Paul's manner of life, the way he went in and out the houses during those eighteen months.<a name=365:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In pursuing this subject I want to show clearly what relates to the local assembly, so that we may have that in mind.<a name=365:4></a> After Paul left, alas!<a name=365:5></a> the breakdown happened.<a name=365:6></a> One of the first complaints he makes in the letter is that "there exist divisions among you", and he gives a list of the parties there.<a name=365:7></a> That was what heavily weighed on his heart; but still there was another condition equally bad; there was an incestuous person there; immorality of the worst kind, and not only in one person, but we learn there were others who were guilty of this kind of thing, and, added to that, there were personal enemies of the apostle.<a name=365:8></a> His faithfulness drew out the enemies who were there; they were inside.<a name=365:9></a> What existed there in Corinth served to bring out what the Lord had in His mind, and the apostle opens his epistle with this: "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=365:10></a> What a dignified title that is!<a name=365:11></a> As Paul was writing the epistle he would be touched with the Lord's thought about His people in Corinth, in spite of all that had come in.<a name=365:12></a> He addresses "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=365:13></a> You may say that some there were not of it at all, and that is true, but the Lord does not refer to them, nor does it affect the title given.<a name=365:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The address, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth", is the assertion of divine ownership, not in regard of the saints viewed in heavenly places, but divine ownership of something here in this world that would stand against all that is opposed; that is what is in the mind of God.<a name=365:15></a> Think of the greatness of having part in that!<a name=365:16></a> You may say that it does not apply now; but it does; that is just what I want to point out; it

		J.T.<a name=445:6></a> Yes; we have had much as to Philippi this afternoon, and I think this epistle is intended to show how results may be quick from divine sowing, may be early.<a name=445:7></a> Philippians will show purity and depth, but Thessalonians is intended to show how in certain fields there are quick results; in others, they are slower.<a name=445:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=445:12></a> You mean the Bereans were more noble?<a name=445:13></a> Of course that would not allude to the saints; that would rather allude to the Thessalonians as such, but still it gives us a clue as to the characteristics of the place and the people.<a name=445:14></a> The Bereans were an inquiring people, a people that would look into things and prove them and have them confirmed -- a very important feature.<a name=445:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=446:18></a> Well, I think there was much there from Old Testament sowing.<a name=446:19></a> That is what the Lord alludes to, corresponding with our own times.<a name=446:20></a> The Spirit of God has our own times in mind in John, times when there is much result from earlier sowing.<a name=446:21></a>

		A.N.<a name=447:2></a>W.<a name=447:3></a> I wondered whether the light as regards baptism would help in that regard.<a name=447:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=447:5></a> I think it has.<a name=447:6></a> The Lord has been helping the brethren in the last forty years on the line of the households, and I believe the truth as a whole has gained enormously through it; the testimony is housed in a brother's house, and those who represent the Lord, make way for the assembly.<a name=447:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=447:8></a>M.<a name=447:9></a> The reference to Samaria that there were no households mentioned and what you said about it helps.<a name=447:10></a> There is nothing to build on in certain areas where evangelisation has been carried on but where there has been no holding to basic things, and where things are confused as in Samaria.<a name=447:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=447:12></a> In the evangelical effort of the past seventy-five years, since 1859, extending back to Whitfield and Wesley and carried down to modern times in Moody and Sankey, there has been no thought of housing the testimony; that is what resulted immediately here at Philippi.<a name=447:13></a> It is not prominent in Thessalonica; it is not mentioned: but it is well to keep it before us in our inquiry now.<a name=447:14></a> Assembly material and assembly formation and household accommodation for the testimony as in the assembly all require households, believers' households.<a name=447:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=447:16></a> Would not material for the testimony be largely secured from the household?<a name=447:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=447:18></a> I think it is.<a name=447:19></a> That is how it comes now and the provision of accommodation in households in a locality where there is to be a meeting, or where there is a meeting, for those who represent the Lord in a special way, is an immense service and leads to the full thought of the household itself in the assembly where the work is housed.<a name=447:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=448:2></a> I think that is right.<a name=448:3></a> The woman is largely the one who graces the house and makes provision for entertaining the Lord's servants, and I believe in a new meeting or in any meeting, that the assembly position is immensely augmented by hospitable households.<a name=448:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=448:5></a>M.<a name=448:6></a> Do you not think that what Aquila and Priscilla did for Apollos, taking him home and helping him there, is a principle; we can all speak of being helped in houses, being invited there through affection and personal interest, and it has been more to us perhaps than a good address?<a name=448:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=448:8></a> At the beginning, it would appear that the enemy's attacks were largely on households.<a name=448:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=448:10></a> As was remarked this afternoon, they beset the house of Jason.<a name=448:11></a> That would be the enemy's effort to get rid of that house and damage it; so that hospitality, I believe, is opened up particularly in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>, and runs on.<a name=448:12></a> Hospitality is intended to augment the assembly, so that in the end of chapter 16, the apostles went to Lydia's, as if to honour the hospitality there.<a name=448:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=448:14></a> Would the goodness of God be seen in the addition to households, in that way?<a name=448:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=448:16></a> You can see how much opportunity there is for the goodness of God in a man's household; how it becomes an opportunity for God to show His goodness, what the house is as for Him, what there is for God in it.<a name=448:17></a> A reading is held and there is morning prayer and the altar, and the smoke of the man's altar ascends every morning.<a name=448:18></a> It is a wonderful thing for heaven; I am sure of that.<a name=448:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=448:20></a>W.<a name=448:21></a> It is particularly interesting in Philippi in connection with Lydia and the jailor because there is a large spoil in each.<a name=448:22></a> It does not say that Lydia was married, but she had a house; it is that that was very important.<a name=448:23></a>

		C.A.<a name=449:1></a>M.<a name=449:2></a> The daily maintenance of the morning and evening sacrifice, as you were mentioning, seems almost to require household conditions.<a name=449:3></a> It must add greatly to a place.<a name=449:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=449:5></a> I am afraid that it is very much neglected, I mean, the morning and evening oblation and lamb.<a name=449:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=449:10></a> Now coming to Thessalonica, there is a suggestion of quick results, but then quick results may not be so stable, and the second epistle to the Thessalonians would show that they were in danger of being easily shaken by the enemy and easily turned aside and damaged by various things being brought to them, but we get the lovely side of youthfulness in the Thessalonians.<a name=449:11></a> They were said to be in God the Father.<a name=449:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=449:13></a> How do you view that?<a name=449:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=449:15></a> I think it refers to the delightful freshness of youth in God the Father.<a name=449:16></a> It meant they were in the Father's affections.<a name=449:17></a> You do not get it just that way in any other epistle.<a name=449:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=449:19></a>W.<a name=449:20></a> How long after the first was the second writing, for they are also called there "in God our Father"?<a name=449:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=449:22></a> It was not very long.<a name=449:23></a> They still retain their freshness, but they have been shaken a bit, and the epistle, of course, is to steady them in respect of the coming of Christ and the day of the Lord.<a name=449:24></a> That line of instruction is very important now when we are apt to turn aside on current happenings and the fulfilment of prophecy, so the apostle makes it very plain that the great falling away that is to come is before the man of sin appears.<a name=449:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=450:23></a> That is the point I think we should notice in a young assembly.<a name=450:24></a> "And <i>ye</i> became our imitators, and of the Lord, having accepted the word in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Spirit, so that ye became models to all that believe".<a name=450:25></a> They became imitators of Paul, and later it says, "For <i>ye</i>, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:14">1 Thessalonians  2:14</a>.<a name=450:26></a> That is an important part of the instruction, for youthful christians, or a youthful assembly, to be imitators of Paul, and then of the Lord, and then of the assemblies at a distance, the assemblies in Judaea; it meant that they were not national in their feelings; they picked their model from a distance, the assemblies that were most likely to be according to the mind of God, those in Judaea at that time.<a name=450:27></a>

		J.T.<a name=525:1></a> That is good.<a name=525:2></a> We noticed that Saul's instruments of war perished.<a name=525:3></a> Some of us have been occupied with the wars of the Lord in a series of meetings, and we were noticing that each battle in the wars of the Lord brings out something distinctive.<a name=525:4></a> In Joshua we have the first great battle at Jericho, then at Ai, then at Gibeon, and then at Merom; each one bringing out something distinctive in Joshua.<a name=525:5></a> The tactics at Jericho were wholly different -- the marching round the city six days and then on the seventh day seven times.<a name=525:6></a> At Ai, after the sin of Achan is judged and Israel is restored, the instructions are very particular.<a name=525:7></a> The lessons that are learned are remarkable.<a name=525:8></a> It is said to be a small city by the spies sent out by Joshua, but Joshua is to attack with all Israel.<a name=525:9></a> There were certain sent as ambush; the principle of an ambush is stressed in that attack, and it is similar here; not exactly an ambush but it is a similar movement, this second instruction against the Philistines: "turn round behind them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees".<a name=525:10></a> An ambush spiritually is some circumstance that arises in which what is of God may be concealed, designedly so, but it draws out the enemy into exposure.<a name=525:11></a> It drew out the men of Ai; it exposed them.<a name=525:12></a> The circumstance is in a sense deceptive.<a name=525:13></a> So that if God wishes to expose something in us that may be concealed, it is drawn out, the ambush exposes it, and it is overcome.<a name=525:14></a> Those tactics at Ai are somewhat similar to what we have here, and teach us the importance of warfare, as the enemy attacks, to get the mind of God; whether it is a frontal attack we make or whether we are to go behind.<a name=525:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passages read in 2 Samuel yesterday afternoon and which we were unable to dwell upon, were in chapters 7 and 15 which we may profitably touch as we proceed.<a name=545:4></a> Particularly that in chapter 7 because it brings out the thought of sonship for the first time in the types we have been looking at.<a name=545:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our subject from the outset of these five readings has been priesthood as seen in 1 and 2 Samuel, but particularly in David.<a name=545:6></a> We saw it first of all in Hannah, who shone in prayer and faith and poetic contribution in the service of God.<a name=545:7></a> Then we saw it in Samuel who exhibited the qualities of a priest.<a name=545:8></a> Although not formally installed as a priest (not being of the sons of Aaron he was scarcely qualified to be a priest), he was a priest actually and practically, and in more ways than one he influenced Israel.<a name=545:9></a> He led them to repentance, offered the sacrifice of the sucking lamb, and prayed for Israel so that God came in against their enemies; showing how priesthood brings in deliverance for the people of God.<a name=545:10></a> Then there is no longer an official place as the judge of Israel.<a name=545:11></a> We saw him in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#19">1 Samuel  19</a>exercising leadership, or presidency, over the prophets, and great power was present to overcome evil, even to the extent of overcoming Saul in his murderous opposition to David.<a name=545:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we saw in David himself how he had liberty to appropriate the priestly food -- an important matter
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=546>[Page 546]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for us as entering on priesthood to know how to appropriate priestly food, the shew-bread.<a name=546:1></a> Then we saw how he had liberty to speak to God and to use the ephod brought to him by Abiathar and how he used it later at Ziklag and brought in deliverance again.<a name=546:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in 2 Samuel, we saw the seemly, considerate spirit toward Saul which belongs to priesthood, especially in his regard and respect for the anointed.<a name=546:3></a> Then there was his petition asking Jehovah whether he should go up to one of the cities of Judah, and, finally, the bringing of the ark to Zion, which occupied us largely yesterday, and his priestly energy displayed before it.<a name=546:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these instances are examples of priesthood and show us how we enter upon it and exercise it, and how it is available to believers; David illustrates the liberty that believers should have to appropriate what is available to sustain us in and fit us to exercise the priesthood.<a name=546:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the passage in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>is the end which we have to come to finally in our reading.<a name=546:6></a> It will be noticed that sonship and lordship are prominent in the passage and that sonship in Christ -- Christ as Son -- serves in view of bringing all into subjection; and that He, so as to be the Leader in this subjection (for it is perfectly seen in Him), is Himself placed in subjection finally.<a name=546:7></a> Wonderful fact for us, that we have a Leader in this permanently!<a name=546:8></a> "Then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all".<a name=546:9></a> If we link that on with <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>, we shall see how it worked out in the types.<a name=546:10></a> Verse 14 says: "I will be his father, and he shall be my son".<a name=546:11></a> And then he says in verse 16: "And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made firm for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.<a name=546:12></a> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.<a name=546:13></a> And king David went in and sat before Jehovah".<a name=546:14></a> That is the position.<a name=546:15></a> David is now in the house, but how?<a name=546:16></a>
