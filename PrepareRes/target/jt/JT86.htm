		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> The passage in Ephesians is generally known to us; it brings before us, perhaps more strikingly than any other, what the saints are to God.<a name=1:3></a> We are to know this; it is the subject of the apostle's prayer that we may know this; it is founded on a certain state already there, as he says, "Having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you at my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints".<a name=1:4></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:15">Ephesians  1:15</a> - 18.<a name=1:5></a> The Lord being here, seen as the Father's glory, we have glory in its greatest features and a rich expression, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.<a name=1:6></a> With this verse in our minds, we may be helped in looking at the Old Testament to see the history of this great subject.<a name=1:7></a> The verses read are only representative, for there are many others bearing on the same subject, but <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>gives us the beginning as regards the position in us.<a name=1:8></a> Of course we have to begin with counsel, and God reaching His counsels from His own side, but what is in mind now is to show how the saints are seen practically, that is through creation and through formation, two words used in this

		subject.<a name=2:1></a> The first thought is obedience; in a way that enters into assembly service as we had it here this morning, what the saints are, and how the saints come before us as God's inheritance; it is not what we are merely according to counsel, but what we are as created and formed.<a name=2:2></a> The passage in 2 Chronicles brings the history of it before us, indicative of God's inheritance, what He found in Israel typically, what He finds in us as seen in Ephesians.<a name=2:3></a> The glory filling the house would mean that the whole scene, according to what is presented through the priests' services, is delightful to God.<a name=2:4></a> It is His inheritance, what He has had in mind all the time in counsel and now has reached.<a name=2:5></a> So that the first thought to be considered is obedience.<a name=2:6></a> It speaks of God having brought them to Himself on eagles' wings, but now "If ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation".<a name=2:7></a>

		F.W.<a name=2:8></a> Would you help us as to being made and formed?<a name=2:9></a> You used, I think, those two words in contrast to what we are in counsel.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:11></a> I was speaking of the passage from the prophet, as you have no doubt observed <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#43:1">Isaiah  43:1</a>, "But now thus saith Jehovah, that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine".<a name=2:12></a> And so verse 7, "Every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory: I have formed him, yea, I have made him".<a name=2:13></a> A distinction is carried down from the first and second chapters of Genesis; the first speaks of man being created, the second speaks of man being formed or made, which is more the personal operation of God.<a name=2:14></a> He was to be in the image of God as created, but then the formation would be more

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=3:3></a> Is that dependent on obedience?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:5></a> I thought obedience was the basis of all this.<a name=3:6></a> Aside from obedience what can God do with us?<a name=3:7></a> We have to be subdued, so that it is conditional here, "If ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation".<a name=3:8></a> The bearing of it would be more public, a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, but it is a question of obedience, hearkening to His voice and keeping His covenant, which has a great bearing today on the saints.<a name=3:9></a> What are we, although we may speak of having been converted at a certain time, save as we come under the divine touch and there is formation?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=3:11></a>M.<a name=3:12></a> It is as we are subject in His hand we come in for the formation.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:14></a> I think that is the way it is.<a name=3:15></a> The creation is a sort of basic thought in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>involving material.<a name=3:16></a> God takes up man as such and forms him, according to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, and enters into covenant with him; so that it corresponds here now; we have a moral being, not simply a creation, but God breathed into man's nostrils and he became a living soul on that principle, which meant that he was not only created, but made a moral being that God could act upon, the moral being meaning that there is that in us that God can affect on moral lines; that was stressed in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>.<a name=3:17></a>

		eternity lose the thought of being creatures.<a name=4:1></a> The two thoughts run together, creation and generation; I think generation is greater, and the idea of formation, at least in Adam, comes in on that line.<a name=4:2></a> God can act, whether through his intelligence, his affections, or his conscience, whatever it be in him.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:4></a> You are not looking at it simply as a creature from the hand of a Creator?<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:6></a> He is that -- God created the heavens and the earth.<a name=4:7></a> Then on the fifth day, as regards the fishes, it says, "God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls, and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the heavens.<a name=4:8></a> And God created the great sea monsters".<a name=4:9></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:20">Genesis  1:20</a>,21.<a name=4:10></a> That is the next use of the word 'created' in the history till you come to man -- it is the same word for all, the same word for the great general act of God in creating the heavens and the earth.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:12></a> Do you carry it on to the new creation in regard to the saints?<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> Quite so, it is carried through.<a name=4:15></a> But <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>helps us; there is nothing said there as to angels; we know they were creatures, of course, but there is very little said about them.<a name=4:16></a> It is what is before our eyes that is in mind, and man is created as the great sea monsters were and as the heavens and the earth were: all came under the same word, something made out of nothing, as far as we can see.<a name=4:17></a> But when you come to formation, it is not that, the material is there; creation brings the material in, so it is a question of God's skill in making something for Himself peculiarly that He can love and persons that love Him and form His inheritance.<a name=4:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> Well, that is a good scripture to bring forward now, no doubt it is a hidden allusion to the assembly.<a name=5:2></a> <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#16">Ezekiel  16</a>helps also -- the beautiful description God gives of Jerusalem.<a name=5:3></a> It shows what is in mind in the sense of formation and fashioning; love enters into it.<a name=5:4></a> The creation is a great general thought, but, when you come to man, formation implies a being God would have intercourse with, who would reciprocate in his intelligence and his affections too; and of course Jacob comes in for that side.<a name=5:5></a>

		Eu.<a name=5:6></a>R.<a name=5:7></a> Does 'voice' in this first scripture in the Old Testament help in relation to that?<a name=5:8></a> Does it involve an intimate link between God and His people, this hearkening to His voice?<a name=5:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:10></a> A thought that begins in the garden -- Adam heard the voice.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=5:12></a>R.<a name=5:13></a> I wondered if we could connect it in any way with the Lord Jesus in Luke's gospel, His genealogy is traced up to Adam and then to God; whether we could link it with "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:4">Luke  4:4</a> and then what is said in Romans, "So also by the obedience of the one" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:19">Romans  5:19</a> -- would that enter into it?<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:15></a> Quite so.<a name=5:16></a> Luke gives us the moral side, the link between God and man.<a name=5:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=5:18></a>M.<a name=5:19></a> In the formation we read of in Genesis is Christ before God supremely as the great Model?<a name=5:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:21></a> That is what is said; Adam is "the figure of him to come".<a name=5:22></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:14">Romans  5:14</a>.<a name=5:23></a> So that God had Christ in His mind; in that way Adam was a figure of what that Man was to be, it is what Christ is really, and our being conformed to Him in the most exalted way: that we might be "conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren".<a name=5:24></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a>.<a name=5:25></a>

		C.G.<a name=6:1></a> Peter, in quoting this passage in Exodus, speaks of disobedience.<a name=6:2></a> Is your thought that the first evidence of God's work coming to light is the thought of obedience?<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:4></a> I think that is the evidence of the moral element that man is responding to God.<a name=6:5></a> "We thus judge", says the apostle, "that if one died for all, then were all dead" (or "then all have died").<a name=6:6></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a>.<a name=6:7></a> That is, there is no pulsation in man Godward, hence the necessity for Christ to die to bring out another order of man.<a name=6:8></a> We have thus judged; but the death of Christ meant there was no pulsation in man at all towards God: "One died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised.<a name=6:9></a> So that <i>we</i> henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer.<a name=6:10></a> So if anyone be in Christ, there is a new creation".<a name=6:11></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a> - 17.<a name=6:12></a> All is dead if Christ had to die; it was imperative; we judge that way.<a name=6:13></a> So that God has to begin over again with Christ.<a name=6:14></a> Peter says we are sanctified to the obedience of Jesus Christ.<a name=6:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=6:16></a>U.<a name=6:17></a> Is the formation you speak of on new creation lines that we recognise there is a new creation and are formed according to that, so that we lose the Jacob character and come out as Israel?<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:19></a> Yes, it is on family lines now.<a name=6:20></a> New creation itself is not a heritage for it extends to inanimate things, though God rejoices in what He creates, He says He will rejoice over Jerusalem with joy.<a name=6:21></a> We ought to get on to the generative line, for it is a question of the family, and ultimately of our being conformed to the image of God's Son, and the passage in Isaiah, I think, helps.<a name=6:22></a> We have the two thoughts, creation and formation.<a name=6:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		"When your obedience is fulfilled", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:6">2 Corinthians  10:6</a>.<a name=7:1></a> Then in Philippians, "As ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence" <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:12">Philippians  2:12</a>.<a name=7:2></a> Does that help?<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:4></a> Yes, indeed it does.<a name=7:5></a> So here I think in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>there was a very infantile condition; they were brought by Moses and brought by Jehovah; they are not yet walking.<a name=7:6></a> "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a> alludes to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>; it took a good time to get to that, but still they are brought by authority and divine influence to Sinai, and the movement is henceforward by the glory in the tabernacle.<a name=7:7></a> But in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>it is persons who are no longer governed by their own thoughts or by an objective idea, but by the Spirit and by what is in themselves; they are constituted sons because they are led by the Spirit.<a name=7:8></a> Now <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>advances on the infantile or babe state.<a name=7:9></a> They had to be carried like the eagle; all has to be done for the young, although the instincts are there.<a name=7:10></a> In Deuteronomy this figure is brought in, but it is an infantile state of things, and God cares thus for a young believer as he comes out of the world; he is borne with more than he is afterwards.<a name=7:11></a> But now Moses puts up twelve pillars; that does not mean a babe, that does not mean the saints are being cared for now as babes; it means men.<a name=7:12></a> Israel is to be composed of men able to do things in relation to one another, able to work in love together; for that is what is in the mind of Moses.<a name=7:13></a> So now he says there are young men in the priestly service, as much as to say, there is a little bit of growth.<a name=7:14></a> That shows the line on which God is coming into His inheritance; it is not in babes, not that He does not love the saints as babes, but He is thinking of men; so Corinthians stresses, "Quit you like men".<a name=7:15></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:13">1 Corinthians  16:13</a>.<a name=7:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:1></a> Quite so; there is some formation in the young man, not only physically, but morally.<a name=8:2></a> I believe the Lord is continually keeping before us all these things in relation to assembly service, for that is the thought in His mind just now.<a name=8:3></a> The great thing is to get them fitted into our minds, and then we can sit down together.<a name=8:4></a> The Corinthians were babes, hence they did not know how to behave themselves in the assembly; they behaved naughtily, as it were playing with toys, like little children.<a name=8:5></a> So Moses uses young men, and the thing is done well.<a name=8:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=82:1></a> Other scriptures will need to be looked into about our subject.<a name=82:2></a> The leading thought in mind is that Luke would show that divine ends, especially assembly service, can only be reached as the Lord comes in and takes part.<a name=82:3></a> We have noticed that Zacharias was occupied with his service, which was, according to the order of his course, to burn incense; it says, "All the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense", as if the great thought of the altar and prayer could only become effective as the angel came in, "standing on the right of the altar of incense".<a name=82:4></a> He came in in regard of what was there, he appeared to Zacharias, but at the right of the altar of incense, that is, in relation to what was going on; and the Lord, in the last chapter, is seen standing in their midst.<a name=82:5></a> The saints had been gathered and were speaking; they had begun, but obviously from the verses read they could not reach an end according to God had not the Lord stood in their midst.<a name=82:6></a> It does not say in this particular case that He came -- John says He came, "Then came Jesus" <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:26">John  20:26</a>; that is, the condition, well known to the Lord, hardly warranted the thought of His coming; His place is standing in their midst.<a name=82:7></a> The word 'came' in John involves certain conditions to be more in keeping with the Lord.<a name=82:8></a> Brethren will remember the wording in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a> - 21, "When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace be to you".<a name=82:9></a> There is nothing said of any activity or speaking on their part; the Lord evidently came in relation to the state that was there, which would mean the

		It seems to me that the point is that there had been prayers and there were prayers, and that the angel standing at the right in regard of what is on hand is to make all effective, that there might be real results, but the state forbade it; at least the state was not in keeping with the opportunity, and so discipline had to come in in the case of Zacharias.<a name=85:1></a> Now in chapter 24 the Lord stood there too, the service was going on, so to say, they were saying the right things so far, but the state was not right; and not only that, but the Lord was intimating that He is taking account of the service so far, that what they were doing and saying was quite right, but he says, 'You must have Me, and I am here to serve', because He is standing, not that <i>He came</i> and stood, but He Himself stood there in their midst, among them, to do what was needful.<a name=85:2></a>

		J.T.<a name=97:1></a> We have the idea of elevation stressed as in the wilderness in these scriptures, and also of course in the land; particularly we see it in the gospel of Matthew.<a name=97:2></a> David makes much of the idea of mountains -- elevation, and, in a general way, before we look into the verses read, it may be helpful to call attention to Moses' remarks as to the mountains in the blessing of Joseph in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:15">Deuteronomy  33:15</a>, "By the best things of the ancient mountains, and by the precious things of the everlasting hills".<a name=97:3></a> He introduces that thought in the blessing of Joseph, and we read also, in the blessing of Zebulun and Issachar, how people were invited to the mountain.<a name=97:4></a> The thought of the mountain no doubt alludes to Genesis where, for our present purpose, chapter 22 should be noted, that is, where Isaac was to be offered up; it is called the mount of Jehovah there and provision should be made there.<a name=97:5></a> In Exodus the matter is made very specific in the appearance of Jehovah to Moses at the bush at Horeb, and the word was that Israel was to serve Jehovah upon this mountain, namely Horeb, where God had appeared to Moses, as it is said, at the thorn-bush.<a name=97:6></a> So that the matter is set in that relation in Genesis, and it gives character to the service of God as inaugurated there.<a name=97:7></a> Chapter 19 brings in the thought strikingly and shows how God, in the Mediator, would stress the thought.<a name=97:8></a> Israel encamped, we are told, in the wilderness of Sinai, and then, "Israel encamped there before the mountain.<a name=97:9></a> And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain", and, that point being established, the Mediator has a peculiar place in this respect, as in others.<a name=97:10></a> It says, "And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God; and

		J.T.<a name=118:1></a> It is in mind particularly that we might see the house of God in its attractiveness especially for the young, as affording spiritual enjoyment.<a name=118:2></a> To some of them our meetings are dull, and it is needful to keep in mind the features of the house that afford enjoyment, enjoyment that lies in affection rather than in understanding; hence the thought of the house of God must be made concrete.<a name=118:3></a> The first scripture has in mind the liberty that is opened up to young believers; the concrete side of the house is in mind rather than the abstract, but the Son abides in it, so that it affords permanence in the way of liberty.<a name=118:4></a> Then in Luke it is dependent on the gospel and presented in a peculiarly attractive way as having in it music and dancing, holiness entering into it from the outset, so that, as young ones begin to taste the joys of the house of God, they also begin to realise the need of holiness, that indeed they are possessed of it as having the Holy Spirit themselves.<a name=118:5></a> But it is presented in a public way in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, for the elder brother would discern the merriment going on inside, although he had no taste for it.<a name=118:6></a> And then in Peter the holiness is more concrete, it says we ourselves are the living stones as coming to Christ as the living stone, and "built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God", so that the element of sacrifice enters into the service of God.<a name=118:7></a> And then finally, that we are at home there, "no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints", not only in the house, but of God's household, the foundation and the ornamentation of it in Christ being the corner-stone; it is ultimately a

		J.T.<a name=119:7></a> Well, music and dancing of course do not require the intelligent side so much; enjoyment is through intercourse with persons from the standpoint of affection.<a name=119:8></a> When we come to Peter, we have the idea of life and priesthood; priesthood requires intelligence, but the mere thought of the elements of music and dancing does not stress the idea of intelligence.<a name=119:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=120:9></a> Well, the point is that the servant of sin is himself a bondman, and for that reason he can be ejected, he is not to continue, but it is a very solemn thing that it is a bondman of <i>sin;</i> it makes it a very serious matter for all who are serving in a lawless way, for "sin is lawlessness" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:4">1 John  3:4</a>; even if it be religious lawlessness, it is sin.<a name=120:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=137:1></a> The proposal in reading this passage is to call attention to Samuel, the last of the judges, as setting out more fully than any of them the thought of judgeship amongst the people of God.<a name=137:2></a> It is a suggestion of how the end of a thing is better than the beginning, and is an encouragement to us, as coming at the end, to aim at the fulness of the divine thought in the dispensation.<a name=137:3></a> Much is made of Samuel's early life in this book, of his parentage, particularly his mother, and how Jehovah saw to it that he acquired moral weight among the people; He did not allow his words to fall to the ground; God took care of that.<a name=137:4></a> He was known as a prophet from Dan to Beer-sheba and what he said came to pass.<a name=137:5></a> That is, what is stressed in Samuel is the reality of his personality according to God and of his gift and mission, so that there can be no question about him, no reasonable question raised up against him.<a name=137:6></a> If the people are not satisfied, if they wish for another, they have to resort to subterfuge, they can hardly complain of himself.<a name=137:7></a> So that he stands out, it seems, as a model for us in the last days as equalling, or more than equalling, the first judge, who, I suppose, is Othniel.<a name=137:8></a> I think all would remind us that there should be no haziness or doubtfulness as to things or persons, that each of us should be known, clear, transparent, that, whatever our service, we are in it rightly and suitably and efficiently -- it is not a time for anything else.<a name=137:9></a> The ark here was not cared for properly; it had been captured and now was not in the proper surroundings, a solemn matter for anyone who, like Samuel, regards Jehovah.<a name=137:10></a> So that, these facts being stated, the position of the ark

		Now this section in the second scripture I have read records a workman with God, a man who worked with <i>God</i>.<a name=158:8></a> Jonathan, we are told, "wrought with God".<a name=158:9></a> He did not work with his father; in fact it says that before he entered on the great undertaking at the beginning of this chapter 14 "he did not tell his father".<a name=158:10></a> <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#14:1">1 Samuel  14:1</a>.<a name=158:11></a> The verses I have read show how wise this was.<a name=158:12></a> The chapter brings out that the end was not really reached, great as was the beginning and the victory in a general way.<a name=158:13></a> The full end was not reached.<a name=158:14></a> And why?<a name=158:15></a> Because of Saul interposing: <i>he</i> would have part in the victory, for the natural mind is ready to take part when things are successful in the service of God.<a name=158:16></a> It was a question with Saul of <i>his</i> enemies -- not <i>God's</i>.<a name=158:17></a> It was a question with him of being avenged on <i>his</i> enemies!<a name=158:18></a> Such a person intruding into a great divine matter can only hinder.<a name=158:19></a> In fact any part the natural mind has in divine operations, however apparently helpful at the outset, can only hinder in the end.<a name=158:20></a> Let us take note of that, dear brethren, because natural energy is not only useless, but it is <i>in the way</i>.<a name=158:21></a>

		So Saul interposed with a curse.<a name=159:1></a> There was no need for it.<a name=159:2></a> In due course anyone interfering or taking a hand in the work of God on natural lines will expose himself, and will be found not only useless but in the way.<a name=159:3></a> Saul saw the work, that the victory was assured, why should <i>he</i> not have part in that?<a name=159:4></a> But was he a worker with God?<a name=159:5></a> On the contrary, dear brethren, he was a worker <i>against</i> God in this matter.<a name=159:6></a> And why?<a name=159:7></a> Because he assumed distinction; he assumed the ability; he assumed all that his outward position afforded him.<a name=159:8></a> And so he assumes the right to interfere with the food of the warriors of God, to deprive them of it!<a name=159:9></a> He interposed a curse, too; assuming the right, the religious right, of cursing anyone who disregarded his foolish edict!<a name=159:10></a> And the worker with God is happily unaware of this.<a name=159:11></a> Happy it is for us when we are working successfully with God if we are unaware of these fathers who would interpose their religious authority, if not to stop the work directly, at least to weaken the hands of those engaged in it.<a name=159:12></a>

		We can thus understand the spiritual meaning of Jonathan refraining from telling his father of the great project he had on hand.<a name=159:13></a> He did not tell his father, we are told.<a name=159:14></a> It is happy to be ignorant of their assumed rights over us in the service of God.<a name=159:15></a> Jonathan was ignorant of this stupid edict, and oh!<a name=159:16></a> how many there are abroad today, dear brethren, based on self-importance, based on religious importance and authority.<a name=159:17></a> Whereas neither exists.<a name=159:18></a> Happy it is for us if we are ignorant of their self-imposed interference, their importance and consequent interference.<a name=159:19></a> Hence, if we are to be successful as workers with God, for Jonathan "wrought with God", <i>do not tell them</i>.<a name=159:20></a> The less they know the better.<a name=159:21></a> Jonathan did not tell his father, but nevertheless his father came into the matter and enjoined that the warriors

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, dear brethren, you see what I mean.<a name=160:8></a> Jonathan says of his father here, "My father has troubled the land".<a name=160:9></a> There are many such.<a name=160:10></a> It is the land in a spiritual sense.<a name=160:11></a> He says, in effect, he has really robbed us of what was within our grasp, namely, the complete overthrow of the Philistines at this time.<a name=160:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You can see then, dear brethren, that if we are to be workers with God at this hour we must disregard all such fathers.<a name=160:13></a> If we are ignorant of their intervention it is happy, but if we come to know it we are not to fail to make it clear that it is an interference.<a name=160:14></a> In fact the whole hierarchical system (if you will allow me to say it here) is an interference with the work of God, to say nothing more than that.<a name=160:15></a> It is a positive interference.<a name=160:16></a> Time was when we could not meet like this.<a name=160:17></a> Why?<a name=160:18></a> Because of that interference!<a name=160:19></a>

		Well then, dear brethren, as workers together with God, let us go on in happy ignorance of this interference.<a name=160:20></a> Not that we do not suffer, but go on with God, partaking of the honey, namely, the fruit of the land, for that is what it is.<a name=160:21></a> The land is constantly

		Now I go on to chapter 15 (much more might be said, of course, as to Jonathan's pronouncement on his father) to show how this incompletion of work divinely assigned is more fully seen in Saul's case.<a name=161:17></a> It is a question of self-judgment, really, in the antitype, a question of dealing with Amalekitish elements amongst the people of God.<a name=161:18></a> And here it may be that most of us are involved, whether it be each in his own self or in his family or in his business or in his service to the Lord.<a name=161:19></a> It is a question whether any of us would come out clear in the matter were we put to the test, as the Lord Jesus says, "before my God".<a name=161:20></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:2">Revelation  3:2</a>.<a name=161:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, after giving Saul full credit for what he had done, "Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt", the Spirit of God goes on to say, in verses 8, 9, "And he took Agag the king of Amalek alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.<a name=164:6></a> And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and oxen, and beasts of the second bearing, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction; but everything that was mean and weak, that they destroyed utterly".<a name=164:7></a> So you see, dear brethren, the matter is exposed, not perhaps to the unspiritual eye, but to the spiritual eye.<a name=164:8></a> Saul is exposed, and he loses the kingdom.<a name=164:9></a> His works were not found complete before his God.<a name=164:10></a> He has his explanation, his apology, to offer, but the fact remains that he is <i>rebellious</i>.<a name=164:11></a> That is at the bottom of it -- his will is at work.<a name=164:12></a> If Amalek is spared, it is the natural mind, the natural will, that does it.<a name=164:13></a> The best of things, what is humanly good, is retained, and what is mean and weak is destroyed.<a name=164:14></a> There is no credit in that, beloved.<a name=164:15></a> It is the Amalekite in the <i>best</i> of him, in <i>all that he is</i>, that is to be destroyed.<a name=164:16></a> You say, That is the flesh in a peculiar way.<a name=164:17></a> Yes, it is, but it is the

		The word that covers my subject is very familiar, it is the word 'adjustment'.<a name=169:1></a> There seems to be no need for it in the physical creation, in that designated as the worlds, which were framed by the word of God, the term 'worlds' covering what we call the universe, not only our universe or solar system, but all the worlds; they seem to move on without need of external adjustment; whereas in the moral system which is correlative, adjustment is constantly needed, and in using the word one has in mind perhaps a little more than it literally conveys, and that where it takes place, as needed, there is not only correction, but ability to go on according to one's best days, to go on according to the greatest light that one has received.<a name=169:2></a> I say the light received because though the true light now shines, we cannot assume to have received all of it.<a name=169:3></a> There is not only light in the sense in which John presents it, the true light which is Christ, He is the true Light, but there is that beautiful expansion of the thought in light from heaven.<a name=169:4></a> Of course Christ was light from heaven, for He came down from heaven, but the apostle Paul speaks of a light shining down from heaven; we cannot say all have received it, but it shines; it "shone .<a name=169:5></a>.<a name=169:6></a>.<a name=169:7></a> round about me", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:6">Acts  22:6</a> the apostle Paul says.<a name=169:8></a> It is, however, what we receive that is effective.<a name=169:9></a> Light comes in through the eye, and it is said "If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:22">Matthew  6:22</a> no part dark, that is the light is allowed to shine unhinderedly through the appointed channel.<a name=169:10></a> One great principle in the work of God in us is that we allow Him His way, whether it be in an assembly, or in a person.<a name=169:11></a> We are to make way

		for God, and if it be that light is shining, then let it shine in, not only round about us.<a name=170:1></a> It is according to this light, as it may have shone into any of us and been received, that, if adjustment takes place, we function according to that light, according to the light we enjoyed in our best days.<a name=170:2></a> Adjustment is thus what is positive, not simply correction, so that there is a resumption of functions that are proper to any one of us.<a name=170:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have selected these three great servants of God, Samuel, David and Peter, as illustrative of what I have in mind, persons amenable to adjustment in the sense in which I have spoken of it.<a name=170:4></a> The fact that such men needed this is a solemn warning to all of us, even the most spiritual, for these are outstanding spiritual men and servants of God.<a name=170:5></a> What is in mind is not to call attention to their failures, but to their adjustments and their amenableness to adjustment, so that in result God lost nothing; He gained in each case.<a name=170:6></a> It is a sorrowful contemplation if one has to own that God has lost something in oneself.<a name=170:7></a> Now Samuel, as you will observe, kept on mourning for Saul; he had to do with Saul from the outset of his official service and he anointed him.<a name=170:8></a> Where a servant has a convert and that convert becomes distinguished, the servant is apt to remember and peculiar links are apt to spring up going beyond what is spiritual.<a name=170:9></a> It appears that Samuel was affected in this way so that he is out of accord for the moment with the mind of Jehovah.<a name=170:10></a> Jehovah had rejected Saul, we are told in the clause immediately preceding this chapter, and Samuel had not; he had done so officially, that is, he had done so as Jehovah's servant, as we might say in ministry.<a name=170:11></a> In the previous chapter he speaks by the word of Jehovah to Saul, he overlooks nothing, no language could be plainer, no message more faithful than the word he spoke to the defaulting king; Saul had rejected the Lord and the Lord had

		rejected him from ruling over His people.<a name=171:1></a> The mind of God was perfectly plain, not only to Saul or anyone who heard Samuel speak, but above all, plain in Samuel's mind.<a name=171:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, dear brethren, what we say on the platform -- for in chapter 15 he speaks by the word of the Lord, it is ministry as it were -- what we say thus may be in every way right, but as soon as the service is ended our mind may be different, and that is what we have to guard against, and it is that in which Samuel failed here.<a name=171:3></a> Mourning is laudable under certain circumstances, certainly as in the case of Josiah, when Jeremiah mourned, and all the singing men and singing women mourned and made lamentation for him; he was worthy; but to mourn for Saul is another matter, for he is the man who failed God.<a name=171:4></a> He had a wonderful beginning in his official service, but he failed God.<a name=171:5></a> His failure is to be mourned, of course, but to mourn for him in the sense of friendship, because I once had strong personal links with him, is another matter; it has no place in the divine lamentations and that is where Samuel missed it.<a name=171:6></a> He mourned, we are told, for Saul when Jehovah had rejected Saul.<a name=171:7></a> This is a serious matter, as also in any similar circumstances, because other great services are to be rendered by Samuel, if not by Saul.<a name=171:8></a> Immediately another charge is given to him, and now we see the bearing of his mourning for Saul; we see that he has damaged his own soul.<a name=171:9></a> Let us never forget this, dear brethren, it is not simply the act, that which is external, but the damage we do to our own souls.<a name=171:10></a> This section is full of light, negatively and positively, it is one of the most remarkable sections in Scripture.<a name=171:11></a> It is a record of Saul's reign, and earlier the light came in of another man elected, so that the ruling man, the acting man, the distinguished man for the moment is already displaced, displaced in the mind of God.<a name=171:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This history of displacement is another matter that runs along with what I am saying, it is a matter of soul history, a history of displacement.<a name=172:1></a> We are told earlier that Samuel says to Saul, "Jehovah has sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over his people; for thou hast not kept what Jehovah commanded thee", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#13:14">1 Samuel  13:14</a>.<a name=172:2></a> That was earlier light; this matter of displacement had already taken place in regard of Saul; in the mind of God, Saul was no more, as you might say.<a name=172:3></a> It was all over; be it a few days, or a few months, or a few years, that had nothing to do with it, it was all over in the mind of God.<a name=172:4></a> Now this history of displacement in our souls, dear brethren, is one of the most important points to take account of; I began my spiritual history with it, with displacement, and Samuel had light earlier, so that he had plenty of time for reflection, for being formed according to the light of the mind of God, the light of displacement involved that the active man was already dismissed and another appointed to rule, the other unnamed, but still another person.<a name=172:5></a> Let us get that into our minds, the active man is displaced in the mind of God.<a name=172:6></a> Then Samuel gets the word of God expressly for Saul, and he delivers it, as I said, most faithfully in chapter 15.<a name=172:7></a> Yet now he is mourning, and we are told that God has rejected Saul.<a name=172:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a new order of things coming in in the mind of heaven, and it ought to have been in the mind of Samuel, but he is out of accord for the moment; he has allowed the natural unduly; the links were strong but they were not altogether spiritual.<a name=172:9></a> You will observe in the previous chapter that even Saul induces Samuel to follow him; he turned again after him, after such a faithful message from God, which meant that he was no longer to be followed, he was to be regarded as a rejected man.<a name=172:10></a> But Samuel found tears enough to shed for him; he

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he gets another commission -- I want to speak of that just for a moment, dear brethren, as I have already alluded to it.<a name=173:3></a> But we see here how our souls become damaged more than we are aware of through natural links: they may be formed primarily in the spiritual sense -- but continuing too far and as the spiritual wanes, the links remain and our souls are damaged.<a name=173:4></a> These damages have to be repaired and the reparation of them implies adjustment not only in negative thought but that we pursue our best line, our best services, that we re-acquire our best tastes, our best sight, our best feelings.<a name=173:5></a> Now Samuel undertakes the commission, and he goes to Bethlehem.<a name=173:6></a> Now Jehovah says, It is the one I appoint.<a name=173:7></a> Remember, Samuel had the light of another in his soul according to chapter 13; another was there in the mind of God, already appointed.<a name=173:8></a> He was not a Samuel unborn, it was a David already there; already appointed to be ruler.<a name=173:9></a> Why is Samuel not looking for this man that is so pleasing to God?<a name=173:10></a> Has he forgotten what pleases God?<a name=173:11></a> Samuel knew well what pleased Jehovah; no one in his day pleased him more than he himself; he knew what was pleasing to Jehovah in an earlier day, in a ruler or in any servant; he himself was the best expression of the thing, but why this defect?<a name=173:12></a> Why is he looking for a different kind of man from himself, a man whom God so often approved?<a name=173:13></a> God had great pleasure in Samuel; He put him forward.<a name=173:14></a> He would not allow a word of his to fall to the ground; He liked him so well; He did indeed.<a name=173:15></a> The evidence is that he was looking for a man like Saul; that was what was in his mind.<a name=173:16></a> If I have been conscious of God's pleasure

		What is in mind is to speak about addition, the thought arising from David's exhortation to Solomon that he should add to what had been already accumulated in view of the building of the house of God; that it was to be an accumulation of wealth not only once for all but added to continuously.<a name=211:1></a> And so the history of the kings following upon Solomon, and of the prophets, shows that this principle was maintained: there was continuous addition, and no doubt, as this matter is mentioned in our hearing, the desire arises in each lover of Christ and lover of God that he should, at least, add something to what he has found.<a name=211:2></a> Of course, each believer is an addition in himself, but that is God's adding.<a name=211:3></a> We are told in the Acts of persons being added, but that is not to their credit; what is to their credit is what they added as having been themselves added by God; so while the divine addition is initial as applied to each of us, the addition by the believer is continuous.<a name=211:4></a> And it certainly would be a sorry result of any person being added by God that he should live as having added nothing, that one should just be added by God in His sovereignty and pursue his way spiritually inactively, unproductively, unconstructively, leaving only a heap of wood, hay or stubble to be burnt up.<a name=211:5></a> Scripture contemplates this, but no true lover of God can contemplate it with anything but the deepest sorrow if it be his case in any sense.<a name=211:6></a> We read in the Acts, as I said, of God adding persons, and then Peter who had to do much instrumentally with these additions, tells us that it is as a newborn babe that anyone grows up to salvation by the pure mental milk of the word, and becomes clear of all adverse elements, not only of

		those that are outwardly adverse to the truth, but of those in himself that would hinder his growth into salvation.<a name=212:1></a> It implies that one is clear and has a free hand, and thus he moves to Christ as a living stone.<a name=212:2></a> That is more than divine addition, that is self addition, Christ being the living stone to whom he comes: "Yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a> that is self addition.<a name=212:3></a> I mean in so far as he moves with Christ, the divine operation takes place at once, for he cannot build himself in: he is being built in as a living stone, as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood -- he belongs to that -- to offer up spiritual sacrifices.<a name=212:4></a> He has not only himself, but sacrifices; and not only material sacrifices, which are also valuable in their place, but <i>spiritual ones</i> and these are what I have in mind.<a name=212:5></a> Spiritual sacrifices can be traced from Solomon's day onwards; yea, from <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16">Exodus  16</a>, the great beginning of the service of God in redemption, we have continuous addition, until the Chief Musician arrives who puts everything in its place, so that even our addition, as well as ourselves, comes under divine control and filling, and hence, as passing off the scene under the will of God, one has left something.<a name=212:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I want to show from Mary in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>how this service proceeds; it is in one's being singled out, and every one of us, beloved brethren, has been singled out divinely -- a great and wonderful fact!<a name=212:7></a> Mary was separated and qualified for a great purpose; I speak now of her as illustrative, not to set out the great facts of the incarnation, but only to deduce a principle from them.<a name=212:8></a> She is taken up on a particular date, the sixth month, and that date has reference to a divine operation in another like her, that is Elizabeth, so that both have a common point of sympathy.<a name=212:9></a> Much is said by the angel to Mary which is familiar to us, but it finishes with a date as to Elizabeth, and Mary says, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word".<a name=212:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=213>[Page 213]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The angel had said to her, "With God nothing shall be impossible".<a name=213:1></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:37">Luke  1:37</a>.<a name=213:2></a> There can be no addition spiritually, dear brethren, save in the acceptance of that initial fact; it is what is possible with God.<a name=213:3></a> However I may think of myself as an unlikely person to add to the great testimony that has now moved down for centuries, this word settles everything, "With God nothing shall be impossible".<a name=213:4></a> Let no one exempt himself therefore in this great matter.<a name=213:5></a> God had wrought with Elizabeth and He had now wrought with Mary; they have a common subject of interest, it is the work of God.<a name=213:6></a> They are set in relation to each other also on the principle of date, and these respective operations of God have matured in the most wonderful addition hitherto known, John the baptist, six months before the Messiah.<a name=213:7></a> No greater subjects, beloved brethren, could engage mortals or immortals, and they are here set before us; and relatively what may be deduced as applicable to ourselves is also transcendently great.<a name=213:8></a> The fact is that we have but little apprehension of the greatness of what we are engaged with; the most advanced of us is hardly equal to handling the great things we have to do with.<a name=213:9></a> And yet the lord graciously allows us to have to say to them and encourages us to go on, but with an increasing sense of responsibility that we have finally to give an account and that in the presence of the most scrutinising light, the divine eyes indeed.<a name=213:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the angel departs as Mary takes the ground of subjection.<a name=213:11></a> She said, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word", and she is taken at her word.<a name=213:12></a> God loves to trust us, and the less we trust ourselves the more we shall be trusted divinely.<a name=213:13></a> God loves to trust us, but then, He knows us and trusts us according to His knowledge of us, not otherwise; He makes no mistakes.<a name=213:14></a> The angel departing implies clearly that she can be

		trusted, and think, dear brethren, of the stupendous character of the trust.<a name=214:1></a> You would have said a legion of angels ought to be around her all the time with such a trust.<a name=214:2></a> We might think that, but no -- the angel departed from her.<a name=214:3></a> She is left alone; there is nothing said about Joseph coming in here; he has his place.<a name=214:4></a> But the stupendous nature of this trust, you might say, requires that all heaven should be around this person, this virgin, a young person, unprotected, left in this world with such a charge -- but the angel departed from her.<a name=214:5></a> Need I say, dear brethren, that heaven never lost sight of her, the eye of the Father never lost sight of this distinctive personage.<a name=214:6></a> Why then is it said the angel departed?<a name=214:7></a> Surely to call attention to her trustworthiness; and that is the point to begin with as to any addition for God, it is the principle of subjection, absolute surrender.<a name=214:8></a> "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me", as she says, "according to thy word", and the angel accepts it and departs.<a name=214:9></a> It is all with you now, Mary -- as it were; and so it is, dear brethren, that in anything, however small, in which I might wish to add to what there is, the Lord will say, 'It is your matter now'.<a name=214:10></a> Well now, what is she going to do?<a name=214:11></a> Is she to remain alone to sit on a throne of distinction without a companion?<a name=214:12></a> No other person ever had or could have such distinction, only one person could have this distinction through all time or eternity; she had it.<a name=214:13></a> Is she to sit on a throne of distinction alone, occupying all of it, and having others come and bow down to her?<a name=214:14></a> No, that is not the divine way, nor is it the way of Him of whom she was to be presently the distinguished mother.<a name=214:15></a> No, "I am among you", He says, "as he that serveth".<a name=214:16></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:27">Luke  22:27</a>.<a name=214:17></a> It is a lowly attitude to take, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word", and what does she do?<a name=214:18></a> Well, the angel had been speaking to her about her kinswoman and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=215>[Page 215]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		about her son.<a name=215:1></a> What does this mean?<a name=215:2></a> This means that if I get any accession of light from God, He will give me to understand there are others, that I am not alone in this distinction -- there is an Elizabeth, and she makes haste to get to her, she makes haste to get to the hill country where this other distinguished person lives.<a name=215:3></a> They are bound up in a common testimony and it is as if Mary were to say, 'I must be there; she will support me and I will support her', and so it was.<a name=215:4></a> She arrives: as we are told, she entered into the house of Elizabeth and saluted Elizabeth -- she is worthy of the salutation, as all the saints are.<a name=215:5></a> However distinguished I may be, I need the saints, they are worthy of my respect; I shall never love a person if I do not respect him.<a name=215:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Mary salutes Elizabeth, and the result is a remarkable contribution, a remarkable addition to what was there -- I say to what was there, that is the fact as to Elizabeth.<a name=215:7></a> See what results, dear brethren, come out as I link on with my brethren who are, equally with myself, or relatively perhaps with myself, distinguished; see what comes out, what there is with me becomes enlarged, yea, something comes out unheard of before.<a name=215:8></a> What brought it out?<a name=215:9></a> The presence of Mary.<a name=215:10></a> As I visit and link myself on with the brethren, paying them due respect and affection, knowing them as acquainted with them by the Lord Himself, I bring out the very best there is with them, and then in return the very best in me will come out -- there is double addition.<a name=215:11></a> In truth, there were three persons now in this pious bond of fellowship in the hill country of Judah.<a name=215:12></a> What an environment we are in now; not simply these two great women, but the hill country of Judah.<a name=215:13></a> We have to think of the antecedents of Judah, its place in this great thought: it refers to the divine claims, the service of God, for, when Israel came out of Egypt, Judah was God's sanctuary

		Then in the last chapter we have two persons of another character; there are a great company of them at the present time -- I mean as they were before the Lord revealed Himself to them, they were wanderers.<a name=217:4></a> It has come before us today that the children of God are scattered abroad; those known to us, dear brethren, are but a tithe of the number, and the divine promise alluded to already is, I will gather others.<a name=217:5></a> Satan, the wolf, has scattered; God is gathering.<a name=217:6></a> The Lord Jesus died "not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:52">John  11:52</a>.<a name=217:7></a> Gather them together into one!<a name=217:8></a> What a thought of unity that is!<a name=217:9></a> It is not simply christians in profession, but the <i>children of God</i>, real souls.<a name=217:10></a> Now these two persons are of that class and they are being gathered.<a name=217:11></a> It is no doubt exemplary, like gathering goes on today; every one of us here has, I suppose, experienced something of it, the gathering together of the children of God into one by the great Shepherd of the sheep who died for that very purpose that we should not be scattered abroad but gathered together into one.<a name=217:12></a> It is a perfect matter.<a name=217:13></a> And so they are amenable to the Lord's conversation with them; in fact He joins them.<a name=217:14></a> There is nothing haughty about them, no turning away from this stranger.<a name=217:15></a> Who is He?<a name=217:16></a> An unknown person to them.<a name=217:17></a> "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<a name=217:18></a>".<a name=217:19></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:18">Luke  24:18</a>.<a name=217:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=225:1></a> What is in mind is to consider the assembly, that is, how it is employed as such as seen in this letter.<a name=225:2></a> There are other scriptures bearing on the subject, but these four are selected to show: firstly, the general thought, that it is God's assembly in any given place; then, secondly, that it is employed locally for the service of God, inclusive of the celebration of the Lord's supper; and, thirdly, that it is viewed as in chapter 14, come together in all its members, that is in each person belonging to it, for spiritual ministry, and that it is itself to be ministered to and that this ministry is to be edifying; and then, fourthly, that the gifts are set in it according to chapter 12, implying its universal bearing.<a name=225:3></a> This will lead, I believe, to our seeing perhaps more clearly than before that, even as used in the celebration of the Lord's supper, it is still God's assembly, and therefore the thought of God in the sense of ownership and control attaches to it, even whilst the Lord's supper is being celebrated, for, as to the very subject of the Lord's supper, the apostle says, "Do ye despise the assembly of God?<a name=225:4></a>".<a name=225:5></a> Their conduct implied that they despised the assembly of God in what they were doing.<a name=225:6></a> So that, although the celebration of the Lord's supper is limited to the dominical idea, as the passages in chapters 10 and 11 which relate to it show, the thought of <i>God</i> is not to be ignored.<a name=225:7></a> Is what I have said clear, do you think?<a name=225:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=226:3></a> Well, it is conveyed, I think, in the verses read from chapter 11, "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper", meaning that they were not conducting themselves rightly because of the way they acted; it should have been the Lord's supper; that was the intent.<a name=226:4></a> They were to come together in assembly to break bread, to celebrate the Lord's supper; and so in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:7">Acts  20:7</a>, "we being assembled", it says "to break bread", that is, the thing itself is necessary now.<a name=226:5></a> It had been done in houses, according to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, but now it necessitates the assembly; the assembly indeed is employed by the Lord, and singing in it is referred to in Hebrews; and it also has the place of the house of God in Hebrews, "Whose house are <i>we</i>, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:6">Hebrews  3:6</a>, so that it takes on the character of the sanctuary.<a name=226:6></a> Do you think that is right?<a name=226:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=226:8></a> Yes.<a name=226:9></a> I was thinking perhaps we have looked at the assembly more as the place of our enjoyment, instead of seeing what it is for God, as you speak of it, to be employed for Him.<a name=226:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=226:11></a> Yes, and in that respect I suppose we should not overlook the Lord's first word as to it: "I will build my assembly" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>, He says, as if He would use it thus.<a name=226:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=226:15></a> It is the vessel He has now -- quite so, as of old He had Israel.<a name=226:16></a> Only that the thought of the service of God was brought down to a special family, Aaron and his house and the Levites; they had

		<a name=227>[Page 227]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a material tabernacle, but it is the same idea; the assembly takes the place, not only of the tabernacle but of Israel itself.<a name=227:1></a> The primary thought of Israel was that it was to be a nation of priests and God was to have it in that peculiar way among the nations; now He has the assembly.<a name=227:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.I.<a name=227:3></a> Do you mean in the Lord's supper there is a service that goes on in a dual way, that is, what is due to God and what is due to the Lord, at the same time?<a name=227:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=227:5></a> Well, 'at the same time' brings it down to detail, which is worthy of consideration.<a name=227:6></a> The dominical part, as we rightly speak of it, implies that it is in regard of the Lord Himself, that there is something that relates to Himself in it.<a name=227:7></a> Some of us lately were speaking of a certain king making a marriage for his son.<a name=227:8></a> The king took control of the marriage feast; there is nothing at all about the son appreciating it there but what is kept in mind is what the king did for his son.<a name=227:9></a> I think, in a general way, that is applicable to what we are speaking of; it is God's assembly and He honours His Son in it.<a name=227:10></a> But then the celebration of the Lord's supper has a special place.<a name=227:11></a> It will not go on in the world to come, as far as we can see; it refers only to the period of the Lord's absence from this world; it is necessitated by that indeed, so it is not a continuous thought.<a name=227:12></a> The service of God will go on eternally, but the Lord's supper is a special thing that involves relations between Himself and His own, the assembly itself, during the period of His absence: so it is to be considered in that light and therefore it is a dominical thought, whereas in general the service is God's, God honours the Son and the Son honours the Father, for the Lord has laid down that the Son must be honoured as the Father is honoured.<a name=227:13></a> So the great feast in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22">Matthew  22</a>would point, in a general

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.I.<a name=228:3></a> Yes.<a name=228:4></a> What you have in mind is the great thought of assembly service; what is due to the Lord will uphold this.<a name=228:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=228:6></a> It has in mind that part, and is provisional, only applying to the period of the Lord's absence from this world, but the Lord's service will go on millennially and eternally.<a name=228:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=228:8></a> Is that special part more inward and spiritual, hence "My assembly"?<a name=228:9></a> If it is God's assembly, is that God's rights in relation to His service and testimony in a more public way?<a name=228:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=228:11></a> I think He has rights in it; it is put in that way, He has purchased it.<a name=228:12></a> It is a peculiar expression, "purchased with the blood of his own" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>, the blood of Christ; but it has cost Him that, and He has rights in it and He implies it here.<a name=228:13></a> If He wishes to honour His Son in it, He can do that freely and He does.<a name=228:14></a> Another thing that is provisional is the house of God, the idea referring to the earth; it will not apply eternally as far as I see.<a name=228:15></a> We have the Father's house, but the house of God refers to what we get in Israel and is continued on now and will be, as Ezekiel shows, in the millennium too.<a name=228:16></a> So there are provisional ideas attaching to the assembly, that is, ideas that are not permanent, and the Lord's supper is included in these.<a name=228:17></a> I think it is worth while viewing the matter in this way, so that we may have suitable thoughts as we eat the Lord's supper, that a wider circle is involved, not called into activity, but about to be, and intelligence enables us to act rightly in each position.<a name=228:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=229:3></a> It does, that is how it stands, I think.<a name=229:4></a> That is why I selected this epistle for it affords more light, I think, as to the assembly and the use made of it divinely than any other.<a name=229:5></a> The more one looks into it the more remarkable are the number of references to it, not only the word 'assembly', but the body of Christ and the temple of God; and indeed it is in that verse called "the Christ", meaning it is an anointed vessel here, as He was for God.<a name=229:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=229:14></a> I only mentioned it there just now because of the question of the Lord using it coming up, how it is used, that that is one of the uses made of it, He sings in the assembly; but in itself that leads us on to the final thought in the assembly, that is not a provisional thing, it is what we shall enjoy finally.<a name=229:15></a>

		My remarks at this time will be in relation to brethren, that is, brethren, as I hope to show, whom Christ can own as His.<a name=255:1></a> I am the more encouraged to turn to this subject as being in this city in which as the Lord graciously revived the truth, specially emphasising the blessed relations of brethren, the enemy sought to discredit the thought, not to set aside the use of the designation 'brethren', but to set aside and nullify what it really means.<a name=255:2></a> Disloyalty to Christ has sprung up, and disloyalty to Christ is utterly incompatible with the idea of the brethren of Christ.<a name=255:3></a> No one who is disloyal to Christ has any right morally to take the title of being one of the brethren of Christ.<a name=255:4></a> The brethren of Christ normally are the friends of Christ.<a name=255:5></a> There is what indeed is called "the brotherhood", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:17">1 Peter  2:17</a> which is a thought which holds and binds us together in relation to any particular emergency in regard to the truth.<a name=255:6></a> So I think it opportune to bring this subject up here, that is, that what the enemy sought to set aside, and did to a very great extent by imitation, should stand out with peculiar lustre in this city, and in this section of the country too, that the term of family relationship should retain its original value as in the divine vocabulary.<a name=255:7></a> It had become dreadfully desecrated and hackneyed so as to be well-nigh lost where once it had its place; and, as with all other divine terms, the Lord would reinstate it in our souls, that it should shine in our relations with one another, and more particularly as representative of Christ in a family sense, that is, Christ seen in us in that relation, so that He is not ashamed in this regard to own all of us.<a name=255:8></a>

		it now as in its setting in Europe, how the idea is put down by the Spirit in this particular verse after the great victory achieved at Philippi.<a name=256:1></a> The martyrs, the witnesses of Christ, having been let go from the prison, came, we are told, to Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they exhorted them and departed; that is, the position is to be held by the brethren, and hence the exhortation.<a name=256:2></a> Now I have linked this verse on with those two in the seventh chapter so as to touch on the type, the great typical teaching on this subject in the book of Genesis.<a name=256:3></a> Joseph was made known to his brethren <i>the second time</i>.<a name=256:4></a> I want you to note that, and to proceed to note certain points in Genesis which are essential to our understanding the position, how it is that it was the second time, and not the first.<a name=256:5></a> They were known to him on the first visit, as on the second, but he was not known to them.<a name=256:6></a> Secondly, Joseph's kindred, or family, was made known to Pharaoh.<a name=256:7></a> Now it is in these first and second visits that the instruction largely lies, the instruction by which we reach the true thought of brethren of Christ.<a name=256:8></a> Whatever they pleaded the antecedent conditions had been, there was a murderous condition in ten of them, but true brotherly state in one of them; that is, the element was there in one of them, and in that sense in all of them, in one amongst them, an important point, dear brethren, as regards this in our local settings.<a name=256:9></a> How much value attaches to one maintaining the right thought, whatever may be the crisis involved!<a name=256:10></a> Crises mark the history of the saints, and in every one something is stressed; and if one in any given place is true to the issue, victory will follow.<a name=256:11></a> Some may be lost, but there will be victory in the issue, if the truth involved is maintained; there is overcoming, there is victory, so that the history of crises is the history of victories for the saints, one after another.<a name=256:12></a> I suppose no annals in heaven are more interesting than the annals of the

		So the first and second visits to Egypt to Joseph are the crucial ones, and I hope the Lord will help everyone to hear, and help me to speak rightly on this point, because whatever may have been the antecedents in our histories, the idea now is to become really brethren, really so.<a name=257:15></a> Joseph's literal brethren had that status, of course, as the sons of his father, twelve brethren, sons of one father.<a name=257:16></a> This is what they assert, but the profession was void of the real thought in the ten, and it is so today, and it may be so with us even here to some extent.<a name=257:17></a> We want the real thing, dear brethren, and heaven is looking for the real thing, and all that the Lord is doing for us

		The Lord seems to be stressing in the ministry that we have from time to time the believer's household; and in one meeting after another, through one speaker after another, this subject is put forward; and it would appear that the saints are absorbing the truth.<a name=271:2></a> In view of this, and in spite of it, I have ventured to read these verses, knowing that I am in the current for the moment.<a name=271:3></a> To keep in the current is an important matter in serving the saints, the current in which God is manifestly making Himself felt.<a name=271:4></a> It makes it somewhat easier in ministry to take up what is thus already on the mind of the brethren; the ground is already covered.<a name=271:5></a> And yet, however much may be said on a specific line of truth, if the Spirit is operating we never seem to exhaust it; there is no such thought as exhausting divine subjects.<a name=271:6></a>

		You will pardon my making these remarks in a preparatory way.<a name=272:1></a> We feel we are in waters to swim in in dealing with the things of God in this light.<a name=272:2></a> I have selected this chapter because it contains the household in a threefold way, the believer's household.<a name=272:3></a> Abinadab's is the first household mentioned.<a name=272:4></a> His household is mentioned at a much earlier date, in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7">1 Samuel  7</a>.<a name=272:5></a> It is mentioned there as on the hill, evidently a household of some distinction in its day.<a name=272:6></a> It is introduced thus as distinguished from other houses; it was upon the hill.<a name=272:7></a>

		The ark of God having just returned from Philistine territory and custody, indeed captivity, I should say, is brought to this house on the hill.<a name=272:8></a> As the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim took the ark and brought it up this hill, we can understand that they thought they were doing something above the ordinary.<a name=272:9></a> I suppose with every sect in christendom -- and there are a great many -- in its inception the leaders of them always assume they are doing something out of the ordinary.<a name=272:10></a> The formation of sects in christendom is an interesting study; each would take on this character, these features of being distinguished and of being out of the ordinary.<a name=272:11></a>

		Abinadab is not said to have been a Levite; he did not have that distinction; and if one takes on something for which he is not divinely qualified, then you may be sure that he will lose what distinction he seemed to have, because the work of God is to be performed by qualified persons; God is extremely particular.<a name=272:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak of difficult or perilous times, as spoken of in the first scripture read.<a name=284:1></a> These times have arrived.<a name=284:2></a> It says in the New Translation, "Difficult times shall be there" (verse 1), meaning that they shall be manifestly present at a given time.<a name=284:3></a> Prophetic announcements involve at some time or another their fulfilment.<a name=284:4></a> Fulfilment of a prophetic announcement is very real when it comes about, and so the word here is, "shall be there".<a name=284:5></a> We may say now, They are here.<a name=284:6></a> They are marked by conditions in the world that are in great measure the occasion of the difficulty.<a name=284:7></a> Within living memory, of some of us at least, general economic, business, and domestic conditions have taken on extraordinary changes and have occasioned, and do occasion, largely what is referred to here.<a name=284:8></a> The word here means 'difficult' rather than 'perilous'.<a name=284:9></a> Christians in employment in the world are exposed to demands upon them that they cannot conscientiously comply with.<a name=284:10></a> Conditions have arisen through the wise of this world scheming as to how to fortify men and women against conditions from which they suffer, by such things as trade unionism and insurance, different societies and associations too, other than trade unionism.<a name=284:11></a> These largely enter into the make-up of the difficult times that are not <i>to be</i> but <i>are</i> now, and are increasing.<a name=284:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Instruction as to how these difficult conditions or times are to be met is obviously of the greatest importance; and God has provided us with this instruction, which calls for uprightness and integrity in His people; for aside from uprightness and integrity, spiritual instruction cannot avail of much.<a name=284:13></a> Integrity is essential in dealing with the public situation at the

		<a name=285>[Page 285]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		present time.<a name=285:1></a> These difficult times are not peculiar to any country.<a name=285:2></a> They are now universal, for innovations such as I have referred to are spread abroad from christian lands into heathen lands; christians are beset with them wherever they go.<a name=285:3></a> Young people do well to face the matter and see whether the way is possible, for there is a way.<a name=285:4></a> God has foreseen conditions; they have not taken Him by surprise, nor is He legislating in view of them now.<a name=285:5></a> He has provided what is needed in the way of instruction, and He would have us to be learners so that we may find the way through with a good conscience; that is, not only a <i>good</i> conscience but a conscience enlightened by the truth and maintained good by one's attitude and conduct; for a bad conscience means a weak christian.<a name=285:6></a> He must keep on the breastplate of righteousness, or he will fall down under the onslaughts of the enemy.<a name=285:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this chapter in 2 Timothy is devoted to this subject, and I read it because of that and to point out the divisions of the chapter.<a name=285:8></a> Attention is called to the evil difficulties of the moment, the concrete effects of the evil that is at work; for evil underlies the difficult times in which the enemy has his part, but in which leading men of this world have their part, too.<a name=285:9></a> First, attention is called to the generality of the people and what marks them in the list of things given.<a name=285:10></a> "For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane, without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good, traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; having a form of piety but denying the power of it" (verses 2 - 5).<a name=285:11></a> That is a generality and includes old and young; not necessarily the leaders yet but the generality of the people; and obviously a list is given so that the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=286>[Page 286]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		saints will not be in that list.<a name=286:1></a> We have a list of our own, and what is especially to be noted is what men <i>love</i>.<a name=286:2></a> First, they love self.<a name=286:3></a> They are marked by self-love, which is very common amongst young people, evidenced in the use of the mirror and the brush and other such things.<a name=286:4></a> And then, as you will observe, "lovers of money", another feature that strikingly marks young people; not to hoard it, but because of what it brings.<a name=286:5></a> Money as it comes into the hands of young people usually leaves them quickly because of what it brings; they are not hoarders.<a name=286:6></a> And then we find that there are those who are not lovers of what is good.<a name=286:7></a> I am calling attention to the use of the word 'love', not only as to persons but as to <i>things</i>.<a name=286:8></a> There are those who are not lovers of good.<a name=286:9></a> And then we have lovers of pleasure and non-lovers of God.<a name=286:10></a> So we have quite a list of persons and things coming under this word 'love', either in the positive or the negative sense; particularly the last reference, "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God".<a name=286:11></a> This is the list the Spirit of God gives immediately in calling attention to the difficult times that come and that we have to meet with day in and day out in our affairs, and the list is given obviously that each christian should challenge himself so that he should not be in this list.<a name=286:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, secondly, in this list or classification of people, we have leading men.<a name=286:13></a> "For of these are they who are getting into houses, and leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various lusts, always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (verses 6,7).<a name=286:14></a> And we complete the type of the opposition with, "Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth" (verse 8).<a name=286:15></a> These are of the class, I think, already called into account.<a name=286:16></a> They would be outstanding persons of this class.<a name=286:17></a> They resist the truth by imitation.<a name=286:18></a> That is number two;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=287>[Page 287]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the second feature of the difficult times is that in this class of people we have outstanding ones who resist the truth according to a very old model, an Egyptian model; showing that whilst modernism enters keenly into the constitution of the difficult times, old or ancient evils find a counterpart in this condition.<a name=287:1></a> Jannes and Jambres are not found by name before this.<a name=287:2></a> We are not told earlier of them by name, and that in itself is a significant matter because when we have names they are apt to be fixed more in our minds, and we are to find them in their own place.<a name=287:3></a> In the Old Testament, they are found in the book of Exodus; not by name, but by their character.<a name=287:4></a> The Spirit of God is pleased to give us their names now, for surely He would remind us of the cumulative character of sin and that men did learn to sin in ancient times as they have learned to sin now.<a name=287:5></a> There are, as I said before, innovations; but at the same time sin is lawlessness.<a name=287:6></a> One of the definitions of it in Scripture is 'lawlessness'; not as in the Authorised Version, "transgression of the law"; it is <i>lawlessness</i>.<a name=287:7></a> That is what sin is, and these two men were outstanding sinners of that kind because they had to do with the power of God in Moses and Aaron in a most striking manner, and they resisted it.<a name=287:8></a> They resisted it in the most lawless way by imitation, for it was manifestly the power of God, and they sought to set it aside by imitation.<a name=287:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing is the remedy, how to meet all this, and that is the first thing that the apostle would bring forward after having said, "But they shall not advance farther" (verse 9).<a name=287:10></a> It is a most comforting word that great as their power is and intensive as their operations are, there is a point beyond which they cannot go: "but they shall not advance farther".<a name=287:11></a> It is not by an act of arbitrary power on God's side, but by exposure.<a name=287:12></a> They are exposed, dear brethren.<a name=287:13></a> "For their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became".<a name=287:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=288>[Page 288]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The exposure in Egypt was effective.<a name=288:1></a> It was manifest that they acted under the enemy's power.<a name=288:2></a> They were controlled and energised by Satan in opposition to what God was doing by those two great servants in Egypt, that is, Moses and Aaron.<a name=288:3></a> Their folly was manifest to all, the apostle says of Jannes and Jambres.<a name=288:4></a> Everyone here would say, I should like to be in that; I should like to have to do with that which exposed this imitation.<a name=288:5></a> Well, it is not simply a matter of special ability.<a name=288:6></a> Every upright christian, every christian of integrity, is called into this service to expose imitation; that is, if I am real, I expose imitation, hence the importance of reality.<a name=288:7></a> The reality of the power operating under Moses and Aaron exposed the imitation under Jannes and Jambres, and so today.<a name=288:8></a> Only reality will expose imitation, hence the call for genuineness in us, for reality in us.<a name=288:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, as I said, there is the remedy.<a name=288:10></a> The apostle says, "But <i>thou</i> hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, long suffering, love, endurance, persecutions, sufferings: what sufferings happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured; and the Lord delivered me out of all" (verses 10,11).<a name=288:11></a> We may not see all of this, but there is something of it.<a name=288:12></a> If God has not raised up personality amongst us, there are no models; but if God has raised up personality after Christ, there are models among us to some extent.<a name=288:13></a> Paul calls attention to himself, not that he had any pleasure in it, not that he wished to bring himself forward.<a name=288:14></a> It is the Spirit of God.<a name=288:15></a> There is no one more suitable to bring forward as a model in his day than himself; and hence he is brought forward and to the young man to whom he is now writing about this.<a name=288:16></a> And so I would appeal to the young here: Keep your eyes on the man of God, that is, in whatever measure there are men of God.<a name=288:17></a> As a matter of
	</div>

		<a name=289>[Page 289]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		fact, Timothy is the only man in the New Testament called a "man of God", a very striking thing; hence, it is within the range of every young man and young woman here.<a name=289:1></a> He was a <i>young</i> man, and he is called "man of God".<a name=289:2></a> He was himself a model.<a name=289:3></a> The apostle Paul himself sent him to Corinth to be a model, but here Paul is calling attention to himself.<a name=289:4></a> Timothy, he says, You know me.<a name=289:5></a> It is an immense advantage that there was such a man as Paul in Timothy's day, and Timothy availed himself of the advantage.<a name=289:6></a> That is the point, dear brethren, especially as to the young people.<a name=289:7></a> Avail yourself of whatever there is; if God has put any man of God near you, pay attention to him.<a name=289:8></a> Notice him.<a name=289:9></a> Not that I would make any partisan feeling or set anyone up as a perfect model -- not at all!<a name=289:10></a> But this idea of a model is one of the leading things in Scripture, and Paul brings himself forward here and uses a list of things as over against the list I have spoken of in the early part of the chapter.<a name=289:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then he says further to him what one is to do.<a name=289:12></a> "But <i>thou</i>, abide in those things which thou hast learned, and of which thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation" (verses 14,15).<a name=289:13></a> What a word that is to all young people here!<a name=289:14></a> Pardon me for referring to young people, but there are parents here sitting by, as it should be in meetings like this; the children and parents are to be together as much as possible.<a name=289:15></a> And the parents know as they are sitting there what these young ones need.<a name=289:16></a> "From a child" -- think of that!<a name=289:17></a> One loves to see the children sitting around in these meetings.<a name=289:18></a> "From a child thou hast known the sacred letters".<a name=289:19></a> We learn earlier that faith had come through his grandmother and his mother.<a name=289:20></a> You must not forget the grandmothers and grandfathers, and we must

		Well now, I go on to Daniel to show how building follows on this.<a name=291:15></a> All I had in mind in reading the verse read was the last clause -- "The street and the moat shall be built again, even in troublous times".<a name=291:16></a> I appeal not now to the very young but to those who are active in service; not indeed, that every one is not to be a builder, for love builds up, we are told; that is, love will do something in the way of building.<a name=291:17></a> But this remarkable vision or prophecy is really an answer to a man praying.<a name=291:18></a> It is one of the most remarkable prophecies that you can get, and it is such a prophecy that is within the range of everybody who prays.<a name=291:19></a> Daniel gets this word from God through Gabriel because he prayed.<a name=291:20></a> He tells us,

		These scriptures are read this evening because they teach us as to the divine way.<a name=354:1></a> First as to those who, as called by grace and affected by grace, are regarded as in that way in measure, but not wholly, the voice is from behind, "This is the way".<a name=354:2></a> Then an example of one in Apollos who is in like manner partially in the way, not wholly, but ready for adjustment, a man who having received light was accurate, not slovenly, in his use of the Scriptures or in dealing with divine things; he was an accurate man.<a name=354:3></a> And then thirdly one, in like manner an example, who was ready for light and help and received light and help and followed Jesus in the way, that is, one ready for leadership, but leadership in the way, as in much else, of course.<a name=354:4></a>

		Now it will be observed that this section in Isaiah begins with verse 18, "And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he lift himself up, that he may have mercy upon you; for Jehovah is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.<a name=354:5></a> For the people shall dwell in Zion, at Jerusalem".<a name=354:6></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#30:18">Isaiah  30:18</a>,19.<a name=354:7></a> So that this instruction in the verse read is in relation to the outshining of grace.<a name=354:8></a> We shall not be amenable to adjustment and leadership according to God save as we are genuinely affected by grace.<a name=354:9></a> Some have come into the way ostensibly, unaffected genuinely by grace.<a name=354:10></a> They become hard in the way, difficult to help, and they grow up, if young, in households, without learning spiritually.<a name=354:11></a> If heads of houses, whilst they may have the Scriptures, pursue regularly what others do, through being unaffected by grace and as wanting in spiritual instinct which goes with the teaching of

		Now an illustration of this we have in "Abinadab on the hill" <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:1">1 Samuel  7:1</a>, a significant phrase to add to his name, him into whose hands the ark was committed, the most precious possible thing to have in one's house.<a name=355:9></a> "The time was long" <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:2">1 Samuel  7:2</a> in his house symbolically.<a name=355:10></a> The children coming in, growing up in that house of Abinadab on the hill would surely come under the teaching involved in the ark.<a name=355:11></a> So many thoughts converge on it that every time one looked upon it or thought upon it a divine thought would come into one's mind, were one spiritual.<a name=355:12></a> And yet after many years when the ark was to be moved from that house it was placed on a new cart and the two sons of Abinadab, or grandsons, for the time was long, drove the cart.<a name=355:13></a> Where was the teaching?<a name=355:14></a> Where was the influence of grace operative, that in all these years that family had not learned what was proper to the ark?<a name=355:15></a> Does it not suggest, dear brethren, what is current often, that we have the external form of things, even the reading of the Scriptures with our family, attending all the meetings, pursuing all that is current and led by spiritual men and yet be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I proceed to Acts, a title that is to be observed as to this book in Scripture, meaning that things were done.<a name=357:16></a> Some of us lately were engaged a little with a word by Peter in his first address at Jerusalem, how he called attention to the prophet Joel, the coming in of the Spirit, how sons and daughters of the people should prophesy, not become prophets and prophetesses, but prophesy.<a name=357:17></a> How young men should see visions, not of course be visionaries which is a word which carries further

	<div class="paragraph">
		than what is meant here, that they should really as of old see visions, such as Paul saw, for instance, at Corinth; the Lord appeared to him in a vision.<a name=358:1></a> The thing was operative; there was such a thing as that, and men dreaming dreams and menservants and maidservants prophesying.<a name=358:2></a> Some of us were speaking about this and it is characteristic of the Acts.<a name=358:3></a> The very title, it seems to me, is divinely chosen although not formally so, as I understand, but it means a book of doings, a book in which we hear that things were done.<a name=358:4></a> And that is, dear brethren, what I believe is important, that God is looking for things to be done.<a name=358:5></a> I believe the force of that well-known expression in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>is that Christ as operating is in our hearts, dwells in our hearts by faith.<a name=358:6></a> "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:17">Ephesians  3:17</a> -- the Christ, the One who does things, and I believe that is what governs this remarkable book from which I have read, and it really implies the divine way.<a name=358:7></a> It is more what was done in a concrete way than what was required to be done.<a name=358:8></a> The apostles, of course, form the teaching governing it, but it is more what is done than what is required to be done, as if God would show with pleasure the effect of His own work in His people.<a name=358:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so this remarkable man, Apollos, is representative of an independent work of God, not indeed that this word is to be understood as different or antagonistic to anything else; it is that God was working in Alexandria in relation to partial light, that is, the baptism of John, for God follows light, however partial it may be.<a name=358:10></a> There is much said about light; it is one of the most remarkable terms in the scripture, as to the qualifying words especially, as the apostle Paul uses it.<a name=358:11></a> I believe in this very scripture in Isaiah it says that the sun will be sevenfold brighter and the moon too will become brighter.<a name=358:12></a> But then we have corresponding gradations in the other direction

		and the baptism of John did not afford the clear shining from heaven that belongs to christianity, but it was nevertheless light, and there are myriads of our brethren with whom God is working, but His Spirit is greatly hampered because of the imperfection of the light that is shining, the imperfection of the truth presented to them.<a name=359:1></a> But this man was not the only one of the kind.<a name=359:2></a> We have others in the next chapter, who, although at Ephesus, were in like manner the subjects of the work of God in relation to the baptism of John.<a name=359:3></a> But this man Apollos is exceptional in the sense of being endowed with great powers, eloquence.<a name=359:4></a> He had evidently a mind for accuracy, most important, and I refer to him in the course of my remarks because of the need of being adjusted in every respect so that the work of God may not be hampered in any of us personally or in those whom we may touch or influence.<a name=359:5></a> If it is imperfect in me I shall certainly damage, to that extent, those whom I may touch or influence.<a name=359:6></a> Happily there were two persons in the audience listening to this man who knew the way of God.<a name=359:7></a> Thank God for that!<a name=359:8></a> The Lord speaks significantly about "two of you", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a> and surely Aquila and Priscilla, though husband and wife, came under that head.<a name=359:9></a> How happy indeed if a husband and wife can be so classified.<a name=359:10></a> They are two, of course, although one in the inscrutableness of union God has set in the human race, but they were two of the assembly, these two persons.<a name=359:11></a> The mention of them in the Scriptures is equal, one before the other, three times the one and three times the other mentioned first, as if God would indicate how pleased He is with two persons who think aright, who think together, who are united in the testimony.<a name=359:12></a> And how He would use them.<a name=359:13></a> They were in this audience in the synagogue at Ephesus.<a name=359:14></a> One can understand how Aquila would look at Priscilla: That is good what that man is saying, but again he

		would shake his head and say, That is not quite right.<a name=360:1></a> And so Priscilla would respond with equal intelligence and feeling, and hence they are both ready to serve this remarkable man, and surely, dear brethren, that is an important thing to be ready to observe the imperfections in persons in whom God is working, to observe the imperfections, and feel them and see that the persons are not damaged by them.<a name=360:2></a> Imperfections are standing in the way of the work of God and yet we can see that he is a subject in a remarkable way of the work of God, and such a man as is greatly needed in the testimony.<a name=360:3></a> We cannot afford to allow him to be damaged.<a name=360:4></a> We cannot afford to allow him to proceed with his service without seeking in the way of grace, in the way of God, to help him.<a name=360:5></a> And they would look at each other and would say, See how accurately that man quotes from Moses, see how accurately he quotes from the prophets.<a name=360:6></a> Being Spirit-taught man and woman they would observe how he could quote Scripture and with what force, for he mightily convinced the Jews; he was effective so far.<a name=360:7></a>

		And hence as he finished, one can visualise the position, dear brethren, how these two dear people would get near to him and speak to him, recognising with feeling the work of God so far in him, but it says, they took him to them.<a name=360:8></a> I suppose they had a dwelling, they lodged in some house in Ephesus.<a name=360:9></a> I suppose they would invite him to their dwelling-place, their lodging; they would not challenge him in public before his listeners.<a name=360:10></a> They would take him, perhaps quietly, aside to their lodging and would with divine grace and feeling raise the question with this dear man and say, Now you see you said so-and-so, while you were speaking.<a name=360:11></a> We greatly enjoyed what you said and we can see that God greatly helped you, but you said so-and-so and you know, dear brother, that is not just right.<a name=360:12></a> Apollos would

		The object in reading these scriptures is to bring out how the will of God and the service of God may be carried on in spite of the most difficult circumstances in which the Lord's people may be found.<a name=390:1></a> In 2 Timothy we are told from the outset the difficult character of our days.<a name=390:2></a> "Difficult times shall be there", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:1">2 Timothy  3:1</a> not 'are here', but "shall be there", and they have come, so difficult that many hesitate to go on on account of them.<a name=390:3></a> Whereas these scriptures among others show that this attitude should never, and must never, be taken up by us.<a name=390:4></a> Not only the will of God, in the ordinary sense of the word, but the service of God must be carried on.<a name=390:5></a> Of course the service is included in His will, but the expression 'will of God' may be used, and rightly used, as less extensive than the service of God.<a name=390:6></a> The will of God is made much of by itself: "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:17">1 John  2:17</a>.<a name=390:7></a> Can we assume that there are those who will abide for ever who do not in a practical sense do the will of God?<a name=390:8></a> It would be very precarious to labour under such an assumption.<a name=390:9></a> Normally a christian seeks, yea loves, the will of God.<a name=390:10></a> As he develops in the truth he discovers the difficulties, not only externally, but internally.<a name=390:11></a> Many suffer from the latter more than the former, and hence the necessity for that wonderful analysis of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, so that we may see how our internal difficulties are dealt with by God so that they should not hinder us in our progress.<a name=390:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we master the analysis of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>(not only the verbal description of it, but what corresponds

		with it inwardly) we say with thanksgiving, "<i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law".<a name=391:1></a> That is the point reached; and no one is worthy of the name of christian who has not reached that point.<a name=391:2></a> "<i>I myself</i>" -- a peculiarly individual experience.<a name=391:3></a> It is a resolve as before God, having mastery over the mind, that great faculty which God has given to us, and the resolve is to use it for the doing of the will of God, the serving of God's law, whatever that may be.<a name=391:4></a> Thus one sets out on his career as a christian in the full sense of the word; he is in accord with Christ, who said that He delighted in the law of God -- <i>delighted</i> in it: it was in His heart.<a name=391:5></a> And so one proceeds; it is not an irksome path, if you delight in it; there is nothing irksome in what you delight in.<a name=391:6></a> And all the divine Persons are available to help, so that there can be no slackening or complaint.<a name=391:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, further, the renewal of the mind; it is kept fresh.<a name=391:8></a> So that the path, the outlook, is inviting as thus viewed, and we prove that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<a name=391:9></a> There is nothing at all in these statements to discourage, but all is inviting, normally.<a name=391:10></a> So that the believer's path shines, as we read in Proverbs, more and more "until the day be fully come".<a name=391:11></a> <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:18">Proverbs  4:18</a>.<a name=391:12></a> It is not far off.<a name=391:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a most attractive path, that is the path of the will of God.<a name=391:14></a> Nothing really, dear brethren, is more to be coveted than the sense of being pleasing to God.<a name=391:15></a> We can understand that such a path as is indicated in Romans would not entail impossibilities.<a name=391:16></a> Our scriptures show that the will of God may be carried through in the midst of the greatest difficulties, what the Spirit of God speaks of as "difficult times shall be there".<a name=391:17></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:1">2 Timothy  3:1</a>.<a name=391:18></a> We say, Difficult times are here.<a name=391:19></a> There never was a day, I believe, of more difficult circumstances than ours.<a name=391:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, in Ezekiel we get what God is to one in the path of His will -- "a little sanctuary".<a name=391:21></a> God can be

	<div class="paragraph">
		that.<a name=392:1></a> A big sanctuary too, of course, but He comes down to what is common with us, our littleness.<a name=392:2></a> We constantly hear such expressions, sometimes perhaps not too sincere; but however little we may regard ourselves to be, God says, I can be just as little.<a name=392:3></a> The power of compression in divine Persons is one of the most interesting things in Scripture.<a name=392:4></a> Time would fail to enter into that subject, but the ark of the covenant suffices to remind us of the power of compression in divine Persons.<a name=392:5></a> One would hesitate to use the language of Christ, that the Spirit uses in the psalms as to Him.<a name=392:6></a> They are written for us, for the spiritual mind to feed upon, and no one can really be little according to the will of God save as nourished by that food.<a name=392:7></a> As one of the greatest servants, Paul, said: "Less than the least of all saints".<a name=392:8></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>.<a name=392:9></a> I confess I can hardly understand Paul saying that, nor do I profess to understand the Lord Jesus saying prophetically in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:6">Psalm  22:6</a>, "I am a worm, and no man".<a name=392:10></a> I speak with the greatest reverence in quoting that passage, but think of Him saying that, think of the power of compression to feel such smallness and yet God over all abstractly!<a name=392:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that this passage in Ezekiel is intelligible, as God says, "Yet will I be to them", those who were scattered abroad in all countries, "as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come".<a name=392:12></a> The suggestion is most touching, as indicating what God can be to us.<a name=392:13></a> Time would fail, again I say, to touch on what God can be to His people, whether individual saints or many together.<a name=392:14></a> It is a great thing to have in mind day by day what God can be and proposes to be and promises to be to His people, and this is one of the most interesting touches, that He can be "a little sanctuary" to us.<a name=392:15></a> How many of God's people are scattered and have no thought of a sanctuary at all, perhaps excusing themselves that they are too far away from the meeting places of the saints
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=393>[Page 393]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		where God is worshipped, and they content themselves in distance.<a name=393:1></a> But God says, I will be something to you if you cannot get to where the saints are, as is contemplated here, "scattered .<a name=393:2></a>.<a name=393:3></a>.<a name=393:4></a> among the countries", away from God's sanctuary so loved by Ezekiel, and all the saints.<a name=393:5></a> God says, Wherever you are, I scattered you, I know where you are; wherever you are, I will be that, a little sanctuary.<a name=393:6></a> So that you will never fail to have means of worshipping Me.<a name=393:7></a> I can come down to your littleness and be a little sanctuary to you.<a name=393:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many other things, as I said, might be added.<a name=393:9></a> I only touch on this to show how God provides for us in the maintenance of His will and service in these difficult days in which we are, and I read in Nehemiah just to point out how this principle was realised and carried out in his day, for instance.<a name=393:10></a> In Daniel, too, it was carried out in Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, Daniel's contemporaries.<a name=393:11></a> How a saint like Daniel, separated from his people, "scattered .<a name=393:12></a>.<a name=393:13></a>.<a name=393:14></a> among the countries" as it says in Ezekiel, opens his window three times in the day, not once or twice, but three times, showing the thoroughness of the matter in his mind: "His windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime".<a name=393:15></a> <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#6:10">Daniel  6:10</a> He did the will of God.<a name=393:16></a> He served God, and we are told that he continued until the days of Cyrus, which is a suggestion of continuing for ever.<a name=393:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Daniel would suggest to us how we may go through.<a name=393:18></a> The point is to get through, not in any way, but in a divine way according to the will of God.<a name=393:19></a> So we find in the book of Ezra that they set up the altar because of the enemies; that is, the enemies afforded difficulty, great difficulty, but instead of hiding in the dens and caves of the earth as others had to do they set up the altar of God!<a name=393:20></a> You might
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=394>[Page 394]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		say that altar would not stand a cannon ball.<a name=394:1></a> Of course not.<a name=394:2></a> But faith is not reckoning on those lines at all.<a name=394:3></a> What faith is reckoning on, as the will of God is done, is the protection of God that is there.<a name=394:4></a> That is the thing.<a name=394:5></a> Let it be armies and navies unparalleled, dear brethren, the will of God is going through.<a name=394:6></a> And the example here is that in spite of the enemies, these returning saints in Ezra set up the altar.<a name=394:7></a> Where?<a name=394:8></a> Anywhere?<a name=394:9></a> No, on its base, according to the will of God.<a name=394:10></a> Not anywhere.<a name=394:11></a> They are not now scattered in the countries, they are in Jerusalem, they are where the altar base is, and the altar is to be set up.<a name=394:12></a> And that is what it is today, meaning that we sacrifice.<a name=394:13></a> The will of God requires sacrifice, and that is the idea of the altar.<a name=394:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then they proceed to carry out the requirements of the months of the ecclesiastical year, the spiritual year, for that goes with the will of God.<a name=394:15></a> Not the lunar or ordinary conditions here, but the spiritual year.<a name=394:16></a> That belongs to God; He has His own year, and they betake themselves to <i>that</i> year, and they hold the feast, the set feast of the Lord.<a name=394:17></a> They might have said, The time is not yet for these things, we have not got a house, the house is not yet built, or even the foundations of it laid.<a name=394:18></a> But the altar is there, the sacrifice is there, the hearts of the saints are manifestly in the thing.<a name=394:19></a> And hence the feast of tabernacles is held.<a name=394:20></a> The feast of tabernacles means, among many other things, that we love one another, we want to be near each other, in our houses, wherever we may be.<a name=394:21></a> Distance is abhorrent to love.<a name=394:22></a> The feast of tabernacles affords the opportunity for the exercise of love.<a name=394:23></a> And they had that feast, and all that entered into that feast, and the sacrifices; and the new moons, too.<a name=394:24></a> The new moon is not determined by man or his laws down here; it comes round in its time; as the sun rises, so the new moon comes in its time.<a name=394:25></a>

		<a name=395>[Page 395]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, further, the building of the wall was another matter of great importance.<a name=395:1></a> The angel Gabriel tells Daniel that at a certain time in seventy weeks the street of the city and the moat or trench (or whatever it was that protected the city -- possibly something more suitable for protection than a wall) should be built again, "even in troublous times".<a name=395:2></a> <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#9:25">Daniel  9:25</a>.<a name=395:3></a> In troublous times.<a name=395:4></a> We discern what these things mean, dear brethren, as we are in the circumstances ourselves.<a name=395:5></a> How much have I built in troublous times?<a name=395:6></a> How often one might excuse oneself and say things are so difficult with me.<a name=395:7></a> God says the defence of Jerusalem, the moat or whatever it was, and the street of the city would be built in troublous times.<a name=395:8></a> The thing must be done.<a name=395:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Nehemiah has his part in all this, in the days when they had a sword and the implement for building at the same time, the enemy ridiculing them, ready to pounce on them at any moment without notice, but the building went on and went on, and it was completed!<a name=395:10></a> It was a question of the will of God, whatever the difficulties.<a name=395:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then as to the passage read in Nehemiah I also wanted to point out the importance of brethren fulfilling the will of God and maintaining spiritual cheerfulness.<a name=395:12></a> Continual depression is no testimony to God.<a name=395:13></a> And so the ministry of the word is another thing that comes into these meetings that we have in different parts of the world.<a name=395:14></a> These meetings are seen in principle in this chapter.<a name=395:15></a> Ezra is the leading brother, and there are a certain number of brothers on his right hand and on his left hand.<a name=395:16></a> He is supported, which is a very important matter in these meetings.<a name=395:17></a> They are not a one-man affair.<a name=395:18></a> God is pleased to give a lead, and He is also pleased to give support.<a name=395:19></a> So you have two groups of brothers supporting the minister, supporting Ezra.<a name=395:20></a> And then the governor himself, Nehemiah, is joining in, not assuming

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is what we get here.<a name=396:3></a> We read in verse 9 that Nehemiah and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites, said unto all the people, "This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep".<a name=396:4></a> And it goes on to say, "For the joy of the Lord is your strength".<a name=396:5></a> This is an important passage for holy convocations such as the present.<a name=396:6></a> It is not a time for depression or sadness.<a name=396:7></a> There are times for these things.<a name=396:8></a> There is a time for everything.<a name=396:9></a> But what is in mind now is the positive side of our position, what God affords us in the way of <i>joy</i>.<a name=396:10></a> He says, <i>I</i> am full of joy.<a name=396:11></a> "The joy of the Lord is your strength".<a name=396:12></a> See what He does for us!<a name=396:13></a> He imparts that spirit to furnish us inwardly, to strengthen us and fit us to face the chilly blast of the north wind.<a name=396:14></a> We need it.<a name=396:15></a> It is not simply that we get instruction in these meetings.<a name=396:16></a> The point is that they are holy convocations in which God has pleasure and He imparts His own joy, the positive side of our position.<a name=396:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were speaking recently about the silver trumpets in Numbers, how certain alarm blasts were to move the camps forward towards the east and the south; that is the positive side of things, the bright, cheerful, expectant side of things.<a name=396:18></a> Why should we not revel in it; God would have it so.<a name=396:19></a> God disengages Himself in these meetings to have part with us in joy.<a name=396:20></a> He loves His people; He loves them near Him and has positive joy in them, and He says, I want you to be in this.<a name=396:21></a> And that is what Ezra preached in <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#8">Nehemiah  8</a>.<a name=396:22></a> They were weeping and mourning, but it was not the time for it.<a name=396:23></a> There was positive blessing, and they needed to be furnished to go out into the chilly atmosphere.<a name=396:24></a> The passage goes on to say, "So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.<a name=396:25></a> And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them" (verses 11,12).<a name=396:26></a>

		They were positively enjoying the thing -- God Himself embracing the occasion and imparting His own joy in His people to them!<a name=397:1></a> And the day was holy; there was no lightness, no natural lightness, which often marks these occasions, but <i>holiness</i>.<a name=397:2></a> These occasions are <i>holy</i>, and light talking and jesting are not convenient, to say the least.<a name=397:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, this important occasion in <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#8">Nehemiah  8</a>might be called a Bible reading; that is what it was.<a name=397:4></a> Ezra read aloud, supported by other brethren, and they all heard; the Levites and Nehemiah, the governor, coming into it to enjoin the people to be heartily glad.<a name=397:5></a> These are positive things.<a name=397:6></a> The blast of the trumpets in the wilderness says, Move towards the east; that is hope, that is joy, the prospect of the coming in of God.<a name=397:7></a> And presently in that movement room is made for the tabernacle.<a name=397:8></a> And what does it mean?<a name=397:9></a> It means that there are conditions for God.<a name=397:10></a> That is not in weeping and sadness, but in gladness, in the hope of His coming and all that is involved in that.<a name=397:11></a> God says, I can come in there, it suits Me.<a name=397:12></a> And hence the next movement brings the sanctuary.<a name=397:13></a> So that we have God's dwelling place in the sanctuary, where He is approached under these circumstances.<a name=397:14></a> It is a question of the testimony moving out and the saints moving out in a positive way towards the east and towards the south, enjoying God's gladness of heart in His people.<a name=397:15></a>

		THE ASSEMBLY BROUGHT TO CHRIST BY THE SPIRIT

		J.T.<a name=400:1></a> I was thinking of this chapter as setting out the assembly, and also the Father's thought for the Son.<a name=400:2></a> At the outset it was said that it was not good that Man should be alone; there was no family as yet in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, but the counterpart was of Adam.<a name=400:3></a> And here you get the family link: the wife for Isaac was to be of the family related to Abraham and Isaac.<a name=400:4></a> As it says in verse 4, "Thou shalt go to my land and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac".<a name=400:5></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:4">Genesis  24:4</a>.<a name=400:6></a> So that we are at a high level.<a name=400:7></a> It seems to be greatly fitting the day, the first day of the week, for the Father is brought into it.<a name=400:8></a> He raised Christ on that day by His glory.<a name=400:9></a> It says, "By the glory of the Father", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>.<a name=400:10></a> It would go further than by His power.<a name=400:11></a> His affections were in connection with it, and the assembly undoubtedly was in mind.<a name=400:12></a> So that it is not only that she is of that family, but she has the graces proper to the assembly, answering to what the servant understood was needed.<a name=400:13></a> So that it is said of him that he was astonished.<a name=400:14></a> "And the man was astonished at her" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:21">Genesis  24:21</a> -- astonished at <i>her</i>.<a name=400:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the chapter is full of worship on the servant's part.<a name=400:16></a> And I thought we might look at the closing paragraphs as showing the culmination of what is in mind in the chapter, that the assembly is led into a place, not her own properly, but which she is to grace in testimony, that is Sarah's tent.<a name=400:17></a> The word in verse 67, as no doubt most of us are aware, is 'led'; "Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent".<a name=400:18></a> As there, she becomes his wife.<a name=400:19></a> She is there in that position; she is there to be loved by Isaac, pointing

		And it was further thought that we might notice Laban as an outstanding figure in the chapter.<a name=401:2></a> He is mentioned before his father in verse 50, and he is mentioned before his mother in verse 55.<a name=401:3></a> We may notice him in view of after-history and in view of such limitations as one such as he might impose on the progress of the saints, of the assembly.<a name=401:4></a> Because, although discerning the movement which came about as of God, he would have detained Rebecca.<a name=401:5></a> He and her mother say, "Let the maiden abide with us some days, or say ten; after that she shall go" (verse 55).<a name=401:6></a> I thought that perhaps we might be helped in seeing what marks Laban as definitely the leading personage in the house, which would be irregular, as the father is still there.<a name=401:7></a> Laban would have detained Rebecca.<a name=401:8></a> Are we conscious of anything of that character in regard to the movements of the Spirit of God in view of the assembly today?<a name=401:9></a>

		First, the enquiry of the Pharisees and the answer which the Lord gave them need special attention.<a name=426:6></a> He spoke to them in testimony, not in any way answering their curiosity.<a name=426:7></a> It does not say He answered their questions, but that He "answered them".<a name=426:8></a> They wanted to know when the kingdom of God should come.<a name=426:9></a> Many such questions are found in the Scriptures which the Lord never answers directly; He answers the questioners.<a name=426:10></a> And these questioners here were Pharisees, they were those who were professedly opposed to Christ, but some were ready to listen, even as it is today.<a name=426:11></a> There are many who at heart are opposed to Christ, but who, at times, are ready to give an ear, not as having any sense of need, but in a certain patronising kind of way.<a name=426:12></a> There may be some of this kind of person here.<a name=426:13></a> You would perhaps be more interested if I unfolded prophecy and indicated something of current events.<a name=426:14></a> You might be more interested in that than in a gospel address.<a name=426:15></a> So

		And so the Lord leaves the Pharisees and turns to the disciples to tell them of future things.<a name=427:8></a> I hope to dwell on this, not in any way to gratify any natural curiosity as to prophetic matters, but to speak about the solemn fact that there is a future thing which is very imminent and which is spoken of here as "the days of the Son of Man".<a name=427:9></a> The kingdom of God is a <i>present</i> fact; its presence then depended upon the presence of the Lord Jesus amongst men.<a name=427:10></a> It was there because <i>He</i> was in their midst and it is a present thing now because the Spirit of God is here.<a name=427:11></a> When the Lord comes in in judgment by and by it will be the days of the Son of Man.<a name=427:12></a> He will then be on His Own throne and it will be retribution and judgment; now it is grace, and that is why I read that query of the Pharisees, so that we might all understand what the Lord's reply really means.<a name=427:13></a>

		The time is very short, for the Spirit will not always plead, but He is here tonight in the character of the kingdom of God, which is said to be "in the midst of you".<a name=430:1></a> Peter said of the Lord Jesus, "Who went through all quarters doing good, and healing all that were under the power of the devil, because God was with him", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>.<a name=430:2></a> And again Paul says, "How that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:19">2 Corinthians  5:19</a>.<a name=430:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=438:2></a> A simple thought is in mind but one of great importance if there is to be unity, especially unity in the ministry which the Lord gives.<a name=438:3></a> The thought is that those who minister are seen as learning together from Christ, coming under His sway and influence together.<a name=438:4></a> First in Mark, which is the Gospel for ministers particularly, we are told that the Lord went up into the mountain and called "whom he himself would, and they went to him.<a name=438:5></a> And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach, and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out demons".<a name=438:6></a> The great general thought in mind is there, the Lord's sovereign selection, but made as on the mountain, that is in moral elevation.<a name=438:7></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>the command is given as He was assembled with them, pointing to the need of the Spirit, as He says, "Being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which [said he] ye have heard of me.<a name=438:8></a> For John indeed baptised with water, but <i>ye</i> shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days", implying in a moral way that their service was to be in the power of the Spirit, not in natural power.<a name=438:9></a>

		Then in Samuel, in the well-known passage read, the Lord is seen in type in presidency, seen as presiding over the prophets, not instructing them, but prophesying is actually going on, and the effect is to overcome all opposition to Himself in type, that is, all opposition to David is overcome by the sight of this service carried on and the power of it.<a name=438:10></a> Saul
