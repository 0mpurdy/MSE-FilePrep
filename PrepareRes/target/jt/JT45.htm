	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> What is in mind for today and tomorrow, if the Lord permit, is the subject of bondmen, to be worked out, as the Lord may help, from the position He took Himself, which indeed is exemplified in what we had yesterday afternoon, <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=1:3></a> We may see that the features of the truth in the book of Revelation stand connected with the thought of bondmen.<a name=1:4></a> The thought runs through the book and has a great application now, as indeed always, but particularly now, in view of the end.<a name=1:5></a> It is necessary to accept the moral import of bondmanship if we are to understand the mind of God as applicable to the end.<a name=1:6></a> Even the angel who is used to convey the Apocalypse to John is himself a bondman, as he says at the end, according to chapter 22: 9.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The verses read in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13">Mark  13</a>enter peculiarly into the subject before us, for the mediatorial economy is in mind in the Lord's remarks, by which He shows that even matters at the end, in relation to His coming, are in the exclusive knowledge of the Father, the Son eliminating Himself from that knowledge.<a name=1:8></a> Our Lord's remarks are only intelligible as we understand the mediatorial economy into which the Lord has come, even to the extent of taking a bondman's form.<a name=1:9></a> It is His having taken a bondman's form which explains His word that even the Son does not know.<a name=1:10></a> He likens Himself, as will be observed, to a man going out of his own country; "having left his house and given to his bondmen the authority, and to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch".<a name=1:11></a> Then, the closing

		solemn remarks are, "Watch therefore, for ye do not know when the master of the house comes: evening, or midnight, or cockcrow, or morning; lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.<a name=2:1></a> But what I say to you, I say to all.<a name=2:2></a> Watch".<a name=2:3></a> The mediatorial economy is really in mind, and our position in it; for we also are placed in a mediatorial position and service as bondmen receiving the authority.<a name=2:4></a> Those who are in the attitude of bondmen receive the authority; the Lord gave them the authority, but the great stress is laid on <i>watching</i>.<a name=2:5></a>

		H.B.<a name=2:6></a> Will you make it clear what you have in mind regarding the mediatorial economy?<a name=2:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> That into which the Deity has come, as over against that which relates to absolute Deity, which is exclusive and beyond us, which no man has seen, nor can see.<a name=2:9></a> The Son here, one of the divine Persons, became incarnate -- to carry out the divine will and purpose, to make known what God is in a moral sense, so that we have the Father and the Son and the Spirit -- we cannot reverse that order.<a name=2:10></a> The Son and the Spirit have taken relatively lower positions, but yet each acting as God; and the mediatorial thought is carried down to the bondmen who have the authority.<a name=2:11></a> So that it is an order of things that is brought near to us, in which we <i>are</i> indeed; for as soon as one is secured through the gospel, one is taken into the administrative side of the position, and, in that sense, is in a mediatorial position.<a name=2:12></a> You have, for instance, in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:41">Matthew  10:41</a> the mediatorial idea coming down to a disciple -- "He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.<a name=2:13></a> And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward".<a name=2:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:1></a> Is the thought of bondmen worked out in us largely in our attitude of mind?<a name=3:2></a> I am thinking of <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>, "Let this mind be in you .<a name=3:3></a>.<a name=3:4></a>.<a name=3:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> That is so.<a name=3:7></a> I thought we might see how the Lord has led in that way, as indeed in everything, and we learn from Him, so that, as you say, it is a question of attitude of mind.<a name=3:8></a> The types, of course, come in and enlarge on this matter -- the well-known one in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21">Exodus  21</a>, for instance, the Hebrew bondman.<a name=3:9></a> The position in Exodus is the result of God coming in, but through a mediator.<a name=3:10></a> The principle of approach is that God is to be served in sonship -- "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (chapter 4: 23); and then, in chapter 21, we have the Son, in type in the Hebrew bondman, taking a bondman's form.<a name=3:11></a> The Lord is thus alluded to in the type, as becoming incarnate, and in love deliberately deciding to remain in that relation; He loves His Master and His wife and His children, so that it is a matter of His own volition, and it is a matter of love, and of love serving; going to the very lowest position to serve.<a name=3:12></a> The whole divine system is pervaded by love, by love that will serve one another and serve God.<a name=3:13></a> Then the teaching proceeds in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>and 29, and shows that the service is in priesthood; these chapters stipulate what is required by God in His service and stress the priest -- "that he may serve me as priest", and not only Aaron, but also his sons, "that they may serve me as priests".<a name=3:14></a> We see thus, that while sonship is the basis of the service, and bondmanship the full testimony of love (for it implies that the bondman went into death to establish the matter, it is a system in which bondmanship prevails, love actuating it, so that love will go to any length to serve), yet God's stipulation requires that there must be also intelligence and holiness, and hence the priesthood in chapters 28 and 29.<a name=3:15></a> I think all that enters into the book of Revelation.<a name=3:16></a>

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T-y.<a name=4:1></a> Would you say the bearing of that comes out in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#15">Deuteronomy  15</a>, where Moses speaks of the bondman <i>and the bondmaid</i> professing to love.<a name=4:2></a> They do not go out, their ear is pierced, so that they bear lasting evidence of true bondmanship?<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:4></a> That helps as bringing the bondmaid into the position, that is the feminine side.<a name=4:5></a> The chapter contemplates a brother or sister being released through the liberality which marks sonship.<a name=4:6></a> Bondmanship implies subjection, and then love carrying you beyond what is obligatory; you go beyond what might be demanded, you go the whole road.<a name=4:7></a> That was Christ's attitude; He said, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life" -- it was His own thought to go that way, it was the power of love in Him.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:9></a> Would verse 16 of <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#15">Deuteronomy  15</a>show that?<a name=4:10></a> The bondman says, "I will not go away from thee -- because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee".<a name=4:11></a> It is the attraction of love that makes him the bondman.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> Exactly; what love is as active here in Christ, or in the saints -- the length to which it will go.<a name=4:14></a> John's epistle develops it as worked out in the saints.<a name=4:15></a> The mediatorial system, as inclusive of all who are thus actuated by love, I think is to be understood.<a name=4:16></a> It is important that it should be understood that as we are secured through love's appeal in the gospel, and the appeal that comes to us on account of the great sacrifice of love in Christ, so that one says, He "loved me, and gave himself for me", we recognise that we are taken into the divine mediatorial and administrative system.<a name=4:17></a> So the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>immediately becomes a vessel -- not that the Lord sent her, but she becomes a vessel in her own mind and carries the thought on.<a name=4:18></a> "If thou knewest the gift of God", the Lord says, "and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and

		he would have given thee living water", that is, He was administrating.<a name=5:1></a> The verses at the end of chapter 3 state that "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" -- love underlies it all.<a name=5:2></a> The woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>takes on the work, in so far as she can, and carries the truth to others; the administration is ever widening, so that the Samaritans learn the Lord as the Saviour of the world, through that administrative act of hers.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:4></a> Referring to Peter as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, would he come into the mediatorial system you are speaking of as a result of the action of the Lord?<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> He would have "part" with Christ.<a name=5:7></a> The Lord makes much in that section of whomsoever He sends -- anyone receiving whomsoever He sends receives Him.<a name=5:8></a> It is the apostolic line, for the idea is a <i>sent</i> one.<a name=5:9></a> Peter as restored, fully set up in love, comes into the administrative side finally in chapter 21.<a name=5:10></a> The test was, "Lovest thou me?<a name=5:11></a>" -- the Lord accepted finally that he did love Him, it came to light, it was manifest in him.<a name=5:12></a> The word used in the last reference meaning objective knowledge, meant, that the Lord could now see that love for Him was there, it was manifest.<a name=5:13></a> That is the thought; if love be there, the administrative representative side is there; the Lord committed the care of His lambs and sheep to Peter.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.C.<a name=5:15></a> Is the apostolic side seen in the beginning of <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#12">Mark  12</a>?<a name=5:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:17></a> Bond-service is there, conveying representation.<a name=5:18></a> Verse 2 says, a bondman was sent by the owner of the vineyard to the husbandmen; and again he sent another (verse 4); and again another (verse 5).<a name=5:19></a> What underlies bondmanship is love.<a name=5:20></a> One of the best examples of it is in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, where the bondmen are employed to clothe the prodigal in his heavenly attire.<a name=5:21></a> There is no rivalry, they are doing it happily.<a name=5:22></a>

		E.G.<a name=6:1></a> Is the thought seen in the letter to Philemon?<a name=6:2></a> Paul says of Onesimus, "whom <i>I</i> was desirous of keeping with myself, that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings".<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:4></a> Well, exactly.<a name=6:5></a> He became attached to Paul through the gospel, he was his child through the gospel, and he had desired to retain him for service, but crediting Philemon with his service.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:7></a> The apostle, in the epistle to the Romans, speaks of himself as a bondman and then he speaks of the fact that he served God in his spirit; would that mean that his service as a bondman was carried out not in a legal fashion, but under the influence of divine love?<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:9></a> Yes.<a name=6:10></a> His very being was in it, he served God in his <i>spirit</i>.<a name=6:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.G.<a name=6:12></a> Does that show that without love I am of no use in the economy?<a name=6:13></a> The <i>word</i> bondman might be used.<a name=6:14></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>the Lord speaks of His bondmen; but they are corrupted by Jezebel's evil teaching.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:16></a> Well, they would still be bondmen; an unconverted man might be used.<a name=6:17></a> I think the Lord alludes to Judas in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>-- "He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me"; that is, Judas's words were undoubtedly used and he was representative of Christ, too, in his apostleship, but he was a lost man, and I have no doubt that what the Lord meant in alluding to him, as He does in verse 20, would cover the truth as it has come down to us.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may have come through unconverted men, but it is not invalidated by that; it stands, the representation of Christ holds throughout the dispensation, although much may have come to us through men whom we could hardly say were characteristically bondmen.<a name=6:19></a> We may say that what has come down to us came down by the Spirit, which is true, but it has come down also through men, of whom some

		Ques.<a name=7:2></a> Are you referring now to the preservation of the Holy Scriptures, and such like?<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:4></a> Yes, all that is under Christ; and in the service He used what was available, that is, the best there was.<a name=7:5></a> You see throughout Scripture that God carries on, but sometimes with very poor instruments.<a name=7:6></a> He used an ass, for instance, and other such instrumentalities; so that we cannot be exclusive in what we say of what the Lord may use.<a name=7:7></a> Our concern now is what is <i>characteristic</i> of the economy, that love is the great thought underlying it all, and it is a proved love.<a name=7:8></a> So that, as we have often remarked, Peter in his replies, appeals first to the Lord's conscious knowledge, that is, what He had divinely, He knew everything.<a name=7:9></a> "Thou knowest all things", he says; but what is in the Lord's mind or thoughts may not be unfolded to us.<a name=7:10></a> In verse 17 Peter uses the word for objective knowledge, saying, "thou knowest that I am attached to thee" -- then it is an attested love.<a name=7:11></a> John's gospel makes much of the attestation of things, even as to the water and the blood that flowed from the side of Jesus, the one who writes, witnessed the blood, and his witness is true.<a name=7:12></a> Then, in his epistle, he speaks of the threefold witness, the Spirit and the water and the blood.<a name=7:13></a> So that what is in the economy into which we are brought is not a concealed matter, it is an attested matter, and you want to be of it characteristically, so that you can say, like Peter, "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee".<a name=7:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.W.<a name=7:15></a>R.<a name=7:16></a> Would that be seen in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1">Philippians  1</a>, where the apostle speaks of some who preached Christ out of envy, but others of love, and the apostle rejoiced that the gospel was preached?<a name=7:17></a>

		characteristically, but still the apostle rejoiced that the gospel was preached.<a name=8:1></a> What a difference in those who preached out of love to support what the apostle was standing for!<a name=8:2></a> He was stressing that his position in prison was representative; it was manifest in all the praetorium and to all others that his bonds were in Christ, that is, he is representative in the position.<a name=8:3></a> We do not want to be in any position that is not representative of God and of Christ.<a name=8:4></a> If one is under discipline he is not representative of the economy, he is in prison under penalty; he has sinned and is falsifying the economy.<a name=8:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:8></a> Yes, He was representative personally.<a name=8:9></a> It is a very important matter now we are in the last days, whether there is any representation of the dispensation, of the administrative system which is in the hands of Christ.<a name=8:10></a>

		H.C.<a name=8:11></a> Paul says, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, that he had declared to them the whole counsel of God, but then he says, "these hands have ministered .<a name=8:12></a>.<a name=8:13></a>.<a name=8:14></a>"; and then he says, "I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring we ought to come in aid of the weak".<a name=8:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=8:16></a> In connection with what you are saying, is it not significant that the case of the Hebrew bondman follows immediately on the giving of the law?<a name=8:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:18></a> Yes, showing that love would fulfil the law.<a name=8:19></a> Jehovah unfolding His rights in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>speaks of the "thousands of them that love me" -- not that <i>should</i> love, but that <i>do</i> -- He knew them.<a name=8:20></a> We are not told who they were, but we have the great example in the Hebrew bondman.<a name=8:21></a> He says, "I love" -- "I love my master".<a name=8:22></a> He is the first one in Scripture who says, I love.<a name=8:23></a> That is the basis of all that follows.<a name=8:24></a> One said to the Lord, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<a name=8:25></a> Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:9></a> Well, she is a type of the assembly, of course -- the feminine side.<a name=9:10></a> It is well to keep that in mind, for Scripture develops masculine love and feminine love -- in a spiritual way, I mean; love takes these two forms.<a name=9:11></a> The feminine, of course, is in the assembly; the masculine flows out from God to Christ, that is the supreme thought.<a name=9:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=9:15></a> Quite so.<a name=9:16></a> She was really a slave, a captive maid, but she was full of right feeling.<a name=9:17></a> "Oh, would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria!<a name=9:18></a> then he would cure him of his leprosy", <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#5:3">2 Kings  5:3</a>.<a name=9:19></a> That is the thought, she is administrating the truth really, showing how the thing is brought down to the least; so Paul says, the least in the assembly may carry on judicial service amongst the brethren.<a name=9:20></a>

		H.P.<a name=9:21></a>W.<a name=9:22></a> Are the features that are accredited to Philadelphia suggestive of the bondman, especially keeping the word of His patience, as being akin to watching?<a name=9:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:24></a> Yes.<a name=9:25></a> The idea of bondmanship must enter to the state indicated in Philadelphia: "thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name".<a name=9:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.G.<a name=9:27></a> The thought of watching in this is mentioned three times in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13">Mark  13</a>, the first coupled with prayer.<a name=9:28></a>

		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=10:1></a> I think we should keep that in mind, it is stressed -- "But what I say to you, I say to all.<a name=10:2></a> Watch".<a name=10:3></a> The allusion is to the strenuous conditions that would result from the Lord's leaving the disciples and shows the urgency of vigilance as attaching to bondmen.<a name=10:4></a> He gave to the bondman the authority, to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch; that is, do not let in extraneous or adverse elements; see to that, and then, "Watch therefore, for ye do not know when the master of the house comes".<a name=10:5></a> And then again, "What I say to you, I say to all, Watch".<a name=10:6></a> The demand is upon us to be vigilant, whether as regards those who come in, or as to current conditions in christendom, or in the world generally, or whether as to the Lord's coming; vigilance is urgent.<a name=10:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this leads us to the book of Revelation, and perhaps no passage confirms the idea of what we are saying as to the economy more than these verses in chapter 1; indeed I believe they allude to the verses read in Mark, in which the Lord says, that the Son does not know "of that day or of that hour".<a name=10:8></a> We have here, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him", that is, He is so representative of the economy that the revelation is <i>given</i> to Him; carrying out His thought in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:32">Mark  13:32</a>.<a name=10:9></a> He takes that attitude.<a name=10:10></a>

		H.P.<a name=10:11></a>W.<a name=10:12></a> Is it important for us to keep the two sides going on together?<a name=10:13></a> On the one hand, there is the work -- "to every man his work" -- and then the watching.<a name=10:14></a> Would that be watching the movements of the Lord, so that the work is to go on hand in hand -- the outcome of the communion of our hearts with the Lord Himself as to what He is doing?<a name=10:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=10:16></a> Yes.<a name=10:17></a> There are three main thoughts: the authority is given to the bondmen, <i>the</i> authority, that is, the whole position is worked out down here in those who have the authority; and then the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We can see thus how the principle of <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13">Mark  13</a>is stressed here, and that in these last days, when these great things that are signified by the angel to John are taking place, or about to take place, our understanding of them depends on bondmanship.<a name=14:8></a> There are those who take up Revelation and make much of the signs and symbols and compare them with current events, and all that, but it is a question of "the word of God" and bondmen taking it up, it is shown to <i>them</i>.<a name=14:9></a> The whole book is sent to the seven assemblies, through John, but the general thought is that the Apocalypse is the Apocalypse of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him, and He signified it, sending by His angel, to His bondman

		J.T.<a name=18:1></a> It may not be known to all, some not having the better translation, that the word "servants" in these verses is more properly "bondmen" -- that is why they are read.<a name=18:2></a> It is thought that we should revert to chapter 1 in order to see how the bondman who was selected by the Lord, and to whom this book is signified, speaks of God, by the Spirit.<a name=18:3></a> He writes to the seven assemblies (verse 4), "Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come"; and in verse 8 we have a further announcement: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty".<a name=18:4></a> The Lord has been helping His people in regard to God, both as to His absoluteness, which is beyond us to comprehend or even apprehend, and also particularly in His relativeness as come into revelation through the incarnation of one of the Persons of the Godhead; and it is significant that, in the introduction to this book, we should have these allusions to God, first "who is", and then "who was", and then "who is to come".<a name=18:5></a> God is thus alluded to, first, as nearly as possible for our apprehension, as to what He is absolutely -- He who <i>is</i>; then what He is historically -- He who was; and finally what He is prophetically -- He who is to come.<a name=18:6></a>

		been absorbed, there will be this more inward understanding with us as to God.<a name=19:1></a> In the book of Exodus, to which we have alluded already, we have, in Moses, a ministry corresponding somewhat with John's, that is, a ministry flowing out of the peculiar revelation made, Jehovah telling Moses to say, "I AM hath sent me"; Moses was to be representative of that, not simply of God as known historically by the fathers -- what He was, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, but of God "who is".<a name=19:2></a> He is Himself, aside from being the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<a name=19:3></a> He is greater than what is known of Him historically.<a name=19:4></a> In our giving of thanks in the assembly, as a rule, we are more conversant with the historical side, we speak of what is historical rather than of what God <i>is</i>.<a name=19:5></a> Now Moses was conversant with God as no one else was, evidenced by his writings in the Pentateuch, and in the first ascription of praise that we get (we may say the introduction of assembly service in type) (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>), we have the first mention of Jah, which is an allusion to the great name revealed to Moses, but evidently a suggestion of a special insight that Moses had spiritually as to God.<a name=19:6></a> (See foot-note in the New Translation.<a name=19:7></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought we might begin with that this time, that we may follow on in what God is doing and be equal to these great matters in the Apocalypse.<a name=19:8></a> This book is not something brought out; it is not a declaration, but a "revelation", and it contemplates we have been saying, bondmanship, but also spiritual capacity, because the Lord spoke to the overcomer in Philadelphia about <i>His</i> God, as if there would be understanding, not simply of God in a general sense, but of <i>His</i> God, that is, God known by man according to what God is.<a name=19:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=20:13></a> Well, in one sense God is always objective, but I mean the two thoughts are together.<a name=20:14></a> He is all, but in the sense of being <i>in</i> all, that is, every vessel filled.<a name=20:15></a> In the new man "Christ is everything, and in all".<a name=20:16></a> God is all as in us, the vessels are filled completely; there is no vacuum, nothing unfilled, in eternity.<a name=20:17></a> I only wanted to begin with this great thought that the brethren might have in mind in our present reading what God has been doing in helping us as to Himself, especially in regard to our worship, because (and it is a remarkable thing) this book is marked by the thought of the worship of God.<a name=20:18></a> As I said, the selected bondman addresses the assembly in this way, saying, "Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of

		J.T.<a name=33:1></a> We are all aware, no doubt, that the word "servants" in these passages is properly rendered "bondmen", and what perhaps will occupy us chiefly this morning is the <i>prophetic</i> services of the bondmen of God.<a name=33:2></a> John himself is to be viewed in this book as a prophet, styled formally bondman of Christ, but in chapter 10 he is viewed as a prophet, having prophesied, and being told that he should prophesy <i>again</i>, because of certain conditions that rose in him as the mind of God was assimilated.<a name=33:3></a> The Lord Himself is seen as speaking under the guise of an angel in verses 5 to 7; the facts presented in the chapter show it is the Lord Himself.<a name=33:4></a> As having title to all below, He puts His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the land and swears "that there should be no longer delay; but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound with the trumpet, the mystery of God also shall be completed, as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets".<a name=33:5></a> The Lord's words here direct our attention to what God has made known to His own bondmen the prophets, that is, the glad tidings, and that they, in their ministries, had spoken of the mystery of God.<a name=33:6></a> God's bondmen are taken into His thoughts, as He said, "the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets", <a href="../bible/Amos.htm#3:7">Amos  3:7</a>.<a name=33:7></a>

		Whilst special prophets are in mind here, it may be profitable to call attention to the place that the prophetic ministry is obtaining amongst the saints, and to inquire whether this scripture, indeed, the whole book of Revelation, does not enter into it, for it is a question of bondmanship in those who minister,

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=36:8></a> Well, it is a <i>little</i> book, the details of the life of Jesus will make a <i>big</i> book; John himself said that if the things which Jesus did were fully written, the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.<a name=36:9></a> The littleness of the book would imply that its contents are not for enlargement, but necessary for the testimony.<a name=36:10></a> It is the history of Europe, I believe, that is, the history of the area in which the testimony has been in this dispensation.<a name=36:11></a> It is <i>opened</i>, it is not a mystery: it is <i>known</i>, and the fact that it was to be eaten would convey that although what it conveyed was known, it was not taken to heart.<a name=36:12></a> John was now to understand that serious consequences were involved in its accomplishment.<a name=36:13></a> The history of Europe is not a mystery, although the mystery of iniquity has been developed in it, and is intelligible to the initiated, but the actual history is a small matter; things relative to the testimony directly and indirectly, enter into it, but generally it is a question of a few things -- man's will, and God does not enlarge on that too much.<a name=36:14></a> He gives us enough, however.<a name=36:15></a> The little book is, of course, more than mere history; it is the mind of God as to the history: what would be the result judicially of the history -- already known, but now to be taken to heart as to its full bearing.<a name=36:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=54:4></a> Well, that is what is in mind; but chapter 18: 20 is more specific as to greatness and spirituality, as inclusive of those who were most capable of judging, heaven itself and the saints -- which of course is a characteristic word -- and then the apostles and prophets; they have a judgment of the system -- "your judgment".<a name=54:5></a> God is honouring them as executing what they have judged, and I think the verse enters into all our disciplinary meetings -- one would make it practical -- how heaven ratifies the judgments we have reached; if it does not, they are not effective, because our judgments ought to have always a wide bearing, the full bearing of the assembly.<a name=54:6></a> The execution of divine judgment now is in the assembly, hence the importance of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>"If .<a name=54:7></a>.<a name=54:8></a>.<a name=54:9></a> he will not listen to the assembly .<a name=54:10></a>.<a name=54:11></a>.<a name=54:12></a>" it is authoritative, it is invested with the heavenly prerogative as to discipline and judgment generally.<a name=54:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=54:16></a> Yes; it is never to be <i>merely</i> local.<a name=54:17></a> So the apostle, in directing the discipline at Corinth, introduces his own spirit into the position, saying: "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this: to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus".<a name=54:18></a> The fact that the apostle's spirit is there gathered in view of the discipline, I think, calls attention to the organism in which we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object of this address is that we might be instructed as to the divine way, how each may <i>make way for God</i>: first, in regard to things that relate to himself, his own blessing; then as to public testimony, how, as engaged in that, one may make a way for God; and finally, how a believer may make way for a divine visitation and the subsequent entertainment of a divine Person, and then an entertainment of him <i>by</i> a divine Person; in other words, how we may make a way for the Lord so as to entertain Him, and that He, as a consequence may, as He loves to do, entertain a christian, as the scripture read in Revelation says, "I will .<a name=67:1></a>.<a name=67:2></a>, sup with him, and he with me".<a name=67:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first part of my subject, as I intimated, is what relates to the individual believer's blessing, how he may be established in the mind of God for him.<a name=67:4></a> So I selected Abraham, who is the characteristic believer, the father of all believers.<a name=67:5></a> He was concerned as to <i>knowing</i> how the promise of God should be fulfilled to him.<a name=67:6></a> There are many who are content with much less, very much less, than what is intimated in divine promise.<a name=67:7></a> Divine promise is the outcome, as we perhaps know, of divine purpose; that is, God can accord a promise as having purposed.<a name=67:8></a> His promise obviously will not go beyond the limits of His purpose, but it may extend to the fulness of His purpose for us, and His purpose for us is very great, I need not say; it is commensurate with Himself as having come out in Christ, so that "whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son" -- He calls him and justifies him and glorifies him.<a name=67:9></a> Thus the purpose

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of God, as I said, is commensurate, in keeping with Himself; it is worthy of God, it becomes Him.<a name=68:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then there are promises; these are all on the line of assurance; the promise and the oath (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:18">Hebrews  6:18</a>), were two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie.<a name=68:2></a> Where you have these promises and oaths and covenants, the <i>assurance</i> of the believer is in mind, and many need establishing.<a name=68:3></a> In making His promises, God undertakes to act for their fulfilment.<a name=68:4></a> It is impossible for God to lie, we are told, that is, we know what He is in a general way, but the promise and the oath are to afford us certainty, to establish us.<a name=68:5></a> Then He has to begin to work, and so you have in this chapter, for the first time, the expression, "the word of God".<a name=68:6></a> The chapter involves a vision, and I suppose if God speaks on the principle of vision to us.<a name=68:7></a> He abstracts us from what would be hindering to us in taking in the vision, and to Him in presenting what He has in mind in the vision.<a name=68:8></a> We are not accustomed to vision now, but Scripture speaks much of it.<a name=68:9></a> God speaks to man, we are told, "in a vision of the night".<a name=68:10></a> He takes account of us and knows how ordinary things interfere as He is seeking to commune with us, and so He abstracts us in His own way so as to have scope for what He has in mind to make known.<a name=68:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter, therefore, is remarkable, God is taking on Abraham to assure him that henceforth he is to be an established believer, established not only in the knowledge of God, but in the certain knowledge that God cannot lie.<a name=68:12></a> He was to be assured for a long time to come, too, four hundred and fifty years -- with us it is much longer, I need not say; I mean the fulfilment of the promise took that number of years.<a name=68:13></a> Abraham in his lifetime would always revert to this with comfort, and it is important that each of us should have some little transaction with God of this sort, beginning with the idea of His

		Abraham says, "how shall I know .<a name=69:4></a>.<a name=69:5></a>.<a name=69:6></a> ?<a name=69:7></a>" And God said to him, "Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon".<a name=69:8></a> This is Abraham's matter, it arose from Abraham's wish to know, to be assured -- hence, in this sense, it is Abraham's matter.<a name=69:9></a> It is for him to act now so as to <i>make way for God</i>; for God, in the fulfilment of His promises to us, does not only work all round us; He does work around us, but He has in mind, in working thus, to work <i>in</i> us, to get <i>in</i>.<a name=69:10></a> We are skilled in keeping Him out; able, perhaps, to tell others how God will enter into their souls for blessing, able to preach the gospel, and yet we have never made a way for Him into ourselves, and He is waiting to get in.<a name=69:11></a> He is saying to us, Unless I do, unless you make a way for Me, there is no possible confirmation for you of what I promised you; it is an inward matter, do not keep Me out.<a name=69:12></a> There are things that are impossible in this sense, morally speaking: God says, I cannot work in you unless you let Me in.<a name=69:13></a> And, in selecting female creatures, a heifer and a she-goat He would intimate that He is

		looking for a certain result here; they denote, in type, responsive affection.<a name=70:1></a> The Lord knows what you are capable of, but it is finding its outlet in other directions than towards God.<a name=70:2></a> The woman of Samaria, as we have often remarked, was a woman of great affection, and she found an outlet, a lawless outlet.<a name=70:3></a> In truth, any letting out of our affections exclusive of what is Godward, is indeed lawless, for we are to love Him with all our heart and all our strength.<a name=70:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So He prescribes three-year-old creatures.<a name=70:5></a> Abraham would have to find them, and in finding them among his cattle -- he had large flocks and herds -- he would no doubt be wondering what it all meant.<a name=70:6></a> Well, God intends to set us thinking when He purposes to do something for us, because He wants to work in us.<a name=70:7></a> He works for us outside of ourselves, but He wants to work <i>in</i> us, and He cannot really succeed in His purposes of love for us unless He is allowed to work in us.<a name=70:8></a> So there are these two female creatures, and then a ram of three years old, which involves a progenitive idea, that there is to be some result for God as an outcome of this.<a name=70:9></a> And then the birds -- they are <i>not</i> to be divided, that is, you can retain <i>whole</i> thoughts of yourself, but in a little way, in this process, the smaller the better; the whole thought must stand in all this operation.<a name=70:10></a>

		So it is now what Abraham will do; God did not tell him what to do with them, but they were for God; it became God that these sacrifices should be provided, and we may be sure that Abraham was particular as to the history of each creature, he would know its age.<a name=70:11></a> But now, having slain the creatures, he divides them, as you will observe.<a name=70:12></a> It says "he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid the half of each opposite its fellow; but the birds he did not divide", that is, the pieces of the larger creatures were matched.<a name=70:13></a> There was to be no severing of the pieces in the passover lamb, the whole

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The birds of prey came down.<a name=71:7></a> There are two sets of birds here, that is, those that Abraham provided, according to verse 9, a turtle-dove and young pigeon -- symbolic of good; but then there are other birds, birds of prey, as you will observe.<a name=71:8></a> "The birds of prey came down on the carcases; and Abram scared them away".<a name=71:9></a> These are other birds.<a name=71:10></a> We must have discernment in reading Scripture; cutting in a straight line the word of truth, not simply the Scripture, but the <i>word of truth</i>, for truth is interwoven, very intricately at times, in what is presented to us.<a name=71:11></a> Abraham sees these fowls that came down -- what is the intent?<a name=71:12></a> To spoil all that he was doing.<a name=71:13></a> I urge young people to listen to what I am saying, for, unless you come into this sort of experience in some sense, you will never he confirmed, you will never be settled or assured in divine love's provision for you.<a name=71:14></a> You have to learn to scare (the word "scare" is in the New Translation) them away; do not entertain them.<a name=71:15></a> That is the difficulty that, in your holiest, most sincere moments, and the moments in which God is set to help you, the enemy is there.<a name=71:16></a> Even in a meeting like this, Satan comes, as we have often

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I have said all that as part of what is in mind, that is, making a way for God.<a name=72:3></a> If these creatures He has directed us to bring, or to provide, are damaged by the devil or his emissaries, God is interfered with.<a name=72:4></a> So the epistle to the Romans teaches us how we are to have control of our minds; it is one of the greatest acquirements of the christian initially, to learn how to control his mind.<a name=72:5></a> "<i>I myself</i>"; not simply "<i>I</i>", but "<i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law".<a name=72:6></a> The delivered christian seen in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>has complete control so that the mind becomes servile and held for one use, namely, God's law.<a name=72:7></a> That is not the ten words simply, but God's law, whatever it be specifically.<a name=72:8></a> So, if the enemy comes -- and he does come -- and young people are hampered with him and wonder how it is, it is because we do not learn how to control our minds and use them according to their power as rightly controlled.<a name=72:9></a> Abraham scares the birds away, they are foreign, they are antagonistic.<a name=72:10></a> That being so, "it came to pass when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, that behold, there was a smoking furnace, and a flame of fire which passed between those pieces" -- that is the power of God.<a name=72:11></a> Abraham made the way for it in scaring away the enemy; so God acts to <i>confirm Abraham</i>, and the whole territory from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, is secured to the believer, to Abraham and to his seed.<a name=72:12></a> How restful he would be after that!<a name=72:13></a> He would be not only a believer, but a confirmed believer.<a name=72:14></a> "He that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God".<a name=72:15></a> That is what He is aiming at with every one of us.<a name=72:16></a> The young

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I now go on to John the baptist.<a name=73:6></a> From the believer -- for Abraham is a characteristic believer now, confirmed in the purposes of God -- I pass on to the minister, to speak of how, in our public service, we make a way for God.<a name=73:7></a> Christendom as it is has blocked the divine way; God cannot move out to the regions beyond now.<a name=73:8></a> I use the word 'cannot' in a moral sense, there are things God cannot do in that sense consistently with Himself.<a name=73:9></a> Paul says, "I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:19">Romans  15:19</a>); in doing that he made a divine way; he provided, not only a way for man, the divine way for us, "the way everlasting", but he provided a way for God.<a name=73:10></a> In the Acts, "the way" for the christian implies the fellowship, but then there is a way for God, so that God can go from city to city, town to town, and village to village, as indicated in the addresses to assemblies in Asia (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3).<a name=73:11></a> John the baptist is, I think, the great example for us in this respect; it is he that is selected by God for this service peculiarly, so that it says, in the passage from which I read in Matthew, "in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.<a name=73:12></a> For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, saying, Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths".<a name=73:13></a> He is making a way for the Lord in preaching repentance, but I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke tells us that the word of God came to him, that marks his ministry: as the word of God came to Abraham, so it did to John.<a name=74:2></a> It is a question of the mind of God, and what one would specially desire is to convey briefly an impression of John the baptist.<a name=74:3></a> I have read from Matthew, rather than any other of the gospels or from the Acts, because of the point the Lord makes, in speaking to John, about <i>righteousness</i>.<a name=74:4></a> John the evangelist presents John the baptist in the most attractive way, I think, of any of the evangelists, and that is because he so stresses John's admiration of Christ, the great estimate he had of Christ.<a name=74:5></a> I believe (if one may be allowed to speak familiarly of such a matter) that, if heaven were to catechise a prospective minister, what would be stressed would be, the minister's estimate of Christ.<a name=74:6></a> How do you regard Him?<a name=74:7></a> What is He in relation to yourself?<a name=74:8></a> Do you think yourself at all comparable with Him?<a name=74:9></a> Now I think John the evangelist is like that in regard to John the baptist; he shows how he measured up with the divine requirement.<a name=74:10></a> He is presented, as I said, as a sort of ideal for all ministers of Christ.<a name=74:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, almost as soon as the Lord is seen here as Man in John's narrative, we have John the baptist quoted as saying that He was preferred before him.<a name=74:12></a> He is urgent and energetic; he says, I want to say at once about that Man.<a name=74:13></a> He is preferred before me -- that surely is a fine thing to start with.<a name=74:14></a> No one can be of any service really in the ministry of Christ, save he learns to be a <i>second</i>; and John puts his word in at once and says, He is preferred before me.<a name=74:15></a> That matter is settled; great as I am, John says, great as other people think I am, that Man is preferred

		Well, Martha was cumbered about much serving.<a name=129:4></a> I may further say here that, in comparing the two sisters, Martha seems to have been the householder.<a name=129:5></a> We are not told the name of the village here: it is called "a certain village"; and Martha was the householder.<a name=129:6></a> She was, as it were, the leading brother in the meeting.<a name=129:7></a> She was the one that looked after things, and she would receive the Lord.<a name=129:8></a> She received Him into her house.<a name=129:9></a> Of course the leading brother will receive the Lord; but we have to bear in mind that the Lord is not here personally, so we have to receive Him through the brethren.<a name=129:10></a> Every leading brother would professedly make way for the Lord, but Martha did not treat her sister properly, nor did the treat the Lord properly, although she received Him.<a name=129:11></a> Our attitude to the Lord may be seen in the way we treat the brethren.<a name=129:12></a> She says to Him, "Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?<a name=129:13></a> bid her therefore that she help me".<a name=129:14></a> She implied that the Lord was not right; she rebuked Him.<a name=129:15></a> "Dost thou not care?<a name=129:16></a>" She is implying that <i>He</i> was negligent.<a name=129:17></a> She thought He would say, Mary, get up and do something.<a name=129:18></a> So the leading brother may be disappointed that he is not justified when the Lord comes in.<a name=129:19></a> The Lord does not come to justify <i>him</i>.<a name=129:20></a> He may bring up something that shows he is not just right; in fact, if I am expecting to be justified in anything I am sure to be disappointed.<a name=129:21></a> I knew of a brother who expected to be justified when a ministering brother, as we say, would come round, but the Lord disappointed that.<a name=129:22></a> It would do one more good to be condemned.<a name=129:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well I want to come on to John to show how the betterment came about.<a name=130:8></a> The village is never lost sight of.<a name=130:9></a> Take the city in which we are, since the time God began to work in it, it has never been lost sight of.<a name=130:10></a> God has in His mind every locality in which His people are, and He wants to improve what He has in it; not to improve the town, but to improve what is of Himself in it.<a name=130:11></a> That is always what is in God's mind.<a name=130:12></a> David is the great example of this -- he expressed to Nathan his desire to improve the divine circumstances here.<a name=130:13></a>

		The next thing I call attention to is verse 5: "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus".<a name=131:12></a> Martha is mentioned first.<a name=131:13></a> At the beginning of the chapter Mary is clearly the principal one in the Lord's mind.<a name=131:14></a> She is specially drawn attention to.<a name=131:15></a> "It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick" (verse 2).<a name=131:16></a> She has the chief place among the three.<a name=131:17></a> In the three mighty ones mentioned in connection with David, there is one that is greater than the others.<a name=131:18></a> Mary is the chief one here; you cannot alter that; but Mary is not my subject, it is Martha.<a name=131:19></a> The Lord has something in mind when He mentions Martha first.<a name=131:20></a> Mary is spiritual; she is never easily irritated.<a name=131:21></a> She is not mentioned in verse 5 except under the heading of sister.<a name=131:22></a> It is sometimes a good thing that a sister who is perhaps thought to be spiritual -- and who indeed <i>is</i> spiritual -- is not brought to notice, but Mary will not mind that, for she has plenty of capital.<a name=131:23></a> She is not petty, nor irritable because another is more noticed than she.<a name=131:24></a>
	</div>

		No one has keener feelings than the Lord, and, we are told here, He was taken up from them and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<a name=155:7></a> He would look upon them with the greatest affection, "I will not leave you orphans".<a name=155:8></a> He had said to them, and now they were for the moment left, but everyone did not go to his own home as on a certain occasion during His ministry.<a name=155:9></a> These disciples loved Jesus, their hearts had become attached to Him; the Lord could <i>see</i> they loved Him, just as He could when Peter, in his final appeal in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>, said, "Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee".<a name=155:10></a> That is, there was something the Lord could take account of with Peter, something objective which witnessed to his love.<a name=155:11></a> Let no one speak of loving Christ unless there is some sign of it that the Lord at least can see.<a name=155:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=174:13></a> Well, it points to the place that Christ had with John.<a name=174:14></a> Both statements are connected with the movements of Christ.<a name=174:15></a> What John saw, what he bore record of (verse 32), was not a movement of Christ, but a movement of the Spirit on Him.<a name=174:16></a> But the expression, "Behold the Lamb of God", is the outcome of a movement of Christ.<a name=174:17></a> First, He came to John -- "he sees Jesus coming to him" (verse 29); then secondly, (verse 36), he saw Jesus "as he walked".<a name=174:18></a> It alludes to the manner of Christ's walk, I believe.<a name=174:19></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>is in mind, Adam naming the creatures.<a name=174:20></a> He would observe the peculiar features of the sheep, or of the lamb; and I think, therefore, what is meant is that Christ is in John sacrificially.<a name=174:21></a> He is not only apprehended as a Person who was before him, but He is a sacrificial Person, as seen in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>-- over against other lambs that are mentioned.<a name=174:22></a> The word "lamb" as in Scripture is generally connected with sacrifice, as in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>.<a name=174:23></a>

		I wish to speak about guidance from heaven; it is a feature of our dispensation that light and guidance come from heaven; not from man-made dignitaries, religious dignitaries, ecclesiastical dignitaries, nor man-made councils -- guidance is from heaven.<a name=180:1></a> Many other things might be said about heaven and its prerogatives in this dispensation, but I confine myself to this one thought, that from the earliest times the heavens were indicated as the source of light and guidance.<a name=180:2></a> The sun and the moon as made were set in the heavens "for signs, and for seasons", and "to give light upon the earth" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:14">Genesis  1:14</a>, 17); the stars also, that is, all were made by God for the purpose stated, and He has never lost sight of this fact, but Christ having entered into heaven accentuates the thought.<a name=180:3></a> He has "gone into heaven, .<a name=180:4></a>.<a name=180:5></a>.<a name=180:6></a> angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:22">1 Peter  3:22</a>.<a name=180:7></a> "Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:21">Acts  3:21</a>); that is, it is a fixed state of things until a certain time.<a name=180:8></a> "Whom the heaven must receive .<a name=180:9></a>.<a name=180:10></a>.<a name=180:11></a>" That is, Christ according to divine appointment is there, and hence there is light and guidance from that point, from heaven, beyond any possibility of human interference; so that we can be quite confident as to what comes, knowing whence it comes -- that Christ is there, "received up in glory", and installed there in the place of power.<a name=180:12></a> "From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:13">Hebrews  10:13</a>.<a name=180:13></a> He is not quiescent, He is not inactive; He <i>is</i> active, indeed, much more so than we are apt to think.<a name=180:14></a> Infinite vigilance is there, the Keeper of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps!<a name=180:15></a>

		So Matthew, who particularly stresses this point of the heavens, begins early to show that they were active as Jesus was born.<a name=181:1></a> What is recorded by Luke is that, "unto you is born this day .<a name=181:2></a>.<a name=181:3></a>.<a name=181:4></a> a Saviour"; it was immediate, according to Luke, the announcement by the angel was "this day".<a name=181:5></a> But Matthew gives us a later incident, for the word should read, "Jesus having been born .<a name=181:6></a>.<a name=181:7></a>.<a name=181:8></a>" However long before is not stated, but what is stated is that the wise men found "the little child" -- not "the babe"; the sign to the shepherds was, "Ye shall find the babe", but here it is "the little child".<a name=181:9></a> That is, He has advanced in age, so that it is now a matter of history that the King has been born -- the "king of the Jews".<a name=181:10></a> It is a matter of history, but history of the greatest possible moment; nothing would be greater as an event, a birth, than the birth of the King of the Jews.<a name=181:11></a> Although gentiles, the wise men do not hesitate to refer to Him in this way; not simply as the King of mankind, but the King of the Jews -- humbly, although gentiles, respecting the divine choice.<a name=181:12></a> It is not a matter of curiosity with them, they are not sightseers, nor are they tourists fulfilling a double purpose -- seeing Jerusalem and its environments at the same time, but they come to see the King!<a name=181:13></a> Where is He?<a name=181:14></a> they say.<a name=181:15></a> They do not seek a guide to show them the sights of Jerusalem -- it is the King of the Jews they want.<a name=181:16></a> And that is all there is today, dear brethren; sights -- localities in themselves -- lose their value in the presence of the King.<a name=181:17></a> It is now a question of the King, what He will do and where He will be.<a name=181:18></a> He is not viewed as a Man -- He is "the little child".<a name=181:19></a> From the human side there is development.<a name=181:20></a> He became a Babe, and grew into manhood, which truth Luke gives in more detail.<a name=181:21></a> The sign given of old was that "a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his

		THE GLORIES OF CHRIST APPREHENDED IN ASSEMBLY SERVICE

		<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24:1">Exodus  24:1</a>, 2, 9 - 18
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=194:1></a> What is in mind is to draw attention to the greatness of the mediator, the increasing greatness of the mediator, in this book -- that is, of Moses -- seen particularly in this chapter; and the distinction made between him and all others.<a name=194:2></a> The word in verse 1 is "Go up to Jehovah".<a name=194:3></a> The others do not go up to the <i>mountain</i>.<a name=194:4></a> Verse 9 says they went up, without specifying the place, it is more the idea of ascension or elevation, but after verse 12 the mountain is mentioned frequently.<a name=194:5></a> Jehovah saying to Moses, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there".<a name=194:6></a> In the verses at the end, the mountain is spoken of a number of times as that into which Moses was called and went.<a name=194:7></a> In verse 18 it is said he "went into the midst of the cloud, and ascended the mountain.<a name=194:8></a> And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights".<a name=194:9></a>

		For general instruction it may be remarked that Exodus has the service of God in the wilderness in mind.<a name=194:10></a> The word earlier was, "ye shall serve God upon this mountain", and the message to Pharaoh was, "Let my son go, that he may serve me".<a name=194:11></a> And as in the wilderness they are at first led by Moses, but chapter 19 says <i>they</i> are moving.<a name=194:12></a> "In the third month after the departure of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai: they departed from Rephidim, and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness; and Israel encamped there before the mountain.<a name=194:13></a> And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: Ye have seen what I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This message conveyed the mind of God as to them, and then we are told later (verse 17), that "Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the foot of the mountain".<a name=195:3></a> So that God is in mind; and the mediator has led the people out of the camp to meet with Him: he is serving the people and God in that way.<a name=195:4></a> He brought them out of the camp to meet with God.<a name=195:5></a> Much intervenes before we come to this chapter 24, which is the end of a section; what follows has to do mainly with the rearing of the tabernacle, and service in an official sense; but in this chapter, while God's service is in mind, it is less official, and <i>youths</i> instead of priests are officiating; but Moses is particularly signalised.<a name=195:6></a> It is helpful in view of assembly service to see how God would make room for Christ in our service.<a name=195:7></a> He is anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows.<a name=195:8></a> We get that in the Psalms -- love active towards Him, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>; in this psalm He is greatly signalised in His personal dignity and attractiveness.<a name=195:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we may see that more scope should be given, in the service of God, to Christ personally, ascriptions of praise to Him in relation to His functions in the assembly, and the glories that attach to Him there.<a name=195:10></a> The sanctuary is provided typically -- from chapter 25 to the end -- but running through the teaching of the book of Exodus is subjugation, that being affected in us; and in that connection, recognition of the glories of Christ.<a name=195:11></a> The sanctuary is seen fully in the end of this book; as the tabernacle was set

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=196:6></a> Well, that is how the truth stands.<a name=196:7></a> The line of ascension is marked by Him, and Jehovah in speaking to Moses says in verse 1 of chapter 24, "Go up"; that is in relation to others; but as to himself only we have added, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there" (verse 12).<a name=196:8></a> It is <i>his</i> place -- Christ's place, typically -- as over against Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu and the elders.<a name=196:9></a>

		W.H.<a name=196:10></a>R.<a name=196:11></a> Who would the others who were in ascension with him signify?<a name=196:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=196:13></a> Well, Aaron is not yet constituted priest, but the order mentioned is Aaron and his two sons and the seventy elders.<a name=196:14></a> They would represent the saints, ourselves, as in the type, going up.<a name=196:15></a> That is, the service of God takes that course.<a name=196:16></a> "Go up", it says, but not to any place.<a name=196:17></a> The place is not specified, but the principle of going up to God.<a name=196:18></a> "Go up to Jehovah".<a name=196:19></a> Yet in verse 12, Jehovah says to Moses, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there".<a name=196:20></a> As to him, the mountain is specified all through from verse 12 to the end of the chapter, marking off the distinction of Moses as over against the others.<a name=196:21></a> Christ goes beyond us in the service, having a definite place above -- "and be there", Jehovah says to Moses.<a name=196:22></a> He is on our side and brings us out to meet God on our side, but He has personal distinction, which is in our view in these chapters strikingly, to call forth, I think, the affections of the saints to Christ in His varied glories, relations, and offices in the assembly; and it seems to me that the brethren are

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=197:12></a> It would be an inward movement Godward, and a corresponding outward movement or attitude.<a name=197:13></a> The word generally used in the New Testament implies prostration towards another in fondness or affection in a reverential way.<a name=197:14></a> The expression, ".<a name=197:15></a>.<a name=197:16></a>.<a name=197:17></a> worship afar off.<a name=197:18></a> And let Moses alone come near Jehovah", would of course carry with it the dispensation, but still God said that He had brought them to Himself, and the thought was to have them near to Him, as we learn elsewhere.<a name=197:19></a> But He makes the distinction here that they were to worship afar off.<a name=197:20></a> He is calling attention to Moses and his personal distinction, hence we need always to have impressed upon us Christ's dignity as standing with us.<a name=197:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=199:11></a> We begin with the Lord as He is above.<a name=199:12></a> We begin with Him there.<a name=199:13></a> And what should come before us, whether we speak of it or not, is the manner of His reception up there.<a name=199:14></a> Of course, the position is that He has been rejected <i>here</i>.<a name=199:15></a> There is no place for Him in the world, but He is accepted up there, ".<a name=199:16></a>.<a name=199:17></a>.<a name=199:18></a> received up in glory", Scripture says.<a name=199:19></a> "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=199:20></a> The Scriptures enlarge on His place above.<a name=199:21></a> We ought to begin with that; if we love Him we ought to begin with the thought of heaven's honour, the honour lavished upon Him above.<a name=199:22></a> Raised from the dead by the glory of the Father and received up in glory; glorified by the Father; all these things are facts as over against His rejection down here.<a name=199:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we are led on in that way, we move on in the service of God into the area known as the sanctuary, and the idea of going up appears.<a name=200:9></a> Moses led the people (chapter 19: 17), out of the camp to meet with God.<a name=200:10></a> They had encamped before the mountain, that was proper, but then there was a leading out of that.<a name=200:11></a> They are not led into another camp, but "to meet with God", and the upward movement of <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>shows that.<a name=200:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.I.<a name=200:13></a> If, as we have been helped in regard to the Supper, the first thing that is before us is the breaking of bread -- we should start with it -- should the place that Christ has in heaven be before us before the breaking of bread, should it be in our minds?<a name=200:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=212:2></a> The brethren will be aware that the subject of <i>spoil</i> has been proposed for the readings this season.<a name=212:3></a> It was thought that <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#30">1 Samuel  30</a>would be the most appropriate section of Scripture with which to begin -- the term, "David's spoil", being found there.<a name=212:4></a> It seems right that we should begin with that as typical of Christ's spoil.<a name=212:5></a> There are many other features of spiritual spoil that will doubtless come into view in the Lord's ordering, as found in the Scriptures, but this seems to be the most appropriate one with which to begin, as bringing the Lord before us as acquiring spoil, and that in relation to the great subject of general recovery.<a name=212:6></a> The chapter, which as a matter of history records a painful disaster for David, obviously has a wider significance, and points to the recovery in Christ of all that was lost through man's unfaithfulness.<a name=212:7></a> (David is to be viewed as an unfaithful man in the immediately preceding history, for he was actually with the enemies of God's people and ready to fight against Israel.<a name=212:8></a>) But as found on the spot where the disaster occurred, that is, Ziklag, he rises to a type of Christ as feeling things, weeping until he had no more power to weep, and also experiencing the immediate danger of being stoned.<a name=212:9></a> He went through the agony attached to the disaster, but found strength in God, so that the power of God enters into the position, and recovery is on that line.<a name=212:10></a> We have this remarkable statement in verse 20: "And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil".<a name=212:11></a> He singled out what he regarded as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=213>[Page 213]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		distinctly his spoil.<a name=213:1></a> There were other cattle there, but he singled out what was to be regarded as his spoil; so that it is very distinctive in this way and stands out for our faith to learn what is peculiarly Christ's spoil.<a name=213:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=213:3></a>M.<a name=213:4></a> Would we be warranted in speaking of David as a type of Christ on account of the agony through which he passed?<a name=213:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=213:6></a> Yes.<a name=213:7></a> It was on the spot where the disaster occurred, that David was changed.<a name=213:8></a> One can understand what heart-searching would be gone through by David, on account of his unfaithfulness being the occasion of it.<a name=213:9></a> During his absence Ziklag, which was his own territory, was destroyed, but he had been on his way to fight against the people of God, a most sorrowful thing, and only through the overruling of God was he dissuaded from that course.<a name=213:10></a> Now he is back where he should be, and we can understand how the position changes; the real David comes to light.<a name=213:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=213:12></a>M.<a name=213:13></a> Do you think that with other things the strengthening of himself in Jehovah his God was mainly the element of recovery to God?<a name=213:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=213:15></a> Yes; and he has recourse to the ephod; he goes back to the divinely appointed way of having to say to God.<a name=213:16></a> God has to be approached in His own way.<a name=213:17></a> David has recourse to that, so we have David the man of faith here.<a name=213:18></a>

		C.A.<a name=213:19></a>M.<a name=213:20></a> This is something like what Jonah went through, being a disobedient man going through the depths in his soul, but the Lord could speak of him as a type of Himself.<a name=213:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=213:22></a> Quite so; that is another good example of a man changing over from the position of an unfaithful man, or sinner, to a type of the Lord Jesus; that there is that power of changing over, is the great triumph of God.<a name=213:23></a> It is a question of what God effects in a man; so that he can change over.<a name=213:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=214:21></a> I thought that; all these items enter into the Lord's position on the cross (we may view David as a type); how divine order comes into evidence there; how thoroughly the Lord was with God in every requirement in view of His vicarious service upon which He was entering.<a name=214:22></a> The thought had been expressed at the commencement of His service -- "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:15">Matthew  3:15</a>); and at no point is the priest more apparent than in Gethsemane and on the cross.<a name=214:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=215:2></a> I think humanity is typified in the captives.<a name=215:3></a> You will observe it says, "and had taken the women captives that were in it; both great and small: they had put none to death, but had carried them off, and went on their way" (verse 2).<a name=215:4></a> And then it says, "And David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were taken captives" (verse 3); the men representing intelligence and power are not there.<a name=215:5></a> I think, therefore, it is a question of humanity; that is, from the standpoint of corruptibility.<a name=215:6></a> Humanity is exposed to being corrupted by the enemy, and so I think <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1">Romans  1</a>enters into this; in fact, Romans is the amplification of this chapter.<a name=215:7></a> Romans does not contemplate us as dead in trespasses and sins, but as alive and corrupted.<a name=215:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=215:12></a> Yes; that is the side that has to be kept in mind.<a name=215:13></a> It is the subjective side of humanity.<a name=215:14></a> The responsible, intelligent side is represented in the man.<a name=215:15></a> Paul says expressly, Adam was not in the transgression.<a name=215:16></a> The way the captives are mentioned is to bring out the subjective side; what is corruptible, and that which Satan <i>has</i> corrupted.<a name=215:17></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1">Romans  1</a>brings out the terribleness of corruption that Satan effected in humanity.<a name=215:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=260:1></a> We began the consideration of our subject, which is "Spoil", by reading <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#30">1 Samuel  30</a>, which represents in a general way the subject before us, that is, David's, or Christ's, spoil; some of it being shared with those who had befriended David in his rejection and sufferings.<a name=260:2></a> And then we looked at Abraham's spoil, as alluded to in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>, but in greater detail in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14">Genesis  14</a>.<a name=260:3></a> There we saw that the spoil was contributory to the priest, that is, Melchisedec; not now shared with those who are friendly to Christ in His rejection, but one-tenth offered to Him as Priest, involving His Person -- who He is; and allied with that, we read from Exodus about the spoil that Israel obtained from the Egyptians, demanding it from them as they went out of Egypt, which later became contributory to the tabernacle.<a name=260:4></a> All these were preliminary features belonging typically to the early history of the assembly.<a name=260:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have come to a chapter that treats of spoil obtained by conflict arising through evil alliances formed by the people of God; that is, Israel coming under the pernicious influence of the teaching of Balaam, who for reward, and at the request of the king of Moab, sought to curse Israel, but God turned it into blessing.<a name=260:6></a> Then Balaam taught Israel through Balak to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication, that is, by forming evil alliances with the world (see <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>).<a name=260:7></a> So, as we have read, the conflict between Israel and Midian arose at the direction of Jehovah.<a name=260:8></a> God would avenge Himself and would have the children of Israel avenge themselves, upon the Midianites.<a name=260:9></a> Now it is for us to arrive at an understanding of what

		<a name=261>[Page 261]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the spoil referred to here means, what its antitype is; and in doing so we should be governed in our thoughts by the preceding chapters; that is, the effort of Balaam, which is brought forward into the New Testament and seen as developed in a certain system of great antiquity in the history of Christianity; and through it real Christians have been drawn under the influence of the world.<a name=261:1></a> As the Lord forewarned: "Woe to the world because of offences!<a name=261:2></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:7">Matthew  18:7</a>.<a name=261:3></a> This system has been an offence; that is, in influencing the people of God to stumble and to affiliate themselves with the world.<a name=261:4></a> After chapter 25, where this evil was dealt with by Phinehas and by the destruction of many Israelites, God opens up the great truth of the inheritance and those who should inherit; and then the sacrifices are outlined in chapters 28 and 29, and the vow in chapter 30; and then this chapter, which is very significant as contemplating the end of the journey through the wilderness.<a name=261:5></a> At the end of this conflict Moses is about to die.<a name=261:6></a> The chapter, therefore, is to be understood in the light of the culminating history of the assembly and its results in spoil for God, for the Levites, and for the sanctuary.<a name=261:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=261:16></a> I think the richness of the chapters that intervene between chapter 25 and this one, brings out what has been recovered in the revival of the last days; that is, the thought of the inheritance in chapter 26; the daughters of Zelophehad claiming it as those who value it in chapter 27, and then in

		THE CONTINUANCE OF PROPHETIC MINISTRY

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#10:1">Revelation  10:1</a> - 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind to call attention to the <i>continuance</i> of the prophetic word.<a name=467:1></a> Prophecy is not a new thing; indeed, it is one of the oldest things, for Enoch prophesied before the deluge, and Abraham is called a prophet, Jehovah saying in relation to him, "Do my prophets no harm", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105:15">Psalm  105:15</a>.<a name=467:2></a> But they were not only prophets, they were <i>praying</i> men; they depended upon God in their service.<a name=467:3></a> However much ability a servant may have, the <i>power</i> is from God.<a name=467:4></a> The excellency of the power is to be of God, which is not simply by the gift, although the gift has power, but by <i>dependence</i> upon God.<a name=467:5></a> So that Jehovah said to Abimelech, of Abraham, "He is a prophet, and will pray for thee" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#20:7">Genesis  20:7</a>); thus we see that prophecy and prayer go together.<a name=467:6></a> Abraham <i>did</i> pray for Abimelech and God answered his prayer.<a name=467:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I have said, the prophetic word is not new; brethren are having recourse to it in a little measure, but it is not new.<a name=467:8></a> It runs down through the Old Testament, also through the New, so that the assembly itself is said to be built upon the foundation of the apostles and <i>prophets</i>; hence the greatness of the service of prophecy, and the importance of its continuance.<a name=467:9></a> The idea of its continuance is set forth in this chapter; it was said to John, "Thou must prophesy again" (verse 11).<a name=467:10></a> This was contingent, evidently, on right feelings in him; he felt the bitterness of the little book.<a name=467:11></a>

		I want to speak, just briefly, about the little opened book in the hands of the mighty angel, who undoubtedly is Christ Himself coming in at the

		end of the dispensation, placing His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the earth.<a name=468:1></a> It is said that He was "clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow upon his head, and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire" (verse 1).<a name=468:2></a> It undoubtedly alludes to a testimony to be rendered by Christ at the end of a long period, and having in mind this matter of prophecy.<a name=468:3></a> It shows how important the matter is, that there should be such an intervention of Christ in this remarkable form, the idea of prophecy being the end in mind.<a name=468:4></a> Pains are divinely taken that the mind of God should come in and should be continued.<a name=468:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord is seen, as I said, at the end of a period, for long centuries have elapsed since the testimony began at Pentecost, and the nations have asserted themselves; being set up of God to carry on for Him provisionally, they have asserted themselves and laid claim to all the earth, having divided it among themselves, whether by mutual partition, or as the spoil of war, and gradually the rights of God are excluded, as indeed they are in international matters.<a name=468:6></a> God is not taken into account to any great extent in peace treaties.<a name=468:7></a> It is a question of the power of the sword behind the peace-makers; war-makers turned into peace-makers for convenience sake.<a name=468:8></a> In international councils, God is left out; we can see it is not a question of the rights of God, but the rights of those who are victorious.<a name=468:9></a> This has gone on for centuries, and not only has the idea invaded the territorial earth, but has asserted itself in religious matters as well; for religious matters come into these peace covenants, and commerce, too; indeed, all that enters into the make-up of the world enters into such conferences.<a name=468:10></a>

		But these prophetic subjects have been discussed by persons who can hardly be said to be genuinely in the fellowship of God's Son; in this way the truth is apt to be brought down to the level of the human mind and thus its true spiritual and moral bearing becomes obscured.<a name=470:13></a> At the same time, the little book is "opened".<a name=470:14></a> We may thank God that it is open; that this prophetic matter is still open, so that anyone can see it and scan it.<a name=470:15></a> Discredit would not be placed on that, for it places all under responsibility as to it, but at the same time, it is

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord has the little open book in His hand; it is available for anyone to look at; it is not sealed like the one in chapter 5; it is open.<a name=471:3></a> There has been expository prophetic ministry, to open out the truth.<a name=471:4></a> But now the Lord is going to test everyone, and He takes up John, who is the most apt representative of the prophetic ministry; the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=471:5></a> He is called a bondman of God.<a name=471:6></a> That is one of the best titles we can get, in a moral sense.<a name=471:7></a> When people are asserting their titles, let them take account of this title, "bondman".<a name=471:8></a> The "revelation .<a name=471:9></a>.<a name=471:10></a>.<a name=471:11></a> which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen .<a name=471:12></a>.<a name=471:13></a>.<a name=471:14></a> sending by his angel, to his bondman John", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a>.<a name=471:15></a> And John testified the word of God; the things which he saw.<a name=471:16></a>

		John is thus a witness, a representative prophet, and he is taken up to show how prophetic ministry is to continue.<a name=471:17></a> It is not to continue in persons who take up the question of prophecy in a merely mental way, and make it a question of ordinary study.<a name=471:18></a> There are seminaries which use the publications of the ministry I have alluded to as textbooks, as other religious books are used for the instruction of students having clerical service in view.<a name=471:19></a> In this respect they are considered largely in a merely mental way, and the true moral and spiritual significance is lost, for it involves association with Christ, like the one hundred and forty-four thousand in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14">Revelation  14</a>, and consequent separation from the world.<a name=471:20></a> But here the Lord is testing John as to reality respecting this open book.<a name=471:21></a> Is it like a text-book to us all?<a name=471:22></a> Are not these prophetic matters real things?<a name=471:23></a> Are they not at our very doors?<a name=471:24></a> But are we ready for them?<a name=471:25></a>

		John says, "And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth as honey, sweet"; the sweetness comes first here, because it is a question of the mind of God.<a name=473:14></a> The disclosure of the mind of God must cause enjoyment to a lover of God.<a name=473:15></a> And so John says, "it was in my mouth as honey, sweet; and when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter" (verse 10).<a name=473:16></a> The Lord spoke of the bitterness first, but

		In these scriptures the assembly is viewed in its local setting.<a name=553:1></a> It has service in mind.<a name=553:2></a> We have dwelt somewhat on this subject already today, and what is in view would be said in relation to this in continuation of the subject.<a name=553:3></a> This time it is to show how the local assembly at the beginning was the mediating sphere of the operations of the Spirit.<a name=553:4></a> The Spirit, it may well be remarked (for it is important to keep it in mind), did not become incarnate.<a name=553:5></a> He remains in the divine form and essence, but in service and activity moves in relation to the incarnation, maintaining His part even actively in the Deity, acting even as God Himself, but nevertheless as coming into the economy which has been formed by divine Persons.<a name=553:6></a> The Spirit has taken the place of service; sometimes going to the most abject measure, even striving with men; indwelling believers, suffering Himself to be grieved by them, but remaining with us all the time in keeping with the economy, being sent not only by the Father, but also by the Son; the Son Himself said, "But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:7">John  16:7</a>.<a name=553:7></a> The Spirit has taken on active operation in the lowest place; yet in abstract Deity He is God, on equality with the other divine Persons.<a name=553:8></a> We have to learn to regard them abstractly, lest we should become irreverent, but in doing so we may safely pursue the language of Scripture.<a name=553:9></a> So the order in the baptismal formula is the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=553:10></a> In truth it is one name.<a name=553:11></a> The three Persons are presented

		What is before us is the operation of the Spirit in the assembly, not as forming assemblies, but as having formed them; hence there is the great urgency for suitable conditions, and I have therefore selected these scriptures.<a name=554:4></a> We see in the assembly at Antioch what was in the beginning.<a name=554:5></a> In order to be found in suitable conditions we have to go back to the beginning of Christianity.<a name=554:6></a> The Lord says, "From the beginning it was not so".<a name=554:7></a> The law governing marriages had become widely defective, but the Lord tests it by what was in the beginning.<a name=554:8></a> So in relation to what is before us these scriptures in the Acts furnish us with examples of what was in the beginning.<a name=554:9></a> I am not overlooking what was produced in the service of the twelve prior to Paul's service; the service of the twelve was productive of assembly formation, but it awaited the apostle Paul's service to develop local assemblies.<a name=554:10></a> So we have the assembly at Antioch and how it was formed.<a name=554:11></a> Paul and Barnabas served in it, as we are told, and taught a large crowd (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:26">Acts  11:26</a>).<a name=554:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=574:1></a> References to the first day of the week, outside of the gospels, are not many; this is perhaps the most significant of them, as grouping the breaking of bread and Paul's discourse in relation to it, in the presence of brethren of spiritual stature from other parts.<a name=574:2></a> Paul was about to depart; the allusion would be to the <i>finish</i> as regards that particular part, and that which he said would not only be applicable to the locality of Troas, but would have a universal bearing, because of the number of brethren there from other localities.<a name=574:3></a> So the spiritual thought seems to be prophetic, as connecting Paul's particular line of truth with the Lord's supper.<a name=574:4></a> The first day of the week is a day of liberty and privilege, rather than of authority.<a name=574:5></a> So that we do not get <i>order</i> here; it is no question of the order of the Lord's supper.<a name=574:6></a> When reference is made to the first day of the week in Corinthians the link is not with the Lord's supper, but with giving, the collection; so that it seems to suggest what is voluntary.<a name=574:7></a> The first day of the week, according to Luke and John, is a time of great activity, particularly on the Lord's part.<a name=574:8></a> We have early rising, running, and late at night, specially mentioned.<a name=574:9></a> So that the suggestion of instruction would call upon us to be active spiritually, not sluggish or lazy, not to have a holiday, or a sabbath, but great spiritual activity and alertness.<a name=574:10></a> So that I thought we might take it up in that suggestive way and seek to see the bearing of what Paul said, what is in mind for us.<a name=574:11></a> It is not a matter of specified order, for we are not told what Paul said; but we may be sure that in what he would say he would cover his doctrine.<a name=574:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=601:1></a> In linking Exodus with the epistle to the Corinthians I desire that we may see how the teaching of Exodus enters into the service of God in the assembly, for the passage in 1 Corinthians contemplates the saints together in assembly, which is the form used in verse 18.<a name=601:2></a> The immediate suggestion is that both scriptures contemplate certain instruction furnished but with more to follow.<a name=601:3></a> We are furnished with light as we need it, and as we are equal to it; and in receiving it we are to be patient and wait for the promised help, for the instruction is sure to be furnished, as in the Lord's hands.<a name=601:4></a> So that Exodus furnishes much instruction in regard to the service of God in this chapter, but there is more; we are told that "Jehovah said to Moses, Come up to me into the mountain, and be there; and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction" (verse 12).<a name=601:5></a> Then Moses makes provision as going up into the mountain for the elders to wait.<a name=601:6></a> He said, "Wait here for us, until we return to you; and behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matter, let him come before them".<a name=601:7></a> So that the position is that Israel had much instruction, and experience too, in keeping with the instruction, in regard to this matter.<a name=601:8></a> There are other matters also, besides the service of God, of course, but in regard to it, they have to wait and be patient.<a name=601:9></a> Moses is called up from them; he had plenty to represent him.<a name=601:10></a> Aaron and Hur, two men already tried in the service, associated closely with Moses; so that they are to wait.<a name=601:11></a> In like manner the ministry at Corinth was according to the state of the saints.<a name=601:12></a> The apostle could not go very far with them, while he was with them,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two chapters furnish us with the account by the Spirit of God of the first missionary enterprise of Barnabas and Saul, particularly Saul, that is Paul; and these sections are read with a view to presenting the gospel from them, but more particularly to show the results for God, and for Christ too, from this great enterprise of these two servants of God.<a name=617:1></a> It is well to bear in mind that results for God are intended in the gospel, although incidentally relief and blessing for men are also included, or the word 'gospel' would hardly fit.<a name=617:2></a> It must carry good news, and what is immediately good news to those in distress from sin, is relief, a means of relief from the distress.<a name=617:3></a> If there are those here under pressure from sin, either directly or indirectly, let it be understood by all such that the aim is that there should be relief.<a name=617:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But these chapters are exemplary as indicating that in the relief there are to be results for God, and that in the way of assembly material, assembly material set up in assembly relations, and in these relations functioning under the eye of God here.<a name=617:5></a> That is what God has in mind; that is a great moral triumph, ultimately a great and glorious triumph for eternity as we see the assembly in heavenly glory, every member of it there, every member of it in his own history having tasted the gospel as relieving him, but now in glory with all his like.<a name=617:6></a> The Lord lays the whole matter out before us in that way, and the first element brought to our attention here as the result of these labours and journeyings is an intelligent man.<a name=617:7></a> That is the first idea.<a name=617:8></a> This man is not presented to us as suffering from sin, though of course he

		was a sinner like all of us.<a name=618:1></a> He was a deputy of the island, a man of distinction politically, but he is called an intelligent man from the beginning.<a name=618:2></a> The evangelists had a good journey to take before they found anyone that could be regarded as a real case, as we say, a case of blessing; it is a good phrase.<a name=618:3></a> They had journeyed down the island of Cyprus, full of evangelical feeling, patience accompanying it.<a name=618:4></a> They did not seem to have been discouraged by the paucity of cases in their immediate efforts; indeed, we read that "they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus".<a name=618:5></a> A very unlikely case!<a name=618:6></a> Very unlikely soil!<a name=618:7></a> and it is not out of place to suggest that we are living in days in which the soil is very, very hard, and if we are susceptible to discouragement, we shall be discouraged in our evangelical efforts on account of the hardness of the soil.<a name=618:8></a> The Spirit of God, however, did not have this man in mind; he is not among those who are saved; we have to regard him among those who are lost.<a name=618:9></a> A terrible thought!<a name=618:10></a> "If our gospel be hid", says the great evangelist, "it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ .<a name=618:11></a>.<a name=618:12></a>.<a name=618:13></a> should shine unto them", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:3">2 Corinthians  4:3</a>, 4.<a name=618:14></a> A terrible thought that there are many such now!<a name=618:15></a> This man was one of them, and he was with another kind of man.<a name=618:16></a> Alas for that man, the deputy, that he should have such a companion as this!<a name=618:17></a> Companionship is used of the devil constantly to keep souls away from Christ.<a name=618:18></a> It may be that someone here has a companion, unsuspectingly, a companion that you do not think for a moment would divert you from Christ, but he may be doing it, or she may be doing it, and doing it in a pious way, for this man's name was Bar-jesus; some religious profession attached to him.<a name=618:19></a> He is a sorcerer, however, a "child of the devil", for it is

		not easy to discern at once what may be hid under such garments: it may be, as here, a qualified person, a qualified emissary of the devil, one who would hinder your soul from drawing near to the Lord, and too, hinder the Lord from getting near you.<a name=619:1></a> But it is your matter.<a name=619:2></a> If there is anyone here with such a companion in any degree, the matter is yours; the Lord is saying to you, You must get rid of that companionship or you will be blinded, as he is, or as she is.<a name=619:3></a> So the apostle spoke to him.<a name=619:4></a> His name is given to us in verse 8, "Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith".<a name=619:5></a> As I said, things may not appear on the surface, but that companion is hindering you.<a name=619:6></a> You may bring him or her to the meeting, and you hear of Christ, and after the meeting you are still the more darkened; the influence is there.<a name=619:7></a>

		Now the deputy was exercised, as we say; he sent for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.<a name=619:8></a> Bar-jesus did not suggest that to him.<a name=619:9></a> Thank God there was a power greater than Bar-jesus working with that man, as there is with everyone whom the Spirit has in His mind to secure for Christ, for the assembly.<a name=619:10></a> It is a question of the power of God, and this man was there by the side of the deputy to turn him away from the faith.<a name=619:11></a> Thank God it was clear at the outset that this was a faith matter.<a name=619:12></a> It is not a matter for mental enquiry; christianity is a faith matter or nothing, and anyone who takes it up otherwise simply whitewashes himself.<a name=619:13></a> It is a faith matter, and this distinguished man had that in mind.<a name=619:14></a> He had the idea of faith in mind, and the devil knew it.<a name=619:15></a> It is not simply, beloved friends, that we believe in the doctrine of justification by faith; that has been crystallized for three or four hundred years; it is a question of faith as the gift of God.<a name=619:16></a> The Lord in speaking to persons who gained by faith, calls it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as I said, one would appeal to young people as to their companionships; that is one point that seems to me to be urgent at this time: the use made by the devil of companions to turn away persons from the faith.<a name=620:3></a> The passage goes on to say, "Saul, who also is Paul", and let us call him Paul henceforth, for it is his name spiritually, and it is well to have the spiritual touch in the use of names in the service of God, for personality enters into this, personality in those who serve, for those who serve are to be examples of what they are saying, and that is the idea in "Saul, who also is Paul".<a name=620:4></a> His converts would notice this.<a name=620:5></a> No one is put forth more in Scripture as an example next to the Lord than this great servant, and every servant of Jesus is to be representative of Jesus, and worthy of being followed, at least, to a point.<a name=620:6></a> He will not let you follow him long if he is like Paul: we have "Paul and his company".<a name=620:7></a> You might say, 'Paul is a partisan man now'.<a name=620:8></a> Never!<a name=620:9></a> He tells the Thessalonians, "Ye became followers of us, and of the Lord".<a name=620:10></a> He soon turns us on to the Lord.<a name=620:11></a> He will do what he can for us.<a name=620:12></a> Why should not every lover of Jesus do what he can for souls?<a name=620:13></a> -- but not to make himself a party head.<a name=620:14></a> You get into excellent company, saving company, when you touch Paul and his company, and that is what you get here.<a name=620:15></a> I would advise every young one to get into that.<a name=620:16></a> You would soon find those who form this company are all set to get you into touch with Christ in an experimental way, that you may know Him as Head, as Leader, the Leader appointed of God, the appointed Leader of our salvation; that is what He is called.<a name=620:17></a> The word signifies

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=621>[Page 621]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that the Lord Jesus has gone before and He has set out the idea of salvation; then He becomes the Saviour in it, the Captain of our salvation.<a name=621:1></a> So that Paul and his company here are not to be questioned; they are over against the deputy, Sergius Paulus, and this man Bar-jesus; the latter is a bad companion, a dangerous companion.<a name=621:2></a> One, an elect one to be a participant in the blessings of the gospel; the other, a child of the devil using every possible effort to turn away the man who is seeking after the faith and the mind of God -- to turn him away from the gospel, to turn him away from the faith.<a name=621:3></a> I warn everybody here against such a companionship; even though it may not be such an one as this, there may be persons very like him, whose faces are toward the world, and they will drag you into it if they can.<a name=621:4></a> Cut that companionship at once; it stands between you and blessing; it is Satan thwarting your salvation and your blessing.<a name=621:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the apostle Paul exposes this man in the most dreadful terms -- "child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?<a name=621:6></a>" He is exposed.<a name=621:7></a> We can thank God for the exposure of such a companion.<a name=621:8></a> So here Bar-jesus is exposed and comes under the judicial dealings of God, for God is always acting judicially; day and night it is going on in our favour in order to make a way for the gospel.<a name=621:9></a> He acts judicially: He may take that friend away, or He may take you away and make you sick so as to get you away from him.<a name=621:10></a> He wants to bless your soul.<a name=621:11></a> This man is exposed and the deputy is secured, and he marvels at the teaching of the Lord.<a name=621:12></a> It is a question of teaching; and we have the kind of material that is greatly needed.<a name=621:13></a> It is the first element here.<a name=621:14></a> A man who is called an "intelligent" man is delivered from his evil companionship, he is a believer in the Lord Jesus, and he is wondering at the teaching of

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have first an intelligent man, wondering at the teaching of the Lord; secondly, believers who are said to be filled with joy; we need those, the testimony needs those.<a name=622:14></a> It is a remarkable thing how joy in heaven is linked up with conversion, with persons who repent.<a name=622:15></a> Heaven is not so doleful as some might think; heaven is very active, there is no night there, it is a place of eternal joy.<a name=622:16></a> You may say, 'Because of conditions up there' -- but it is rather because of what happens down here, what is happening down here from the east to the west all day, namely, souls repenting -- not simply once and for all, there is no such thought as that.<a name=622:17></a> The idea

		So the second part of this chapter deals with the work at Antioch in Pisidia.<a name=623:13></a> Paul is the speaker; he, like Stephen earlier, enters on the history of the testimony.<a name=623:14></a> You say, 'What is that to do with me if I am convicted of sin here tonight?<a name=623:15></a>' It has a great deal to do with you, because the testimony has had to do with persons like you from the very beginning; from Adam and Eve down to the present time, the testimony of God has had to do with persons like you -- sinners.<a name=623:16></a> Adam was one, Eve the first one.<a name=623:17></a> Let it not be forgotten by the feminine side, the woman was in the transgression by herself: Scripture

		If I come into the joy of forgiveness, I have already caused joy in heaven, but now I find my name has been known beforehand.<a name=626:1></a> I have been ordained: think of that!<a name=626:2></a> Everyone who is a christian has been ordained to this great matter, to the promise of God, purpose too: "For God so loved the world", in order to reach this "that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>.<a name=626:3></a> As soon as that "whosoever" believes, he finds out he was ordained to it; it is a double security.<a name=626:4></a> There is no question about it, and do we not need it?<a name=626:5></a> With the terrible winds blowing around the young people they need to get into their souls the fact that believers have been ordained to eternal life.<a name=626:6></a> And so, as you might expect, they were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.<a name=626:7></a> The joy is mentioned first, as if the Holy Spirit takes up His abode in a heart filled with joy.<a name=626:8></a> Why should He not?<a name=626:9></a> We talk about the Spirit almost entirely in a theoretical way, but there is such a thing as the Spirit dwelling, perfectly at home with nothing to disturb.<a name=626:10></a> The heart is made joyful by the gospel and by the knowledge of the counsels of God regarding him.<a name=626:11></a> Think of being named before the ages, before the world was!<a name=626:12></a> Let us let the thought in, for it is gospel.<a name=626:13></a> Why should it not be gospel?<a name=626:14></a> To think I have been known before and "ordained to eternal life"!<a name=626:15></a> Does it not fill the heart with joy?<a name=626:16></a> It does.<a name=626:17></a>
