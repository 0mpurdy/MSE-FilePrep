		THE MATERIAL FOR THE NEW STRUCTURE

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:1">Acts  1:1</a> - 26
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in this chapter the nature of the material the Lord had formed, and how suited it was for the new structure -- the assembly.<a name=1:2></a> Special notice should be taken of the place given to the Spirit in the Lord's charge, of the fact that He assembled with the apostles and that they as together asked of Him, and that Peter stood up <i>with</i> them for his discourse recorded in chapter 2.<a name=1:3></a> There is something for us in all this, for according to the mind of God, the end of a dispensation should conform to what was true at its beginning.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first narrative by Luke finishes with Christ carried up into heaven after blessing the disciples, and their returning to Jerusalem and attending the temple and praising and blessing God there.<a name=1:5></a> All is suggestive of the results of Christ's ministry as bringing in the priestly family.<a name=1:6></a> Luke's second narrative, the Acts of the Apostles, has in view the new structure, hence the prominent idea is <i>assembling</i> together in view of the coming of the Holy Spirit.<a name=1:7></a> The Lord's own charge to the apostles is said to be by the Spirit.<a name=1:8></a> His service in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>is not presented as being by the Holy Spirit, but as what He did Himself.<a name=1:9></a> Acts has the assembly as the new system in view.<a name=1:10></a> Everything is now provided by the Spirit, and what the disciples did in the ten days between the Lord leaving them and the Holy Spirit coming shows that they had been formed by Christ's ministry.<a name=1:11></a> Without being told to return to the city and to go to the upper room they did so, showing that they had light as to the new thing.<a name=1:12></a> The fact that we get here the mount of Olives instead of Bethany gives a clue to the heavenly connection.<a name=1:13></a> Those in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Assembled" is one of the key-words to the new dispensation, and here "assembled with them" is a most remarkable expression.<a name=2:2></a> Here in Acts it is the manner of His presence, and so He assembles with them and commands them not to depart from Jerusalem until they had received the Holy Spirit.<a name=2:3></a> It is a pattern -- a primal thought that goes right through the dispensation as a matter of light.<a name=2:4></a> It is most suggestive that the Lord takes up a relation like this, and there He commands.<a name=2:5></a> We treasure it as light in the soul, and if we are to answer to the beginning this is necessary.<a name=2:6></a> In Luke we find that the Lord left here a priestly company.<a name=2:7></a> He led them out to Bethany, which speaks of an earthly association, and there He blessed them; it was like Aaron's house being blessed (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#115">Psalm  115</a>.<a name=2:8></a>).<a name=2:9></a> They continued in the temple praising and blessing God, which was what God sought from Aaron and his family.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke's second treatise has the assembly in view and although he refers to the same things, it is in quite another way.<a name=2:11></a> The disciples, who belong to the new structure, are here charged, assembled, and commanded not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father.<a name=2:12></a> The mount of Olives in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>suggests a heavenly connection.<a name=2:13></a> When every man went to his own home, Jesus went there (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:1">John  8:1</a>), and it would seem to point to heavenly associations with the Father, "When they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives".<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the disciples are together they <i>ask</i> the Lord; they recognise the oracle, the place of divine communications.<a name=2:15></a> It is at this point that the Lord is taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight, but the two things we have been looking at remain, the Lord's administration in relation to the assembly, and our privilege of asking.<a name=2:16></a> It is a great thing to be in a place where we can ask, and although we may not always

		get <i>what</i> we ask, we get regulated.<a name=3:1></a> Here the Lord replies to their question in the negative, but a negative is very often light, and we learn that when the Father's time comes, the course of things will be resumed according to the prophecies.<a name=3:2></a> The assembly is linked up with an eternal order of things; we are, as it were, let down to earth like the sheet, but only to be drawn up again.<a name=3:3></a> The feast of Pentecost was not limited by time like the other feasts, and so we have access to what is eternal.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord is taken away, and they are seen gazing up, but they are corrected at this point.<a name=3:5></a> The cloud would indicate that they were not to look up.<a name=3:6></a> Stephen was right in looking up into heaven, for then there was no cloud; but at this point God had not given up Israel, so there was not the "clear shining" yet.<a name=3:7></a> The disciples go to the upper room, not to the temple.<a name=3:8></a> It was probably the guest-chamber where the Lord had been (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:14">Mark  14:14</a>, 15), and where He had instituted the Supper.<a name=3:9></a> They show that they are in keeping with the new thoughts.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter standing up is another evidence of the fruit of the Lord's work.<a name=3:11></a> He stands up in the <i>midst</i> of the brethren, the assembly properly, and proves that he had profited by what had gone before.<a name=3:12></a> In chapter 2 he shows that he understands further the ground on which preaching stands.<a name=3:13></a> In the first instance they are together to receive communications, and he stands up "in the midst of the brethren", but in the second he stands "with the eleven"; that is, they are on the same footing as he; they were all commissioned to preach, and it is only sent ones who can preach or teach.<a name=3:14></a> Evangelisation stands on the ground of commission, and it is for the brethren to determine whether there is a commission; they are to judge.<a name=3:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 21 we see that they deemed it an indispensable qualification that the one to be chosen in

		the place of Judas should be "of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us".<a name=4:1></a> Only such could be an adequate witness.<a name=4:2></a> It is remarkable that the Spirit tells us the number of names in the whole company residing in the upper room, which indicates His cognisance of what belongs to Christ.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter stands up in chapter 2 more as an oracle than as a servant.<a name=4:4></a> "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God"; as there is speaking for God things are clarified.<a name=4:5></a> A word from the Lord comes from one standing up "in the midst of the brethren".<a name=4:6></a> In the assembly the Lord is supreme, and the speaking is an oracle.<a name=4:7></a> The gospel preaching is supported by the sympathies of the house of God, and you may get a manifestation at the Lord's supper, which will colour not only the preaching, but will go through the week with you.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is instructive to see that the disciples appeal to the Scriptures, and that they pray.<a name=4:9></a> The Lord knew when He left them that He could safely trust them, and so He did not tell them, as He could have done, whom they should appoint in Judas's place.<a name=4:10></a> They had not the Spirit as yet, but they knew what to do in those unique circumstances.<a name=4:11></a> They were menders of nets, and what they did in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>was on the principle of repairing a rent.<a name=4:12></a> It is also a point to be noticed that they knew the brethren, those who had been in the habit of assembling with them all the time Jesus went in and out among them, and the Lord knew their hearts.<a name=4:13></a> They go through all the exercises needed in making the selections, but God decides the choice.<a name=4:14></a> It is a great thing to know the brethren, and then you know how to act under any circumstances.<a name=4:15></a>

		ADJUSTMENT TO GOD'S THOUGHTS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:1">2 Samuel  7:1</a> - 29
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> In this chapter we see the need for adjustment even in the most spiritual.<a name=5:2></a> It is easy to apply it to those who are not spiritual, but that it should be needed in the most spiritual is perhaps what we would not expect.<a name=5:3></a> There is no evidence of any naughtiness of heart in David in this connection.<a name=5:4></a> In the end of the previous chapter, referring to his dancing before the ark, he says to Michal, "It was before Jehovah, who chose me"; he evidently was subdued and humble in his spirit, but not withstanding all the honour put upon him and the prosperity that marked him in bringing up the ark, he needed adjustment.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:6></a> Nathan needed it also, did he not?<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:8></a> Yes; so that we see the most spiritual among the people of God need it, especially in connection with His house.<a name=5:9></a> God would remind us that all in the house must be of Himself.<a name=5:10></a> That David should consider the fact that he dwelt in a house of cedars and that the ark of God was under curtains was a very right motive and exercise.<a name=5:11></a> Nathan says to him, "Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee".<a name=5:12></a> It was right that it should be in his heart, but then whatever may be in my heart, I must think of what is in <i>God's</i> heart.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:14></a> Would God's word to Abraham earlier, "Walk before my face, and be perfect", show that in God's wisdom He anticipates that in the most spiritual there would be times of imperfection?<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:16></a> Just so; in the most spiritual.<a name=5:17></a> Even Joseph, wonderful man though he was, does not pass without a slip that needed adjustment; he would have the elder blessed, in that way denying the sovereign choice of God.<a name=5:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:3></a> It is to bring out the importance of the house, that God's mind must pervade it and that He must have the initiative as to all things concerning it.<a name=6:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:7></a> There is no doubt that the motive on the part of David was a worthy one; he had in his mind to find a habitation for God.<a name=6:8></a> It was a governing principle in his life, but this chapter is to bring out that notwithstanding all that, worthy as it was, David was short of the spirit that enters into the house of God; that he lost sight of the fact that it was a question of God's sovereignty and choice and that the thought of relationship entered into it.<a name=6:9></a> A military man was never in divine purpose, it was a son; what answers to the heart of God is sonship.<a name=6:10></a> It is the son who is to build.<a name=6:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:14></a> We must not be too quick.<a name=6:15></a> Deliberation is a great thing in the things of God.<a name=6:16></a> Of course, the Lord answered quickly in His dealings with others, but deliberation is a great principle.<a name=6:17></a> It was a great and weighty matter that David suggested to Nathan and required due consideration.<a name=6:18></a> You would have thought that Nathan would have said, Well, what about the word, "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, the place that thou, Jehovah, hast made thy dwelling, the Sanctuary, Lord, that thy hands have prepared", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:17">Exodus  15:17</a>.<a name=6:19></a>

		Ques.<a name=7:3></a> Is that why it is said regarding Solomon, "I will be his father, and he shall be my son", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#17:13">1 Chronicles  17:13</a>?<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:5></a> It is not simply David's son that builds the house.<a name=7:6></a> In both Proverbs and Ecclesiastes it is David's son -- Solomon, "son of David".<a name=7:7></a> But that is not enough for God, the point that God emphasizes is, "He shall be my son"; that is to say, he is detached wholly from David.<a name=7:8></a> So that from the very outset of Solomon's being, God, as it were, intervened.<a name=7:9></a> He sent by the hand of Nathan and called his name Jedidiah, meaning that Jehovah loved the child.<a name=7:10></a> To David he was Solomon, but to Jehovah he was Jedidiah, and this showed what he was in the mind of God.<a name=7:11></a> God adopted him because He loved him.<a name=7:12></a> Thus Solomon is not simply David's son.<a name=7:13></a> As building the house, he is God's son, and the application of that to Christ in the first chapter of Hebrews makes it all the more emphatic: "<i>I</i> will be to him for father, and <i>he</i> shall be to me for son".<a name=7:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=7:15></a>H.<a name=7:16></a> I suppose David reached that in his soul in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#72">Psalm  72</a>where he blessed "Jehovah Elohim, the God of Israel, who alone doeth wondrous things".<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:18></a> Quite; and we see the end of David's desires, for the psalm ceases with, "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended".<a name=7:19></a> He sees now in the son one who would take up the will of God; there is nothing more to desire.<a name=7:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These scriptures, as you will observe, speak of the simple thought of fruitfulness.<a name=15:1></a> God had this in His mind from the outset of His operations.<a name=15:2></a> On the third day, spoken of in the book of Genesis, we have the first reference to it.<a name=15:3></a> It is presented there as a result of certain latent qualities in the earth.<a name=15:4></a> That is, the earth had long lain in water and by the word of God emerged from the water; the allusion, doubtless, is to the judgment of God which precedes and enters into fruitfulness.<a name=15:5></a> As applied spiritually it signifies that the believer is planted in the likeness of Christ's death, planted in baptism.<a name=15:6></a> God indicating in this that there can be nothing in us for Him aside from the definite acceptance of His judgment on ourselves, but borne vicariously by the Lord Jesus.<a name=15:7></a> So that the apostle says, "We, as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:3">Romans  6:3</a>.<a name=15:8></a> We are become identified with Him in the likeness of His death, or planted, we are told, so that there should be a crop according to the mind of God, the believer taking root downwards.<a name=15:9></a> There is no suggestion of a limit to the depth of the roots.<a name=15:10></a> The deeper the roots go, the more fruitful and valuable and extensive will be the crop.<a name=15:11></a> There are grades in the roots.<a name=15:12></a> Baptism is the nominal acceptance of the death of Christ as being the penalty due to us, and involves that one is planted.<a name=15:13></a> The use of baptism abroad today, therefore, by millions of people on the earth who have no thoughts whatever of the reality of it, is a most solemn consideration, and every believer having been baptised, is under serious obligation as to what it means, and whether the acceptance of what it means marks him.<a name=15:14></a> True there is the planting, but then the planting is one

		thing, and the taking root downwards is another thing.<a name=16:1></a> The Lord, in these parables about the sower, speaks of persons having no root in themselves.<a name=16:2></a> The figure in Isaiah is taking root downward, and bearing fruit upward (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#37:31">Isaiah  37:31</a>).<a name=16:3></a> The planting is one thing, but the taking root in the energy of life is another thing, and then the depth to which the root goes is still another thing.<a name=16:4></a> There are grades.<a name=16:5></a> The Lord Jesus is said to have gone down to the lower parts of the earth.<a name=16:6></a> Who can fathom that?<a name=16:7></a> Certainly no geologist can fathom that.<a name=16:8></a> Though they do not go down very far they have a great deal to say of what they have found, but you find no reference to the great descent of Christ into the lower parts of the earth.<a name=16:9></a> The depth is beyond us, really, and the deeper we go the richer and more extensive should be the fruit.<a name=16:10></a> For instance, a man who accepts baptism generally as planted in the likeness of Christ's death is sure to take root.<a name=16:11></a> Aside from taking root there could be no crop.<a name=16:12></a> But then, the root may be little and short, so there is in that same scripture in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>the idea of our old man being crucified with Christ.<a name=16:13></a> That is a further thought which requires a deepening of the roots.<a name=16:14></a> Crucifixion is a man's death.<a name=16:15></a> It involves that I have judged the old man in which I had part.<a name=16:16></a> There is only one old man; it is the thought that involves us all -- each of us comes to a judgment of what it is -- but it involves us all; "our old man", it is said.<a name=16:17></a> That is a further extension of the root downwards; and then finally we have one who says, "I am crucified with Christ".<a name=16:18></a> When one says, "I am crucified with Christ", he is dealing with himself -- he is not dealing with others.<a name=16:19></a> His thoughts are occupied with himself, and he means to convey that he has reviewed his whole history and discovered how mean he has been, unrighteous of course, and sinful -- but also the meanness of the things he has been guilty of, the utter despicableness

		of his thoughts and attitude towards others.<a name=17:1></a> Many of us have reviewed our history in that way and have come to the necessity of crucifixion.<a name=17:2></a> The history of oneself has been viewed as so utterly bad, so mean, that nothing less than crucifixion will meet the case, and he sees that the Lord Jesus knew all that, and accepted all that, in hanging on the cross.<a name=17:3></a> His heart is drawn after Christ; it becomes entwined around Him as he thinks of the depth of suffering that He endured, that He became a curse, that He was "made sin" on the cross.<a name=17:4></a> He was made a curse -- a remarkable statement -- made sin and made a curse for us.<a name=17:5></a> One thus judged, beloved brethren, is taking root downward, and correspondingly he bears fruit upward, that is, God-ward.<a name=17:6></a> So that <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>is really a sort of answer, that we have become "dead to the law by the body of Christ, to be to another".<a name=17:7></a> And all that we are is acceptable.<a name=17:8></a> We are not going to link on with Him the meanness, the earthliness, the despicableness of our conduct.<a name=17:9></a> We are holding ourselves according to Him.<a name=17:10></a> The believer, as his root goes down, corresponds with Christ, and he would abhor the idea of linking on with Christ anything of that which took Him so low, which cost Him so much sorrow and suffering.<a name=17:11></a>

		My remarks will deal with what induces worship to God.<a name=27:1></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>the Lord, in conversing with the woman at the well, introduced the Father, saying, "The Father seeks such as his worshippers"; referring to those who worship Him "in spirit and truth".<a name=27:2></a> She had introduced the subject of worship and the Lord had seized the opportunity to say wonderful things which, ordinarily, we would hardly expect Him to say to such a one.<a name=27:3></a> But God was working in this woman and the Lord paid attention to her remarks and said things to her that we do not find Him saying to anyone else, remarks that we refer to constantly, and rightly so.<a name=27:4></a> These remarks are found in John's gospel which unfolds to us the declaration of God, that He has needs, speaking reverently, and hence the Father <i>seeks</i> worshippers.<a name=27:5></a> The quality of those who worship is in mind, for He goes on to say, "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth".<a name=27:6></a> There is no deviation from these remarks; they convey the divine standard as to worship.<a name=27:7></a>

		I want to show, first of all, that ministry induces worship.<a name=27:8></a> God approaches men in a minister; that is, in Christ, and then in ministers.<a name=27:9></a> There are two words used, one implying servile or slavish ministry -- the other official or dignified ministry.<a name=27:10></a> Normally, both are combined in every minister.<a name=27:11></a> Moses and Aaron represent the ministry in the Old Testament.<a name=27:12></a> God expended great care upon them to this end.<a name=27:13></a> Primarily, Moses possessed the light and thoughts of God, and Aaron was the speaker.<a name=27:14></a> In their first service they occasioned worship, as it says in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:31">Exodus  4:31</a>, "When they heard .<a name=27:15></a>.<a name=27:16></a>.<a name=27:17></a> they bowed their heads and worshipped".<a name=27:18></a> Thus the people met God.<a name=27:19></a>

		So that, normally, God comes into contact with us through ministry.<a name=28:1></a> The verses in chapter 12 show the power of ministry as normally exercised.<a name=28:2></a> They are the words of Moses.<a name=28:3></a> Earlier in the chapter Jehovah speaks in a great general communication of His mind in regard to the passover, the great institution that was to exercise such an influence in Israel, and in which the Lord Himself took part, as we all know.<a name=28:4></a> But the verses I have read, beloved brethren, are Moses' presentation of what Jehovah had spoken to him.<a name=28:5></a> And you will observe that there is a great abridgment of what Jehovah had spoken, and there were certain additions.<a name=28:6></a> But what I am endeavouring to say is that ministry is not only intended to refresh us, and instruct us, and edify us, but to induce worship.<a name=28:7></a> And so Moses epitomizes what Jehovah communicated to him, on the principle of brevity, for ordinarily we take in but little at a time.<a name=28:8></a> Brevity and pungency with affection behind what is said are important.<a name=28:9></a> And so you will find that the great minister Paul, we might say, constantly introduces the spirit of worship into his ministry.<a name=28:10></a> He is not so unduly occupied with the service in hand as to shut out the additional thoughts that would enter into it.<a name=28:11></a> The minister always keeps his mind free so that in his service there is the introduction of God, some recognition of God -- how great God is.<a name=28:12></a> Thus the feelings of the minister are calculated to convey the greatness of God to those ministered to: "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=28:13></a>".<a name=28:14></a> How persons would be affected were they to hear the apostle Paul preach "the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)".<a name=28:15></a> And so, in various instances, we find his feelings coming out spontaneously as he dealt with the great features of the truth.<a name=28:16></a> You can understand that those to whom he ministered would become worshippers.<a name=28:17></a>

		And so Moses, in a few words, conveys to the elders of Israel what Jehovah had said about the passover.<a name=29:4></a> And in doing so he introduced the use of the hyssop.<a name=29:5></a> You may ask Moses, Why did you bring in that idea?<a name=29:6></a> Well, it was his skill as a minister.<a name=29:7></a> Hyssop implies that if I am to be a worshipper I must be small.<a name=29:8></a> It grows out of the wall, "From the cedar tree that is on Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall" was a moral conception in the mind of Solomon.<a name=29:9></a> And Moses also introduced the thought of the bason.<a name=29:10></a> Why did he use that word?<a name=29:11></a> It is not in the general instruction he received.<a name=29:12></a> The bason was for the blood.<a name=29:13></a> It is referred to again in chapter 24 in relation to the service of God.<a name=29:14></a> Think of the precious blood of Christ, beloved brethren!<a name=29:15></a> If the blood is to be preserved in a bason, a vessel, it is to be kept in all its preciousness!<a name=29:16></a> It is that we may have a true estimate of it and of the "cup of blessing which we bless".<a name=29:17></a> The idea, thus, is carried forward into the Lord's supper; there is a vessel; there is that in which it is conserved and presented to us, out of which we drink.<a name=29:18></a> We speak of the blood much, but what about the preciousness of it?<a name=29:19></a> "Ye have been redeemed, not by corruptible things, as silver or gold .<a name=29:20></a>.<a name=29:21></a>.<a name=29:22></a> but by precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:18">1 Peter  1:18</a>.<a name=29:23></a> Think of what that life was to God!<a name=29:24></a> Was it mere human addition that Moses introduced?<a name=29:25></a> No, beloved brethren, it was a spiritual addition, a spiritual touch in ministry that the Holy Spirit promoted in the minister so as to affect the hearts of the hearers.<a name=29:26></a> And so, if I am small the blood is great.<a name=29:27></a> Well now, as I said, Moses spread out

		And now I want to show how headship in Christ induces worship.<a name=31:12></a> That is what David represents in the closing section of 1 Chronicles.<a name=31:13></a> Solomon sat on the throne before David died, but immediately before that, according to the narrative in 1 Kings, David was advanced in years and obtained no warmth.<a name=31:14></a> But in 1 Chronicles he is seen as before God, as it were, in supernatural power.<a name=31:15></a> And it is only in that power that we can be before God -- out of weakness we are made strong.<a name=31:16></a> But from Chapter 23 to the end of 1 Chronicles we are told of David's disposition of what there was in his day; and that is going on at the present time, beloved brethren.<a name=31:17></a> The Lord Jesus is making disposition of what He has.<a name=31:18></a> All are not available, but those who are available He makes disposition of, and that is headship.<a name=31:19></a> As I understand headship, as presented in David here, it is to get the most out of what there is.<a name=31:20></a> It is the very converse of one-man ministry.<a name=31:21></a> One-man ministry dominates christendom, whereas headship is to dispose of what there is so as to get the very most out of it.<a name=31:22></a> Hence, the Levites are mentioned first in chapter 23.<a name=31:23></a> There

		I have in mind to speak about worship, and I have selected my scriptures from this book so that it may become clear that worship is intended by God to mark His people from the outset, that is, from the time of one's conversion, and that each may understand that it is not merely for those who have advanced in the truth but for all.<a name=34:1></a> Hence we find that, in the gospel of John, it enters into a conversation between the Lord and a woman, who had in herself no moral right to speak about such a holy subject, but she did speak of it; she introduced it into the conversation, evidently because her soul had been reached, the Lord, having spoken to her in a prophetic way, had brought her sins to her mind, and, as the sequel shows, she had begun to judge them, she had begun to repent.<a name=34:2></a> It is to this very thing she alluded in speaking of Christ afterwards, that He had told her all things she had ever done.<a name=34:3></a> It was therefore in no perfunctory way that she introduced the subject of worship, nor did the Lord, who knew it well and who continued the subject in a most exalted way, deter her at all.<a name=34:4></a> In no way did He indicate to her that it was not for her to speak of such a holy subject so early in her contact with Him; it was quite apropos.<a name=34:5></a> No doubt if she came into fellowship and into service later, as doubtless she did, she would shine in it.<a name=34:6></a> She would not be behind in her part in that service for she was one of those as to whom it is said that their conscience is purged from dead works to serve the living God.<a name=34:7></a> That is the end in mind.<a name=34:8></a> So also with another notable case contemplated by the apostle Paul in his letter to the Corinthians -- an unconverted man or an ignorant man coming into the christian assembly and coming under the power of the prophetic word.<a name=34:9></a> He would

		The gospel narratives furnish many more instances than I have mentioned, and Exodus would elucidate the point, as I hope to show, not only as to young believers, but in Moses himself, the great mediator and deliverer, under God, of His people; he worshipped, too.<a name=36:1></a> The passage read in chapter 4 contemplates the reception of the ministry of God.<a name=36:2></a> Moses and Aaron appear as the ministers of God acting together, for it is an important thing in service that the servants who minister are of one mind, able to act together.<a name=36:3></a> Two are always better than one, even in service; and so, if there is to be this unity in service on the part of those who are qualified to serve in a special way, the history of Moses and Aaron must be looked into.<a name=36:4></a> We see God's great concern about them, particularly Moses.<a name=36:5></a> What a history his is!<a name=36:6></a> It is a history from his infancy.<a name=36:7></a> Not so with Aaron.<a name=36:8></a> We hear nothing of him until he is about eighty-three years of age.<a name=36:9></a> Not that he did not have a history with God, but the Spirit of God passes over it until he is about to enter the divine service, and then God tells Moses about his brother.<a name=36:10></a> He knew more about Aaron than Moses did, I am sure, and it is well for all those who serve to understand that God knows all about us, that He would put us together and help us to serve together.<a name=36:11></a> He would tell one about another -- some good thoughts about him.<a name=36:12></a> The Lord does that if we wait upon Him about fellow-servants.<a name=36:13></a> He would give us to understand just what each one is and how he is to be regarded; it is important that we should understand each other and have an exercise to come to a right judgment of each other; God would give it to us for He intends His servants to work together.<a name=36:14></a> So He says to Moses, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=36:15></a>".<a name=36:16></a> He is called a Levite before Moses, not simply because he was of the tribe of Levi, but he evidently had the characteristics of a Levite, known to God.<a name=36:17></a> No one

		The meeting takes place on the mountain of God, which is another important point to be observed, because the mountain of God refers to the place of divine reserves, and servants have all to go there.<a name=37:5></a> We all get our supplies from the same source.<a name=37:6></a> And there was an expression of affection between them.<a name=37:7></a> Aaron was three years older than Moses and would thus be at a peculiar disadvantage, indeed Moses would be too, because age enters into the calculations of servants.<a name=37:8></a> The older we are the more apt we are to make much of our age; it is a part of our capital and we do well to discount that capital; it becomes a test to servants when such disparity exists between them.<a name=37:9></a> But the affection is here between Moses and Aaron, and expressed too.<a name=37:10></a> Moses had the lead; God never overlooked that.<a name=37:11></a> There was no one like him in God's mind at that time, "My servant Moses", He says.<a name=37:12></a> When Aaron and Miriam questioned him later there was no one like him, one to whom God spoke face to face as a man speaks to his friend.<a name=37:13></a> But they were of one mind here, and according to what God said, and Aaron spoke to the people.<a name=37:14></a> God had said, "I know that he can speak well".<a name=37:15></a> And so in our verse it says, "And Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses".<a name=37:16></a> Moses received the communications; they passed through him, for there is only one mediator.<a name=37:17></a> He was the apostle, the one through whom the messages came, and how many there were!<a name=37:18></a> It would be

		I wish to use these verses as setting out how God in His wisdom and love cares for believers, especially young ones.<a name=53:1></a> The divine record only proceeds a little way before we get this thought inserted.<a name=53:2></a> In chapter 1, Man is said to be created.<a name=53:3></a> There is nothing said about his need for a companion in that chapter.<a name=53:4></a> The word "Man" includes both man and woman: "male and female created he them".<a name=53:5></a> But chapter 2 brings things in from the standpoint of God's own affections and pleasure in what He had created, so that we have the word "formed" there instead of "created".<a name=53:6></a> The word "formed" denotes skill of handiwork after a pattern, so that men are not simply the product of the ground.<a name=53:7></a> Eve comes under the divine hand in the sense of formation.<a name=53:8></a> Formation involves features of life which would be pleasing to the person who formed the things.<a name=53:9></a> So that every creature of the field would have some attractiveness for the Creator, but particularly Man.<a name=53:10></a> So we have the word "formed" used in regard to him at first.<a name=53:11></a> The same word is used for the lower creatures, but Man is distinguished in that he is breathed into by the Creator; he lived by the breath of God; not by the formation of God, but by the <i>breath</i> of God he became a living soul.<a name=53:12></a>

		Formation refers to ornamentation, appearance, the framework.<a name=53:13></a> As a result of it God saw His own image in Man, and then He began to think for him.<a name=53:14></a> So that Adam comes in immediately as an object of divine interest.<a name=53:15></a> We cannot say that of the lower animals, although they had their existence by God and were formed too; there is nothing said about their environment, nor is it indicated that they had a place in the garden, but Jehovah Elohim planted

		Then it is said that "out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food".<a name=54:14></a> That is a question of providing for Adam; the "sight" would be Adam's sight, and the eater of the food would be Adam.<a name=54:15></a> Jehovah Elohim (the compound name is used indicating that He is entering into close contact with Adam) is going to provide for him and care for him, and if any need arises in Adam's history, Jehovah Elohim will see to it that it is met.<a name=54:16></a> Sin had not yet come in; so there is no need to use the word 'legitimate', because everything, so far, was perfect.<a name=54:17></a>

		There are persons who question the authenticity of these verses, claiming that they have been added to the book by someone other than the writer of the gospel.<a name=67:3></a> But they really are necessary to bind up, or complete, the gospel, and there hardly can be any doubt but that they are a part of Mark's writing.<a name=67:4></a> Mark has his own particular way of expressing himself.<a name=67:5></a> One thing that characterises him is that he is very brief -- more so than the other gospel writers.<a name=67:6></a> But he is most careful to carry matters through to completion.<a name=67:7></a> And this is very important, and especially so in assembly matters.<a name=67:8></a> The Scriptures tell us that the creation was finished: "And the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:1">Genesis  2:1</a>.<a name=67:9></a> And we are also told <i>how</i> the matter was completed.<a name=67:10></a> The heavens were garnished, we are told.<a name=67:11></a> That suggests adornment -- not only that they were finished, but that they were made beauteous.<a name=67:12></a> And Noah finished the ark -- it was completed.<a name=67:13></a> The word is, "And Noah did it", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:22">Genesis  6:22</a>.<a name=67:14></a> And so throughout the Scriptures we find incidents in which matters are brought to completion.<a name=67:15></a> God would have it so.<a name=67:16></a>

		I confess to a certain peculiar liking for this section of Scripture covering the ministries of Elijah and Elisha.<a name=82:1></a> They are, as it were, peculiarly homely and practical -- and I might add, human.<a name=82:2></a> Elijah and Elisha were representative of God to men, and they were conversant with death.<a name=82:3></a> One of them, indeed, was only conversant with it in the moral sense, for he never died; he was one of the great exceptions in the race.<a name=82:4></a> He was one of those who did not die; he was taken up to heaven in a whirlwind.<a name=82:5></a> And we have, in him, the principle of passing on to others of what he had, so that they too might have it.<a name=82:6></a> He, in this, indicates God's way, for whilst Elisha wished to share in what Elijah had, his share was to be on certain conditions; that is, he was to see Elijah as he went up.<a name=82:7></a> His wish was -- and it was a noble wish, and one which he obtained -- to have a double portion of Elijah's spirit; that is to say, it was on the principle of increase.<a name=82:8></a> That principle is particularly seen in the Lord Jesus, of whom it is said, "He must increase".<a name=82:9></a> The principle of our dispensation is increase and those of us who belong to it are in a great wave of prosperity; the prosperity that is marked by increase; by the "increase of God", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:19">Colossians  2:19</a>.<a name=82:10></a> It is said, "growing by the true knowledge of God", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:10">Colossians  1:10</a>.<a name=82:11></a> Therefore, dear brethren, we may each hope to become richer, not to remain in contentment with what we may have acquired so far, but to have more and more.<a name=82:12></a> Now Elisha was to see Elijah when he went up, meaning that there was to be keenness of sight or vision.<a name=82:13></a> The moment, it was implied, would be short, but the thing he required or desired so much would be his by the use of his eyes, "If thou see me when I am taken from thee,

		These scriptures are often read, but they are read now to show that the testimony of God is going on and that in the current order of things it takes priority to the translation into heaven.<a name=93:1></a> The translation to heaven is a fixed matter as to time with God and will happen according to 1 Thessalonians, but in the order of things the testimony has first place, as I may say, the priority.<a name=93:2></a> In saying this it is with the hope that all may be moved to have part in it.<a name=93:3></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>may be cited as illustrative of heaven's mind in view of gospel testimony, in view of gathering, and in view of saints being brought into the assembly.<a name=93:4></a> That is to say, great activity is contemplated, great industry in the sense of effecting things such as are indicated in the gospel by Luke, and indeed in all the gospels, but particularly those by Luke and John.<a name=93:5></a> So that we have the shepherd seeking his sheep, the woman sweeping her house for something lost, and the father waiting for his son so as to have him robed and fitted for the house.<a name=93:6></a> All this has priority to the actual translation to heaven.<a name=93:7></a> That will happen, as we have said, and the saints are to be comforted by this happening.<a name=93:8></a> It is said, "Encourage one another with these words".<a name=93:9></a> "These words" would be the reference to the actual translation of the saints to heaven.<a name=93:10></a>

		And so here, according to what I have read, "When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace be to you".<a name=97:2></a> Now you notice what I have already remarked, and am now stressing, that it is a question of where the disciples were, and that they were in danger of being affected by some intrusions.<a name=97:3></a> If these intrusions are effected mentally, of course, the enemy can use them and does, alas!<a name=97:4></a> But the saints are not indifferent to that.<a name=97:5></a> We are not told who shut the doors, but we are told that they were shut for fear of the Jews.<a name=97:6></a> And that gives us some inkling as to how these physical matters stand in relation to the service of God.<a name=97:7></a> But the main thought, as I have said, is where the disciples were.<a name=97:8></a> If it was in a tent, well, it was where they <i>were</i>.<a name=97:9></a> If in a room -- an upper room -- it is where they <i>were</i>.<a name=97:10></a> They dominate the matter.<a name=97:11></a> The importance of the persons and what they are engaged with, dominates the matter.<a name=97:12></a> The Lord says, according to Matthew's report: "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=97:13></a> Notice, it is <i>them</i>, alluding to the persons.<a name=97:14></a> That is, it is in the midst of <i>them</i>, whatever it may be that surrounds them or houses or shelters them.<a name=97:15></a> It is a question of these persons and that the Lord is there.<a name=97:16></a> He is there to help them in whatever they do.<a name=97:17></a> They are doing it but He is there to help them, and who can help like Him!<a name=97:18></a> We can count on that day in and day out -- some of us, at least -- and the Lord proves how true He is.<a name=97:19></a>

From verse 61 to the end of the chapter, a long chapter, we have this matter that I have in mind to speak of just for a moment.<a name=101:1></a> First, as to Rebecca herself; how she followed the man, I am speaking of her now as the type of a characteristic sister, on a high level, characteristic of the assembly.<a name=101:2></a> And it says that she followed the man.<a name=101:3></a> That was the order.<a name=101:4></a> The servant of Abraham, the greatest servant of the house, was in charge.<a name=101:5></a> He is a type of the Holy Spirit as in charge of us here, today, so to speak.<a name=101:6></a> He is in charge, and so it says that Rebecca followed the man, "The servant took Rebecca and went away.<a name=101:7></a> And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi, for he was dwelling in the south country.<a name=101:8></a> And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields towards the beginning of evening.<a name=101:9></a> And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, camels were coming".<a name=101:10></a> My theme is not simply that Isaac is a type of Christ and that Rebecca is a type of the assembly, but that both Rebecca and Isaac are also types of saints.<a name=101:11></a> And it is now a question of how the masculine side is to fit and how the feminine side is to fit.<a name=101:12></a> I have spoken about Rebecca following the man, which is a good feature.<a name=101:13></a> She was subject.<a name=101:14></a> But then Isaac is occupied with the Holy Spirit.<a name=101:15></a> He is returning from Beer-lahai-roi which first came to notice at the time of Abraham, when Hagar was seen as a type of an unruly sister.<a name=101:16></a> She was not subject to her mistress.<a name=101:17></a> But the Spirit of God is seen as having to do with her at the well Beer-lahai-roi.<a name=101:18></a> That is to say, that well is a type of the Spirit as dealing with such a person as Hagar.<a name=101:19></a> The sisters may become unruly and misbehave, but Hagar, in the grace of God, becomes subject and returns to her mistress.<a name=101:20></a> And this well is first seen in connection with her, which is a very important point.<a name=101:21></a> But still, her son was a wild ass of a man.<a name=101:22></a> She was a poor mother.<a name=101:23></a> Although she had a son who was a son of Abraham, she was a poor

		Although life and eternal life are used interchangeably, especially by the apostle John, yet in Romans they present different ideas.<a name=113:1></a> Eternal life is an end in view, whereas life (chapter 8) is connected with the Spirit: "the Spirit life", and so present.<a name=113:2></a> Life in this sense is power -- it involves ability to be free from the flesh, so as to fulfil righteousness here.<a name=113:3></a> There is also the "springing up into eternal life".<a name=113:4></a> The latter is clearly objective and outside (above, morally) the present condition.<a name=113:5></a> I do not think it right to connect eternal life with our present mortal conditions, and therefore I regard it as wrong to place it in the wilderness.<a name=113:6></a> It is the life of God's purpose for man and is necessarily the other side of death.<a name=113:7></a> The fact that it is said to consist in the knowledge of God and of Christ as the sent One only shows that the moral element is possessed by those who have it -- that is, they know God as the supreme Object of veneration, and a Man, tested in every way and found, in contrast to Adam, to be infinitely obedient.<a name=113:8></a> The cross (all that entered into it) was essential to this obedience being fully expressed; to apprehend rightly what "sent" involved, we have to ponder Gethsemane and the cross, and the light thus acquired has a great effect upon us, both as regards God and Christ, and relatively as regards the world.<a name=113:9></a> So that clearly eternal life belongs to another order of things -- "in the coming age life eternal".<a name=113:10></a>

		READINGS ON DANIEL (2)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:1">Daniel  2:1</a> - 49
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=227:1></a> In accord with the proposal made for these readings, it is well to notice the moral side in Daniel and his three companions, the companions have to be noted in this chapter.<a name=227:2></a> It is most important that before he attempts to open up the interpretation to the king, Daniel goes to God Himself.<a name=227:3></a> He praises God first.<a name=227:4></a> God has to come first, and the children are to be brought up to give God His place.<a name=227:5></a> So it is said in verse 17, "Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions", (Notice he calls them by their proper names.<a name=227:6></a>) "That they would desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.<a name=227:7></a> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.<a name=227:8></a> Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens".<a name=227:9></a> This is what I am alluding to.<a name=227:10></a> He considered for God first, that He must have His portion.<a name=227:11></a> "Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; For wisdom and might are his", and so on to the end of verse 23.<a name=227:12></a> This is the tribute that Daniel renders to God in the sense of service and praise.<a name=227:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.G.<a name=227:14></a>M.<a name=227:15></a> You called our attention to the fact that Daniel called his companions by their original names rather than by the names given them in Babylon.<a name=227:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=227:17></a> I think their names were probably from God.<a name=227:18></a> As we baptise our children to the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, they are baptised formally, and that requires that God is to have His place with the children.<a name=227:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.G.<a name=227:20></a>M.<a name=227:21></a> It gives us a reason then for looking upon the brethren as we see them in the family as God gives them names.<a name=227:22></a> W e look upon them in that way.<a name=227:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=228:3></a>H.<a name=228:4></a> The principle of leadership is seen in Daniel as he takes these others into confidence.<a name=228:5></a> Paul in writing to the Philippians says, "You have us for a model".<a name=228:6></a> He uses the plural.<a name=228:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=228:17></a> That is exactly how things should work out.<a name=228:18></a> We can see in the gospels how the Lord set out the principle of following.<a name=228:19></a> He said in the end of the gospel of John, for instance, "Follow thou me".<a name=228:20></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=228:24></a> Just so, very nicely.<a name=228:25></a> Does He not say, "I praise thee, Father"?<a name=228:26></a>

		serve Them, and what apprehension we have of Them.<a name=229:1></a> So John says, "No one has seen God at any time".<a name=229:2></a> Well, what a thought that is to get into our minds!<a name=229:3></a> "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him".<a name=229:4></a> That is the point to be constantly in our minds and before us in every meeting, we might say, that brings in the assembly and the service of God, where is God, what is God, and what are the names that are proper to use, and what are we using?<a name=229:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>it says, He has "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=229:6></a> All these things are to be considered, and they enter into every meeting we have, whether those on the first day of the week, or Bible readings, or prayer meetings; every meeting we have we must bring God into it.<a name=229:7></a> What do we understand about the Being we are now speaking to?<a name=229:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=229:9></a>M.<a name=229:10></a> Would that account for the very dependent way in which Daniel approached this great matter in the secret of his soul with God?<a name=229:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=229:18></a> Would intelligence be suggested in what is said here, he blessed the God of the heavens (verse 19), "Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens"?<a name=229:19></a> The throne has been transferred from Jerusalem the earthly centre.<a name=229:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=229:21></a> I think so, very much so indeed.<a name=229:22></a> And what comes down to us now, as to this country and all countries of the earth, is what part God has in these countries, and what reverence has to be yielded to

		Him, and what terms used in our reference to Him.<a name=230:1></a> I think the matter before us now opens up a wonderful sphere of instruction for us, and what is available to us is to help us reach all of these things, to be intelligent as to them, and to know what to say to God, and when to say it, and what applies at a given time.<a name=230:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=230:3></a>S.<a name=230:4></a> So it bears on the thought of "from eternity to eternity thou art God".<a name=230:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=230:9></a> That is what I am trying to say.<a name=230:10></a> What are Their names, how to address Them, the circumstances in which the address is made, and so on.<a name=230:11></a> So that this chapter, and the whole book of Daniel indeed, opens up a wonderful vista of instruction to us, but we need to attend to it and to follow things up that are said in meetings like this, and written too, in the way of notes of readings, so that we should all be instructed and intelligent as to the whole service of God.<a name=230:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=230:13></a> Would the God of the heavens referred to here fit in with the Father as the governor of the universe?<a name=230:14></a> It says among other things in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, "One God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all".<a name=230:15></a> That is an allusion to Him as Governor of the universe.<a name=230:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#9:20">Daniel  9:20</a> - 27; <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#11:1">Isaiah  11:1</a> - 16
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:1></a> It is thought well to add the passage from Isaiah so as to bring out the recovery and glory of the millennial day, to show how Daniel links up with Isaiah, and how the prophets can be used at the present time.<a name=269:2></a> The book of Daniel furnishes the truth, and the setting out of the truth on the moral line, Daniel being marked by godliness throughout.<a name=269:3></a> Then Isaiah in his inimitable language sets out the glory of the coming day, the millennium.<a name=269:4></a> It is hoped that we shall all be able to follow.<a name=269:5></a> The Spirit of God which indwells us has more ability than Isaiah or Daniel, therefore, we have more intelligence and ability to enjoy these things.<a name=269:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=269:7></a>S.<a name=269:8></a> Would it culminate in the last verse of chapter 12?<a name=269:9></a> "Cry out and shout, thou inhabitress of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee".<a name=269:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:11></a> In fact, I had thought of proposing the whole of chapter 12, but I thought it well to confine ourselves to what we have, but it certainly fits in beautifully and you cannot but feel the peculiar stimulation that marks Isaiah in all these tributes.<a name=269:12></a> And I thought it well, therefore, to link on what we have from the book of Isaiah so as to show that what Daniel asks for is fully set out in Isaiah.<a name=269:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=269:14></a> Do you mean that what we have in verse 19 of our chapter in Daniel, "Lord, hear!<a name=269:15></a> Lord, forgive!<a name=269:16></a> Lord, hearken and do!<a name=269:17></a> defer not, for thine own sake, O my God!<a name=269:18></a> for thy city and thy people are called by thy name", has an answer in the glory recorded in Isaiah?<a name=269:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:20></a> I thought so.<a name=269:21></a> Daniel did not go the full length.<a name=269:22></a> Isaiah seems to have the full divine thought more than any of the prophets; in fact, more than all of them together.<a name=269:23></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=270>[Page 270]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=270:1></a> So that Isaiah includes the new heavens and the new earth, which in his view would link with the millennium, not quite as far as Peter's view.<a name=270:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=270:3></a> Well, just so.<a name=270:4></a> Peter says,"According to his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth".<a name=270:5></a> It is really what is our portion.<a name=270:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=270:7></a> I was thinking of what Isaiah says as to the new heaven and the new earth in the end of his book, as to whether it goes as far as what we have in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>as to the eternal state, or whether it links more with the millennial day and its glory?<a name=270:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=270:9></a> I think Isaiah would link with the latter.<a name=270:10></a> I think the Spirit of God would bring out exactly what exists at the present time.<a name=270:11></a> We get wonderful statements in the passage we read, that refer to the millennial day, whereas, in the New Testament, in Peter, it is linked up with what we call the new heavens and new earth.<a name=270:12></a> I mean to say the Spirit of God is entitled to use these terms, and we ought to be able to follow them according to the way He uses them, whether in Isaiah or in the New Testament.<a name=270:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=270:14></a> I think that helps in relation to Isaiah's ministry.<a name=270:15></a>

		R.W.<a name=270:16></a>S.<a name=270:17></a> Isaiah is not at all downcast because only a remnant return.<a name=270:18></a> He is more buoyant than all the other prophets.<a name=270:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=270:20></a> He makes more reference than all of them to the word as applied to Israel, not the assembly.<a name=270:21></a> We do not exactly form a remnant, we represent the whole idea or nothing.<a name=270:22></a> Here this afternoon we represent the whole idea of the assembly; we are a part of it.<a name=270:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=271:5></a> Good.<a name=271:6></a> So that when we come to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#11">Isaiah  11</a>, the present characteristics of Christ appear to us.<a name=271:7></a> It is very wonderful that God comes down to us in this sense to bring out to us the present characteristics of Christ, not the assembly glory, but the millennial glory.<a name=271:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		V.L.<a name=271:9></a> Is it not wonderful that Daniel refers to terms that bear on the Lord Jesus?<a name=271:10></a> It is like the Father opening the heavens and saying, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son".<a name=271:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=271:12></a> Beautiful, I think we should be enamoured with these wonderful scriptures because they are so marvellous; so much is said in Isaiah's wild measure, compared with John's simple page; it is not wild, but perfectly set out.<a name=271:13></a>

		L.E.<a name=271:14></a>S.<a name=271:15></a> Very good.<a name=271:16></a> I was thinking too of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#11">Isaiah  11</a>, the root of Jesse, and then the breaking through of the blessed Spirit of God in relation to the consummation of His own work.<a name=271:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.G.<a name=272:5></a>H.<a name=272:6></a> Is it not important too, in view of the fact that Isaiah develops the glory side that he above any of the other prophets develops also the sufferings of Christ?<a name=272:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=272:8></a> Just so.<a name=272:9></a> He is quoted in the New Testament for that purpose.<a name=272:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=272:11></a> Would this part of this chapter show to us how Daniel can speak in relation, so to speak, to the assembly as he refers to "thy city", "thy holy mountain", and "thy people"?<a name=272:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=272:13></a> Yes, but you have to regard these statements literally to get the truth.<a name=272:14></a> The direct word is not to the assembly, it is to Israel.<a name=272:15></a> The recovery of Israel is in mind, all these terms referred to her primarily.<a name=272:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=272:21></a> Quite so.<a name=272:22></a> He is really a priest, as we said this morning.<a name=272:23></a> Daniel is a priest really, just as Ezekiel was a priest; it is unto God.<a name=272:24></a> At the same time we are called priests too, properly speaking, "a kingly priesthood, a holy nation", so that we might carry on the service of God.<a name=272:25></a> We might as well keep to the meaning of the terms whatever passage is read, keep to its meaning, and then, if needed, apply it in a spiritual way because "every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching", and can be used, only we have to use them rightly.<a name=272:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=273:11></a>M.<a name=273:12></a> Would you say it is a time favourable in God's sight?<a name=273:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=273:17></a>M.<a name=273:18></a> I was going to ask further if the evening oblation would indicate that in Daniel's mind there is a restful state, so he is able to take in the instructions from the angel.<a name=273:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=273:20></a> Quite so.<a name=273:21></a> The angel could not give him as much instruction as we could, but the angel could give Daniel instruction.<a name=273:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		N.B.<a name=273:23></a> Is the speed mentioned here worthy of note?<a name=273:24></a> Daniel repeats it.<a name=273:25></a> Verse 20, "whilst I was speaking" and in verse 21, "flying swiftly".<a name=273:26></a> I am thinking of Peter in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>.<a name=273:27></a> "While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word".<a name=273:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=292:1></a> This chapter is very full, and full of great things.<a name=292:2></a> Perhaps no part of the book is so full of great things.<a name=292:3></a> No doubt the brethren will be looking up that the Lord might, from moment to moment as we are engaged in the chapter, help us that we may get the general outline of the chapter and then the details.<a name=292:4></a> First, there is the great fact of the intervention of the angel Michael, standing up, as it says, for the children of Daniel's people, and then, the terrible thought of the suffering, the affliction that is about to come.<a name=292:5></a> "There shall be", as it says, "a time of distress, such as never was since there was a nation until that time".<a name=292:6></a> And then the first thing is, "And at that time thy people shall be delivered".<a name=292:7></a> That is to say the definite hope is held out for the deliverance of Daniel's people, which are the Jews, the children of Israel, and, then, further in verse 2, a very striking matter that no doubt will require more attention than most of the things mentioned, or any of them, and that is "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame, to everlasting contempt".<a name=292:8></a> Now, without going further, I think we should perhaps come on to this matter of eternal life.<a name=292:9></a> Other things, of course, will be touched in their place, but it seems to me that this is a matter that requires great attention by all of us, for the subject of eternal life is only very vaguely apprehended, especially as it is seen in the Old Testament and in this chapter.<a name=292:10></a> It is presented in a most striking way in this chapter.<a name=292:11></a> It says further, I should mention, before that, "At that time thy people shall be delivered", and it says, "Every one that is found written in the book", without mentioning what the book is, but clearly it is the book of the remnant of Israel in

		J.T.<a name=293:11></a> Very fully, I would say.<a name=293:12></a> Matthew corresponds more with the Old Testament than any of the gospels.<a name=293:13></a> Matthew, under the Spirit of God, carries through the prophets in certain relations and the subject of eternal life; although we shall see presently that John takes it up differently, not as a thing here, as in this chapter, or in the Old Testament, but more in relation to the assembly, or rather to those who belong to this present dispensation.<a name=293:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=294:26></a> There is a difference, of course, but not so very great as it might appear, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly".<a name=294:27></a> That would surely be eternal life.<a name=294:28></a> So that there would not be so much difference in regard to life and eternal life.<a name=294:29></a> We will come to that in detail.<a name=294:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=295:3></a> Yes, it is a prophetic thought as we said, "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame, to everlasting contempt".<a name=295:4></a> Well, I would say the Psalms say much about it, and it is hinted at in many parts of the scriptures, but it says, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>, "There hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore".<a name=295:5></a> It is a command, it is mentioned.<a name=295:6></a> It is hinted at many times in the book of the Psalms.<a name=295:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=315:6></a>F.<a name=315:7></a> I was just wondering if there should not be an exercise with us to regard the authoritative side of the ministry, and to be engaged with what the Spirit brings before us in our own day.<a name=315:8></a> The character of the ministry would correspond with the time in which we are living.<a name=315:9></a> It speaks of the time of Elijah and the day of Elias, that amounted to more than anything else that may have happened at that time.<a name=315:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=315:14></a> The points of the compass come in.<a name=315:15></a> He was to turn eastward.<a name=315:16></a> The east would be exhilarating, it would be an encouraging feature.<a name=315:17></a> The points of the compass are often spoken of in relation to the tabernacle in the book of Numbers.<a name=315:18></a> East, west, north and south -- the points of the compass are important and the Spirit of God uses them.<a name=315:19></a> We should notice them too and understand what they mean.<a name=315:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=315:21></a> Would the epistle to the Romans help us in regard to the question of the eastward side?<a name=315:22></a> Paul says, "Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God".<a name=315:23></a> I thought that would link with the Pauline side.<a name=315:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=315:25></a> Just so.<a name=315:26></a> So we see further he was to turn eastward, "and hide thyself by the torrent Cherith, which is before the Jordan".<a name=315:27></a> We are told where the torrent is.<a name=315:28></a> Then we are told further, "Thou shalt

		J.T.<a name=328:1></a> We might say this is one of the greatest chapters recorded, furnishing us with the details of Elijah's exploits, and affording much for us.<a name=328:2></a> As we had this morning, Elijah was to be maintained; that is a word that we do well to notice, that the servants of God are maintained, and we have to regard them accordingly.<a name=328:3></a> They are servants of God.<a name=328:4></a> He calls, we might say, on this brother, Obadiah, a faithful man, who feared Jehovah greatly, as it says in verse 3.<a name=328:5></a> He is characterised by care for the Lord's servants, and it says, "And it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and maintained them".<a name=328:6></a> I think we have often noticed this numeral fifty as a measure of a local meeting, fifty is enough to form a meeting and afford all that is necessary.<a name=328:7></a> Obadiah is a very good testimony to us, affording protection for the prophets of Jehovah.<a name=328:8></a> And another thing that is to be noticed especially is the presence of Jezebel here.<a name=328:9></a> Her name will come up presently and will link on with Revelation.<a name=328:10></a> We know how serious and solemn the declarations of a certain system are in deceiving people.<a name=328:11></a> We do well to take account of it especially because of the certain doctrine promulgated at a certain time, the Roman Catholic system propagating this terrible doctrine that the virgin Mary was caught up into heaven without dying.<a name=328:12></a> Mary the mother of the Lord -- a terrible blasphemy.<a name=328:13></a> We do well to take account of the terrible times we are in.<a name=328:14></a> We have this terrible thing called trade unionism; that is another feature that the enemy is using strongly against the Lord's people, and we have to be sympathetic with the Lord's people who have to do with it.<a name=328:15></a> They need our prayers that the saints may
