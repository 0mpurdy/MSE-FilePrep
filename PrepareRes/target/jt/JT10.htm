		It would be helpful to draw attention to the word "form" in Mark, and from that to point out the character of each record of the manner of the Lord's appearing to the disciples after He rose from the dead.<a name=1:1></a> The expression "another form" is one which requires attention; it is peculiar to Mark.<a name=1:2></a> He has in view the state of the disciples.<a name=1:3></a> His narrative calls special attention to their unbelief; so that in telling us about the form, Mark simply says, "he appeared in another form to two of them as they went into the country".<a name=1:4></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>and 2 enlarges on this comment.<a name=1:5></a> If the Lord's form is not natural, if the manner of His appearance to us is not normal, it denotes things are not right with us.<a name=1:6></a> The form seen in Patmos called attention to things that existed.<a name=1:7></a> The fact was that the assembly had left its first love, and His appearance was abnormal.<a name=1:8></a> It is a serious matter to find the Lord appearing in an abnormal way.<a name=1:9></a>

		Mark's gospel calls special attention to the state of unbelief which underlay the movements of the disciples after His death.<a name=1:10></a> The Lord not only speaks to us when there is departure, but He changes His attitude, and you cannot say in what form He may appear.<a name=1:11></a> The state of unbelief was the necessity for that.<a name=1:12></a> Each of the addresses to the seven assemblies opened with the Lord in a position or aspect suitable to its state.<a name=1:13></a>

		"Going into the country" seems so simple but really lies at the bottom of the assembly failure.<a name=3:3></a> It is taking up an earthly position instead of having their faces to Jerusalem.<a name=3:4></a> "Another form" is a different form, not a normal one.<a name=3:5></a> It is different from what He is in His own Person.<a name=3:6></a> As a matter of fact in Luke they did not even know Him.<a name=3:7></a> <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#5:3">Song of Songs  5:3</a> - 6 shows a great test of affection.<a name=3:8></a> The sight of His hand puts her affections in motion.<a name=3:9></a> The two that went into the country had been treated similarly, only He goes all the way with them into the house; then being there, He breaks the loaf and they know Him.<a name=3:10></a> He does not tell them what to do; but what they did was to return in that same hour to the eleven, who were in a right position though unbelieving.<a name=3:11></a> The Lord said to the assembly at Philadelphia: "I will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=3:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>).<a name=3:13></a> They had returned to the city.<a name=3:14></a> In Nehemiah a premium had to be put on dwelling in Jerusalem.<a name=3:15></a> They cast lots, for the disposition was to go into the country.<a name=3:16></a> The assembly should have retained its place in the centre of divine thought and rule.<a name=3:17></a>

		In the question of recovery, what the Spirit does is to bring us back to the previous appreciation of Christ in the Supper, and this effects recovery.<a name=5:16></a> What Luke brings us to is real humanity, the spirits of just men made perfect.<a name=5:17></a> Jerusalem is peopled by those.<a name=5:18></a> In Jerusalem we see the kind of men who have taken character from Christ: they are of Him.<a name=5:19></a>

		It seems to me that we ought to seek to arrive at the truth of what the Lord had in His mind when He uttered these words.<a name=7:1></a> Did He take account of the assembly in the light of God's purpose, or did He also include in His mind the wilderness circumstances?<a name=7:2></a> My conviction is that the latter was not in the Lord's thought; but that He contemplated the saints as <i>gathered around Him</i> consequent on His death and resurrection, and so viewed as outside of wilderness conditions.<a name=7:3></a> To apprehend the thing in a concrete way, I think we have to go back to original conditions.<a name=7:4></a> We have to do this to rightly understand any assembly truth; and I would say that when the saints came together "in assembly", the Lord came to them and this was realised.<a name=7:5></a> The Spirit does not record, or give examples of the inward working of the assembly viewed in this exalted position after Pentecost.<a name=7:6></a> I think it is left to intelligent affection to find out.<a name=7:7></a> The scene after the Supper when they sang a hymn, is the closest analogy as to the singing, but this was before the Lord's death and resurrection; they were then on Jewish ground.<a name=7:8></a> Afterwards, the disciples would be regarded as His brethren before the Father, as now made known, but referring to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, it is well to remember, that it is not the unfolding of assembly truth, but primarily to show the humanity of our Lord.<a name=7:9></a> Therefore, it is not to determine <i>when</i> He sings, but shows that He sings in the midst of the assembly; it is a characteristic function, as also declaring the Father's name to His brethren.<a name=7:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems clear that the primary thought of the assembly is that those who form it should be together; and its distinctive privileges are thus enjoyed; this

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My conviction is that the Lord in using the precious words recorded in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>, did <i>not</i> contemplate the saints as in the wilderness, or in incidental circumstances, but rather as <i>gathered together</i> as the glorious result of His death.<a name=8:4></a> Were one to take the assembly as viewed only in the light of this passage, we would think of it in no other circumstances than as surrounding Christ to "go no more out".<a name=8:5></a> That is, we should not think of the wilderness.<a name=8:6></a> I am therefore afraid that if we make the praise here to include what may ascend from individuals, as such, we lower its character.<a name=8:7></a> I believe it refers to the assembly as outside all here, and that it extends beyond the present period.<a name=8:8></a> Indeed it does not specially refer to <i>any</i> period.<a name=8:9></a> From another point of view, I believe the words "in the midst" in their ordinary force, mean that the saints are <i>together</i>.<a name=8:10></a>

		My thought is to speak a word about the relationship in which the Lord has set us as brethren, a term which is, thank God!<a name=9:1></a> now current among us, and the fact that it is current and appreciated shows, that there has been recovery amongst the people of God.<a name=9:2></a> The exercise is that what has been recovered may continue; not only the relationship, but that which belongs to it, that is, the love that is suited to it, brotherly love, and so I would wish to enlarge on the subject by the Lord's help, especially as found in the epistle to the Hebrews, which is not a formal, apostolic epistle, but one written on the ground, as one might say, of mutuality.<a name=9:3></a> The writer begins by saying, "God having spoken.<a name=9:4></a>.<a name=9:5></a>.<a name=9:6></a>.<a name=9:7></a>.<a name=9:8></a>.<a name=9:9></a> to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to <i>us"</i>.<a name=9:10></a> He is not assuming that he had any special official place, but having a message involving an exhortation, he delivered it on the ground of mutuality.<a name=9:11></a>

		In writing his apostolic letters, Paul usually associated with himself a brother, and this is especially so in corrective letters.<a name=9:12></a> You will recall that in writing his first epistle to the Corinthians he associated with himself "Sosthenes the brother", and in the second letter, "the brother Timotheus"; that is, combined with his official position as an apostle, there was the brotherly representative.<a name=9:13></a> Those who have to do with military matters know how at the tribunals a military representative is there, representing the claim of the military authorities, and while, of course, this is very different from what a brother suggests, I name it as illustrating the idea of association in acting.<a name=9:14></a> Although Paul was a brother, he was also an apostle, and as an apostle he represented the authority of Christ; the authority

		of Christ was vested in him, as it had been in the twelve.<a name=10:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a point of great interest in the opening of the Acts to see how Peter on the day of Pentecost stood up in his official capacity as an apostle not associated with the hundred and twenty; that is, with the brethren as such, but with the eleven; "But, Peter standing up with the eleven", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:14">Acts  2:14</a>).<a name=10:2></a> They were the ones who had been commissioned to announce the glad tidings, and it is said of those who believed through Peter's testimony, that "they continued stedfastly in <i>the apostles' doctrine and fellowship</i>"(verse 42); they were brought into a new system which superseded that established by Moses.<a name=10:3></a> Instead of Moses' seat, it was Christ's seat, represented in the apostles; that was how matters stood at the beginning.<a name=10:4></a> When we come to Paul, we find that he is careful to associate with his authority the brotherly spirit.<a name=10:5></a> There was one linked with him in writing the letter to the Corinthians who had the heart of a brother; that would tone the letter, not that any modification was necessary, for Paul had the heart of a brother, but he would by this means assure the brethren to whom he was writing that what he wrote was not out of keeping with the spirit of a brother; so we read, "Paul, called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:1">1 Corinthians  1:1</a>).<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find this principle of associating others with him common in the different epistles of Paul, but especially in the corrective ones, and it is worthy of special note that when he wrote to the Galatians he mentions not only one brother, but "<i>all</i> the brethren with me", (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:2">Galatians  1:2</a>) It was not only the affections of the brethren, but their solemn judgment as to an error that was about to rob the people of God of their liberties.<a name=10:7></a> It is a serious thing when all the brethren, or the brethren generally, are of one mind about a matter.<a name=10:8></a> That which belongs to Christ, His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to the epistle to the Hebrews, it is not the authority of the writer that is in view, but the mutuality that should mark the people of God.<a name=11:10></a> When I speak of mutuality, I speak of what we have in common in the way of possession.<a name=11:11></a> The early Christians began, according to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, with holding <i>everything</i> in common; "all things" were in common.<a name=11:12></a> The principle was so pronounced amongst them that even their material possessions were held in common.<a name=11:13></a> Paul distinguishes in that regard in 1 Timothy and elsewhere.<a name=11:14></a> In writing this epistle, the writer speaks of the <i>spiritual</i> things which Christians have in common, and they are very much greater, I need not remark, than material things, for they are enduring, and they become a binding element amongst the people of God.<a name=11:15></a> I suggest for your consideration expressions which recur frequently in this epistle, "<i>we</i> have" and "let <i>us</i>".<a name=11:16></a> We have things in common.<a name=11:17></a> It is not that he says, "do you", but "let us", and that leads on to what I may call in the language of Scripture, the "brotherly covenant".<a name=11:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know whether you have noticed the expression, but it occurs in the scripture I have just read from Amos, "Tyre.<a name=11:19></a>.<a name=11:20></a>.<a name=11:21></a>.<a name=11:22></a>.<a name=11:23></a>.<a name=11:24></a> remembered not the brotherly covenant".<a name=11:25></a> The principle of covenant is very pronounced in the epistle to the Hebrews, and I think that this principle helps greatly in the formation of mutual relations and bonds; indeed, in this as in all else, we have to learn from God.<a name=11:26></a> According to Thessalonians, it is God who teaches us to love

		In this epistle you will find the thought of covenant alluded to in different connections.<a name=12:2></a> It is said of Jesus that He became Surety of a better covenant; that is, a better one than the first, and it is established on better promises.<a name=12:3></a> Let us not shelve these promises for a later day.<a name=12:4></a> They are for us in the principle of them, and so also is the "better covenant", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:6">Hebrews  9:6</a>) of which Jesus is Surety.<a name=12:5></a> Primarily it is consummated as regards the house of Israel and as regards the house of Judah, but Jesus is the Surety of it, and, moreover, it is later said, <i>we</i> have come to Jesus the Mediator of it, we have come to that Man; and in the last chapter of this epistle we read that the God of peace "brought again from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep in the power of the blood of the eternal covenant".<a name=12:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:20">Hebrews  13:20</a>) Note <i>eternal</i> covenant; that is to say, one which is never to be broken, for it is not dependent on us, it is effectuated through the blood of Jesus; it is dependent on God, for Jesus is brought again from the dead in the power of the blood of it, and He is the great Shepherd of the sheep.<a name=12:7></a> What a Shepherd for the sheep to be under the care of!<a name=12:8></a> We have to take account of the Lord in these various connections.<a name=12:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not refer to the passage for that reason, but, as I said, to call attention to the fact that God has respect to the rights of the brethren.<a name=16:3></a> You may say to me, I did not know we had any rights.<a name=16:4></a> If I <i>claim</i> any I am in a false position, but <i>I</i> must recognise that <i>you</i> have rights, and so the word here is "Command the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir .<a name=16:5></a>.<a name=16:6></a>.<a name=16:7></a> meddle not with them".<a name=16:8></a> I have, therefore, to respect the brethren: they have rights: if I regard them according to God, there are no people who have such rights as the brethren.<a name=16:9></a> In the first epistle to the Corinthians "all things" are said to be ours, and amongst them the servants, the ministers, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas.<a name=16:10></a> Must I meddle?<a name=16:11></a> must I interfere?<a name=16:12></a> In Christendom the thing is reversed; you hear of certain men speaking of <i>their</i> flocks, whereas the truth is that the minister belongs to the congregation.<a name=16:13></a> If the Lord has graciously supplied a means of help for His people at the present time, let us not meddle, yea; rather let us see to it that the saints get all there is for them; they need it.<a name=16:14></a>

		Then it goes on to say, "I will not give you of their land".<a name=16:15></a> You may say, It refers to Esau; it does, but he is regarded here as representing the brethren, and there must be no interference; their land is given to them according to the counsel of God, and we must not take it away from them.<a name=16:16></a> You may say, There is very little in this brother or in that one; but remember this, the Lord is able to make him stand, and the ministry he has received

		It will be noted that throughout this epistle <i>God</i> is made specially prominent, and what He is as in contrast to <i>man</i>.<a name=35:15></a> "Of him", says the apostle, "are ye in Christ Jesus, who <i>of God</i> is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption".<a name=35:16></a> God had chosen certain ones in Corinth, generally from among those regarded as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, God is before us in all the epistles, indeed, in all Scripture, but He is peculiarly so here, as compared, for instance, with Colossians, where Christ is emphasised more.<a name=36:3></a> God was to be known in His assembly through the order and holiness seen there in contrast to what man is as seen in this world.<a name=36:4></a> It was "the testimony of God" that Paul had announced at Corinth, and his preaching was in every way in keeping with this.<a name=36:5></a> He had <i>determined</i> to know nothing among the saints there, but Jesus Christ and Him crucified.<a name=36:6></a> He was taken up with the order of Man that pleased God.<a name=36:7></a> The fact that such an One was crucified spoils all the glory of man in this world.<a name=36:8></a> The apostle's determination was in view of the general conditions at Corinth.<a name=36:9></a> Human education, social distinction, and the like had a great place in this Greek city, and the introduction of God, as presented in Jesus Christ crucified, in Paul's testimony, struck at the root of all this.<a name=36:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul was in full accord, in the manner of his ministry, with what he ministered.<a name=36:11></a> He avoided all that would appeal to the flesh, and his word was "in demonstration of the Spirit and of power", that the Corinthians' "faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God".<a name=36:12></a> These believers had thus a wonderful opportunity to start well; they had some eighteen months of Paul's work and manner of life.<a name=36:13></a> Not only did they have his <i>doctrine</i> but also the spirit and power in which he ministered; that was an immense advantage, which the saints at Rome did not have, when the

		epistle to them was written.<a name=37:1></a> The apostle, having weighed the peculiar influences of a city like Corinth <i>judged</i> that he would know nothing there but "Jesus Christ, and him crucified".<a name=37:2></a> Such knowledge is the only effective antidote to human pride.<a name=37:3></a> It is of all importance <i>now</i> as the sure fortification against the spirit of Antichrist which denies "Jesus Christ come in the flesh", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:3">1 John  4:3</a>.<a name=37:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having spoken of the subject matter and character of his ministry at Corinth, the apostle touches on what he ministered elsewhere, by way of contrast.<a name=37:5></a> He spoke wisdom among the <i>perfect</i>, but not the wisdom of this world, but "the wisdom of God <i>in a mystery"</i>.<a name=37:6></a> The Corinthians were carnal, "babes in Christ".<a name=37:7></a> They were Christians, being "in Christ" but had not gone on; they had not grown.<a name=37:8></a> Evidently they had not grown as they should have, even under the apostle's influence, for eighteen months should have taken them out of the babe state, which is passed for a much longer time in the spiritual, than it is in natural history.<a name=37:9></a> The Thessalonians got on better; they had the apostle a <i>much</i> shorter time.<a name=37:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "babe" state among Christians is generally marked by <i>undue</i> recognition of gift or signal ability in others, which tends to partisanship.<a name=37:11></a> Compare chapter 1: 11 - 13.<a name=37:12></a> The blind man of Bethsaida in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8">Mark  8</a>is an illustration; the Lord <i>led him out of the town</i> before He opened his eyes.<a name=37:13></a> In the town sin is concentrated, and hence the peculiar danger <i>there</i> for young Christians.<a name=37:14></a> The blind man, having his eyes opened, <i>first saw men as trees</i> walking; men would thus be unduly great in his estimation; this is always the danger, but afterwards he saw all men clearly.<a name=37:15></a>

		One object in this epistle to the Corinthians is to teach the Lord's people how to form a right judgment of <i>everything</i>.<a name=37:16></a> We are to have a true estimate of every man and every thing; "he that is spiritual

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Corinthians were unable to take in such light, being but little beyond the natural man as to their practical state; their spiritual ability was very limited notwithstanding their great advantages.<a name=38:5></a> Although richly endowed with gift they made but poor use of it, and this was a sad discrepancy, but alas!<a name=38:6></a> constantly noticeable among the people of God.<a name=38:7></a> The Corinthians seem to have regarded gifts almost as playthings, things to adorn and distinguish them as men in this world, whereas they are precious endowments, by which, as given by Christ the Head, the assembly is to be edified and instructed.<a name=38:8></a>

		Presently the wisdom of God shall be manifested in all its various workings, but now it is hidden; it is in mystery now, and is thus ministered to those who appreciate it and can understand it.<a name=38:9></a> It was "ordained before the world for our glory".<a name=38:10></a> Wonderful surety!<a name=38:11></a> The princes of the world knew nothing of it, or they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<a name=38:12></a> Jesus on earth was the expression of it.<a name=38:13></a> Wisdom is personified in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>, but it took form in Christ when become Man.<a name=38:14></a> Luke presents it to us, especially in chapter 7, where wisdom shines in a remarkable way, and is there said to be "justified of all her children".<a name=38:15></a> Note the centurion and the woman in Simon's house.<a name=38:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Wisdom is more prominent in this epistle than righteousness, although, of course, the latter has its place.<a name=39:9></a> The fact that the <i>order</i> that should mark the house of God is in view explains this.<a name=39:10></a> There is great evidence of divine wisdom in the structure of the epistle.<a name=39:11></a> Wisdom is the handmaid of love, and love in peculiar fervency underlay what the apostle wrote.<a name=39:12></a> The Corinthians were his "beloved children", and the apostle's communications to them were in genuine fatherly affection, although largely taking the form of warning and admonition.<a name=39:13></a> Chapter 2 emphasises the <i>spiritual</i>, but the Corinthians, alas!<a name=39:14></a> were not spiritual.<a name=39:15></a> Although they had the Holy Spirit, they were but "babes in Christ".<a name=39:16></a> The subject of spirituality is brought forward so that the Corinthians might realise their poverty in this respect.<a name=39:17></a> Chapter 13 has the same bearing in regard of <i>love</i>.<a name=39:18></a> "The spiritual discerns all things, and he is

		Although the Corinthians had the Holy Spirit, they were carnal; the apostle <i>fed</i> them, however, but this could not be with meat, but with milk.<a name=40:9></a> Their carnality was largely evidenced in partisanship; this usually appears in young or stunted Christians.<a name=40:10></a> In the world partisanship is legalised, and this is true in Christendom also, but it is a most baneful thing among the people of God.<a name=40:11></a> Scarcely anything is more hateful to a spiritual man than that he should be regarded as the leader of a party.<a name=40:12></a> It must have been very painful to Paul.<a name=40:13></a> The Corinthians walked "as men".<a name=40:14></a> To do this does not necessarily involve what is outwardly sinful.<a name=40:15></a> It works out in natural preferences and selections.<a name=40:16></a> It is quite natural for a man to like another of his own rank or education.<a name=40:17></a> National prejudices, too, come under this head.<a name=40:18></a> In a word, the principles that mark the world are here condemned as appearing among Christians.<a name=40:19></a> For a brother to accept the fealty of others in any sense, or to aim at being a recognised leader, is a serious matter; it can only serve the enemy's designs.<a name=40:20></a> It makes for division among the saints.<a name=40:21></a>

		Paul's careful judgment as to what he should present to the Corinthians is very striking; it was "Jesus Christ, and him crucified".<a name=41:1></a> The blessed character of that Man presented to them in Paul's ministry was calculated to lay a foundation in their souls, that would, if truly accepted, save them from the very evils they were allowing.<a name=41:2></a> The blind man of <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8">Mark  8</a>who had his eyes opened, first saw "men as trees, walking".<a name=41:3></a> He is a type of the Corinthians and, alas!<a name=41:4></a> of many at the present time; subsequently "he saw all things clearly".<a name=41:5></a> Following this in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8">Mark  8</a>Peter confesses that Jesus was "the Christ".<a name=41:6></a> Normal progress is indicated in this.<a name=41:7></a> The Lord inquired of the disciples, "Whom do ye say that I am?<a name=41:8></a>" Peter answered, "Thou art the Christ of God".<a name=41:9></a> Here in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>, the question is, "Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos?<a name=41:10></a>" They were ministering servants through whom the Corinthians had believed; but Jesus is "the Christ of God", the anointed Man, by whom God effects all that is in His heart.<a name=41:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=158:2></a> I do not propose to go over this chapter, but I desire to call attention to the matter of food, the subject being necessarily of very great importance spiritually, as it is physically.<a name=158:3></a> This chapter presents it fully, and gives us the kind of food that we require to partake of in order to live.<a name=158:4></a> There is food that one has to partake of in order to serve, priests' food; but the food in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, is what is essential to life.<a name=158:5></a> The Lord, in raising Jairus' daughter, commanded that something should be given to her to eat, without specifying what it was.<a name=158:6></a> He left that to those responsible, which raises a question as to those who are in any sense "stewards" of the "manifold grace of God", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:10">1 Peter  4:10</a>.<a name=158:7></a> The faithful and wise servant provides food for the household, and in regard to the kind of food, he would be concerned as to whether those needing it were young, middle-aged, of old, and what work they had to do.<a name=158:8></a> This principle is illustrated in the apostle, who said, "I have fed you with milk and not with meat", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:2">1 Corinthians  3:2</a>.<a name=158:9></a> Under other circumstances he would supply other food.<a name=158:10></a> I would further remark, in order to make the subject clear, that in this chapter the Lord, it appears, gives the food direct to "the men" who "were set down".<a name=158:11></a> In the other gospels it is said to be given through the disciples, but verse 11, correctly reads; "And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed them to those that were sat down".<a name=158:12></a> The Lord provides that which is suited to His own.<a name=158:13></a> He gives us the Supper, and says: "Take, eat, this is my body", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:26">Matthew  26:26</a>.<a name=158:14></a> Then, in Jerusalem, after He rose from the dead, He "ate

		J.T.<a name=169:1></a> The idea of eating and drinking, it may be remarked, is spoken of in the Word, as not only meeting the needs of the body physically, but as a means of enjoyment.<a name=169:2></a> We get the thought of feasting.<a name=169:3></a> In the tenth chapter of the first letter to the Corinthians where <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32">Exodus  32</a>is referred to, in connection with a "feast to Jehovah", eating and drinking are called idolatry; then, in chapter 15, the apostle reasons, that if there be no resurrection, men would simply eat and drink, and die to-morrow; thus showing how the terms are used as expressing enjoyment and satisfaction away from God.<a name=169:4></a> Whereas they are also used in the same sense, to denote enjoyment and satisfaction in the presence of God, as in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>, where the elders of Israel ate before God, having seen God, as we are told.<a name=169:5></a> He did not lay His hands on the elders, and they ate and drank, so their life was continued there.<a name=169:6></a> Then in the gospels we have several instances of feasting, in which eating and drinking form prominent features.<a name=169:7></a> I mention these things to show how Scripture connects what is of the world, as well as what is of God, with eating and drinking.<a name=169:8></a> Eating in the presence of God necessitates very great exercise.<a name=169:9></a>

		In reading these scriptures I do not intend to go into detail, but I wish to speak a little of priesthood.<a name=180:1></a> I desire to point out how essential it is at the present time, if the testimony of Christ is to be preserved and continued; and I have for this reason read a passage in Paul's epistle to Timothy, which places Timothy in a position of trust, and, as so placed, he is necessarily regarded as a priest.<a name=180:2></a> Timothy had been in captivity, but was released.<a name=180:3></a> "Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:23">Hebrews  13:23</a>, There is, perhaps, more said of Timothy personally than of any other servant in the New Testament apart from the apostles.<a name=180:4></a> He receives remarkable mention in the Scriptures.<a name=180:5></a> He appears, as many of you know, at a period when he was greatly needed.<a name=180:6></a> Barnabas had failed Paul, and on the occasion of Paul's mission to Europe as recorded in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>, Timothy appears.<a name=180:7></a> His genealogy is given spiritually; he was the son, it says, of a <i>believing</i> woman, not only of one who had believed, but of a woman characterised by faith; his mother was such.<a name=180:8></a> In the second letter to Timothy, the apostle reminds him of that, and also that his grandmother was one in whom unfeigned faith dwelt.<a name=180:9></a> Furthermore, the Spirit of God tells us of him, that he is designated by Paul as his true child in faith, his beloved child, so that he has spiritually, in that way, a very remarkable parentage.<a name=180:10></a> I would emphasise it, he had a <i>believing</i> mother, and a <i>believing</i> grandmother, and an apostle as a father spiritually; and as such he comes into a position of trust in the house of God.<a name=180:11></a> He is a custodian of the good deposit entrusted; that is to say, of the truth in regard to God and in regard to

		Christ.<a name=181:1></a> He is, as one may say, the trustee for.<a name=181:2></a> Paul's doctrine; Now, that is saying a good deal, but it is not saying more than Scripture predicates of this remarkable young man, for such he was yet, even when this second letter was written to him from Rome.<a name=181:3></a> I am not ignoring the fact that the Holy Spirit is the power to maintain things for God here, but I am speaking of the position that Scripture accords to this remarkable young man.<a name=181:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is, as I remarked already, also referred to as a brother.<a name=181:5></a> The writer to the Hebrews does not speak of him as his son, but as a brother.<a name=181:6></a> "Know ye", he says, "that our brother Timothy is set at liberty".<a name=181:7></a> And so being free, he is now available, as one may say, in the service of the truth, and is constituted a trustee, so that he should pass on, what he had learned from Paul, to faithful men.<a name=181:8></a> Indeed, the passage is somewhat like the last will and testament of a man.<a name=181:9></a> Timothy is to administer; he is delegated by the apostle to entrust to faithful men what he himself had heard of Paul in the presence of many witnesses.<a name=181:10></a> You will understand I am not ignoring the fact that the Holy Spirit is here to maintain the truth.<a name=181:11></a> I am speaking for the moment of a servant.<a name=181:12></a> Timothy has to administer the truth, and he is to commit to faithful men what he had heard from.<a name=181:13></a> Paul.<a name=181:14></a>

		It is as if the Spirit of God would set this man before us, as one unquestionably qualified to fill the office with which he was entrusted, and on which he was about to enter.<a name=182:1></a> At this juncture I would call your attention to one peculiarity in these books of Ezra and Nehemiah, that in them the principle of genealogy is emphasised.<a name=182:2></a> A genealogical register is set down as of the very greatest importance in these two books.<a name=182:3></a> Ezra, I apprehend, is the great genealogical chronicler of the Old Testament, and I would ask you to note that whilst he is the priest and his genealogy is incontrovertibly established, he is also said to be a scribe, and a ready one.<a name=182:4></a> Now in saying that he is a scribe, one would be careful to point out that he was in no sense a journalist; he was in no way occupied with the narration of the events of the time; he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given; he was efficient in that.<a name=182:5></a> I mention this in view of the great value of writing in our time.<a name=182:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a remarkable thing that in the second letter to Timothy, books are specially mentioned, and they were brought to Paul; he says, "especially the parchments".<a name=182:7></a> And so Ezra was a ready scribe in the law of the Lord.<a name=182:8></a> I would suggest that the conditions in his day required writing.<a name=182:9></a> The saints were scattered.<a name=182:10></a> They had not all returned to Jerusalem.<a name=182:11></a> And the true priest of God would concern himself about every saint of God.<a name=182:12></a> Let us not be narrow in our affections.<a name=182:13></a> It is essential to be narrow, in a sense, in our fellowship, as another has said, 'Keep our hearts large, but our feet in the narrow path'.<a name=182:14></a> In that relation I would remark that Ezra, in his wonderful prayer to Jehovah, when confessing the sins of the people, says, "there hath been favour from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place .<a name=182:15></a>.<a name=182:16></a>.<a name=182:17></a> .<a name=182:18></a>.<a name=182:19></a>.<a name=182:20></a> and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem".<a name=182:21></a> (<a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#9:8">Ezra  9:8</a>, 9)

		These were what I might call the available things in his day.<a name=183:1></a> There was a remnant available, a nail in the holy place of God was available; and a wall about Jerusalem was available.<a name=183:2></a> But then all the saints of God were not available, but Ezra would embrace them all in his affections; so Paul says in writing his letter to Timothy, "The Lord knoweth them that are his".<a name=183:3></a> It may not be within our scope to test the genealogy of everybody, but the Lord knows everyone's genealogy.<a name=183:4></a> "The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his".<a name=183:5></a> This is a great comfort.<a name=183:6></a> There are many, alas!<a name=183:7></a> who are not available to us, but there are those who are, and it is for us to value what is available, and to make the most of it.<a name=183:8></a> Those three things are available, according to Ezra's prayer.<a name=183:9></a> A remnant of the people of God; thank God for the few or for the many: the larger the number the better, provided they are genuinely the people of God.<a name=183:10></a> Then access to the holy place of God; and then, finally, a wall.<a name=183:11></a> These things are to be cherished.<a name=183:12></a> They are the available things at the present time.<a name=183:13></a> The question is, Am I using what is available?<a name=183:14></a> a remnant of the people of God, access to God, a nail in the holy place of God; a sure footing there through the blood of Jesus!<a name=183:15></a> As the writer to the Hebrews says: "Having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having an high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:19">Hebrews  10:19</a> - 22.<a name=183:16></a> And then there is a wall in Jerusalem.<a name=183:17></a> It may be called exclusivism, but it is: a priestly feature.<a name=183:18></a> It is that which the priest delights in.<a name=183:19></a> It involves the security and the protection of the people of God from error or defilement.<a name=183:20></a> Fellowship is available within.<a name=183:21></a>

		Before speaking on what I have specially on my mind, I wish to call attention to John, the writer of this gospel, so I have read this passage in the last chapter.<a name=196:1></a> His writings have many peculiarities, as compared with other apostolic and evangelistic writings, for the New Testament, with the exception of the Apocalypse, which is a prophetic writing, may be classified under these two heads.<a name=196:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One thing which I think may he noted is that John brings in, in a special way, fatherly and brotherly interest.<a name=196:3></a> The Apocalypse is distinguished by the brotherly spirit.<a name=196:4></a> The gospel is the narrative of a loved one, a very touching ground on which to write.<a name=196:5></a> The Apocalypse is by the <i>brother;</i> that, too, has its own voice.<a name=196:6></a> The epistle is mainly the address of a father.<a name=196:7></a> In other words, John's writings may be grouped under these three heads, <i>loved one, brother, and father</i>.<a name=196:8></a> Now, in speaking of the <i>brother</i> which is perhaps the most prominent feature with us, in these last days, I would remark that the thought appears in the introduction of nearly all the collective epistles of Paul; Romans is an exception.<a name=196:9></a> He writes to the Romans as an apostle, and his concern is to make known the gospel; to declare, as he says, the gospel of God, to which he was separated.<a name=196:10></a> But in writing letters which involve discipline, he invariably connects the brother with him in his writing; that is to say, he blends apostolic authority with brotherly interest and sympathy.<a name=196:11></a> So, in his first letter to Corinth, he has Sosthenes, and in the second, Timothy; and if the things are exceptionally serious, as in Galatia, he says, "all the brethren with me".<a name=196:12></a> If <i>all</i> the brethren are joined in a judgment, it is a serious matter for those who are judged, and the matter <i>was</i>

		Returning to John, we learn from him, that it was he who wrote his gospel.<a name=197:3></a> He tells us in chapter 21: 24, that "This is the disciple".<a name=197:4></a> It is as much as to say, 'The Lord has designated me a reserve man, ad I want you to understand that what I have written is an evidence of the reserve'.<a name=197:5></a> It is, as it were, the Lord bringing up His reserves, and that in view of final and complete victory; let there be no mistake about that!<a name=197:6></a> It is not that these are <i>all</i> the reserves; this gospel is only part of what is infinite.<a name=197:7></a> We need have no fear as to the results of that in which we are engaged, though it is a warfare of the most strenuous nature, if we have faith.<a name=197:8></a> If we have not faith, John is entirely outside of our range.<a name=197:9></a> Have we any fear, if we have faith?<a name=197:10></a> None whatever, for John, after saying, "This is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things", immediately adds, "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written".<a name=197:11></a> There is much more, John tells us, that he or others could write, if the Lord so ordered it, but it was not necessary, for all the reserves, so to speak, that were required had been brought up.<a name=197:12></a> "There are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one; the world itself could not contain the books that should be written".<a name=197:13></a> I suppose it is the conjecture of a loved one.<a name=197:14></a> We see thus that there is an infinitude behind this; the full account and amplification of the ministry of Christ would mean infinitude.<a name=197:15></a> How encouraging to realise that all this is, so to speak, in the rear, while all that is necessary has been brought forward!<a name=197:16></a> This gospel is not all

		Now, God is putting solitary ones into that family.<a name=204:5></a> In the previous verse to the one we read you will observe, that He is said to be a "father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation"; that is what God is, in His holy habitation.<a name=204:6></a> I apprehend this in a <i>spiritual</i> sense, though I should be far from restricting it, or denying the comfort of it to any orphan, any one who, in a literal sense, was deprived of parents, or any one deprived of husband, or husband of wife; for Scripture contains comfort for all, as we read, "that we through comfort of the Scriptures might have hope", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:4">Romans  15:4</a>.<a name=204:7></a> I apprehend, however, that the application is more to spiritual orphans, and those bereft of shelter spiritually; and if there is one such here, I would say, there is comfort in this word for you.<a name=204:8></a> God will be a Father to you and He will judge your cause, you need not have any anxiety.<a name=204:9></a> So if difficulties arise among the people of God, and if there are those who, in consequence, are denied the shelter and protection due to them, God is the Judge of all such in His holy habitation; and, as is said elsewhere, He is "greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#139:7">Psalm  139:7</a>.<a name=204:10></a> He is to be feared there.<a name=204:11></a> It is well to have that before us, the fear of God in His saints.<a name=204:12></a> Whilst He has revealed Himself in Christ, in love and grace and mercy, He is also said to be a consuming fire, and this is said, not of Israel's God, but of <i>our</i> God.<a name=204:13></a> "Our God is a consuming fire", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:29">Hebrews  12:29</a>.<a name=204:14></a> There can be no change in God as to the manner in which He regards sin, He is

		J.T.<a name=222:2></a> In speaking of priesthood and genealogy I refer to what we get in Ezra and Nehemiah; each one had to establish his genealogy; and I thought this epistle would help us to see how these things are worked out now.<a name=222:3></a> There is mention made in Nehemiah of a certain number of priests' garments which were provided.<a name=222:4></a> Nehemiah himself provided a good number, suggestive of the hope that he had cherished, that there would be priests to wear them.<a name=222:5></a>

		You observe, that as to Timothy the apostle remarks on his genealogy in a spiritual sense; the faith that dwelt in his mother and grandmother dwelt also in him; he is marked off in Scripture as of a spiritual generation.<a name=222:6></a> Of course, every Christian is, but it is remarkable about him that mention is made of his mother and grandmother, both of whom had faith.<a name=222:7></a> Paul was his spiritual father, so that his parentage in that way established his genealogy.<a name=222:8></a> Then the fact that he was entrusted with the testimony reminds us of priesthood, because that was the responsibility the priests had; they were in charge of the ark and the holy things, they were over the ministry.<a name=222:9></a> It seems obvious that these are details to be looked for, and absolutely essential <i>now</i>.<a name=222:10></a> If that which is of God is to be preserved and continued, there is the need of establishing our genealogy; and being priests, we are to wear priests' clothes.<a name=222:11></a>

		GENEALOGICAL REGISTRY IN A DAY OF DEPARTURE (2)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=230:1></a> The two thoughts that are prominently in mind are in Ezra and Nehemiah; namely, genealogy and priesthood.<a name=230:2></a> It seems to me that the analogy between Ezra and Nehemiah and 2 Timothy is very pronounced: the Scriptures which were written aforetime, being written for our learning, these two books should be specially studied in connection with the last days.<a name=230:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of genealogy is very pronounced; that is, as to those who have professed to have returned from Babylon.<a name=230:4></a> They are required to show that they are genuine; and then that they are clothed in priestly garments.<a name=230:5></a> Nehemiah provided priests' clothes, showing that he had in his mind that there would be priests.<a name=230:6></a> I think Timothy answers to these ideas, his genealogy, his clothing, and his priesthood.<a name=230:7></a> As to the latter, he is entrusted with the testimony.<a name=230:8></a> It comes out specially in this chapter.<a name=230:9></a> It will be observed, that he is addressed in the first chapter as the apostle's "beloved child", and here as his "child".<a name=230:10></a> So that it is as of a certain spiritual generation that he is addressed in both.<a name=230:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=230:12></a> He is marked out to carry on the testimony.<a name=230:13></a> How do we establish our genealogy?<a name=230:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=230:15></a> First of all by separating from evil, and then by following what is good with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=230:16></a> One forms links of affection with the saints.<a name=230:17></a> The tabernacle was marked by links or hooks of gold, and a Christian proves that he is genuine by the fact that he establishes these links with the Lord's people in seeking to be among them.<a name=230:18></a> It is not simply being a professed believer, one ought to show that he values the saints

		by being with them, and thus forming links of affection with them, as I said.<a name=231:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=231:2></a> It is not simply outward separation; it is that, but it is more.<a name=231:3></a> Did you say, that having love for the brethren would establish the links?<a name=231:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=231:5></a> Yes; God's tabernacle was formed, after the people had come out of Egypt; the principle for us therefore is that there must be separation first, and then a recognition of what is of God as found among His people, who are following righteousness, faith, love, and peace.<a name=231:6></a> One is not only to be identified outwardly with them; definite links are to be formed.<a name=231:7></a> One <i>is known as one of the brethren by brotherly love</i>.<a name=231:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=231:9></a> The apostle puts trust in Timothy, but he spoke of "all who are in Asia" having turned away from him.<a name=231:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=231:11></a> Yes; Paul was now the test for all.<a name=231:12></a> He represented the truth, for he was set for the defence of it.<a name=231:13></a> He was in every way in keeping with it.<a name=231:14></a> So that such an one as that is a test as to whether there is true affection for Christ.<a name=231:15></a> Paul, being in such circumstances, as he was, in prison, for Christ, became a test.<a name=231:16></a> It is all well to be happy with each other in the meeting; it is love so far as it goes, but the test of the love is the reproach under which those are who are true to Christ in every way.<a name=231:17></a> Paul had become the test for the saints, being in great reproach.<a name=231:18></a> Onesiphorus is a contrast to those in Asia.<a name=231:19></a> He had often refreshed the apostle, and was not ashamed of his chain.<a name=231:20></a> Being in Rome, Onesiphorus had sought out the apostle, and <i>found him</i>.<a name=231:21></a> It may seem to us now that every Christian would gladly seek out the great apostle, but we little realise the reproach he was in.<a name=231:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=232:10></a> There was always a test for the people of God, and how we answer to it brings out the genuineness of our genealogy.<a name=232:11></a> The Lord in the sixth of John says, "Will ye also go away?<a name=232:12></a>" He had been speaking words that were spirit and life, and so there was a test.<a name=232:13></a> Many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with Him; so He says to the twelve, "Will ye also go away?<a name=232:14></a>" And Peter says, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=232:15></a> thou hast words of life eternal".<a name=232:16></a> They clung to Him as appreciating what He ministered.<a name=232:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McF.<a name=232:18></a> Referring again to priesthood, the way you are looking at it is, according to the book of Numbers: the priests had charge of the vessels of the tabernacle.<a name=232:19></a> It is not the thought of Leviticus, of approach to God?<a name=232:20></a>

		It would be admitted by all who are familiar with Scripture, that the truth of translation comes out first in connection with Enoch "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>.<a name=266:1></a> In his prophecy he does not speak of translation, but of the coming of the Lord, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads"; but the truth of translation is first introduced with him.<a name=266:2></a> I think, too, it is a principle in Scripture, that in the first introduction of a thought you get the main features connected with it, and these mark it right through.<a name=266:3></a> Scripture.<a name=266:4></a> So here one of the main features connected with translation is that God translates what pleases Him.<a name=266:5></a> Enoch had this "testimony, that he pleased God".<a name=266:6></a> I suggested reading these scriptures that our attention might be called to this thought, that pleasing God precedes translation,

		These scriptures show the circumstances under which the kingdom of heaven was introduced, especially in regard to the posture in which the Lord announces the word of the kingdom; He is sitting.<a name=285:1></a> In this connection I would point out how in this gospel the thought of sitting is made prominent.<a name=285:2></a> It is suggestive of serenity and deliberation.<a name=285:3></a> It is a thought that comes in at the present time in a very peculiar way, for we are confronted, at least the world is, with the unsettling of everything.<a name=285:4></a> Thrones and governments which seemed to have been firm, have collapsed, and others are likely to follow, occasioning a very real disturbance in the order of the world, and possibly in the minds of many of God's people.<a name=285:5></a> Now the gospel of Matthew comes in opportunely in the midst of these circumstances, for it deals with the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=285:6></a> I need not remind you that these occurrences on earth, affecting the powers that are on the earth, have no influence in heaven, and so in the Old Testament you have from the outset the idea of God sitting in supreme power as between the cherubim for instance, armed with power for the fulfilment of His will.<a name=285:7></a> In the Psalms too, God is regarded as sitting in the heavens, in such wise as not only to deal effectively with what passes on earth, but to hold all opposing elements in supreme derision, in solemn irony, as in the second Psalm.<a name=285:8></a> Later on in the book of Psalms He is seen in the same way, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#29">Psalm  29</a>we read of the voice of the Lord and what it does.<a name=285:9></a> Then David says, "The Lord sitteth upon the flood".<a name=285:10></a> God sits above them, and sustains the heart of faith.<a name=285:11></a> He sitteth King for ever.<a name=285:12></a> It is a wonderful thought for the heart amid the raging billows of human wrath.<a name=285:13></a> We must

		The epistle to the Ephesians, whilst presenting salvation, enlarges on the thought of the headstone.<a name=294:1></a> The thought of unity is found in Romans and Corinthians, but the unity of the Spirit and the unity of the faith are found here, They have a remarkable bearing in view of the conditions that have arisen, The saints are in a world that is in need of unity; they are apt to be drawn into that which is moving in the world.<a name=294:2></a> What fortifies us is to see what God has brought us into by our baptism, then in the fellowship of God's Son and fellowship with one another, leading to practical unity of the Spirit.<a name=294:3></a>

		We can reckon on the angelic ministry; it is not the ministry of the Spirit, but it is a ministry that is under Christ, and He is using it now on account of the saints, so that the angel sitting on the stone signifies the supremacy of God, the superiority of God in regard to every other power.<a name=296:2></a> It tends to stay the heart in view of the upheavals that go on.<a name=296:3></a> Things occur that seem so disastrous in the world.<a name=296:4></a> It must have been a harrowing time for the powers of the world lately, but the Christian is restful, not indifferent, but restful.<a name=296:5></a> He sees that it turns out for the furtherance of the gospel.<a name=296:6></a> The administration of Christ will be carried out in spite of the opposition.<a name=296:7></a> The angels are governmental and providential in their service.<a name=296:8></a> They ministered to the Lord, but they are not limited to the individual ministry.<a name=296:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12">Acts  12</a>the angel takes care of Peter, and also deals with Herod; he smote Herod.<a name=296:10></a>

		You will observe that throughout the law governing the offerings, Aaron's sons figure more than Aaron does, so that drawing near with the offerings you become acquainted with Aaron's sons, and with Aaron himself, for he is there too.<a name=346:6></a> He is the great priest, as is said of Christ, "having a great priest over the house of God".<a name=346:7></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:21">Hebrews  10:21</a>) He is on our side, and as we draw near we see Him there for us.<a name=346:8></a> But we find, as we come often, so to speak; that is, as we habituate ourselves to the sanctuary court, that He is more than Priest for us; He is a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man.<a name=346:9></a> The more you apprehend Christ in that light, the more enlarged you become, and I do seek for enlargement in myself.<a name=346:10></a>

		Now when you come to Leviticus, it is the truth presented from our side, and I may remark here as to a point of distinction as regards Numbers.<a name=348:14></a> Numbers contemplates the people's position, so it is said in Numbers, "And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt".<a name=348:15></a> (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1:1">Numbers  1:1</a>) The Spirit of God is occupied in Numbers with the public position, and the testimony, and the order of the camp in that position, hence you have military arrangements.<a name=348:16></a> It is the public position of the saints, God dwelling in their midst, and the order that marks them.<a name=348:17></a> It is in that book that

		I apprehend that the apostle John was specially qualified, and was assigned the task of writing about it, of presenting it in such a way that it should be impressed, in its true proportion, upon the hearts of the people of God.<a name=385:5></a> John writes his gospel in a peculiarly humble spirit; he avoids referring to himself, as having any official capacity, but as one whom Jesus loved.<a name=385:6></a> He is referred to in that way, one whom the Lord had, so to speak, kept in His quiver, a polished shaft for His use.<a name=385:7></a> The Lord had kept John, so to speak, hidden; and there is no safe hiding place for any of us except in the love of Christ.<a name=385:8></a> It is there that one is secure, and the more one knows the flesh and its capabilities, the more one desires to be there; for unless one is there one is exposed to the influences that govern this world.<a name=385:9></a> Hence the importance of being humbly hidden in the love of Christ.<a name=385:10></a> John was so in the good of the position that he could ask the Lord questions; he found out things from the Lord, so that he is the one of all others, who employs the words <i>we know</i> that is to say, he knew.<a name=385:11></a> He was not uncertain as to the things he ministered.<a name=385:12></a>

		John begins: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>.<a name=386:1></a> In this infinitely important statement the evangelist is calling attention to the Deity of Christ; but not only this, he is also calling attention to the fact that He was <i>with</i> God; for Christianity in its true power and moral bearing is marked as having originated with God.<a name=386:2></a> It is also added here, "the same was in the beginning with God".<a name=386:3></a> And then he goes on to say, "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John"; the one who is to bear witness to the Light has also been with God.<a name=386:4></a> Notice, it is "sent from", not by, God.<a name=386:5></a> But immediately the evangelist says, "he was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light".<a name=386:6></a> It was "that all men through him might believe".<a name=386:7></a> And then he goes on to say, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him", verse 18.<a name=386:8></a> It is not now <i>what</i> He was, or where He was, but where He <i>is</i>.<a name=386:9></a> The declaration is in One who <i>is</i> in the bosom of the Father; you will see therefore how the Spirit links up all with God.<a name=386:10></a> So John says further, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only begotten with a father".<a name=386:11></a> This glory was seen, <i>contemplated</i>, by the disciples as He dwelt among them.<a name=386:12></a> "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us".<a name=386:13></a> He <i>became</i> flesh; a wonderful fact!<a name=386:14></a> He came so near that the disciples contemplated His glory; they had that opportunity and they seized it.<a name=386:15></a> What glory they saw in Him!<a name=386:16></a> He was full of grace and truth.<a name=386:17></a> He was seen thus as with the Father.<a name=386:18></a>

		John develops another point, which hangs on this.<a name=387:8></a> He presents to us the Lord, in the end of chapter 3, as the Son, into whose hand all things are given by the Father.<a name=387:9></a> He says, "The Father loveth the Son"; the Son is the object of the Father's love, and in this way He communicated to Him all things.<a name=387:10></a> Now, that would be administration in the hand of the Son; God gives all into His hand, hence the boundlessness of the gift that flows from this; that is to say, the living water.<a name=387:11></a> "God giveth not the Spirit by measure".<a name=387:12></a> That is a wonderful thought and it involves Christianity.<a name=387:13></a> How one feels the smallness of one's own faith and affections!<a name=387:14></a> In dispensing what we may have in the way of stewardship, we are to be governed by the manner of God's giving.<a name=387:15></a> The Lord says to the woman of Sychar, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee

		Then in chapter 7 this same water is received by the believer.<a name=388:4></a> What have I received?<a name=388:5></a> Chapter 4 is God's gift, chapter 7 is what I receive; that is to say, it refers to my capacity, for I only receive according to my capacity, but the capacity is not regarded as limited.<a name=388:6></a> Faith that is formed by the Spirit in the believer is in keeping with what is presented of God in Christ, so that "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=388:7></a> That is a limitless thought, it does not say how many rivers.<a name=388:8></a> In the garden of Eden there were four, but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>the number is not given, and it suggests to us the magnitude of what has come in; but mark, it is <i>in the believer</i>.<a name=388:9></a> "He that believeth on me", says the Lord.<a name=388:10></a> This is what I am coming to: first, whether one does believe at all; and secondly, <i>what</i> one believes.<a name=388:11></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>it is the believer in Christ.<a name=388:12></a> If the Lord had said: 'Out of Me shall flow rivers', it would be more understandable, but it is said of one who believes on Him.<a name=388:13></a> What a Person Christ is!<a name=388:14></a> And see what the Christian is!<a name=388:15></a> "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=388:16></a> Christianity subjectively is in keeping with what formed it objectively.<a name=388:17></a> Chapter 4 is objective; it is what God gives; chapter 7 is what those who have faith receive.<a name=388:18></a> Receiving is implied, of course, in chapter 4, but I am speaking of what is emphasised in both chapters.<a name=388:19></a> In the passage I read, the Lord says, "Do ye now believe"?<a name=388:20></a> It is a simple question; I listen to it, and I ask myself What do I believe?<a name=388:21></a> We use the word <i>believe</i> very freely and rightly, I

		Now I want to say a word about chapter 13 of this gospel.<a name=389:4></a> The Lord saw the position; it says, "Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God".<a name=389:5></a> He was conscious at that moment that He was going to the Father.<a name=389:6></a> Now, mark, it is not simply that He came out from God, but He also went to God.<a name=389:7></a> He was going out of the world to the Father.<a name=389:8></a> Jesus has gone out of the world, and I would remind everyone here that He is <i>not</i> in it; and He has not only gone out, but He has gone out of the world to the Father; that is, in His own personal dignity, as a Man.<a name=389:9></a> It involves the perfectness of His testimony and work, under the Father's eye.<a name=389:10></a> In this world there was not the slightest discrepancy in His service, He did always those things that pleased the Father, so He went out of the world to the Father.<a name=389:11></a> The idea is as to what is personal in His service, and so "having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end", <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:1">John  13:1</a>.<a name=389:12></a> That goes with the perfection of His manhood under God's eye.<a name=389:13></a> He went to the Father as the High Priest, for He had the saints in His heart.<a name=389:14></a> He did the Father's works, made the Father known, and then went to the Father.<a name=389:15></a> He returned to the One from whom He came.<a name=389:16></a> Christ is the "Yea" and the "Amen".<a name=389:17></a> He is the "Yea" coming down, and the "Amen" going up.<a name=389:18></a> He says, "I have glorified thee on the earth; I have completed

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=414:1></a> In continuation of what we have been saying together on a previous occasion as to the house of God, I might remark that not only is a suitable moral state necessary for it as seen in Jacob, but as Exodus teaches us, if God is to dwell with men, it must be in that which is built according to His own directions.<a name=414:2></a> It seems clear from chapter 15 that the people had it in mind that He should have a dwelling, and there is good authority for the ordinary version that they would build a habitation for Him, "he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation".<a name=414:3></a> In chapter 25 God proposes it Himself "Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them".<a name=414:4></a> Note He uses the word <i>sanctuary</i>.<a name=414:5></a> Thus God indicated clearly that if He were to dwell with men it must be in that which is wholly according to His own mind; that is, there must be nothing of man or of human wisdom.<a name=414:6></a> Besides this, what is to be especially noted is, that whilst we have all the instructions as to the building, yet the actual construction of it did not begin until after Moses had acted as is recorded in chapters 32 and 33, which we read this morning.<a name=414:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=414:8></a>S.<a name=414:9></a> God had intimated His mind before that.<a name=414:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=414:11></a> Yes, but the fact that the tabernacle is first pitched as separated from an evil scene is very significant.<a name=414:12></a> The man of God in that way emphasises the <i>moral foundation</i> of the system; it must be on the ground of separation from evil.<a name=414:13></a> That principle must be there.<a name=414:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=415:2></a> That is what I was thinking, so that the principle of the judgment of evil marks the foundation of the system; I think this is what exercises our brethren here at the present time.<a name=415:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=415:4></a> The whole thing suggests that spiritual intelligence acts on the first principles given us in Scripture.<a name=415:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>we get that God divided the light from the darkness, and really that principle governs everything in the divine sphere thereafter.<a name=415:6></a> I mean that what we get in these chapters 32 and 33 of this book is activity on that line, separating light from darkness.<a name=415:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=415:8></a> Yes, and unrelenting judgment of the evil.<a name=415:9></a> It says, "Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=415:10></a> let him come unto me.<a name=415:11></a> And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.<a name=415:12></a> And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.<a name=415:13></a> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.<a name=415:14></a> For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord: even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day".<a name=415:15></a> It occurred to me that, whilst the principle of separation is there, there is also the principle of unmitigated judgment of evil.<a name=415:16></a> I believe that in separating from what is evil there should be a testimony to the fact that God's judgment is upon it.<a name=415:17></a>

		F.L.<a name=422:1></a> I would like to suggest that the position established by Moses in the tabernacle being pitched outside the camp was answered to after the death of Christ, when Israel lay under the fearful guilt of it; the disciples were all with one accord in one place, really outside the whole camp of Israel, to which the moral guilt of the death of Christ attached, and the Spirit of God came and identified Himself with them in that outside place, and baptised them into one body, which became the new element from henceforth so that really what we see on the day of Pentecost is very similar to what we see with Moses.<a name=422:2></a> It embraced all the moral element that remained after that fearful deed.<a name=422:3></a>

		It has come before me today that the Lord in His service was peculiarly constructive; whilst overthrowing what He found here prejudicial to God and to man, He was at the same time constructive; He was in this way in keeping with the prophetic word in the book of Zechariah, where it is said that the opposers of the people of God, of Israel, were frayed by four carpenters.<a name=475:1></a> Carpenters are not for destruction, but for <i>construction</i>, and so the Lord in overthrowing what was opposed to God and to man, spiritually constructed what should remain and supersede that which He overthrew.<a name=475:2></a> This is seen particularly in the way in which He brings in His Father and His planting; the enemy's work has always in view the effacing of God and what He is.<a name=475:3></a>
