		J.T.<a name=1:5></a> Scripture abounds with intimations that the dispensation in which we are is heavenly, and one hopes we may be helped to a more concrete understanding of this qualification.<a name=1:6></a> The heavenly character of the dispensation is admitted theoretically amongst us, but whether it is understood is a question.<a name=1:7></a> Current public events give occasion to bring out the concreteness of the truth of the heavenly character of christianity.<a name=1:8></a> The confession of the Lord Jesus before Pilate, recorded in our chapter, which is peculiar to John, will help us as to the initial thought in the subject, the Lord Jesus saying, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#18:36">John  18:36</a>).<a name=1:9></a> This statement of the Lord is the kernel of the whole matter.<a name=1:10></a> In other dispensations from the very outset, the sword was used.<a name=1:11></a> War meant war in the physical sense, and this character of warfare will be resumed when the Lord Jesus returns publicly.<a name=1:12></a> In the meanwhile, as far as christians are concerned, the sword is put into the sheath (<a href="../bible/John.htm#18:11">John  18:11</a>).<a name=1:13></a> "Our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:12">Ephesians  6:12</a>).<a name=1:14></a> The Lord's words before Pilate are especially alluded to by the apostle Paul, "Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:13">1 Timothy  6:13</a>).<a name=1:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The present time affords much opportunity to witness a good confession as to the character of the

		dispensation, and many are availing themselves of it.<a name=2:1></a> God is ordering it, confessions are reaching the authorities as the Lord's confession reached Pilate.<a name=2:2></a> The Lord is pleased with the confessions that are being rendered, and the hope is that what may come before us may strengthen the position in that respect, especially that the idea of a good conscience towards God and before men may be clarified.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord leads the way here, and in this first reading our remarks should bear on the phase of the subject in the passage read.<a name=2:4></a> Later we may be able to see the practical working out of the heavenly dispensation in our lives, as taught in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>; later still in the truth of the heavenly calling in Ephesians; and the heavenly priesthood, entering into the service of God as shown in Hebrews: that in result we may have a clearer idea of the whole position, that it is really heavenly.<a name=2:5></a> Our contact with the earth is provisional in the sense that the assembly is of heaven; formed on the earth and used here for heavenly testimony at the moment, but received back into heaven as having spiritually come out of heaven.<a name=2:6></a> That is the general idea of what is in mind.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.R.<a name=2:8></a>T.<a name=2:9></a> Is your thought that the matter of confession has to do with the kingdom of heaven?<a name=2:10></a> Our confession as to our allegiance among men is a great matter just now, but the allegiance to Christ made Lord in heaven is much greater.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:12></a> Quite so.<a name=2:13></a> John's presentation of the matter is intelligible as entering into these last days, how the truth works out in remnant times.<a name=2:14></a> So that the chapter is a unique one, beginning with the Lord in the garden, not here called Gethsemane, because the idea of pressure is not the side of the truth presented in John.<a name=2:15></a> It is the Lord in liberty and power so that when He says, "I am he", His enemies "went away backward and fell to the ground" (verse 6).<a name=2:16></a> Throughout He is in liberty and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in peculiar power, which is applicable at the present time as to what is needed -- a knowledge of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, who He is divinely; and liberty in relation to that.<a name=3:1></a> We have priesthood in this chapter under the enemy's power, in Annas and Caiaphas, and on the other hand Peter's denial of the Lord Jesus without any repentance attached to it.<a name=3:2></a> In John we have the character of the general position in the last days indicated in this chapter, and the Lord's confession coming in in these verses as the guide for the young men and for all of us at such a time.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.R.<a name=3:4></a> What other dispensations do you refer to, and what would be the character of them with which you intend to contrast our dispensation?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> Paul says, "these things happened as types of us" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:6">1 Corinthians  10:6</a>); and in verse 11, "all these things happened to them as types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come".<a name=3:7></a> That would mean that there is capability contemplated in the assembly to take up everything; it is, as it were, a clearing house for the principles of all the dispensations.<a name=3:8></a> The assembly in which the all-various wisdom of God is active is, viewed normally, equal to this.<a name=3:9></a> All these principles are seen worked out in the very best hands, first in the Lord Jesus Himself, and then in the assembly in which the Holy Spirit dwells.<a name=3:10></a> The Spirit guides us into all the truth so that we understand divine principles, wherever they are, or however expressed.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The antediluvian period involved great root principles and the Spirit has opened them up to us through certain ministries divinely provided.<a name=3:12></a> We may regard it as a dispensation.<a name=3:13></a> That period of long lives was more extended than ours, but is covered by only six chapters of the Bible; but what histories and principles they contain!<a name=3:14></a> These all were written for us.<a name=3:15></a> They enter into our own times, but yet had application at that time.<a name=3:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the idea of God's call, seen in Abraham, involving the great family of faith.<a name=4:1></a> There is no calling out of the antediluvian world, although there was suffering for the truth, calling on the name of Jehovah, separation and walk with God as apostasy set in.<a name=4:2></a> It is after the flood that the call comes in, when idolatry had gained a footing.<a name=4:3></a> Nothing is said about idolatry in the first world.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Exodus introduces the dispensation of law under Moses.<a name=4:5></a> It continued on to Christ; but features were added, each of which had in itself a dispensatory character: judges as set up of God; and particularly kingship as inaugurated in David, through whom the royal seed was established.<a name=4:6></a> All these dispensations are only intelligible in the assembly; in their full significance they awaited the presence of Christ on earth, and, redemption accomplished, the presence of the Holy Spirit here in the assembly.<a name=4:7></a> The principles involved could not otherwise be perfectly administered nor even fully understood; the prophets sought to understand the things they ministered, and it was revealed to them that it was to us they ministered them (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:10">1 Peter  1:10</a> - 13).<a name=4:8></a> The Psalms express the greatest spirituality and it is quite plain that in speaking of the principles of the earlier dispensations they had Christ in view.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.R.<a name=4:10></a> You think then that God has in mind the assembly as the consummation of all the dispensations?<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:12></a> Yes, the divine thought is that, not only what comes out of heaven, but everything to be established in the millennium is to be made intelligible in the assembly.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=4:14></a>F.<a name=4:15></a> This thought of witnessing a good confession enters into our own period and it also extends back to the dispensations which have gone before, does it not?<a name=4:16></a> Paul and Stephen are examples in the former, and

		Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in Old Testament times.<a name=5:1></a> You get a climax as to this in the passage before us -- "Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession".<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:3></a> Just so.<a name=5:4></a> We have it in a supreme way here, and it is taken up in the epistles for our learning.<a name=5:5></a> Perhaps before we enter fully into the verses read we should grasp the teaching of the chapter, that we may understand the conditions that occasioned the truth the Lord developed.<a name=5:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The garden into which the Lord and His disciples entered is noted, and Judas and his band came there.<a name=5:7></a> "Judas therefore, having got the band, and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons" (verse 3).<a name=5:8></a> That is, it is an apostate crowd coming back to attack the Lord with light, such as lanterns and torches; also with weapons.<a name=5:9></a> Then, "Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them, Whom seek ye?<a name=5:10></a>" (verse 4).<a name=5:11></a> "Knowing all things".<a name=5:12></a> We are not to be in the dark as to these circumstances; whatever the enemy may be thinking of, the saints are to know.<a name=5:13></a> John says elsewhere, "<i>ye</i> have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:20">1 John  2:20</a>).<a name=5:14></a> Then the Lord says, "Whom seek ye?<a name=5:15></a> They answered him, Jesus the Nazaraean.<a name=5:16></a> Jesus says to them, I am he.<a name=5:17></a> And Judas also, who delivered him up, stood with them.<a name=5:18></a> When therefore he said to them, I am he, they went away backward and fell to the ground" (verses 5, 6).<a name=5:19></a> So that there is <i>triumph manifested in relation to the Person of Christ</i>.<a name=5:20></a> As long as the Person of Christ is the basis of the position, then nothing can stand before it.<a name=5:21></a> This being attested, the Lord allows Himself to be bound and led away.<a name=5:22></a>

		C.A.<a name=5:23></a>M.<a name=5:24></a> They were against the name of Jesus the Nazaraean, the despised Man.<a name=5:25></a> But what came out was that they were also against God.<a name=5:26></a>

		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:1></a> That is it.<a name=6:2></a> The Lord accepts the lowly title.<a name=6:3></a> He says, "I am he", but then, a divine Person was there, God was there.<a name=6:4></a> He answered to the name, "Jesus the Nazaraean", but who He was expressed itself in power as He said, "I am he".<a name=6:5></a> "They went away backward and fell to the ground".<a name=6:6></a> 'He' is not in the original, so that His Person is expressed in 'I am'.<a name=6:7></a> "Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them, Whom seek ye?<a name=6:8></a> They answered him, Jesus the Nazaraean.<a name=6:9></a> Jesus says to them, I am he".<a name=6:10></a> When He said to them "I am he, they went away backward and fell to the ground".<a name=6:11></a> That is the basis of the whole position: Jesus is I Am.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The will of God was that He should die.<a name=6:13></a> Peter uses the sword, but the Lord says to him, "Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=6:14></a>" That is the position, the will of God; whatever God orders is according to His will, and the responsibility of the believer is to stand by that; in connection with it is the divine presence and nothing can overcome it.<a name=6:15></a> The will of God must be accepted, even if it involves death, as we see in the Lord here, but the presence of God with us and the power that marks it settles all for the faithful believer.<a name=6:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.D.<a name=6:17></a>S.<a name=6:18></a> What is the import of His asking of them again in verse 7, "Whom seek ye?<a name=6:19></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:20></a> Well, that is to bring out what was definitely in the minds of the betrayer and his band; so they said again, "Jesus the Nazaraean".<a name=6:21></a> Then "Jesus answered, I told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go away; that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, As to those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them".<a name=6:22></a> That is, the saints are being looked after in these terrible situations.<a name=6:23></a> The Lord is there, His Person is in evidence and the power

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.R.<a name=7:5></a>T.<a name=7:6></a> Would it be right to say that the opposition of the enemy in the various dispensations takes character from the vessel that God is using for the moment?<a name=7:7></a> That is, the opposition of the enemy here is centred against Christ as here in the flesh.<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:9></a> Yes; thus He challenges them: "Whom seek ye?<a name=7:10></a>" It is a question of the will of God, and hence those who are attacked are not evading anything that may come upon them in the way of suffering, for the will of God must stand.<a name=7:11></a> But the Lord shows here that He has power to deliver His servants.<a name=7:12></a> He allows His enemies to take Him, but says, "let these go away;" He takes care of His people.<a name=7:13></a> That is one of the greatest comforts.<a name=7:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=7:15></a>H.<a name=7:16></a> Would what you are saying enter into Paul's account of the Lord's supper?<a name=7:17></a> He says, "the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:23">1 Corinthians  11:23</a>).<a name=7:18></a> He uses the term "Lord" as well as "Jesus" -- the Lord, and yet Jesus, that very Person.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:20></a> Quite so.<a name=7:21></a> He "took bread, and having given thanks broke it", verse 24.<a name=7:22></a> He is in the circle of the saints.<a name=7:23></a> It is in view of His going away and leaving something for their affections by which they should remember Him.<a name=7:24></a> Here He is taking care of the saints.<a name=7:25></a> "If therefore ye seek me, let these go away; that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, As to those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them".<a name=7:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=7:27></a>F.<a name=7:28></a> The Lord jealously takes care of what should characterise the situation.<a name=7:29></a> On the one hand, divine power was there in Him, on the other hand He would not allow Peter's sword to falsify the position.<a name=7:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:31></a> That is right; He healed the ear of the bondman of the high priest (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:51">Luke  22:51</a>).<a name=7:32></a> In view of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:6></a> I thought of that.<a name=8:7></a> How miserable the whole effort was, including their lanterns and torches!<a name=8:8></a> Compare them with Christ -- the light and power manifest in Him!<a name=8:9></a> How morally despicable was this band of Judas!<a name=8:10></a> With the betrayer were the representatives of the accepted current religion to arrest and crucify the Lord of glory!<a name=8:11></a> It is really an apostate band with their pretended lights, but the Lord exposes them, especially their impotence.<a name=8:12></a> But still He is not destroying them.<a name=8:13></a> Infinite power was there, but instead of using it against His enemies, He allows Himself to be taken, directing that they should let the disciples go away.<a name=8:14></a> Like the ark in the wilderness, He was really taking a three days' journey to find a resting-place for His own, (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10:33">Numbers  10:33</a>).<a name=8:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.R.<a name=8:16></a>T.<a name=8:17></a> Does this passage also indicate the greatness of the Person?<a name=8:18></a> It says, "that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke".<a name=8:19></a> We have referred to the Lord fulfilling the prophetic word in Scripture, but here His own word takes that place.<a name=8:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:21></a> Yes.<a name=8:22></a> The allusions to the fulfilment of Scripture in this gospel are striking; that nothing is left out.<a name=8:23></a> In John everything is according to plan, you might say, in spite of all that has happened, in spite of the darkening influences of the middle ages and what has come down to us today, everything is proceeding in our time according to divine ordering.<a name=8:24></a> "These things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#19:36">John  19:36</a>).<a name=8:25></a> When the Scriptures are assailed by so-called critics, with their "lanterns and

		J.T.<a name=9:5></a> That is the idea.<a name=9:6></a> The Spirit of God is here speaking ironically of the boasted light of modern science as to the things of God.<a name=9:7></a> The leaders have torches and lanterns and weapons; with the weapons, they will persecute.<a name=9:8></a> The weapons go with the lanterns.<a name=9:9></a> The Lord says to Peter, "Put the sword into the sheath".<a name=9:10></a> <i>You</i> are not to use such a weapon.<a name=9:11></a> Doing the will of God may involve persecution.<a name=9:12></a> The Lord here says, "The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=9:13></a>" Judas and his band have their lanterns and torches and weapons to do harm to Him who is doing the will of God.<a name=9:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=137:1></a> Our subject this morning is Aaron and Miriam.<a name=137:2></a> It reminds us at the outset of the brotherly spirit in service; it is not a question of gift, but brotherly feeling and affection, and ability to speak, and through this the obligation to take a secondary place in service -- not an independent line as with the apostles.<a name=137:3></a> Each apostle had his own line of ministry.<a name=137:4></a> In this type it is the same ministry, the same current of things, and the introduction of the brother, or brothers, of a brotherly spirit, with readiness to take a second place in order to augment the position already inaugurated.<a name=137:5></a> Aaron appears as an afterthought.<a name=137:6></a> God intimated that He would go on with Moses alone, but Moses felt weak and unable to take the service up by himself, and so God in this first passage tells him about his brother, or rather by his question, reminds him of him.<a name=137:7></a> "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=137:8></a> I know that he can speak well".<a name=137:9></a> Aaron represents divine resources and reserves, but he is not brought in in any way to supplant Moses but to supplement his service.<a name=137:10></a> So that the deficiency that Moses asserted of himself is to be made up, the whole position is to be buttressed by the addition of Aaron.<a name=137:11></a> The verses read in chapters 6 and 7 show respectively the ages of the men.<a name=137:12></a> Aaron was older than Moses, which would not be an accident; God intended that there should be, through this fact, occasion of exercise in each of the brothers.<a name=137:13></a> Moses would have to overcome by moral power the discrepancy of age.<a name=137:14></a> Aaron came to that in time because he called him lord, showing that the moral feature is a great thing in service.<a name=137:15></a> Miriam is Aaron's sister in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>, but in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#26">Numbers  26</a>she is 'their' sister, just the three in the family so far as the record goes.<a name=137:16></a> They will be tested

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=138:9></a> Well, he follows in happy accord: "And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.<a name=138:10></a> And he went, and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him.<a name=138:11></a> And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent him, and all the signs that he had commanded him.<a name=138:12></a> And Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel; and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses".<a name=138:13></a> He did not add a word of his own apparently, but just spoke the words that God had spoken to Moses; so he falls into the position at once.<a name=138:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=139:26></a> Yes; the Lord sent out the apostles and the seventy others two and two.<a name=139:27></a> The point here is that Aaron shall augment fully what has already been inaugurated; therefore the connection in those cases would be that the brotherly spirit is allied with the apostolic spirit in Paul.<a name=139:28></a> The authority of God in Moses, or in Paul, might be too much for the brethren, so that the addition of a brother or brothers is intended

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=141:12></a> That is important, and is more plainly stated in chapter 6.<a name=141:13></a> Here God says in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:16">Exodus  4:16</a>, "And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God".<a name=141:14></a> God has made both mouths and He is going to give effect to both mouths, and in result I expect Moses' mouth exceeded Aaron's.<a name=141:15></a> In the meantime God is taking the matter in hand.<a name=141:16></a> It is a great undertaking.<a name=141:17></a> As we are entering on the service of God, we are entering on a great matter; it is already inaugurated, and it is a question whether we can fit in.<a name=141:18></a> Here God says, I am going to be with both your mouths; so that both increase in power, increase together.<a name=141:19></a> Therefore their speech would be a fit representation of God because there would be no disparity at all, no divided thought.<a name=141:20></a> Then in chapter 6 Moses raises the question of his poor speaking again.<a name=141:21></a> He says he is "of uncircumcised lips".<a name=141:22></a> It is a critical stage: Moses is not yet established and Aaron has come on the scene and chapter 5 is the crisis.<a name=141:23></a> God is hardening Pharaoh.<a name=141:24></a> It is a testing time and Moses is still afraid of his speaking powers, which is rather poor because God had said He would be with his mouth.<a name=141:25></a>

		I wish to occupy you with the Spirit of Christ, whether viewed as operating by Himself, or in vessels employed by Him; and how He constitutes those in whom He is, in whom He moves and works, likeable to heaven.<a name=235:1></a> They are likeable to men, in measure, but principally to the saints, for in truth what is pleasing to God in the saints is characteristically displeasing to men, which necessarily implies persecution.<a name=235:2></a> But I am speaking now of the Spirit of Christ as constituting those in whom He is likeable to God and to one another, as Enoch was.<a name=235:3></a> Those who have Him please God.<a name=235:4></a> And they are caused to know that they please God and that they are worthy of divine care and protection; that indeed the Lord Jesus, whose Spirit dwells in them and characterises them, would have them with Himself, not merely to protect them, but because He loves them, and would have them where He is.<a name=235:5></a>

		So I read from the history of Noah, and that history includes the early activities recorded in Scripture of the Spirit of Christ.<a name=235:6></a> I may say here that the Spirit of Christ, or the Spirit of God -- for the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God -- may act or move as the Spirit of God or as the Spirit of Christ according to the necessities of the testimony.<a name=235:7></a> And so it is that Genesis begins the history of the Spirit by connecting Him with a chaotic condition of things.<a name=235:8></a> Chaos is not foreign to us.<a name=235:9></a> The more we are possessed of the Spirit of God, the more we discern it, whether physically or morally.<a name=235:10></a> And so the first presentation we have of the Spirit is in relation to what is chaotic.<a name=235:11></a> He was not turning His back on it, leaving it, but He was hovering over it, over the face of the waters; so that we are reminded that the Spirit of God leads in occupation with a chaotic condition in

		Then we find Him in a limited state of things, some one hundred and twenty years, for we are now in time; that is the sixth of Genesis.<a name=236:11></a> Jehovah says, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man".<a name=236:12></a> The striving is not said to be with chaos, although morally it was, but it was with man.<a name=236:13></a> God is showing that He is not for the moment dealing with the earth or the seas, but with men.<a name=236:14></a> His Spirit, having hovered over the material waters and indirectly the earth, is now occupied with men, and as striving with them.<a name=236:15></a> Those of us who have to do with evil in men and in ourselves, each in himself, know the power of striving by the Spirit of God.<a name=236:16></a> The Spirit indeed would enlist the individual on His side to

		So that the ministry meeting involves the prophets searching, as Peter says here, "Searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these.<a name=255:14></a> To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things".<a name=255:15></a> Isaiah ministered in the days of Hezekiah, and other prophets did, too.<a name=255:16></a> But he would say, I must not confine myself to meeting Hezekiah's position, I must be thinking of the future, perhaps thousands of years from now.<a name=255:17></a> It is Isaiah who tells us that Cyrus was selected by God before he was born.<a name=255:18></a> Well, if he was selected before he was born to do a great service, then Isaiah would have in mind that

		some little bit of his ministry must slip along the line down to Cyrus.<a name=256:1></a> I am only citing that as an illustration.<a name=256:2></a> But look at what John says about Isaiah, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:41">John  12:41</a>).<a name=256:3></a> Christ's glory!<a name=256:4></a> Isaiah was ministering in the power of the Spirit of Christ, and he saw beyond the current moment.<a name=256:5></a> He saw the glory of Christ.<a name=256:6></a> It was a question of the sufferings and the glories.<a name=256:7></a> So that John says, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him".<a name=256:8></a> That is a good example for any little effort we put forth in our prophetic meetings: not only to take account of the present -- though we must take account of the present, as I was saying -- but then, let us be in the Spirit of Christ.<a name=256:9></a> The Spirit of Christ has a long outlook.<a name=256:10></a> He is thinking of Christ; He is thinking of the coming generations in relation to Christ.<a name=256:11></a> So that as the testimony proceeds, it will be found that the Spirit of Christ has provided what it needs; and it is largely that the young might take on the truth and carry forward the witness of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.<a name=256:12></a>

		What a wonderful theme we have, dear brethren, in the Spirit of Christ!<a name=256:13></a> So that our meetings should take on the character of <i>searching</i>.<a name=256:14></a> No one will ever be effective unless he does search for the truth.<a name=256:15></a> And who is the Searcher, really?<a name=256:16></a> The Spirit of God.<a name=256:17></a> He "searches all things, even the depths of God".<a name=256:18></a> And if we are to minister at any given time, at any given place, as in us, He knows the hearts of the saints who are there.<a name=256:19></a> There is a link between the saints and the depths of God.<a name=256:20></a> "Man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the inner parts of the belly" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#20:27">Proverbs  20:27</a>).<a name=256:21></a> There must be the searching of the inner parts; so that the Lord in preparation for the prophetic ministry would have in mind on the one hand the depths of God, the wonderful possibilities there are to be brought forward, and on the other hand, the measure of the saints.<a name=256:22></a> Then, also,

		Then, thirdly, there is this matter of the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<a name=257:9></a> That is spoken of in Philippians.<a name=257:10></a> The assembly there was the door into Europe, as we have often noted.<a name=257:11></a> The testimony rolled westward through the great vessel that God had provided for this service.<a name=257:12></a> He was called into it.<a name=257:13></a> Indeed, he saw the man of Macedonia in a vision calling for help, and the Philippian assembly was formed, leading into the western world.<a name=257:14></a> The western world involves this city that we are in now, this country and continent.<a name=257:15></a> This continent is the western extremity of the western world, and the Spirit of God had in mind through Paul to bring forward here this thought of the Spirit of Christ, the supply of it.<a name=257:16></a> Most of us who have come to this country came to better our temporal circumstances, not that there is any discredit in that.<a name=257:17></a> Some have not, but most have.<a name=257:18></a> God's mercy is seen in the wonderful

		And so we get one person in Philippi to exemplify what I am saying in a special way.<a name=258:11></a> Her name was Lydia, and she was a seller of purple.<a name=258:12></a> Mercantile employ is not out of order.<a name=258:13></a> It marks this country in an extensive way.<a name=258:14></a> Farming, of course, is a great industry, largely so because everything depends on the field.<a name=258:15></a> "The king himself is dependent upon the field" (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#5:9">Ecclesiastes  5:9</a>).<a name=258:16></a> The cities cannot supply the country, the country supplies the city.<a name=258:17></a> "Prepare thy work without, and put thy field in order, and afterwards build thy house" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#24:27">Proverbs  24:27</a>).<a name=258:18></a> So that if Lydia were to come over here she would probably find a market for purple.<a name=258:19></a> The Spirit of God opened her heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul.<a name=258:20></a> She would have to pay her bills when she bought the purple if she were to be like Noah and be righteous, for when you are paying your bills you are attending to righteousness.<a name=258:21></a> That is quite obvious, and she would pay her bills, you may be sure.<a name=258:22></a> But the Lord opened her heart to attend to other and greater things -- more important than selling purple, farming, insurance work or whatever it may be.<a name=258:23></a> I do not like

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A distinguished personage is in this section, as in chapter 8, which we considered yesterday, but he is distinguished, not so much because he is a Roman officer, but because he is pious.<a name=327:3></a> There was piety among the gentiles.<a name=327:4></a> This would show, without naming it, that the Holy Spirit had had to do with him.<a name=327:5></a> According to John's presentation of the truth, we have had nothing of new birth so far in this book, but we have to regard its presence here: "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:8">John  3:8</a>).<a name=327:6></a> The result of the Spirit's work is clear, here, as the chapter says, "But a certain man in Caesarea, -- by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic, pious, and fearing God with all his house, both giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:1">Acts  10:1</a>, 2).<a name=327:7></a> So that the incoming of the gentiles is not presented as though they were raw material, but as material already affected by God.<a name=327:8></a> We could not otherwise possibly have such a man as this; no Roman culture, tuition, or influence could effect it, but indeed the contrary.<a name=327:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we might dwell a little on the sovereign action of the Spirit seen here, not in word, but in effect, to make way for His active service in verses 19, 20 where He spoke to Peter, and told him, "Behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because <i>I</i> have sent them".<a name=327:10></a> The Spirit now is in charge of conditions with which He has already had to do, which indeed He had effected.<a name=327:11></a>

		Nothing could be more interesting, for we, that is the gentiles, were, as represented in Cornelius and his company, admitted, not as crude raw material, but as persons described in this chapter, affected by the Spirit.<a name=328:1></a> On the other hand, viewed apart from any divine operation we were dark and without God.<a name=328:2></a> Indeed, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:12">Ephesians  2:12</a> says, "ye were at that time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world".<a name=328:3></a> But God is letting us know that He is the God of the gentiles, and that He has already been operating.<a name=328:4></a> Indeed as far back as the deluge, as far back as the distribution of the race in the sons of Noah, I believe God was operating in view of the western nations coming into the economy which is set up now in Christ by the Spirit.<a name=328:5></a> That is, Japheth denotes <i>spreading</i> in the political developments in the west, and God undoubtedly had to do with them providentially to make way for the gospel; not the everlasting gospel, but the gospel which had the assembly in mind, for that is the gospel today.<a name=328:6></a> Cornelius was a household man; you would hardly get such a man in the east.<a name=328:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=328:12></a> Yes.<a name=328:13></a> Actually the Ethiopian and Cornelius received it in the same territory, only that the eunuch was said to be one "who had come to worship at Jerusalem".<a name=328:14></a> I should think he was a proselyte, such as many who were at Jerusalem when the Spirit came; that is, he was in religious relation to the Jews.<a name=328:15></a> Cornelius is one who fears God; but he is not viewed just in this way, but also as a military man, "a centurion of the band called Italic".<a name=328:16></a> I think he represents the Roman system.<a name=328:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=336:8></a> I would; there are many corresponding results.<a name=336:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=336:13></a> No, that is after you have believed the gospel of your salvation, "in whom <i>ye</i> also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>).<a name=336:14></a> He had not believed the gospel of salvation, it had not been presented to him yet, but it is about to be presented through Peter.<a name=336:15></a> Clearly he and those gathered with him believed it, for, as the preaching went on, the Spirit fell upon them.<a name=336:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=336:17></a> Would you say the work of the preacher links on with the work of the Holy Spirit?<a name=336:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=336:19></a> Yes.<a name=336:20></a> The work of the Holy Spirit may take place in the gospel and persons be converted, as in Peter's case at Caesarea, and clearly the Spirit operated in those three thousand at Jerusalem; otherwise they would not have believed as they did.<a name=336:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=336:22></a> Do you view in new birth the action of the Spirit from the standpoint of His sovereignty as a divine Person, or as an instrumental power or agency, or both?<a name=336:23></a> I am thinking of the Lord Jesus in relation to creation.<a name=336:24></a> In Colossians He is alluded to in both ways, as acting in sovereignty in His power as a divine Person, and as the instrument, all things being created by Him.<a name=336:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=337:1></a> I understand that the Spirit operates sovereignly in relation to the light.<a name=337:2></a> New birth is not presented as the effect of light, it is presented as the immediate work of the Spirit in a person.<a name=337:3></a> The Lord said to Nicodemus, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:3">John  3:3</a>).<a name=337:4></a> The light stands in relation to the kingdom; new birth is an act by itself, so that without it "he cannot see the kingdom of God".<a name=337:5></a> That means he has no light at all.<a name=337:6></a> Before new birth he had no power to see, but now he has and what he sees is what the light discloses.<a name=337:7></a> Light contemplates the objective side of the truth, and the gospel is the full thought of it.<a name=337:8></a> So what Cornelius needed here was the gospel; he already, clearly, was the subject of the Spirit's work.<a name=337:9></a>

		J.R.<a name=337:10></a>H.<a name=337:11></a> Perhaps that helps as to the matter of directions.<a name=337:12></a> Cornelius gets his directions from the angel, but Peter from the Spirit.<a name=337:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=337:14></a> Quite so; with Cornelius distance is still there.<a name=337:15></a> He could not say, "Abba, Father", intelligently or feelingly, because he did not have deliverance.<a name=337:16></a> Light is necessary, too, but deliverance lies in the Spirit.<a name=337:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=338:4></a> The Spirit Himself, although it is God's work.<a name=338:5></a> One of the features of the truth which is before us is that the Spirit is God.<a name=338:6></a> He is no less than God: "in whom <i>ye</i> also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:22">Ephesians  2:22</a>).<a name=338:7></a> It is God here in Spirit, so that what the Spirit does, God does.<a name=338:8></a> Therefore when Peter gives the account in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:17">Acts  11:17</a> of what the Spirit had done, he says, "who indeed was <i>I</i> to be able to forbid God?<a name=338:9></a>" The Spirit had acted, Peter tells them that, which meant it was God that acted.<a name=338:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=338:11></a> In our first reading you spoke of the indirect reference to the deity of the Spirit in chapter 5, which might be quoted here: "Thou has not lied to men, but to God", verse 4.<a name=338:12></a> Verse 3 says it was to the Holy Spirit they had lied.<a name=338:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=338:14></a> That is right; and thirdly in verse 9 it is "the Spirit of the Lord", against whom they had sinned, so the three divine Persons are there.<a name=338:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=338:21></a> I think it is more, because it is the Lord personally set before the soul, which is by the gospel.<a name=338:22></a> So not only is there the work of the Comforter, but the drawing power of the Father to Christ; hence the three divine Persons are always operating in the salvation of one soul.<a name=338:23></a>

		connection, because we must always understand Scripture contextually.<a name=487:1></a> The word <i>salvation</i> here refers to the working out of the truth of the gospel in a man's soul.<a name=487:2></a> Even Paul needed the gospel; he needed it right through.<a name=487:3></a> He tells the Romans, "now is our salvation nearer than when we believed" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:11">Romans  13:11</a>).<a name=487:4></a> That does not mean that any Roman or any Philippian christian who might die at any time would not go to be with the Lord; it means that the true believer is to go through to the end which the gospel has in view.<a name=487:5></a> And so in this epistle the apostle says, "work out your own salvation" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:12">Philippians  2:12</a>) -- work it out.<a name=487:6></a> Well, you inquire, am I thus depending upon myself?<a name=487:7></a> No, you are not depending upon yourself.<a name=487:8></a> There is a very large sect in this country which holds that at one time one might be <i>saved</i> through the death of the Lord Jesus and afterwards be lost, which is false.<a name=487:9></a> When the Philippian jailor asked the apostle how to be saved, he said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:31">Acts  16:31</a>) -- believe on the Lord Jesus.<a name=487:10></a> That is salvation on the principle of <i>faith</i>.<a name=487:11></a> But then the salvation you have has to be worked out like a gold mine, if you are to obtain the full gain of it.<a name=487:12></a> It becomes yours through faith, otherwise you could not work it out.<a name=487:13></a> That is what Paul means here; he speaks of his own salvation.<a name=487:14></a> He says, "I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation".<a name=487:15></a> Even the prayers of the saints would help him.<a name=487:16></a> He tells the Philippians to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, for, he says, "it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure".<a name=487:17></a> So that, we have here, as I said, fruit from certain sowing by Paul and Silas that was good.<a name=487:18></a> Without going further on that line, he is able to speak in this way to them about their helping him in his salvation -- a most remarkable thing; so that the most spiritual man, as we might say, on the earth then, looked to the brethren to remember

		And so he brings in this additional thought, that I have especially in mind; namely, "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" -- a very fine phrase; not that he would get all there was, because it is infinite, but he would get his part, whatever he needed.<a name=488:2></a> The Lord is always very ready to pour in a supply of His Spirit; it is an infinite reservoir in heaven, in Christ; each of us always needs a supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<a name=488:3></a> Do not forget the brethren.<a name=488:4></a> Some of you may be saying, You are making too much of the brethren; but I am not making more of them than Paul did; not any more than the Lord Jesus did.<a name=488:5></a> We cannot do without the brethren.<a name=488:6></a> As I said before, if one is converted, he is secured for God for ever; if God begins a work in my soul, it is going on to completion, but as to practical christianity, we need the assembly; we need the saints; we need their prayers; we need their fellowship; we need their example; we need their affections.<a name=488:7></a> So we cannot be isolated; we cannot be so many units; the idea is to be characteristically of and in the assembly.<a name=488:8></a> "To whom coming, a living stone .<a name=488:9></a>.<a name=488:10></a>.<a name=488:11></a> yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:4">1 Peter  2:4</a>, 5).<a name=488:12></a> That is christianity; that is the practical working out of the truth.<a name=488:13></a> Individual salvation is an initial thought and runs on with what I have been saying.<a name=488:14></a> The jailor at Philippi felt the need of it, and hence his question, "what must I do that I may be saved", and the answer, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house".<a name=488:15></a> <i>Faith</i> is stressed in this side of the truth as affording one the unalterable possession of salvation in Christ Jesus.<a name=488:16></a> Possessing it in this way

		I now go on to David.<a name=492:6></a> This chapter in 1 Samuel which I read is a very crucial one: David had gone away among the Philistines; he evidently lost the joy of his soul and said, I will go to Achish, the king of the Philistines, and he did, and got into trouble.<a name=492:7></a> Anybody who goes to the Philistines is sure to suffer damage.<a name=492:8></a> Achish had given him Ziklag, and while he was away the Amalekites came to Ziklag and burned it and they carried away his wives and his children -- a terrible disaster.<a name=492:9></a> The position here, therefore, affords me an opportunity to bring out that when I come into disaster, terribly adverse things happening to me, if I am a real christian, I know where to turn.<a name=492:10></a> David turned to God.<a name=492:11></a> He "strengthened himself in Jehovah his God".<a name=492:12></a> Where else could he find real strength?<a name=492:13></a> He might have gone to the king of the Philistines and asked him to send down an army to retrieve the lost.<a name=492:14></a> No!<a name=492:15></a> he did not do that; he had learnt his lesson.<a name=492:16></a> He turned to God.<a name=492:17></a> As some of us were saying, the quality of a horse is seen in the manner of his recovering himself after he falls, and that is David.<a name=492:18></a> He knew how to get up.<a name=492:19></a> "The righteous falleth seven times, and riseth up again" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#24:16">Proverbs  24:16</a>).<a name=492:20></a> There is no license for falling seven times, nor for falling once, but if a real christian falls he will rise

		again; he has power in his soul and he knows where to turn; he knows God and that He is not different from what He was when He converted him; he knows He loves him as much as He did then; His grace is the same as it was then.<a name=493:1></a> And so David turned to God, as we have noted: "David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God".<a name=493:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I say all that of David as prefatory to what I wish to say as to the verses I read in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#30">1 Samuel  30</a>.<a name=493:3></a> David, through the great mercy of God, recovered all that the Amalekites had taken in their foray.<a name=493:4></a> A young Egyptian found in the field, who took part in the raid, but who had been left behind by his master because he fell sick, became, as revived, a ready instrument in David's great recovering achievement.<a name=493:5></a> All was brought back.<a name=493:6></a> And David went down and gained a great victory over the Amalekite army and recovered everything they had carried away -- not one thing lost, a very remarkable thing.<a name=493:7></a> It can only be true spiritually.<a name=493:8></a> You can hardly imagine an ordinary military incident of this kind without some loss, but in God's victories nothing is lost.<a name=493:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go on to verse 20, where we learn that David makes a division between cattle and cattle.<a name=493:10></a> I take these cattle as types of christians; some are called David's spoil; there must be differences.<a name=493:11></a> We sometimes have trouble with young christians marrying unbelievers, or marrying christians that are worldly; and when the latter are in question some neutral persons will say, He or she is a <i>christian</i>, why do you object?<a name=493:12></a> In the minds of many it differs from the meaning implied in its use by the Holy Spirit.<a name=493:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:26">Acts  11:26</a> it is said, that the disciples were first called christians in Antioch and <i>called</i> there has an oracular significance intimating that the saints had taken on the character of Christ.<a name=493:14></a> The Spirit of God says elsewhere, if one suffers "as a christian, let him not be ashamed, but glorify God in this name".<a name=493:15></a> If I am going to the theatre, am I glorifying God in that name?<a name=493:16></a>

		I am dishonouring God; I am dragging that name in the dirt, and the devil knows it.<a name=494:1></a> That is just what he seeks to accomplish in causing believers to become worldly.<a name=494:2></a> A christian who is influenced by the world dishonours Christ from whom the name <i>christian</i> is derived.<a name=494:3></a> So one who intends to marry a worldly person and justifies himself, because he or she is a professed believer, is deceiving himself.<a name=494:4></a> The man who was put away in Corinth was a christian in that sense, but he was <i>unfit for fellowship</i>.<a name=494:5></a> He was delivered to the devil that his flesh might be destroyed and his spirit saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<a name=494:6></a> In attaching the name christian to a worldly person, especially to conceal or justify my own unfaithfulness, is lowering it and hence dishonouring it.<a name=494:7></a> He is not deserving of it.<a name=494:8></a> If you are to marry, you are to marry <i>in the Lord</i> and that makes room for the word christian.<a name=494:9></a>

		I am speaking now of the cattle in this verse I read (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#30:20">1 Samuel  30:20</a>): "And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil".<a name=494:10></a> That is, there are other cattle besides those thus distinguished.<a name=494:11></a> Transferring the thought to nominal christians, they are David's spoil.<a name=494:12></a> Now the other cattle -- how many cattle there are!<a name=494:13></a> Let me just attempt to indicate the number of sects; they are more than I could count.<a name=494:14></a> I would not belong to a sect under any consideration; to belong to a sect is a dishonour to Christ, it is a dishonour to the saints, and it is a dishonour to myself.<a name=494:15></a> The Lord said: "all <i>ye</i> are brethren .<a name=494:16></a>.<a name=494:17></a>.<a name=494:18></a> for one is your Father, he who is in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:8">Matthew  23:8</a>, 9).<a name=494:19></a> Thus there are cattle <i>and</i> cattle.<a name=494:20></a> David says, The flocks and herds that are in the front are my spoil.<a name=494:21></a> There are others, not to be ignored, but they are not in the front.<a name=494:22></a> That is what he says: "David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil".<a name=494:23></a> We have to differentiate between the front ones

		and those others, and you are not to make these others the same as those; there are christians and christians, as I said.<a name=495:1></a> I want to be among those that are called David's spoil; persons that have been turned aside (and who has not been?<a name=495:2></a>) but have been restored, recovered to God; that is David's spoil.<a name=495:3></a> I want to be amongst those.<a name=495:4></a> They go <i>before</i> others; it was David's ordering.<a name=495:5></a> <i>This</i>, he said, "is David's spoil".<a name=495:6></a> This incident is remarkable in this section of Scripture which treats of recovery.<a name=495:7></a> It is the principle of <i>grading</i> among the people of God which enters into the divine way.<a name=495:8></a> Looking on the cattle brought back in a general way, and the position of those <i>they drove before the other cattle</i>, David said, "This is David's spoil".<a name=495:9></a>

		The next circumstance to be noted here is that there were two hundred men who were not able to go to the battle with David.<a name=495:10></a> He did not have a big army.<a name=495:11></a> He started with six hundred men, the most efficient soldiers that ever fought, but two hundred of them here were too weary to go on to the battle, to fight with these Amalekites, and they had to stay behind, which they did at the brook Besor.<a name=495:12></a> They stayed with the stuff; they were not idle; they looked after something.<a name=495:13></a> And now David is coming back with the spoil.<a name=495:14></a> And there are men here called sons of Belial, wicked men they are; and they would not share the spoil with those that remained at the brook.<a name=495:15></a> Verse 21 says, "And David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and whom they had left behind at the torrent Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and David drew near to the people and saluted them".<a name=495:16></a> That is beautiful: their great captain, saluting those who had been unable from exhaustion to join in the conflict, exhibits the Spirit of Christ.<a name=495:17></a> They were in David's eyes genuine people.<a name=495:18></a> The Lord Jesus in like manner honoured the women who had been at the

		Let us note this mournfully, because it is typical of what is current today.<a name=496:8></a> There are nominal christians about us who speak thus: they have no sympathy with weakness or weariness in the saints.<a name=496:9></a> We are enjoined to "comfort the faint-hearted, sustain the weak, be patient towards all" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:14">1 Thessalonians  5:14</a>).<a name=496:10></a> Failing in this spirit we are prone to think of ourselves only and thus fail of the characteristics of Christ's body as stated in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>.<a name=496:11></a> And now, as I said, we get the Spirit of Christ in David.<a name=496:12></a> In verse 23 he says, "Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah has given us, who has preserved us, and given the troop that came against us into our hand.<a name=496:13></a> And who will hearken to you in this matter?<a name=496:14></a> For as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike.<a name=496:15></a> And it was so from that day forward; and he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day".<a name=496:16></a> In this fine statement we have a landmark in the history of the testimony; this is a great statute of grace, a fixed principle: That he that abides by the baggage shall partake with those that go down to the battle; they shall share alike.<a name=496:17></a> In the light of it, as a type, christians must renounce churlish selfishness, and put on the Lord Jesus Christ, making no provision for the flesh, (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:14">Romans  13:14</a>).<a name=496:18></a>

		Well, the inquiry that is now to be made is, Are we here partakers of the spoil?<a name=496:19></a> We read in verse 26, "And David came to Ziklag, and he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Behold a
