		J.T.<a name=1:4></a> I have in mind the peculiar situation, which exists in these countries.<a name=1:5></a> The power of human associations to set aside what is of God, and whether the brethren are aware of it, and how it is to be met, and the means God has given to us, which is of course the Spirit, but the Spirit in a special way, that is what we have come to in the book of Hebrews: "Ye have come to mount Zion; and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem".<a name=1:6></a> I thought a little of the instrumentality of the Spirit in that sense, and what we have come to, amongst other things an innumerable company of angels, and whether we apprehend this in the book of Hebrews, and whether we are bringing these things in in prayer.<a name=1:7></a> The expression "Ye have come to", is not necessarily what we have personally and individually appropriated, but to what we have come.<a name=1:8></a> That is to say, it is available.<a name=1:9></a> It is a question of our nearness, and, of course, that would depend on our state.<a name=1:10></a> The expression "The Lord is near" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:5">Philippians  4:5</a>) is to indicate that He is not far away, but ready to join in where He is needed.<a name=1:11></a> So that it is a question of what brethren discern is needed.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=1:13></a> There is a system of things operating in Hebrews administratively under the Lord's hand.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:15></a> That is right, a system of things, Christ being the Head of it.<a name=1:16></a> Hence we have to learn to speak systematically, and to understand systematically, using our senses.<a name=1:17></a> So that Luke said he wrote

		with method.<a name=2:1></a> Every person, who believes is brought into the system, as at Pentecost three thousand were brought into it, and so as Peter finished, those who were affected spoke to Peter and the others; that is to say, they recognised the system.<a name=2:2></a> Peter was not everything; the Lord, of course, was everything, but yet in another sense He was not, because it was a system and included all that were added, because it says "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:47">Acts  2:47</a>)".<a name=2:3></a> The system was there and was added to.<a name=2:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.A.<a name=2:5></a>H.<a name=2:6></a> We are brought into this living system then, as added persons.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> The system did not begin until Christ ascended into heaven, and the Spirit came down.<a name=2:9></a> Certain things had to happen, and they happened in order; first Christ had to be installed in heaven, where He is, and then He received from the Father the promise of the Spirit, and shed It forth.<a name=2:10></a> So the Spirit was there to be heard; "which ye now see and hear (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>)".<a name=2:11></a> Then those who were affected said to Peter and the other apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?<a name=2:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:37">Acts  2:37</a>)" and Peter answered them, and we are told that they who accepted his word persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles; not of Moses or the prophets, but of the apostles.<a name=2:13></a> The Lord had fitted these men to speak, and they spoke, and so the system began and functioned, and it functions still, although centuries have elapsed.<a name=2:14></a> It is the same system, and it functions still, and so the question now is, how are we applying what is available to us in it to meet current conditions?<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=2:16></a>J.<a name=2:17></a> Are you thinking that the Holy Spirit has the chief place in this system which you have mentioned, and then that the angels have a place in it and are available to us?<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:19></a> That is what I was thinking.<a name=2:20></a> We have come to the system, including the angels.<a name=2:21></a> Persons come

		into it, like the woman of Samaria.<a name=3:1></a> She came out to draw water; she was identified with her vessel, but she left it.<a name=3:2></a> She left her vessel and went away into the city and came to the men, and said, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?<a name=3:3></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:29">John  4:29</a>.<a name=3:4></a> She then, in that practical way, became an item in the system.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.G.<a name=3:6></a>McC.<a name=3:7></a> In this system have we everything that we need to maintain us in the pathway?<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:9></a> That is it.<a name=3:10></a> Everything that is needed, not any extraneous things there, all needed things.<a name=3:11></a> There is much more that God has that is needed, but that is not for our system.<a name=3:12></a> He will have another system, and have suitable persons to work in it, but now He is working in the assembly.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=3:14></a> Does the administration of angels stand in relation to physical conditions through which the saints are passing?<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:16></a> Yes, it would.<a name=3:17></a> We can easily show that from various examples throughout the book of Acts, and the epistles, as well as throughout the Old Testament.<a name=3:18></a> In the Old Testament we have an early instance of angelic ministry in the visit to Abraham.<a name=3:19></a> Two of the visitors were angels, the other was Jehovah.<a name=3:20></a> It soon became evident that they were detached for the moment from Jehovah in order to attend to Lot in Sodom.<a name=3:21></a> God said, "Shall I hide from Abraham, that thing which I do (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:17">Genesis  18:17</a>)".<a name=3:22></a> The thing was not hidden from Abraham; he came into it and interceded for Lot.<a name=3:23></a> Then, of course, there are other things that could be said about them, how angels acted for the saints, and how they are still acting for the saints, as in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12">Acts  12</a>.<a name=3:24></a> Peter was in prison and he was aided to clothe himself, and one thing after another happened until he came to the iron gate, and it opened of itself; and so he came to the saints, but the saints were not ready for him; although they had been praying, they were not ready

		for him.<a name=4:1></a> There was one who listened, who knew his voice; that was Rhoda.<a name=4:2></a> Hence the movement began and Herod was smitten; it was angelic action against physical conditions.<a name=4:3></a> Now we have an opposing system of men and women, but particularly of men, and they are ready to apply physical conditions, even violence if necessary, and that is what we have to contend with.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=4:5></a>J.<a name=4:6></a> You would attribute the opening of the iron gate to angelic power, and that would be suggestive of what angelic power might do in relation to the Roman Empire at the end?<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> The immediate instrumentality of that is in the prayers of the saints.<a name=4:9></a> They prayed in Jerusalem urgently for Peter, but then they did not have faith in their prayers.<a name=4:10></a> They did not believe it was Peter, but it was really Peter, and Rhoda said that.<a name=4:11></a> She insisted it was Peter, and that is the thing; that we are assured of what we are doing, and what is acting for us.<a name=4:12></a> So Peter himself says, "Now I know certainly that the Lord has sent forth his angel and has taken me out of the hand of Herod (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12:11">Acts  12:11</a>)".<a name=4:13></a> So Peter came to himself.<a name=4:14></a> He came down one street, showing how God comes down to our natural physical circumstances, and, if necessary, to act against them if they are adverse.<a name=4:15></a> Not indeed that we join the army; we do not need to do that.<a name=4:16></a> We are obligated by God to refuse to take men's lives, but we may thank God that the governments today are allowing us to serve in other ways than to take men's lives, and it may be that God would help us too as to these unions, that they may have to recognise human rights, and prayer may lead them to come to that.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=4:18></a>J.<a name=4:19></a> There seemed to be a combination of power against the apostle and those with him on the boat in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27:23">Acts  27:23</a>,24, and Paul says, "For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night, saying, Fear not, Paul".<a name=4:20></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> That is very good, and in accord with what we are saying, that God will come in for us.<a name=5:2></a> Many of us older ones know that God has come in for us, for the Lord's people, through two terrible wars, and has caused them to stop; and He can do more than that.<a name=5:3></a> It is a question of our having confidence in God, and that is the point in these chapters read, that we have come to mount Zion.<a name=5:4></a> It is the verse that refers to power.<a name=5:5></a> The mountain is power, hut it is mount Zion; it is not mount Sinai.<a name=5:6></a> It is grace reigning through righteousness, so that we are on those lines, and hence we have the prayer meeting on Monday night, and God recognises the places where prayer is wont to be made, and answers the prayers.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.A.<a name=5:8></a>H.<a name=5:9></a> So we need to recognise that myriads of angels are in this system to which we have come; perhaps we have not thought sufficiently about the service that God would render through them.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:11></a> The word 'myriads' is used, showing there are a great number; we might say uncountable as far as we are concerned.<a name=5:12></a> The Lord says, "more than twelve legions" of them; He could ask for them.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=5:14></a> Would it be a parallel in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#6:17">2 Kings  6:17</a>, when Elisha prayed that his servant's eyes might be opened that he might see?<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:16></a> So <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68:17">Psalm  68:17</a> says, "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them".<a name=5:17></a> The prophet asked that the young man's eyes might be opened to see this, and perhaps that is the point now, that our eyes might be opened to see what is in our favour.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.R.<a name=5:19></a>P.<a name=5:20></a> Why do you think this power has not been manifested more than it has?<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:22></a> I would say because it has not been asked for.<a name=5:23></a> It is not that God is dependent on what we ask, but it does say He is able to do more than we ask or think.<a name=5:24></a> All power is subordinated to the

		present position, of Christ: "Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies as footstool of thy feet", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:13">Hebrews  1:13</a>).<a name=6:1></a> So in chapter 2, verse 5, we are told that, "He has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak";(<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:5">Hebrews  2:5</a>) that is, He has not placed that under angels.<a name=6:2></a> The millennium will not be placed under angels any more than our dispensation is formally.<a name=6:3></a> Our dispensation is placed under Christ; everything is put under Him; principalities and powers are put under Him.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=6:5></a>P.<a name=6:6></a> It was not until God heard the groaning of the children of Israel that He came down to deliver them.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:8></a> God said that He heard their groaning, showing that it is well worth groaning if we need something.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.R.<a name=6:10></a>P.<a name=6:11></a> Is there to be a moral accordance with us along with this asking?<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:13></a> Just so.<a name=6:14></a> The Lord may do things for us With which we are not in moral accord, because we are His people.<a name=6:15></a> He thinks of us in that light, and we are told much of asking, even as to the Spirit of God: "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=6:16></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:13">Luke  11:13</a>).<a name=6:17></a> That shows how much God is ready to give us on the ground of asking.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.E.<a name=6:19></a>J.<a name=6:20></a> Would <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#6:10">Daniel  6:10</a> suggest the same thought?<a name=6:21></a> When he knew that the writing was signed, "he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#6:10">Daniel  6:10</a>)".<a name=6:22></a> Later he was able to say to the king, "My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#6:22">Daniel  6:22</a>)".<a name=6:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:24></a> Very excellent example.<a name=6:25></a> The book of Daniel affords much in that sense for us.<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.R.<a name=6:27></a>P.<a name=6:28></a> Do you link up the matter of faith with this?<a name=6:29></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=7:4></a> James makes much of individual faith, saying, "The fervent supplication of the righteous man has much power", <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:16">James  5:16</a>.<a name=7:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:6></a> Showing what righteous men do, and so it is that Abraham was heard, because he was righteous: "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; .<a name=7:7></a>.<a name=7:8></a>.<a name=7:9></a> for I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:17">Genesis  18:17</a> - 19).<a name=7:10></a> God bases things on what Abraham would do.<a name=7:11></a>

		P.A.<a name=7:12></a>H.<a name=7:13></a> Would angels be active today, do you think?<a name=7:14></a> The angel said to Philip, "Rise up and go southward", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:26">Acts  8:26</a>).<a name=7:15></a> Do you think angels would be serving in that regard today?<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:17></a> Yes, only the dispensation requires that we ask for things which are named.<a name=7:18></a> We ask for angels, but then there are only two that are named; although there may be many, because God names all the angels as He names all the stars.<a name=7:19></a> He is not making much of them; though He might make much more than He makes in the scriptures we have, and there may be much more made of them in a further dispensation, but it is for us to go by the words written; as the Lord says, "It is written".<a name=7:20></a> When He was attacked by the devil, in every case He says, "It is written".<a name=7:21></a> We go by the words written.<a name=7:22></a>

		R.P.<a name=8:3></a> Would that not mean salvation in a practical sense?<a name=8:4></a> "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?<a name=8:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:6></a> That is what it says here in the verse read.<a name=8:7></a> We cannot say how many there are, but we can say there is an innumerable company, but it would hardly be intelligent for us to ask Him to send Michael.<a name=8:8></a> We have to go by what is written.<a name=8:9></a> Although we do know that Michael contended with the devil about the body of Moses, and we do know that Michael will make war with the devil and his angels.<a name=8:10></a> But he is only one.<a name=8:11></a> Therefore the intelligent way would be to ask God to send the necessary power on our behalf.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McN.<a name=8:13></a> We see how the Lord could say that the Father could furnish Him with more than twelve legions of angels; but He pointed out the necessity of the Scriptures being fulfilled.<a name=8:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=9:8></a> Well, some of us were speaking about that today, how Mordecai urged Esther to come into the matter, although she had already become queen, because the Jews were appointed to death because of Haman's influence with the king.<a name=9:9></a> She took her life into her hands and went and asked the king, but she did not ask the Jews to pray, but asked them to fast.<a name=9:10></a> God was working for them, although hiding His face from them.<a name=9:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=14:1></a> This chapter shows how God acts, we may say, in a physical sense, to enforce His mind, to enforce the truth of the gospel.<a name=14:2></a> The book begins in the main at the second chapter, which relates Peter's gospel address, the result being three thousand souls; the chapters following show how the enemy set to work to oppose, and the facts related indicate, as we said, that God acted as we might say physically, or through physical means, to advance the truth of the Scriptures.<a name=14:3></a> Hence it is said in the beginning of this chapter that as "they were speaking to the people, the priests and captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, being distressed on account of their teaching the people and preaching by Jesus the resurrection from among the dead; and they laid hands on them, and put them in ward till the morrow".<a name=14:4></a> Now the intervention of God is seen in what we have read.<a name=14:5></a> The general thought is that many of those who had heard the word believed.<a name=14:6></a> We have already been told that there were three thousand converted, but now it is said here that many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men had become about five thousand, so that God's work was proceeding in great power and with great results.<a name=14:7></a>

		DIVINE ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF THE TESTIMONY (3)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:1">Acts  5:1</a> - 42
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=31:1></a> What was remarked this morning is also true of this chapter, that God acts in support of His testimony, and for the help of His people.<a name=31:2></a> He acts on physical things and by physical things, as well as spiritual and moral things.<a name=31:3></a> He can do this in His own right as God.<a name=31:4></a> And so this matter of Ananias and Sapphira serves to promote this thought.<a name=31:5></a> It is a matter of discipline, of course, often alluded to and constantly needed, and, of course, more drastic than is usually applied, for it became a question of death; but still it was discipline, and indicates how God may resort to physical things to carry out His thoughts.<a name=31:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=31:7></a> There was this lying to the Holy Spirit right at the beginning of the assembly's history.<a name=31:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=31:9></a> Yes, as it were stressing the thing, so as to impress us at all times with it, just as in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>we have a similar drastic matter, but not so severe as this; but still such as we may make allusion to.<a name=31:10></a> God may act severely, for the purpose of establishing a principle which runs down the dispensation.<a name=31:11></a> It will be noticed that Peter did not himself have recourse to anything physical in the matter, it was God Himself, but Peter indicated the truth.<a name=31:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.W.<a name=31:13></a>A.<a name=31:14></a> Is it important to see in all these matters how these things affect God?<a name=31:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=31:16></a> Quite so; the whole matter is a question of God, really, the whole matter of the dispensation.<a name=31:17></a> "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:1">Hebrews  1:1</a>,2)".<a name=31:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McN.<a name=32:3></a> Is this to show that God is a consuming fire even in a day of grace?<a name=32:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=32:5></a> Quite so, and it is "our God", remember.<a name=32:6></a> That is to say, the Christian's God, not merely the God of the Jews.<a name=32:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=32:8></a> If we have to have part in the assembly vitally, we have to be consistent with the God who dwells there.<a name=32:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=32:10></a> Quite so.<a name=32:11></a> So in the epistle to the Hebrews already alluded to, it is a question of the Son over God's house, whose house are we.<a name=32:12></a> So in the book of Revelation, when the Lord Himself writes to the assemblies, He is seen as the Son of God in relation to Thyatira.<a name=32:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=32:14></a>J.<a name=32:15></a> It would be a serious matter to lie to the Holy Spirit.<a name=32:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=32:17></a> Quite so; there are several allusions to that very thing.<a name=32:18></a> You will perhaps name them all for us.<a name=32:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=32:20></a>J.<a name=32:21></a> I was referring to the third verse: "But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit .<a name=32:22></a>.<a name=32:23></a>.<a name=32:24></a> ?<a name=32:25></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=32:26></a> Then there is another allusion in verse 4, "Thou hast not lied to men, but to God".<a name=32:27></a> That is to enforce the thing.<a name=32:28></a> Then in the ninth verse, "Why is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?<a name=32:29></a>" So that the thought of divine Persons is brought in strikingly in this matter of discipline, and the severity of the action taken, because we are to behold God's goodness, but we have also to think of His severity: that God is severe if He has to be.<a name=32:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.A.<a name=32:31></a>H.<a name=32:32></a> It produced a great effect upon all who heard it.<a name=32:33></a> That seems to be the effect of this severity and discipline.<a name=32:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=32:35></a> You allude to the eleventh verse, "Great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who

		<a name=33>[Page 33]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heard these things".<a name=33:1></a> That is the intent of it, to subdue us and to cause fear, because God is to be feared in all who draw nigh to Him.<a name=33:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.A.<a name=33:3></a>H.<a name=33:4></a> That scripture already alluded to as to our God being a consuming fire, also speaks of serving Him with reverence and godly fear.<a name=33:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=33:6></a> There was much at stake.<a name=33:7></a> It was the effort on the part of the enemy to set aside what was coming in.<a name=33:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=33:9></a> As we have already remarked, we get things stated at the outset that run down.<a name=33:10></a> We have to learn what God is in the severity of judgment against evil.<a name=33:11></a> In fact I believe God is calling attention to that, because the book of Revelation is especially intended to stress the thought of judgment, even the lake of fire being mentioned.<a name=33:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.P.<a name=33:13></a> Are you applying this matter specially to the saints?<a name=33:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=33:15></a> Well, it is a question of the saints of course, that Peter is dealing with.<a name=33:16></a> Ananias and Sapphira were ostensibly of the assembly, and, of course, the assembly is amenable to the discipline of God.<a name=33:17></a> We should there learn what God is in judgment.<a name=33:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=33:19></a> Do you mean that God is very jealous as to His rights in the assembly, and in this matter of associations we should see that God is jealous also?<a name=33:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=33:21></a> Particularly so.<a name=33:22></a> Associations mean banding together.<a name=33:23></a> They began in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11">Genesis  11</a>, where they banded together and one said to his fellow, "Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11:4">Genesis  11:4</a>".<a name=33:24></a> "The whole earth had one language, and the same words.<a name=33:25></a> And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11:1">Genesis  11:1</a>,2".<a name=33:26></a> That is the secret of all these combinations, power being vested in the idea of combination.<a name=33:27></a> "Let us build ourselves a city (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11:4">Genesis  11:4</a>)".<a name=33:28></a> It is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=34:3></a> Are you bringing before us the importance of what Peter says in verse 9, "Why is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?<a name=34:4></a>"?<a name=34:5></a> Is this the introduction of evil into the assembly?<a name=34:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=34:7></a> Yes.<a name=34:8></a> Agreeing together.<a name=34:9></a> That was the idea at Shinar, to have something great.<a name=34:10></a> It is pure selfishness, the thought of exalting themselves.<a name=34:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=34:12></a> Is not the great effort of the enemy at the present time to introduce what is counterfeit?<a name=34:13></a> What was so beautiful and glorious at the beginning was the saints moving together, and God being the inheritance of the saints, and love operating among the saints.<a name=34:14></a> Is there not a great effort at this time to bring in influence on that line; the idea of security, and universal brotherhood, and the like?<a name=34:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=34:16></a> Quite so.<a name=34:17></a> And the word is taken out of its proper setting.<a name=34:18></a> The proper setting of the word "together" is in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=34:19></a> That is the precious setting of the matter, leading up to the truth of the assembly, and confirming it; whereas men band together with selfish motives, and with a view to exalting themselves, which reverses everything.<a name=34:20></a> Power belongs to God, but this idea that we are dealing with is power vested in men, by themselves, not by those above them, but by themselves.<a name=34:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.W.<a name=34:22></a>A.<a name=34:23></a> This works out in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>, where the artisans of Demetrius's trade banded together in a way that is suggestive of the operations of men now for their own purposes, regardless of what God was doing in the assembly, but God's work was going on.<a name=34:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=35:2></a> Well, this sort of thing would divide the saints and make them selfish and deceitful, and the word is stressed as to lying to divine Persons.<a name=35:3></a> There is also mentioned lying to one another, and also agreeing together to lie, which is the point stressed here.<a name=35:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=35:5></a>J.<a name=35:6></a> I wondered if it would help us to see how intolerable this matter of unionism is, if we could lay hold of the fact that this is where the Holy Spirit is operating; and in Ezekiel the Lord, in speaking of His house, says, "This is .<a name=35:7></a>.<a name=35:8></a>.<a name=35:9></a> the place of the soles of my feet", <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#43:7">Ezekiel  43:7</a>.<a name=35:10></a> Then in relation to angels which you have brought before us, they are said to be "the holy angels", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8:38">Mark  8:38</a>).<a name=35:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=35:12></a> I think we ought to touch on this matter of angels at this reading, because although we have already touched on it, it comes in here in this chapter in verse 19.<a name=35:13></a> The angels are to be in our minds.<a name=35:14></a> They are great intelligent agencies of God for dealing with matters that we cannot deal with because of our belonging to this dispensation.<a name=35:15></a> They belong too, to what is outside the range of the time of man, because they existed before men, and were there, we are told in <a href="../bible/@Job.htm#38:7">@Job  38:7</a>, when the foundations of the earth were laid; they then shouted for joy, showing how sympathetic they are with God.<a name=35:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is a great matter, and God has His means of dealing with it.<a name=35:17></a> In all these evil wars that have come upon the saints in this dispensation, especially recently, there has been need for great power to deal with the evil, and to rescue the saints out of it; and so I think the Lord would help us as to the place that angels have.<a name=35:18></a> So here in verse 19 we have, "an angel of the Lord during the night opened the doors of the prison, and leading them out, said.<a name=35:19></a> Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the
	</div>

		words of this life".<a name=36:1></a> Notice that it is "all the words of this life", in order to bring out the importance of that life, the preciousness of it.<a name=36:2></a> And the angel is directing the apostles here, "Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life".<a name=36:3></a> So we can see how much the idea of angels enters into what we are saying.<a name=36:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=36:5></a>J.<a name=36:6></a> Would that preserve us from taking up one thought or one line of doctrine, and remaining around it?<a name=36:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=36:8></a> Very good.<a name=36:9></a> I believe the Lord has greatly helped the brethren as to how to study the Scriptures, and how to read them, to study them carefully, and spiritually, and to take account of all that has been said.<a name=36:10></a> How great the volume of things in the life of Jesus!<a name=36:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.E.<a name=36:12></a>J.<a name=36:13></a> Would you say that we should be free to pray in our prayer meetings that God may set the angels in activity in relation to His people?<a name=36:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=36:15></a> It is just as well to bring that up, as to how they are to be brought into our prayers.<a name=36:16></a> There are a great many of them, but we are not given many names, so far as I can see only about two; but obviously there are many.<a name=36:17></a> If we pray for the Lord's servants, we pray for them by name.<a name=36:18></a> We can ask the Lord to send a brother known to us, if He was pleased to do so, if we thought he was suitable to meet any condition in this country; that would be quite in order.<a name=36:19></a> But you could not speak of the angels in that way, because we only know the names of two of them.<a name=36:20></a> Therefore it is a question of asking God as to a matter; and I verily believe that, as to men in this world, in the recent war and the previous one, God acted through men who were perhaps not converted at all.<a name=36:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=49:8></a> Yes, and it is a common thing which has often arisen amongst brethren since Pentecost.<a name=49:9></a> But it may be linked on with what has been engaging us, which is not exactly national, but an industrial matter, which has brought about a combination of men of all kinds, and all nations and religions, in order to better themselves through that combination, disregarding whether divine principles are involved or not; so that we are therefore in the presence of a most serious matter, and one that deserves the full understanding that God has given to us, so that we may do His will, and not man's.<a name=49:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=84:5></a> We would have to generalise it, and regard it as viewed as a whole.<a name=84:6></a> The first reference to eldership and to local assemblies appears to be in chapter 14:23, whereas <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:1">1 Corinthians  1:1</a> says, "Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother, to the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=84:7></a> There the saints gathered together in Corinth, although local, are called "the assembly of God"; "with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>".<a name=84:8></a> This is where we get the formal reference to assemblies, local assemblies.<a name=84:9></a> The chapter we have read does refer to the local idea, if we are to take the authorised version as it is, but the note to which I have referred in verse 31 says, "or assembly", that is to say "the assembly then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace".<a name=84:10></a> The note is a critical one, and I believe we are to consider it, so as to see how the truth developed.<a name=84:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=135:1></a> What is in mind is to call attention to being cast out.<a name=135:2></a> The thought is to connect what <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>teaches with the first epistle of Peter, in order to enlarge on the subject: "Because it is contained in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame.<a name=135:3></a> To you therefore who believe is the preciousness; but to the disobedient, the stone which the builders cast away as worthless, this is become head of the corner", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:6">1 Peter  2:6</a>,7.<a name=135:4></a> It is thought that the record of this man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>will help us to see how the principle of casting away is applied by the people of this world, and how the castaway comes in for blessing, as it is said in the verses read, "Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=135:5></a> He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?<a name=135:6></a> And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he.<a name=135:7></a> And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage" (verses 35 - 38).<a name=135:8></a> So that these passages will doubtless help us to see how Christianity applies in those who have faith, and how it leads to their being cast out; and then the contrast, the truth is seen in the Lord announcing His sonship, and that the cast out one comes to know the Son of God.<a name=135:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=151:1></a> The subject of the Lord's supper is taken up at this time according to what it means as the inauguration or beginning of the service of God.<a name=151:2></a> It is Paul's account of the Lord's supper, of its inauguration.<a name=151:3></a> The worship of God did not begin with Christianity; it was inaugurated in the Old Testament; it has come down to us, in that way, and although the Lord's supper is mentioned in the synoptic gospels and in the Acts and elsewhere, yet it is formally introduced in this chapter as the beginning of the service of God, the beginning of it.<a name=151:4></a> Thus brethren rightly have it on the first day of the week, for the book of Acts tells us that that was the custom in the early days, after Pentecost, that they came together on the first day of the week to break bread.<a name=151:5></a> The three synoptic gospels contain it, John does not; and what is seen in Matthew, Mark, and Luke is that the twelve were with the Lord when He inaugurated the Supper.<a name=151:6></a> The facts indicate that the twelve were formally there to be the Lord's witnesses.<a name=151:7></a> Matthew, Mark, and Luke mention it so that there can be no question as to testimony as to it.<a name=151:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=152:5></a> Yes; that is just what I had in mind, that we might see that it is his word.<a name=152:6></a> We know from his letters, besides this one, that he was the minister of the assembly peculiarly; and of course, the ministry of the assembly involves the Lord's supper, not only because of its own value, but because of its importance as giving a lead to the service of God, and opening up the whole thought of the service of God.<a name=152:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=152:8></a> Would Paul link on with what is historical, and give added new features in regard to the assembly position?<a name=152:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=152:10></a> Well, I think so; we should not establish the facts properly from the synoptic gospels, or even from the Acts.<a name=152:11></a> They are established in these particular letters of Paul's, the first and second epistles to Corinth; and nothing can be more important than that the saints now should understand that Paul is the minister of the assembly.<a name=152:12></a> Colossians especially deals with it, the brethren will remember.<a name=152:13></a> It is stated in the first chapter of that epistle "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly; of which <i>I</i> became minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given me towards you to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:24">Colossians  1:24</a> - 26.<a name=152:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.A.<a name=153:5></a>H.<a name=153:6></a> When you speak of the inauguration of the service of God at the Supper, is it through that means that the Lord secures His place in the midst of His own, and then the service proceeds?<a name=153:7></a> Is that the thought?<a name=153:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=153:9></a> I would say that is just the point, His own place in the midst; and that is what He promises to us in John, because we get from John what was intended to run down the whole dispensation.<a name=153:10></a> Hence we have the great fact of the Spirit coming, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a>, and then He says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", meaning that the Lord did not intend to leave them to their own resources, but that the Spirit having come.<a name=153:11></a> He also would come to them.<a name=153:12></a> I believe that is what enters into the present time, and the peculiar way the ministry has come forward in regard to the Lord's supper.<a name=153:13></a> The Lord

		comes to us, and the synoptic gospels deal with the general facts of the Lord's ministry, but Paul deals with what is special as relating to the assembly.<a name=154:1></a> So that the service of God comes down to us from the Old Testament, but it comes down to us through the twelve apostles.<a name=154:2></a> So those who were converted through Peter's ministry persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, and in the breaking of bread and in prayers.<a name=154:3></a> That is the general fact as to the twelve.<a name=154:4></a>

		Then with the incoming of Paul, we have these special epistles, opening up the truth as to the assembly, bringing forward himself as the minister of it, so that we have things firmly in our hands in that way.<a name=154:5></a> It seems to me that the brethren should be thoroughly alive to the present time, because the imminence of the Lord's coming is apparent, and the Lord would have the truth of His supper entered into fully, so that we might be fit to take on the great service that is for us in the millennium according to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, in which it is said that the assembly is a habitation of God in Spirit, and increases to a holy temple in the Lord; that is, the means by which God will disclose His mind and the order of His service in the millennial day.<a name=154:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=168:1></a> The eleventh chapter of the first epistle to Corinth was read last Lord's day, but we were unable to enlarge on the subject then.<a name=168:2></a> We think it better to go on to the second letter now to pursue our subject, that is, the Lord's supper, because the second letter is more substantial, more complete, so that it is thought we shall be able to open up the subject a little more fully.<a name=168:3></a> What has been remarked is of the very first importance as to the subject, because the first letter is almost entirely corrective.<a name=168:4></a> The second letter affords more substance and spiritual enlargement, as I hope we shall see as we proceed.<a name=168:5></a> The apostle had experienced much suffering and persecution before the second letter was written.<a name=168:6></a> He had come nigh to death, he said, but God had effected deliverance for him, and so he is now free to touch on the very fundamentals of the first epistle.<a name=168:7></a> The first epistle to the Corinthians is one of the most important in the whole New Testament in view of the service of God, because it is devoted in the main to that subject, but the apostle in the first epistle has almost immediately to reprove them, to enter on a course of reproof.<a name=168:8></a> And it may be that we all need reproof as to the principles governing the Lord's supper.<a name=168:9></a> The Lord's supper is celebrated nominally in perhaps a hundred ways among the sects, so-called, so that it is all the more important that we should look into it carefully, and see what the bearing of it is as seen in the second letter.<a name=168:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=170:5></a> That is why it has been thought well of late to call attention to the fact that the calling of the Lord to mind as indicated in the first letter, is not simply that He is absent from this world, but that He is actually in spirit, at least in mind and in thought, in the place of suffering; because I think at times it has been thought that the calling of the Lord to mind is just that He is away, He has gone into heaven.<a name=170:6></a> But I do not think that the Lord really, as it were, needs to be sympathised with, if I may use that word, but rather that He is actually here in spirit.<a name=170:7></a> I use the word 'in spirit' so as to make clear that the Lord is in heaven literally, but He is here in spirit, that is, with His people.<a name=170:8></a> When the time of calling Him to mind arrives on the first day of the week, there is opportunity to be reminded that He too Himself is still in the place of suffering; and that is illustrated in the fact that when the apostle Paul was converted, the Lord said to him, "Why persecutest thou me?<a name=170:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>) Now the Lord is in heaven literally, but He speaks of Himself as in the place of suffering, and that Paul was causing the suffering.<a name=170:10></a> The Lord was not literally persecuted by Paul at that time, but He was in spirit with the brethren in their sufferings.<a name=170:11></a> Paul at that time, or immediately before it, was the outstanding instrument of the devil to persecute the saints, dragging men and women before tribunals, and so forth, as we learn in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>.<a name=170:12></a> So that the Lord in spirit is in the sufferings when He asks us to call Him to mind.<a name=170:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=172:10></a> Exactly, and surely it is in keeping with the dispensation, and God is entitled, so to speak, to bring it before us, that the Lord Jesus, although He is actually and literally in heaven, yet as a divine Person, can come and go as He pleases.<a name=172:11></a> For instance He comes for us: "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first", (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:16">1 Thessalonians  4:16</a>).<a name=172:12></a> That is the Lord's own action.<a name=172:13></a> It is not the Spirit's action, it is His own action, and we cannot say that He is sent to do it.<a name=172:14></a> It implies that He is at all times at liberty to have access to His brethren, to the assembly.<a name=172:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=256:1></a> It will be observed that the suggestion, is to begin with "the first day of the week".<a name=256:2></a> As to time, for the service of God, the idea of the month is more prevalent in the Old Testament.<a name=256:3></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:2">Exodus  12:2</a>, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you", and in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#13:4">Exodus  13:4</a>, "Ye come out today, in the month Abib".<a name=256:4></a> What is to be called attention to, particularly in these verses, is that the month alluded to in the beginning of chapter 12 is regulated by heaven, that is to say, by the moon; whereas in chapter 13, whilst it is the same month, the name is different; it is the month Abib, which alludes to <i>the month the corn ripens</i> .<a name=256:5></a> Whilst the idea of the moon, or the heavens, has to do with the origin of the month, the reference in chapter 13 has to do with the earth; that is to say, the ripening of corn, which is more the subjective side.<a name=256:6></a> The thought is to show that whilst the Lord acts sovereignly in these matters, He also acts in relation to what is in us, what is developed in us by the Spirit.<a name=256:7></a> Thus time, especially in the Lord's service and the service of God, has to take into account what is to be developed in the saints, what progress they are making; as if what God is doing in relation to time is based on what He is doing Himself in the saints, as well as in the heavens.<a name=256:8></a> Then another thing is the matter of eating governing the service.<a name=256:9></a> "If the household be too small for a lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; each according to the measure of his eating shall ye count for the lamb", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:4">Exodus  12:4</a>.<a name=256:10></a> Thus the passover will be regulated by the capacity in the families to eat.<a name=256:11></a> So that it is not wholly an objective

		thought, nor is it even the death of Christ viewed objectively, but the capacity to eat, to appropriate.<a name=257:1></a> Then another thing entering into all this, is the idea of the word "assembly", and the word 'congregation'.<a name=257:2></a> The word "assembly" in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:3">Exodus  12:3</a>, is said to mean 'the congregation looked at as a moral whole, a corporate person before God'.<a name=257:3></a> As I understand the word "assembly" there, it implies, not that every responsible person is in mind, but a sufficient number to be representative as a moral whole, even although some are not present.<a name=257:4></a> On the other hand, the word 'congregation' alludes to every one present.<a name=257:5></a> 'Congregation is the actual subsisting congregation composed of all its members',(see footnote to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:6">Exodus  12:6</a>).<a name=257:6></a> What has been remarked is important as to assembly services, and especially discipline.<a name=257:7></a> I think that we need to pay more attention to accuracy in quoting or reading Scripture than has been common amongst the brethren, because one believes, without assuming to criticise or to judge, that things are taken too loosely.<a name=257:8></a> According to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4">Leviticus  4</a>, where responsibilities are attached to distinguished persons, such as the high priest, and then the assembly itself, or whether it be the prince or even the ordinary people, inadvertent things can be adjusted or recalled.<a name=257:9></a> Other scriptures, such as in the epistle to the Hebrews, regard sin as unforgivable, and the sinner as unrestorable.<a name=257:10></a> I refer to all this because I believe it is important to bear in mind that when we come to critical things, such as doctrine or discipline, we need to pay more attention to the actual letter of Scripture.<a name=257:11></a> It might, of course, be said that the letter kills, which is true, but it is not always the truth in that sense; it has to be read with intelligence.<a name=257:12></a> "By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:37">Matthew  12:37</a>).<a name=257:13></a> There it is a question of literality.<a name=257:14></a>

		ABSTRACT TRUTH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:1">1 Corinthians  3:1</a> - 23
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=271:1></a> It may be wondered at by some that the Corinthians are viewed as the temple of God in this chapter, since the writer begins by saying, <i>"I</i> , brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.<a name=271:2></a> I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able; for ye are yet carnal".<a name=271:3></a> However, the explanation may be, and is, indeed, that the apostle is presenting the truth in an abstract sense in these early chapters, that he is giving credit to the Corinthians, as he says in chapter 1, "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge, (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,) so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you to the end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=271:4></a> God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:4">1 Corinthians  1:4</a> - 9.<a name=271:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle is thus viewing them as we may say, in an abstract way, because the body of the epistle treats them as if they were in a very low state, with much evil amongst them.<a name=271:6></a> Hence the abstract view gives leverage to persons thus regarded to speak of things as God does.<a name=271:7></a> Thus, whilst the apostle says in verse 1 that they were fleshly, yet he says in verse 16, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=271:8></a>" This, of course, is the basis of the presentation of the truth as we have it; that is to say, the saints are viewed abstractly because they have the Spirit, they are

	<div class="paragraph">
		assumed to have the Spirit.<a name=272:1></a> In order to rightly understand and profit by this scripture therefore, it is well to keep in mind the abstract side, how God is pleased to hold back certain things in order to give leverage to us in speaking of them, and even to give the writer latitude to rebuke, to reprove the saints, if necessary, for anything that is wrong in the assembly.<a name=272:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=272:3></a>T.<a name=272:4></a> Is that in keeping with the way in which Paul opens, "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth"?<a name=272:5></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a> He credits them with having assembly status throughout, does he not?<a name=272:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=272:7></a> Just so.<a name=272:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=272:9></a>T.<a name=272:10></a> By extension, does that work out to us at the present time, for whilst we could not claim to be the assembly of God, we move in the light of it, and the whole of the epistle is available to us on that ground?<a name=272:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=272:12></a> I think that is all important.<a name=272:13></a> One hopes that the brethren will all be free to speak according to what may be in their minds in the way of difficulty as to the apparent inconsistency of what has been alluded to.<a name=272:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.P.<a name=272:15></a>P.<a name=272:16></a> In the expression "babes in Christ" do the words "in Christ" suggest that the Corinthians are clothed with thoughts according to God, and given a status?<a name=272:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=272:18></a> Yes.<a name=272:19></a> The word "babes", of course, indicates a very feeble state of mind and thought.<a name=272:20></a> <i>"I</i> .<a name=272:21></a>.<a name=272:22></a>.<a name=272:23></a> have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ".<a name=272:24></a> The idea of fleshly is therefore treated as the babe state, a state of babehood, which would not be the normal condition of a person who had intelligence in the matter on hand.<a name=272:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=273:1></a> Well, of course, a babe is a babe.<a name=273:2></a> The Lord speaks in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:21">John  16:21</a> of "joy that a man has been born into the world".<a name=273:3></a> He refers to a babe, of course, but still the idea of a man is there, the potentiality of the position is manhood, and that is the idea I am sure, and we ought all to take hold of it and therefore speak as men.<a name=273:4></a> It is said later, "quit yourselves like men", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:13">1 Corinthians  16:13</a>).<a name=273:5></a>

		S.S.<a name=273:6></a> Would it be right to say that sovereignly they were brought into relationship, but practically they had not progressed?<a name=273:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=273:8></a> Well, they had not.<a name=273:9></a> Of course they were very young, we ought to remember that, they were relatively young Christians and God had acted sovereignly in making them what they were.<a name=273:10></a> There were a good many of them according to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>.<a name=273:11></a> The Lord said to Paul, "Fear not .<a name=273:12></a>.<a name=273:13></a>.<a name=273:14></a> .<a name=273:15></a> I have much people in this city" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:9">Acts  18:9</a>,10.<a name=273:16></a> The Lord had that in His own mind, and knew their state, the characteristic features of the people of Corinth.<a name=273:17></a> In view of all this, the wisdom of the brethren as we are now here tonight, is to take the ground of being persons with minds, and not babes, for indeed it is said in chapter 2, "<i>we</i> have the mind of Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:16">1 Corinthians  2:16</a> meaning the faculty of thinking, so that we are entitled, as the Lord would encourage us, to speak out as men, as those who are responsible.<a name=273:18></a> According to chapter 3 and chapter 1 the real difficulty evidently was the matter of division amongst them.<a name=273:19></a> So it goes on to say in chapter 3, "For whereas there are among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?<a name=273:20></a> For when one says, <i>I</i> am of Paul, and another, <i>I</i> of Apollos, are ye not men?<a name=273:21></a> Who then is Apollos, and who Paul?<a name=273:22></a> Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each.<a name=273:23></a> <i>I</i> have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase.<a name=273:24></a> So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but

	<div class="paragraph">
		God the giver of the increase.<a name=274:1></a> But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour" (verses 3 - 8).<a name=274:2></a> Therefore, obviously our wisdom is now to proceed according to the minds we have, the intelligence; we have, and treat of the truths as they are presented to us here, and learn from them, in the light of being the temple of God, no less than that.<a name=274:3></a> We do not formally assume to be that, as they could here, because a great deal of change has come about in the assembly since this epistle was written, but nevertheless the Spirit of God is here and the truth of the first verse of the epistle is that those addressed were "the assembly of God which is in Corinth <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>".<a name=274:4></a> That is the ground to take, that we belong to the assembly in this great city, not that we assume to be it, as they could, but still we belong to it, and the Spirit of God is with us as He was then.<a name=274:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.N.<a name=274:6></a>G.<a name=274:7></a> Would the statement in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>, that Paul was among them for eighteen months teaching the word of God, connect with this chapter?<a name=274:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=274:9></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=274:10></a> That certainly ought to have great weight in what we are reading now, and challenge us, too, as to whether we are learning as we have opportunity.<a name=274:11></a> They had opportunity, Paul having been there so long.<a name=274:12></a>

		E.A.<a name=274:13></a>K.<a name=274:14></a> Would you say a word as to why God is introduced into this chapter in such a significant way, "God the giver of the increase", and "we are God's fellow-workmen: ye are God's husbandry, God's building"?<a name=274:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=274:16></a> Quite so, and therefore God is in mind.<a name=274:17></a> It is God's assembly, nothing less than that, the assembly of God; and the end of chapter 3 says, "all are yours; and <i>ye</i> are Christ's, and Christ is God's".<a name=274:18></a> That is to say, we are viewed in a mediatorial position from God down to Christ and to the saints, so that we are in a most favourable position with great

		L.G.<a name=275:8></a>L.<a name=275:9></a> Does Paul give evidence of reaching manhood in a spiritual way in that he was not prepared to take a place that was not really his?<a name=275:10></a> He refused to accept the place the Corinthians would give him, but moved in relation to what was of God, and in that sense, he gives evidence of having reached manhood.<a name=275:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=275:12></a> Quite so.<a name=275:13></a> That is to say, he was lowly, and took the same ground as Apollos.<a name=275:14></a> Paul was a much greater man, longer in the truth and more gifted and more experienced than Apollos, but still he was lowly enough to associate Apollos with himself.<a name=275:15></a> Apollos had not long been a Christian, but he was a gifted man, and mighty in the Scriptures, and the apostle Paul was ready to associate him with himself.<a name=275:16></a> Paul planted and Apollos watered, but the apostle brings God in, as has just been remarked, and the mind of the saints is therefore fixed upon God, as it should be; everything comes from God; God gives the increase.<a name=275:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=276:9></a> That is very good, and we should have that brought before us, because there are the two thoughts; that in this epistle is local, that is to say, the idea of the temple of God may be attached to the brethren here in Melbourne at any time, or even smaller cities than Melbourne, if there are saints there.<a name=276:10></a> So that as coming together for the reading of the Scriptures we have liberty, because we may regard ourselves as of the temple of God, which is a very important matter, what we call a temple matter.<a name=276:11></a> But what has to be said too, in order to clarify the position, is that the word 'temple' here is a word that is properly applied to the saints of God of this dispensation, not as the temple at Jerusalem was regarded (that was a mere building by man, and so, too, the idea of temple in the Greek world was man's idea) but in this epistle it is taken up by God as applying to the local company of the saints at Corinth.<a name=276:12></a> God is pleased to regard the saints at Corinth as His temple, because the Spirit of God is among them.<a name=276:13></a> Now in the book of Revelation the word 'temple' is also used, but not in this sense, but in that in which it was used in the Old Testament, and that is important to bear in mind.<a name=276:14></a> The word 'temple' here in Corinthians refers to the saints viewed collectively in any locality, whereas in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:21">Ephesians  2:21</a> we have it viewed as growing, "groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord".<a name=276:15></a> It is not viewed as growing in Corinthians; the saints are viewed as babes, however.<a name=276:16></a> In Ephesians it is another view, but it is a universal view, as has been referred to, so that we have to keep these two thoughts in mind.<a name=276:17></a> We are now dealing with the temple of God in a locality, such as Corinth.<a name=276:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=305:19></a> Quite so.<a name=305:20></a> It is a question of the Spirit, because we have to come to this, that everything lies in the Spirit in a subjective sense.<a name=305:21></a> Of course, there is "Christ in you" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:27">Colossians  1:27</a>), too, but it is by the Spirit that all is effected subjectively.<a name=305:22></a> That is the great fact of Christianity; it is the day of the Spirit, so that we get heavenly thoughts.<a name=305:23></a> Although the Spirit is down here continuously, yet He is the Spirit, He is God Himself really, so we cannot limit Him.<a name=305:24></a> We may rise by the power of the Spirit to heavenly places; the Spirit effects this in us.<a name=305:25></a> He is the Spirit of sonship, and therefore would promote feelings of affection toward God and toward one another, but specially toward God.<a name=305:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=306:4></a> Quite so.<a name=306:5></a> That is the great thing to have in mind, because we have the expression, "the Lord of glory" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:8">1 Corinthians  2:8</a>), and "the Father of glory" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:17">Ephesians  1:17</a>), and "the God of glory", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:2">Acts  7:2</a>).<a name=306:6></a> We have a great realm in those thoughts of glory.<a name=306:7></a> Hence the need of being ready for glory, for that is the idea, it is from one glory to another.<a name=306:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=306:12></a> It is a simple fact that we are dependent on the Holy Spirit.<a name=306:13></a> At the very beginning of the meeting when we sit down together, we are dependent upon the Spirit to be in a right attitude, and a right attitude of mind; and there are other phases as we proceed, the saints viewed as brethren; we are the Lord's brethren, we are not simply brethren as such, but Christ's brethren, and we are pervaded by the Spirit in that sense, the spirit proper to brethren.<a name=306:14></a> Then the Spirit of adoption refers to the Father, so we are dependent upon Him throughout the service, and as a matter of fact, dependent upon Him all the time, because we are to walk in the Spirit, "If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit", (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:25">Galatians  5:25</a>).<a name=306:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=307:6></a> Yes, there is.<a name=307:7></a> The Spirit had not yet come, but the brethren were there, they were not yet indwelt by the Spirit, of course, but at the same time they were born anew, and not only so, but they had been formed by the Lord's own teaching.<a name=307:8></a> He had taught them, and what He taught was spirit and life.<a name=307:9></a> At the same time, the Spirit had not come, but they were instructed as to what to do, and they knew what to do, and so they went to the upper room instead of going to the temple.<a name=307:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:53">Luke  24:53</a> it is said that they returned from Bethany, "and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God", but it does not say that in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>.<a name=307:11></a> So that it shows that <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>has in mind Christianity, as it was intended to be here on earth as a testimony, and so they went to the upper room.<a name=307:12></a> Instead of going to the temple, they went to the upper room; and we are told who were there, the very names of the apostles are given, and that there were several women as well, and the Lord's mother was there, showing that it was in principle the formation of the public assembly.<a name=307:13></a>

		THE ASSEMBLY VIEWED AS THE BRIDE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:1">Revelation  19:1</a> - 10; <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:9">Revelation  21:9</a> - 27
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=308:1></a> It is thought that a fitting close to the series of meetings we have had recently would be to consider the assembly from the standpoint of the bride of Christ, and especially in the light of the nearness of the coming of the Lord, which is prominent in this book.<a name=308:2></a> It may be remarked that in order to get immediate profit, it is needful to dismiss from our minds the imagery that enters into the book of Revelation, the symbolic character of the whole book, to seek to get at what is really meant.<a name=308:3></a> There is a premium in connection with the reading of the book in the first chapter, and although individual reading is of prime importance, yet collective readings, or what we might call class readings, are the most resultful; that is, the Spirit of God has scope in them and furnishes what we may need at any moment.<a name=308:4></a> Whatever is needed at the moment in a locality would be in the mind of the Spirit, especially when it is what we may call a city occasion, and the Spirit would take us on, and use what is present in the sense of gift, and in the sense of experience, and in the sense of interest generally, so that we may all profit.<a name=308:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is in mind, in addition to what has been said, is that the ground is cleared in chapter 19 for the introduction of the assembly as the bride.<a name=308:6></a> She is seen earlier in the book, from the very outset, especially in chapter 1, where she is seen before the Lord Himself is seen.<a name=308:7></a> The seven golden lamps are seen, and then He is seen in the midst of them.<a name=308:8></a> That is the present time, the present actual position of the assembly in responsibility.<a name=308:9></a> But then as we remarked, the way was to be cleared for the assembly, not in the sense of responsibility, but in the sense of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=309>[Page 309]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the bride; so these scriptures have been suggested.<a name=309:1></a> The clearing process has in mind the entire destruction, everlasting destruction, of the imitation or false assembly who never claims widowhood or being bereft of protection; she sits a queen and is no widow and has no sorrow, and in these chapters, up to the end of chapter 18, God shows how He can deal with her; He has judged her, and He has judged our judgment upon her too, that is to say, the judgment of the saints, so that we are with Him in the judgment.<a name=309:2></a> Then chapter 19 is a summary, leading up to the end of the whole matter, the end of the book of Revelation; and the assembly is presented to us in verse 6, "I heard as a voice of a great crowd, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for the Lord our God the Almighty has taken to himself kingly power.<a name=309:3></a> Let us rejoice and exult, and give him glory; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready".<a name=309:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is thought that our first consideration should be to think of the idea of the wife, and of her making herself ready, and then in the second scripture read, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, to see her coming down from God out of heaven.<a name=309:5></a> The point to be before us first is how she makes herself ready, and whether it has not a direct reference to the present time, that it is the time of getting ready.<a name=309:6></a> Here we are told that "his wife has made herself ready".<a name=309:7></a> The last chapter of Proverbs presents her as taking care of His interests, and it is so here; the Lord's interests are being cared for in the idea of the wife.<a name=309:8></a> But then it is said, "the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready", meaning that she has taken account of herself in regard of what is needed for the great moment.<a name=309:9></a> In chapter 21, she is seen as a bride <i>adorned</i> for her husband, but here she is not viewed as already adorned, she has made herself ready, she

		<a name=310>[Page 310]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		is in the character of the wife.<a name=310:1></a> Then there are certain things granted to her, which point to the present time, "And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints", that is to say, they are of herself.<a name=310:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=310:3></a>S.<a name=310:4></a> Do you mean that the righteousnesses are coming into evidence now, or do you mean that it is given to her <i>now</i> to be clothed in fine linen?<a name=310:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=310:6></a> It is what she has herself, because, viewed from the standpoint of the assembly, the saints are it.<a name=310:7></a> Therefore, she has her own resources in that sense, but she is granted to use them, they are fit for use on such a wonderful occasion.<a name=310:8></a> They are the righteousnesses of the saints.<a name=310:9></a> They are not imputed righteousnesses, but actually accomplished righteousnesses.<a name=310:10></a> They are now regarded as fine linen, clean and bright.<a name=310:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.P.<a name=310:12></a>P.<a name=310:13></a> Would those righteousnesses be really all that she had taken on of the interests of Christ in caring for them?<a name=310:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=310:15></a> I would say that in general, although whatever they are in detail, they are righteousnesses of the saints, and how essential it is that we should bring them forward.<a name=310:16></a> In order now to apply the thing immediately, they refer to ourselves, because we need not speak of them objectively as of others than ourselves; we are the saints.<a name=310:17></a> When I say <i>we</i> , I mean those who have the Holy Spirit.<a name=310:18></a> The righteousnesses of all such are included here in the clothing, the fine linen, "It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure", and then it adds, "for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints".<a name=310:19></a> Whilst they are viewed as clothing for her now, yet they are of essential value to God in testimony, in view of the wickedness that is current abroad in the world.<a name=310:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=311:2></a> That is what I understand.<a name=311:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=311:4></a> It says in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>, "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace".<a name=311:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=311:6></a> And then in the epistle to the Romans, the great thought is righteousness, and so when we come to chapter 8, it is said "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:4">Romans  8:4</a>".<a name=311:7></a> It is not without significance that the great system called the great harlot is no less than the Romish system, the Romish church; not that we are here to bring up names, but we have to deal with the truth, and the epistle to the Romans deals with what was at Rome in the early days after the truth of the assembly was introduced.<a name=311:8></a> The truth as carried to Rome, and the great epistle to the Romans contains the truth that was delivered to the saints at that time.<a name=311:9></a> It is, therefore, very suggestive that the righteousnesses of the saints should be worked out in our minds from that great epistle which was written to Rome, and yet Rome is in mind in what is said in the body of the book of Revelation up to the end of chapter 18.<a name=311:10></a> Many of us perhaps are not aware that we are actually dealing with the system that is all around us, not only the system called the church of Rome, but all religious systems that derive their character and principles from her, for she has daughters.<a name=311:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=313:5></a> Quite so.<a name=313:6></a> You might say all the epistles work out the righteousnesses of the saints, but they are to be worked out as over against the awful thing in this book that is called the harlot, which is entirely destroyed; the smoke of it goes up for ever and ever, and then the ground is cleared for the assembly to be seen first as the wife, and then in the clothing.<a name=313:7></a> But in chapter 21, she is seen coming down out of heaven, first as a bride, "the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>".<a name=313:8></a> In verse 1 and what follows, she is seen in that way up to the end of verse 8.<a name=313:9></a> But then from the beginning of verse 9, she is seen in her millennial functions and glories, which is the next thing to be considered.<a name=313:10></a> Firstly, there is the thought of what is current now in the preparation, but secondly what comes down from God out of heaven; that is to say, she is seen in her heavenly character.<a name=313:11></a>

		I have read these verses because they are in Philippians.<a name=324:1></a> I might get some verses like them elsewhere, but they are read because they are in the epistle to the Philippians, and also because of what they contain in themselves; that is, what is positive.<a name=324:2></a> There is very much of other than positive features in the world.<a name=324:3></a> When I speak of 'positive', I refer to what is conveyed in these verses, positive in the sense of what is substantially good, and which is thus to occupy us, so that we might be positive in the assertion of what is good.<a name=324:4></a> Philippians is especially in mind as the epistle which arose from the work of God through Paul in Macedonia.<a name=324:5></a> It will be recalled that as Paul was at Troas, a word came to him in a vision, a man of Macedonia speaking to him, saying, "Come over into Macedonia, and help us"; (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:9">Acts  16:9</a>) and the apostle gathered assuredly, it says, that the Lord had called them to preach in Macedonia, and he arrived at Philippi which was the chief city in that area.<a name=324:6></a> He refers to it as a colony -- a well-known word, although now somewhat giving way to dominion, to what is more distinguished and dignified politically.<a name=324:7></a> The apostle arrived, and I need not remind all of the history of the sufferings he endured, and those sufferings signified what was to be done in the place, in the city.<a name=324:8></a> It was to be a day of great prosperity spiritually, beginning with the women who went out to the riverside and had prayer.<a name=324:9></a> Prayer characterised the work there in a peculiar way, but then a certain woman came into view before the sufferings, and before the result of the sufferings, namely Lydia, "whose heart the Lord opened", and not only opened, but opened "to attend to the things spoken by Paul", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:14">Acts  16:14</a>).<a name=324:10></a> So there was a peculiar

	<div class="paragraph">
		Returning to Paul's work in Philippi, it is to say a word about the epistles; there is only one epistle to Philippi, one to Colosse, one to Ephesus, but there are two to Corinth, and these two epistles may be profitably compared with the epistle to the Philippians, because Philippians especially records that they had fellowship with the apostle from the first day until the day on which he wrote to them; that is, there was continuance with them in the work, not only in the knowledge of God, but in the gospel; they were thoroughly with the apostle in what he was doing in his evangelical services.<a name=325:4></a> So he was free to say many things about them that we often quote to one another, among which are the verses I have read to encourage us to be occupied with what is positively good, and to steady us in that occupation.<a name=325:5></a> There are many currents which are affecting us, affecting the saints, which we may regard as political currents, and we have to be guarded and fortified against them.<a name=325:6></a> The fortification I have in mind is in these verses, but I also refer to the general character of the epistle, and how it encourages the brethren to what is good.<a name=325:7></a> So I refer to a verse or two I have in mind with this in view.<a name=325:8></a> The apostle says, "Constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication

	<div class="paragraph">
		I read that because it is a characteristic passage in Philippians, an encouraging passage for the saints there, and it has a striking application to what is in mind at the present time, and especially as to what has happened today.<a name=326:4></a> We have just heard of a sister who has today departed to be with Christ, and another sister who was buried today.<a name=326:5></a> This epistle speaks of Paul's exercises about departing to be with Christ, and it is a matter that every one of us would, I am sure, have in his mind, more or less; it certainly is in my mind because it is so imminent in persons of one's age, and when such occurrences as two sisters having departed to be with Christ are mentioned, we are not without feeling.<a name=326:6></a> The name of one of them has been long known in this city, and her family, too, is honoured in this city, so I thought it would be quite in order to call attention to the great apostle Paul's own exercises.<a name=326:7></a> He was not at all concerned with any fear of death, he spoke of it as something to be desired; he said elsewhere, "I do not deprecate dying" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#25:11">Acts  25:11</a>); he had no fear

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention this so that we might have it before us, and consider the epistle in the many things that are well known to us, being often quoted in our Bible readings and thought of in our private readings.<a name=327:5></a> Amongst these are such wonderful passages as refer to the Lord's own incarnation; His <i>mind</i> , the mind of Christ, is spoken of, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation" <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:5">Philippians  2:5</a> - 7.<a name=327:6></a> This epistle, and what I am saying tonight, has in mind to keep us lowly, because it is our salvation, it is a protection for us to keep lowly in the sense of the lowliness of the mind of Christ.<a name=327:7></a> I refer to it because it is such an outstanding passage in this epistle.<a name=327:8></a> I am not speaking of it in itself, I refer to the verses read, but I think it right to call attention to what is read with regard to the departing to be with Christ of two of our number in this city, and it is intended to sober us.<a name=327:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other passages in Paul's epistles which allude to our being conformed to the image of Christ, which is a matter that requires the most diligent looking into on the part of all of us.<a name=327:10></a> We often think of what we are to be like, and of what our condition will be in the resurrection.<a name=327:11></a> John says, "it doth

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very remarkable that it is said of us that we are "sons of the resurrection", the word "sons" being a figurative word in that sense, because the resurrection does not beget sons; sons of the resurrection is a result of Christ's resurrection.<a name=329:2></a> We shall be as angels; you might say we are greater than angels, and that is true, and amongst the things in my mind is this greatness as attaching to our very selves, that is that we are the very first family in the whole universe.<a name=329:3></a> Every family in the heavens and on the earth is named by the Father, but we are the first family; the evidence of that might easily be shown in the fact that the Lord Jesus says, "I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star.<a name=329:4></a> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come", (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>,17).<a name=329:5></a> The bride is alongside the Spirit, she is nearest to the Deity, as one has often said, and what a great thing it is to think over, that we belong to the family that is nearest to God, for it is said, that the Spirit <i>and</i> the bride say, "Come", to the Lord Jesus.<a name=329:6></a> They act together, they say the same thing.<a name=329:7></a> You see, therefore, how great our position is, and not only that, but <i>we</i> are great, we are the objects of it, we are in mind, as has been said.<a name=329:8></a> The fact of it being said by the Spirit of God should affect us and should lead to a walk that is in keeping with it.<a name=329:9></a> In Ephesians it is said that there are good works ordained by God beforehand for us to walk in; they have been here, and they are here now, but the question is whether we are walking in them now.<a name=329:10></a> I thought I might freely bring this before us, so that we may be affected by the greatness of the things into which we are brought, and amongst these are what we shall be according to this epistle.<a name=329:11></a> This is to be taken in as a positive thing applicable to us,

		I proceed to say a word as to these verses, because they are very practical and come home to us; I might say they are homely thoughts, calculated to affect us, and they begin thus, "Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest", (that word "honest" has the force of what is noble), "whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things".<a name=330:2></a> There are no bad things mentioned at all.<a name=330:3></a> The newspapers contain what is corruptive, that which is vicious, and we have to be on our guard as to the use of these papers, although we cannot be in the world as not knowing what is current in it.<a name=330:4></a> The Scriptures afford much instruction and much information as to what is current in the world, and they afford, too, what God has in mind in the way of judgment, one of the most solemn things one can mention.<a name=330:5></a> In the book of Revelation it says, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a>,2.<a name=330:6></a> That is something that came in late, in the period of the unfolding of the testimony of the Scriptures.<a name=330:7></a> This Revelation came in late, it came in from God to the Lord Jesus, it was a revelation, an apocalypse, an unfolding, an unveiling of things that were to come.<a name=330:8></a> "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:19">Revelation  1:19</a>)".<a name=330:9></a> John has to write

		according to this order in the book of Revelation; the Lord directed him what to write, and the order in which the subjects should be written; and, of course, what was written was to be read according to the order in which it was written.<a name=331:1></a> So it is well to follow that order, and if we do, we shall get much instruction, because we all need this instruction as to what is coming on the world; awful woes are coming on the world.<a name=331:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only refer to this by way of contrast with the verses I read, as in them there is not a single woe mentioned, not a single evil report; what is mentioned is all good, and it is calculated to strengthen and purify our hearts and minds, so that we may be stabilised in the midst of the evil that is current abroad.<a name=331:3></a> The evil in the book of Revelation is only recorded to sober us, and to bring us into accord with the mind of God at the present time, in order that we may have a clear outlook as to what is coming, because there is nothing coming to stimulate hope in the sense of prosperity in this world.<a name=331:4></a> God is not on those lines at the present time, not indeed that He does not prosper people, nor that the saints are not to prosper too, for God prospers us, but that is not to make us anything in the world, God is not on those lines.<a name=331:5></a> He has written the book of Revelation to sober us, to solemnise us, so that we may be brought into accord with Him as to the judgments that are impending, and they are awful.<a name=331:6></a> You say, That is hardly in keeping with what you began with.<a name=331:7></a> I am just speaking of things as they come to me, and I see that the brethren do well to look at things in the face.<a name=331:8></a> There are terrible things coming, but on the other hand, there are promises, and these are among the good things about which I have read.<a name=331:9></a> The greatest promise in the sense of which I have been speaking, is what the Lord gives to Philadelphia, <i>"I</i> also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which

		is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth", (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>).<a name=332:1></a> Therefore, we have to be on our guard, lest we be earth-dwellers, and be concerned about our houses and furniture and cars and all sorts of things; we are not to be occupied with them, but to learn to be heavenly, to be <i>positively</i> heavenly, because of what we <i>are</i> , not only what we shall come into, but what we <i>are</i> already, not naturally, but what we are as Christians; and so the word is, "What hath God wrought!<a name=332:2></a>" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#23:23">Numbers  23:23</a>) If we speak thus, it is not a question of admiring ourselves because of the work of God, but of seeing what the work of God is.<a name=332:3></a> God is to be glorified in His work, and if He is, we have to be occupied with the good things, the things that are above -- "Have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth", (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:2">Colossians  3:2</a>).<a name=332:4></a> It is a question of the mind, and we can control our minds.<a name=332:5></a> God has given us minds, but our minds are not to control us, we are to control our minds.<a name=332:6></a> So Paul says, <i>"I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:25">Romans  7:25</a>).<a name=332:7></a> It is a determination in his mind, <i>"I myself</i>".<a name=332:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here it is a question of things that are dignifying, purifying and ennobling.<a name=333:12></a> That is what these words are meant for, so I mention them accordingly.<a name=333:13></a> The passage goes on further, "whatsoever things are of good report"; these are not the reports given by the public press (I am not now seeking to occupy you too much in that sense), but what is of good report is what is reliably reported.<a name=333:14></a> We may hear things and

		The last words of David, dear brethren, cannot fail to be of interest to all of us, and what is in mind in reading this part of the chapter is <i>kingship</i> , not that I wish to speak of kingship as such, but because it applies peculiarly to David.<a name=338:1></a> What we shall come to is rule, which indeed David speaks of here, "The ruler among men", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:3">2 Samuel  23:3</a>.<a name=338:2></a> What was in mind was mutual feeling between the ruler and the ruled, and, as applying to our David, the Lord Jesus, He said that He was among them as One who served (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:27">Luke  22:27</a>).<a name=338:3></a> What is in mind now is the thought of rule, not among the nations, but among the brethren.<a name=338:4></a> The only way we can get rule now according to God is among the brethren.<a name=338:5></a> So it is thought that these words of David may help us to apply rule among the brethren.<a name=338:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You might say no one is more suitable, either morally or actually, to deal with this matter of rule than David; although there is a higher than he, of course.<a name=338:7></a> David is a type of the Lord Jesus, yet not simply a type, there is a substance in David which is often to be observed in the Old Testament saints, prophets or poets.<a name=338:8></a> So as I said, David is entitled to a voice; in fact, what he says implies this -- "the last words of David: David the son of Jesse saith", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:1">2 Samuel  23:1</a>.<a name=338:9></a> You will all recall, too, how there were his last prayers, and they become quite interesting; they relate to Solomon, they relate to Christ, of course.<a name=338:10></a> If we selected the last words of the speakers in the Old Testament, we would have a book of great value, if it could be put together and used.<a name=338:11></a> But when we come to divine writing or speaking, they imply infinitude; we cannot apply that to David, but we can to Christ; if all His works were "written one by one" -- very remarkable -- "not

		What is in mind now is to bring down the last words of David to our own times, as to what is suitable in persons who rule; those who rule among men.<a name=339:3></a> It may be rendered <i>over men</i> , but it is very likely it is <i>among men</i> , and it is a very beautiful touch I would say, especially as applied to the Lord Jesus as to how He was among the brethren.<a name=339:4></a> "But <i>I</i> am in the midst of you as the one that serves" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:27">Luke  22:27</a>), He says.<a name=339:5></a> That is a matter of which everyone who is serving in a prominent way should take notice; that is to say, to be <i>among</i> the brethren, not above them.<a name=339:6></a> Although David does allude here to what is above, he was raised up on high, God has the right to raise up His servant, and not only to raise him up, but to raise him up on <i>high</i> ; therefore, it is a most distinguished place.<a name=339:7></a> We get others like it, but David is unique.<a name=339:8></a> The brethren will all agree that David is always attractive, especially in the book of Revelation where there is so much to distress in the awful judgments of God unfolded.<a name=339:9></a> The refinement of David is seen there, Christ being the root of David; so that he is more than an ordinary writer in Scripture, he is a prophet, he is a priest, and he is king.<a name=339:10></a> We could apply all these titles to David, but I prefer to apply them to the real David, the Lord Jesus, because He is the Ruler now.<a name=339:11></a> So in writing to the assemblies, the Lord presents Himself as the Son of God, whose eyes are like a flame of fire.<a name=339:12></a> He is the Son of God, He is the Ruler in the house, He is over the house of God.<a name=339:13></a>

		I have in mind, as it will be observed from the verses read, to speak of the faithfulness of God.<a name=350:1></a> It is mentioned in these three scriptures.<a name=350:2></a> Firstly, it is said, "by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son", and secondly that He "will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear, but will with the temptation make the issue also", and then finally it was a question of the veracity of the servant of God, that is Paul.<a name=350:3></a> Servants are often questioned as to their veracity and transparency, and nothing is more important than that we should be true and transparent and loyal to God, to Christ, and to the saints, and to their interests.<a name=350:4></a> So the third scripture is peculiarly important as to veracity, as to transparency in our motives, ways and services.<a name=350:5></a> In making these remarks I will take the liberty of referring to the Old Testament as to the great thought of God's faithfulness, and I refer to Genesis, the great patriarchal book where we find old men in responsibility to God, but true in it.<a name=350:6></a> In some instances, indeed, as even in Abraham himself, there were deviations from the right path, and also in Isaac and in Jacob, but in general they were true, and proved God's faithfulness in their loyalty to the truth.<a name=350:7></a> Abraham had been promised a son, and the son was duly born, Isaac.<a name=350:8></a> God thus proved His faithfulness to His promises, as He always does.<a name=350:9></a>

		Now when Isaac is raised from among the dead in figure he does not go down with Abraham, he goes up to heaven, you might say.<a name=357:2></a> I have gone to chapter 26, but the facts of chapter 22 would mean that in principle Isaac is not only risen, but he has gone up somewhere, he has gone out of view.<a name=357:3></a> Abraham goes down, and his young men, to Beer-sheba.<a name=357:4></a> He is settled in Beer-sheba.<a name=357:5></a> He lived there, but Isaac is not said to have gone there; that is to say, as we had it today, Christ goes to heaven.<a name=357:6></a> He is entitled to go there any time.<a name=357:7></a> He is the Son of God and can go to heaven whenever He pleases.<a name=357:8></a> He may come to us and He does; but He is the Son of God and therefore has liberty to do what He pleases; I say that most reverently.<a name=357:9></a> The Lord has liberty to come as He pleases, either to come to us or to come and go from us into heaven, but even if He goes wisdom remains here.<a name=357:10></a> The Spirit remains here in all His power, so the testimony remains here.<a name=357:11></a> Isaac did not go down, but Abraham and his young men go down to Beer-sheba.<a name=357:12></a> Isaac is now seen in chapter 26, and is tested as Abraham was tested, but he did not fail; he is at Beer-sheba, and I want every one here today to name the thing I am speaking of, to know the faithfulness of God and stand by and count upon it at all times and in all circumstances.<a name=357:13></a> And so, as I said the testimony comes to him that his servants had found water, they had dug a well and found water, and "he called it Shebah (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#26:33">Genesis  26:33</a>)".<a name=357:14></a> The general principle for the continuance of things is the presence of the water, which means the Holy Spirit.<a name=357:15></a> It can only be in the power of the Holy Spirit that anything can be maintained according to God.<a name=357:16></a>

		been through a lot.<a name=358:1></a> We are coming to the end of his history at the end of Genesis, which book is mainly the history of these three patriarchs.<a name=358:2></a> In chapter 46 Jacob goes down to Joseph.<a name=358:3></a> It was Joseph who had sent for him, meaning that now we are coming on to the fulfilment of the promises.<a name=358:4></a> Joseph is not in the land of Canaan; he is in Egypt, he is among the gentiles.<a name=358:5></a> Christ is now amongst the gentiles, dear brethren.<a name=358:6></a> He is not among the Jews.<a name=358:7></a> His work mainly was among the Jews during His sojourn here, but at Pentecost He is first among the Jews, but presently He is among the gentiles.<a name=358:8></a> Christ is among the gentiles now, I mean that is the position, and we can thank God we are all gentiles here; but it is Christ among the gentiles.<a name=358:9></a> It is a very precious thought to have before us.<a name=358:10></a> Although we are gentiles, we have Christ among us.<a name=358:11></a> The Messiah is among the gentiles, He is not among the Jews; He will be, He will come back.<a name=358:12></a> "He shall send Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:20">Acts  3:20</a>), Peter says, but He is not come yet, not in that sense.<a name=358:13></a> He comes to us, as I have been saying, and presently He will come <i>for</i> us.<a name=358:14></a> He comes <i>to</i> us now, He comes <i>for</i> us, and then He comes <i>with</i> us.<a name=358:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are three things which I would like to insert here in what I have to say.<a name=358:16></a> First, it is the thought of the Lord Jesus coming to us as He does in assembly, and then coming for us according to 1 Thessalonians, and then He is coming <i>with</i> us.<a name=358:17></a> He will not come without us.<a name=358:18></a> He is coming with His saints to be admired <i>in</i> them, for they are His glory.<a name=358:19></a> He is not coming without us.<a name=358:20></a> It is a very precious thought to have before us in all these meetings, dear brethren, that the Lord is amongst us by the Spirit, but He is presently coming for us, and then He comes with us.<a name=358:21></a> That is the finish, "to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed", (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#1:10">2 Thessalonians  1:10</a>).<a name=358:22></a> So that is the outlook and I just endeavour to keep it before the brethren in this address that we may all

		be furnished in view of the great events that are ahead of us.<a name=359:1></a> The greatest possible events are ahead of us, we are essential to them too, we belong to them, we are part of them, and the thing is to hold ourselves free of the world, to refuse the influence of the Philistine and maintain our liberty in the power of the Spirit which is seen typically in the well.<a name=359:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would just refer to Jacob.<a name=359:3></a> It is said that he is going down to Joseph, which is very remarkable because the land was promised to the patriarchs.<a name=359:4></a> God said, He espied it for them (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#20:6">Ezekiel  20:6</a>).<a name=359:5></a> He saw the land at a distance, as from heaven, and He espied it for Israel; that is the way He speaks of it, but He is not taking it on yet, He has given us the earnest of the inheritance, but He is not taking on the land as yet, we have to wait for that, and Israel has to wait for it, but then Jacob is going out into Egypt, he is going out among the nations.<a name=359:6></a> My thought is that Christ is now among the nations.<a name=359:7></a> It is a question of our keeping the charge of the Lord; Aaron's family and Aaron kept the charge of the Lord.<a name=359:8></a> It is a great matter to keep the charge of the Lord; and these meetings are all to that end, to strengthen our hearts to keep the charge of the Lord, not to let things go wrong, but to have them go right that the saints may be governed by right principles.<a name=359:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So now, as I said, Jacob was going down to Egypt, he was going out of Canaan, and of course it is bound to affect us if we have to face that situation, but then we are going out to Joseph.<a name=359:10></a> There is nothing to fear if we are going out to Christ.<a name=359:11></a> It is a question of the position of Christ, whether He is now among the nations or whether He is among the Jews, or whether it be that He is just in heaven.<a name=359:12></a> As Peter says, "whom heaven indeed must receive till the times of the restoring of all things", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:21">Acts  3:21</a>).<a name=359:13></a> It is just a matter of Christ being in heaven.<a name=359:14></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>

		I now want to come back to the passages I have alluded to; the last one specially: "Now God is faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:18">2 Corinthians  1:18</a>.<a name=361:10></a> Paul is vindicating himself as to how he had been regarding and treating the Corinthians.<a name=361:11></a> He had been treating them in love.<a name=361:12></a> He loved them, but they thought he was prevaricating, a thought sometimes allowed as to brethren who care for us, but Paul said, "God is faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay.<a name=361:13></a> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea <i>is</i> in him.<a name=361:14></a> For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us".<a name=361:15></a> You see the triumphant point that the apostle reaches in opening up this truth, and it is for us.<a name=361:16></a> Of course, the Corinthians

		You can understand how the brethren would say, How did Paul get on last night?<a name=362:13></a> I would ask that question myself.<a name=362:14></a> And how did Timotheus do?<a name=362:15></a> Where was he preaching?<a name=362:16></a> And how did Silvanus do, and where did he preach?<a name=362:17></a> You may be sure they were all preaching, and they were preaching Jesus Christ God's Son; that was the point, Jesus Christ God's Son.<a name=362:18></a> So we should not ask people to preach who do not know how to preach, because God has given gifts to men, He has sent them all down here by the Spirit.<a name=362:19></a> There is no reason why we should not have gifts because they are available; "desire earnestly the greater gifts" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:31">1 Corinthians  12:31</a>), we are told.<a name=362:20></a> The gifts are available and certainly they are
