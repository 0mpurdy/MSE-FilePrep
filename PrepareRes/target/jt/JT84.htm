		I thought we might look at the household of faith.<a name=1:4></a> It contemplates that faith will be in those in it.<a name=1:5></a> The next step to the household of faith is the household of God, and that leads to the assembly.<a name=1:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One feature of the household idea is stewardship.<a name=1:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:2">Genesis  24:2</a> Abraham speaks "to his servant, the eldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had".<a name=1:8></a>

		Then training in the house is to be noticed.<a name=1:9></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14:14">Genesis  14:14</a> says: "And Abram heard that his brother was taken captive; and he led out his trained servants, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen".<a name=1:10></a> How ill-trained we are in service and the things of God!<a name=1:11></a> The household idea is attractive; it should appeal to all believers.<a name=1:12></a> Control is there; training is there; influence is there.<a name=1:13></a> In Galatians the household of faith is referred to in addressing lawless christians.<a name=1:14></a>

		An emergency arises in connection with Lot.<a name=1:15></a> A brother is taken north about two hundred miles.<a name=1:16></a> How are we going to meet it?<a name=1:17></a> You need your whole household to set that brother right, and it is a trained household.<a name=1:18></a> The number is three hundred and eighteen, not round numbers; every one is necessary.<a name=1:19></a> An untrained person would be in the way.<a name=1:20></a> The apostle sent a trained servant to Corinth in the person of Timothy.<a name=1:21></a> He had been "shewn" certain things at Corinth; in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>it was a matter of report.<a name=1:22></a>

		Chapter 15 brings in the thought of the seed, for the household of faith must be "wholly a right seed" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:21">Jeremiah  2:21</a>).<a name=2:20></a> Abram says, "I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus;" as if to say, 'he is all right, but what is he to me?<a name=2:21></a>' Abram is discriminative; he must have "wholly a right seed" with right antecedents, right father, right mother.<a name=2:22></a> A wife must be a sister, not a half-sister.<a name=2:23></a> Esau married two of the daughters of the land.<a name=2:24></a> Ishmael had a good father but a poor mother.<a name=2:25></a> Mongrels are objectionable in the house of God.<a name=2:26></a> Look at Rome, Lutherans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and so on -- the mothers are not right and the product cannot be right.<a name=2:27></a> The wholly right seed is Christ.<a name=2:28></a> Those of the right seed are of faith, and if they have the right mother they will apprehend the assembly.<a name=2:29></a>

		In verse 9, the heifer comes first, then a she-goat, each mature.<a name=2:30></a> It is the feminine side in maturity.<a name=2:31></a> It means that Abram must go through things spiritually.<a name=2:32></a> <i>He</i> begins the four hundred years of suffering.<a name=2:33></a> It must be so, for it cannot be figured out in any other way; actually the children of Israel were in Egypt a little over two hundred years.<a name=2:34></a> So now

		We might now look at the subject of <i>weaning</i>.<a name=7:10></a> Hannah is said to have weaned Samuel, but here the mother's name is left out.<a name=7:11></a> It says: "And the child grew, and was weaned" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21:8">Genesis  21:8</a>).<a name=7:12></a> Weaning is a fixed principle; it goes with growth and refers to believers in a christian household.<a name=7:13></a> Mary had not weaned the Lord spiritually, for when He was in the temple at the age of twelve, she says: "Child, why hast thou dealt thus with us?<a name=7:14></a> behold, thy father and I have sought thee distressed" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:48">Luke  2:48</a>).<a name=7:15></a> The fixed principle was not there.<a name=7:16></a> The idea in weaning is that my child is cast upon God and I impress that upon him.<a name=7:17></a> A wife may maintain the principle when the husband fails.<a name=7:18></a> Abraham failed.<a name=7:19></a> "The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21:11">Genesis  21:11</a>) -- that is, the casting out of Ishmael.<a name=7:20></a> It enhances the importance of having "a sister as wife" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:5">1 Corinthians  9:5</a>).<a name=7:21></a> In connection with this casting out it is remarkable that the Holy Spirit quotes her very words in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:30">Galatians  4:30</a>.<a name=7:22></a> If the principle of weaning is not followed, we carry our children into the meeting, and in times of difficulty they follow blindly the lead we give, whether we are

		I thought we might go on to Exodus, carrying forward our subject of the household of faith, and see that it is presented more from a ministerial or levitical standpoint in this book.<a name=14:1></a> Levites typify the saints as all first-born ones; or as heavenly, as in the book of Joshua; or as ministers or servants -- as in Exodus.<a name=14:2></a> They are not a class today.<a name=14:3></a> All christians are priests and all are levites.<a name=14:4></a> They are here viewed as in service in testimony.<a name=14:5></a>

		It is worthy of note that in chapter 6: 14 it says: "These are the heads of their fathers' houses", and so on, until you reach Levi; then Levi is pursued to Phinehas in verse 25, and nothing more is said about the tribes, but Moses and Aaron are brought in.<a name=14:6></a> That is, the service of the Levites is now emphasised.<a name=14:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The growth of Moses in a ministerial connection is to be noted.<a name=16:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:10">Exodus  2:10</a> it says, "And when the child was grown;" but in verse 11, "And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their burdens".<a name=16:5></a> The Levite is a burden bearer, especially in Numbers.<a name=16:6></a> He is seen as carrying things.<a name=16:7></a> One thinks of Christ who bore our burdens.<a name=16:8></a> How many burdens there are at the present moment to be carried, what need of levites!<a name=16:9></a> But Moses does not bear them yet; that is to come later.<a name=16:10></a> He sees the two brothers fighting.<a name=16:11></a> That is a sorrow -- not a burden.<a name=16:12></a> In Galatia they were biting and devouring one another.<a name=16:13></a> These two were not ready for adjustment.<a name=16:14></a> Moses asks: "Why art thou smiting thy neighbour?<a name=16:15></a>" The man is not only a brother, but a neighbour.<a name=16:16></a> Your neighbour is one whom you should certainly not smite; you are to love your neighbour.<a name=16:17></a> Moses' levitical instinct leads him to smite the Egyptian, but the one who did wrong in fighting with his brother is depriving himself of a great minister who could help him.<a name=16:18></a> How often we do this!<a name=16:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian.<a name=16:20></a> And he sat by the well".<a name=16:21></a> He had learned his lesson now.<a name=16:22></a> The smiting of Egyptians does not make a minister but sitting by the well does.<a name=16:23></a> Think of Moses as he made his journey from Egypt to Midian; it is a long distance.<a name=16:24></a> Every step of that distance taught him a lesson.<a name=16:25></a> He must have said to himself, 'I cannot deliver my brethren by smiting the Egyptians one by one; it would take me all my life'.<a name=16:26></a> He learns that it is "not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts".<a name=16:27></a> Notice it is <i>the</i> well.<a name=16:28></a> Now Moses is truly on levitical lines.<a name=16:29></a> The idea of the well in Exodus and Numbers

		Another thing to be noted is that Reuel's daughters do not appreciate Moses; they tell their father, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds".<a name=17:12></a> A levite must be prepared for this -- to serve and get no thanks.<a name=17:13></a> Paul says: "Now <i>I</i> shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:15">2 Corinthians  12:15</a>).<a name=17:14></a> But Reuel has better thoughts than his daughters, showing that God cares for all Levites.<a name=17:15></a> Reuel is with God.<a name=17:16></a> God will never leave the Levites uncared for.<a name=17:17></a> Verse 21 says, "And Moses consented to remain with the man".<a name=17:18></a> It would almost appear that it was against his will.<a name=17:19></a> Paul says, "But if against my will" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:17">1 Corinthians  9:17</a>).<a name=17:20></a> A Levite is not self-willed; he happily accepts the will of Another.<a name=17:21></a> Moses does not stay for Zipporah; he remains "with the man".<a name=17:22></a> Think of Moses, the gentleman, the prince, with Reuel.<a name=17:23></a> Reuel is a Midianite and Moses is truly a great man.<a name=17:24></a> But this young man must now submit to obscurity.<a name=17:25></a> He is to be a shepherd.<a name=17:26></a> This is rough work for a nobleman, for a man trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.<a name=17:27></a> But how beautifully he accepts his circumstances.<a name=17:28></a> He does not look for a better place; he does not ask for wages.<a name=17:29></a> Everything comes from Reuel's side.<a name=17:30></a> Moses asks for nothing; he even accepts Zipporah, for it says: "He gave Moses Zipporah his daughter".<a name=17:31></a> Then, in chapter 3 it says, "And Moses tended the flock of Jethro his

		The next thing to notice is that "he led the flock behind the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God -- to Horeb".<a name=18:9></a> He led them in the right direction, to the mountain of God.<a name=18:10></a> Notice it is <i>the</i> flock.<a name=18:11></a> No true minister will say, 'my flock'.<a name=18:12></a> It is Jethro's flock.<a name=18:13></a> Then there is the thorn-bush.<a name=18:14></a> It represents Moses' own littleness and nothingness, as well as Israel's, and it is not consumed.<a name=18:15></a> We must remember that "also our God is a consuming fire".<a name=18:16></a> He is many other things, which we know in grace, but He <i>is</i>, also, a consuming fire.<a name=18:17></a> This appearance reminds one of the three in Daniel.<a name=18:18></a> There was nothing to burn with them; and one "like a son of God" stands with them.<a name=18:19></a> There is no disparity -- how wonderful!<a name=18:20></a>

		THE DIVINE IDEA OF A CITY, ITS MAINTENANCE AND ITS FUNCTIONS

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind, dear brethren, to occupy you with the idea of a city as presented in Scripture, hoping to suggest something applicable, and perhaps distinctive, so that the divine thought may be better understood and carried into effect by us in these days of small things in which we are.<a name=34:1></a> But however small the things may be that are current, no divine thought is to be small to us, or allowed to lapse; all is to be held in a living way.<a name=34:2></a> You will remember when the Lord in the book of Revelation had spoken and shown Himself to John, that, as John fell at His feet as one dead, the Lord touched him, saying, "<i>I</i> am .<a name=34:3></a>.<a name=34:4></a>.<a name=34:5></a> the living One" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:17">Revelation  1:17</a>).<a name=34:6></a> That is what He was, that is what He would be, what He had shown Himself to be as He arose from the dead.<a name=34:7></a> According to Luke's account He had shown Himself unto them living (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:3">Acts  1:3</a>), and He had not ceased to be that.<a name=34:8></a> Whatever decay had taken place in the assembly -- and, alas, decay had set in -- there would be no change in Christ.<a name=34:9></a> He was still the living One, and He touched John, which is a suggestion of what is needful in remnant times, the touch of the living One.<a name=34:10></a> He laid His right hand upon John, meaning that not only was He living, but His strength remained and was available, so that John should carry out his service accordingly.<a name=34:11></a> He was to carry it out not only as a mere seer -- although he was that, and was to write the things that he had seen, and the things that are and the things that should be afterwards -- but the spirit of life was to enter into his writing.<a name=34:12></a> John makes much of writing.<a name=34:13></a> The fourth gospel is his, as we know, the great theme being life; and his first epistle also deals with life, and so throughout his earlier writings, they are all in

	<div class="paragraph">
		relation to life.<a name=35:1></a> It is as if the Lord were to say, 'There must be no flagging; the ministry must go on in a living way; whatever the state of the saints, the state of the minister must be that he is living;' and we know by reading those wonderful chapters in the Apocalypse what vigour and life there is in the writer, and how he appeals in relation to the water of life.<a name=35:2></a> What a volume, too, there is!<a name=35:3></a> There is no slackening of the thought in relation to the river that flows out from the throne of God, clear as crystal, "the river of water of life", fructifying all that is around.<a name=35:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord would encourage us in regard of every thought of God; nothing should be dormant among us, although we may be at times at a loss to know how to make the thoughts living; but things are only living practically as they are held by the Spirit in our hearts and minds.<a name=35:5></a> We may be at a loss at times to make every thought practically living; but as we wait on the Lord He supports us so that no thought should be dormant, or dead; and certainly not the thought of a city.<a name=35:6></a> That is to go forward.<a name=35:7></a> We all know how it comes in in Revelation; we are never tired of referring to the marvellous presentation of it in chapter 21.<a name=35:8></a> How stimulating it is!<a name=35:9></a> and how it should reflect backwards so as to stimulate us in our day in regard of the divine thought; for certainly the presentation of it there is in order that we might see that it has not lapsed in the mind of God.<a name=35:10></a> It is one of the great thoughts of God, presented from the outset of faith, and looked for by faith.<a name=35:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I read from Ruth to show how the thought of the city appears there in what I might call the creating of royalty; for the city thought necessarily attaches to royalty.<a name=35:12></a> There is "The city of the great King" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:35">Matthew  5:35</a>); that is the idea; and what we get here in Boaz gives us the clue to what there was in Bethlehem, this great Bethlehemite, Boaz, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		So that Boaz accepted the suggestion of Ruth at once, and that is why I called attention when reading the scripture to the changed pronoun, pointing out that it ought to be 'he', instead of 'she' as in the Authorised Version.<a name=36:12></a> The meaning is plain enough, that while it is true that she also went into the city, the point is that he went into the city.<a name=36:13></a> That is, her claim suggested to him a great matter, not only her matter, but a great matter, that is, the question of

		redemption.<a name=37:1></a> We do well to go over the ground of redemption, and if there be any claim put forward on the Lord as our Redeemer, the One who has a right (for it is a question of right) the Lord will go over the whole ground with us.<a name=37:2></a> There is constant need that the Lord should go over the whole ground of one phase of the truth after another, and every time He does it we get something distinctive.<a name=37:3></a> It is no question of one meeting being better than another, but is there anything distinctive?<a name=37:4></a> Is there anything that is needed?<a name=37:5></a> Is there anything that the Lord has called attention to?<a name=37:6></a> If there be something that we have been neglecting, or have not perceived, then there is profit, definite gain as we go over the matter.<a name=37:7></a> And so Boaz went into the city as if making it a great matter.<a name=37:8></a> It may be a small matter in our eyes, but it is not so in the Lord's, for everything must stand in relation to the whole scheme or system of truth.<a name=37:9></a> If He is to meet the obligation put upon Him, so to speak, He must go into the city, the great centre where all things are resolved, where the light and the authority and the administration are carried out.<a name=37:10></a> He goes into the city.<a name=37:11></a> Sure enough, Naomi had suggested this to Ruth.<a name=37:12></a> After she had told her mother-in-law what had occurred Naomi said that the man would not rest until he saw the matter through; neither will the Lord rest.<a name=37:13></a> He proceeds at once, but He proceeds according to His own methods, which are always best.<a name=37:14></a> We had better, having suggested what is needed, leave matters with Him, and He will take our little affairs and bring them into His great affairs, and He will work them out in relation to His great affairs.<a name=37:15></a> So that Boaz goes into the city and sits in the gate, the gate being, of course, a place of publicity.<a name=37:16></a> It was a public place, but it was the place where things happened.<a name=37:17></a> How great a thing it is, beloved brethren, to be where divine things are happening, where they are likely to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Boaz sat in the gate and took up this matter.<a name=38:8></a> You are all conversant, no doubt, with the teaching of the history given in chapters 1 and 2, not only with the things that happened, but with what was required to meet the position.<a name=38:9></a> The obligation put on Boaz was carried out not only as in the city, but in relation to Israel.<a name=38:10></a> The way of doing things is called attention to, that is, the allusion is to the spiritual way of doing things: "This was the custom in .<a name=38:11></a>.<a name=38:12></a>.<a name=38:13></a> Israel" (<a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#4:7">Ruth  4:7</a>).<a name=38:14></a> I have no doubt, dear brethren, that the answer to all this in chapters 3 and 4 may be worked out in the gospels in relation first to Israel and then to the assembly.<a name=38:15></a> They both were in view in the closing moments of the Lord's life when He sent His disciples into the city to prepare the passover.<a name=38:16></a> It was a great matter.<a name=38:17></a> We do well to ponder the facts presented, as to what came into the Lord's mind, as I might say, the passover speaking of His relation to Israel which He was now foregoing, for He would not again partake of the fruit of the vine until He should drink it in a new way in the kingdom of His Father.<a name=38:18></a> But there was that before His eyes which was becoming everything to Him, that is, the

		assembly; and hence the deliberation with which everything was done, especially as recorded in Luke's gospel.<a name=39:1></a> It is really the Lord going to the city, literally, of course, Jerusalem, but more than that; He had already around Him an order of things, and had already inaugurated the system where henceforth all these thoughts, and the light of God, and the administration of God, should issue.<a name=39:2></a> We should bear all this in mind in pondering the records of the institution of the Lord's supper.<a name=39:3></a> The Lord impresses us with His carefulness (not that He was not always careful) that there should be preparation, and that there should be no cause for misunderstanding afterwards.<a name=39:4></a> The taking on of the right of redemption, and the obligation, and all that went with redemption -- that is, in relation to Israel and the assembly, now that the assembly was coming into view -- made it imperative that the disciples should realise what was taking place, that there should be no mistake, but that it should be perfectly clear what was in the Lord's mind.<a name=39:5></a> So as in the case of Boaz who went and sat in the gate, the Lord acted with the greatest deliberation.<a name=39:6></a> There was no question yet of the assembly as in Corinth, for there is no evidence of any sisters being present.<a name=39:7></a> It was a question of testimony, a question of Israel's custom; it was a question of everything being carried out according to God, and that the Lord's rights in redemption should be indisputable, that no question should be raised as to them; and to this end He was ready to accept humiliation.<a name=39:8></a> Doubtless the drawing off of the shoe as in the case of Boaz implies that the Lord had to accept humiliation, which He did, and went into the dust of death in order to establish His redemptive rights in relation to whomsoever they applied, and especially to ourselves now.<a name=39:9></a>

		Now, what I have said about the Lord's supper and what was in the upper room in Jerusalem requires careful consideration so that we might see how the thought of the city was there, and how it worked out in the succeeding chapters in Acts.<a name=40:4></a> But it waned, and it has continued to wane until well-nigh lost; although a little revival has taken place as depicted typically in the days of Nehemiah.<a name=40:5></a> We cannot, however, but be sensible of its smallness; and in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>we see how the Lord would check or repair whatever damage had accrued through carelessness.<a name=40:6></a> It is not Jerusalem now, nor are the apostles there, but the Lord had in His mind that the city in the true sense of the word should exist.<a name=40:7></a> That, dear brethren, is where special attention is needed, because the Lord has left us here so that we might help our brethren, and be ready to serve them.<a name=40:8></a> That is to say, the particular business of those who love the Lord at the present time is to help our brethren, so many of whom need help.<a name=40:9></a> So the Lord has one in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>in Saul, and He directs him to go into the city.<a name=40:10></a> Now, it is not accidental that the word 'city' is used, for you can understand that the Lord does not simply mean that Saul was to go inside the walls; He has more than that in mind.<a name=40:11></a> The Lord has in His mind the great thought of the city which He has inaugurated in the twelve; and now, as it was

		I want to show in the last scripture how this great thought is maintained not only in our localities, but in a general way, so that the city thought is maintained in the very presence of the apostasy.<a name=43:2></a> This is a great problem, and a great matter; and this scripture that deals with it is one of the most interesting sections of Scripture, certainly in this connection.<a name=43:3></a> Absalom had revolted, and Israel with him, and he was approaching Jerusalem, just as today the apostasy is heading up and almost engulfing everything and yet not everything, for after all -- and I say it with great triumph -- there is that here on earth, although obscure, which it cannot touch, and which means the overthrow of it all, the complete negation of the whole matter, and which will itself grow and grow till at last it will come out and fill the universe.<a name=43:4></a> These things of which I have been speaking and which we go on with in our localities, will be presently unveiled (they are veiled now) and they will fill the universe in the heavenly city.<a name=43:5></a>

		I now want to show just briefly how this is seen in this remarkable type.<a name=43:6></a> David, as you will observe, is in rejection.<a name=43:7></a> He is leaving the city; that is to say, applying it today, the Lord in a moral sense is rejected; really He has no place in christendom viewed as a whole.<a name=43:8></a> That is the position.<a name=43:9></a> What He had in the first of Acts and indeed right through Acts no longer exists publicly; He is already rejected in christendom as a whole.<a name=43:10></a> This has gone on for centuries, and David's position is a type of the Lord's, but what he says to Zadok and then to Hushai and the sequel to that show how the victory is certain.<a name=43:11></a> That is, there is that here that means the overthrow of the apostate religious state of things, and what I want to say, dear brethren, is that it is a mystery

		The verses I read in John's epistle call attention to the brethren, and how we know that we have passed from death to life because we love them; and, moreover, that as love has been shown in that He, that is Christ, laid down His life for us, we should lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=68:1></a> These verses form the basis of what I have to say.<a name=68:2></a> I have in mind that we should have a clear understanding of the persons referred to, those who are to be loved to the extent that we should lay down our lives for them.<a name=68:3></a> It is a right enquiry, Who are they?<a name=68:4></a> Whence are they?<a name=68:5></a> Where are they?<a name=68:6></a> Whither are they bound?<a name=68:7></a> If they are so important as to deserve such love, firstly, on the part of God in Christ, and, secondly, on the part of each christian, they surely deserve the most careful consideration and enquiry, so that we may be sure as to them, who they are and whence they are, what they are and where they are, whither they are bound, and what is their outlook.<a name=68:8></a> This epistle treats of its subjects radically, I may say, abstractly, and I have read the passages in Genesis so as to develop, by the help of the Spirit, the answer to these questions.<a name=68:9></a> The Lord enquired as to what men said about Him, as to who they said He was, and to this enquiry there was an answer forthcoming by revelation through Peter.<a name=68:10></a> But this answer was also confirmed by the teaching of Scripture, for revelation by God, whether in great or small measure, must always be in keeping with Scripture, Scripture being one whole!<a name=68:11></a> Every part of the divine unfolding agrees with all the other parts, and is confirmed, too, by the others; so that the announcement of

		You will see by comparison that Jacob secured his blessing on the principle of faith, though in discreditable circumstances; but he secured the blessing, and it is marked by gift, his father saying as he drew near, and as he kissed his son, "The smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed".<a name=70:5></a> That is, a subjective state is indicated.<a name=70:6></a> There was a work, as we call it, subjectively.<a name=70:7></a> The smell of a blessed field alludes not to what is superficial, but to what is potentially rich, and which will bear the fruits desired; that is, the brotherhood according to God.<a name=70:8></a> The smell was there, which by the Spirit, as we may say, Isaac smelt; and the blessing to Jacob is on the principle of gift according to what God is.<a name=70:9></a> As the Lord Jesus says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a>).<a name=70:10></a> He gives not the Spirit by measure unto Him.<a name=70:11></a> Things are on the principle of gift, and in abundance.<a name=70:12></a> Then the Lord proceeds in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:10">John  4:10</a> to speak of "the gift of God".<a name=70:13></a> Things are on the principle of gift.<a name=70:14></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27:28">Genesis  27:28</a> is the gift; then verse 29 suggests an administrative position: "Let peoples serve thee, And races bow down to thee.<a name=70:15></a> Be lord

		Well now, as I said, we get the thought of presentation in that way, and it is comforting, speaking of this, that Jude, so as to assure our hearts, says, in a beautiful doxology (another thing, dear brethren, that is to be noted in the apostolic writings, the fervency and the depth of feeling that marked these men) "To him that is able to keep you without stumbling .<a name=92:6></a>.<a name=92:7></a>.<a name=92:8></a>" (there is always that danger, so in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:23">Colossians  1:23</a> the 'if' comes in in verse 23) "and to set you" [or present you] "with exultation blameless before his glory".<a name=92:9></a> Think of the brilliancy of that light, the shining out of the glory, beloved!<a name=92:10></a> God is able to keep us, to set us up there, "God our Saviour" to whom he ascribes "glory, majesty, might, and authority, from before the whole age, and now, and to all the ages.<a name=92:11></a> Amen" (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#24">Jude  24</a>, 25).<a name=92:12></a> What great thoughts encircle what I am speaking of, dear brethren, being set up, or presented, in the presence of the glory by God Himself.<a name=92:13></a> He is able to do it; He is able to keep us from stumbling so as to do it.<a name=92:14></a> That is what He is aiming at, to keep us from stumbling, for the danger is great; and you may be sure that if God is aiming at great things, Satan is all the more aiming to defeat Him, so we are to be warned, but God is able to keep us.<a name=92:15></a>

		Now in Colossians we have perhaps the greatest thought in this respect.<a name=92:16></a> Colossians is what may be called a tentative epistle; it is not final for we are not yet in Canaan, and hence the 'if', but everything needed is brought in to induce a forward movement.<a name=92:17></a>

		This psalm is the beginning of the last book of Psalms, and significantly calls for praise.<a name=106:1></a> The book has praise in view, as might be expected, it being the last book of the Psalms, the whole book having God in mind, all things being for Him, and above all, the intelligent praises of His people.<a name=106:2></a> So that we have here a call to men, "Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; for his loving-kindness endureth for ever".<a name=106:3></a> What enters into the psalm most significantly, and what I wish to speak of, is the idea of "a city of habitation".<a name=106:4></a> The idea of a habitation, that is, a place of dwelling, whether in the country or in the city, is pronounced in the Scriptures.<a name=106:5></a> The earth was made, not in vain, but to be inhabited, and it will be.<a name=106:6></a> The Lord Jesus is said to be set over "the habitable world which is to come" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:5">Hebrews  2:5</a>).<a name=106:7></a> The city will be there, both the heavenly and the earthly; but the earth too will be a scene inhabited according to God.<a name=106:8></a> It is exhilarating to contemplate an earth, inhabited according to God, all knowing Him; as it is said, "The earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#11:9">Isaiah  11:9</a>).<a name=106:9></a> There will be a complete reversal of the present state of things where the very opposite, that is, ignorance of God, prevails.<a name=106:10></a> Men, it says, "did not think good to have God in their knowledge" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:28">Romans  1:28</a>); and that is how the matter stands; even where He has been known, the knowledge of Him is being systematically eliminated.<a name=106:11></a> How great will be the change, dear brethren, when the knowledge of God shall prevail with all the accompanying results here.<a name=106:12></a> That is what will mark the coming world, the world to come; many other things too as the result of it, but the

	<div class="paragraph">
		great thought is the knowledge of God, and His praise, as the result of that.<a name=107:1></a> This book has the full result in mind.<a name=107:2></a> Now, for the moment, the world is a wilderness to the christian, to faith, and that is what the psalm contemplates; it contemplates too the gathering of God's people, it contemplates them feelingly as wandering, and then as gathered and led.<a name=107:3></a> "They found no city of habitation", we are told, until God took a hand in gathering and in leading.<a name=107:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these facts apply at the present time.<a name=107:5></a> In the history of public christianity, it came about that the people of God found themselves in circumstances such as described in these early verses; they found no city of habitation.<a name=107:6></a> The great city spoken of in the book of the Revelation called Babylon existed indeed, but that is not a city of habitation such as God has in mind.<a name=107:7></a> Indeed in the prophets it is itself described as a wilderness, as a desert, meaning that there is no refreshment in it for the people of God.<a name=107:8></a> There was no city of habitation for hundreds of years in the history of public christianity.<a name=107:9></a> But God has taken a hand in matters, dear brethren, and the principle of gathering has ensued and the principle of leadership, and these facts have culminated in what many of the people of God are enjoying at this very time, "a city of habitation".<a name=107:10></a> It is said, "They found no city of habitation", but God "led them forth by a right way, that they might go to a city of habitation".<a name=107:11></a> Most of us here, thank God, have been thus led.<a name=107:12></a> Some may not have been; if not, it is your opportunity to fall under divine leadership, and that will mean that you will go to a city of habitation.<a name=107:13></a> "That they might go to a city of habitation;" most of us understand!<a name=107:14></a> God has intervened wonderfully during a century now, and, in referring to a century, one is thankful to be able to testify to the continuance of the movement, and, we might say, a certain enlivenment in it, so that the idea of a city of habitation is

	<div class="paragraph">
		becoming more and more prominent in the minds of the brethren.<a name=108:1></a> The enemy attacked very soon and beclouded the position; the early movement became beclouded almost immediately; an evil root was sown.<a name=108:2></a> As of old, as the Lord sowed the good seed, the enemy sowed tares, so an evil root was sown, and soon bore fruit.<a name=108:3></a> But the position through it became clarified, and the idea of a city of habitation has been kept in view, thank God, ever since, and I believe will be kept in view until the end.<a name=108:4></a> The heavenly city having come into view, not only in the Scriptures, but in a spiritual way, the saints will be kept moving on until they reach that blessed city, truly "a city of habitation".<a name=108:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show before passing on to Zechariah (for I wish particularly to speak of Zechariah) that, alongside of the divine movement and leadership, God, as the end of the psalm shows, creates an environment out of which the idea of a city of habitation springs.<a name=108:6></a> That is to say, in verse 35 we read, "He maketh the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into water-springs;" <i>that is what God does</i>.<a name=108:7></a> This passage corresponds with Exodus, and I bring it forward now, as just stressing what God does, what God will do, what God is indeed doing out of consideration for His people who instinctively seek a city of habitation; He creates an environment.<a name=108:8></a> In Exodus as the people came into the wilderness they found springs; for us these refer to the activities of the Spirit for the environment of a city of habitation is spiritual activities.<a name=108:9></a> The geographical environment may be simple but not so the spiritual side; the geographical is nothing more than a wilderness, however fine the houses, however attractive the gardens.<a name=108:10></a> Suburban dwellings have these thoughts in mind, but they never cease to be a wilderness; if they do in our estimation, they become deadening to us.<a name=108:11></a> If we hold them as a wilderness it is safe to be in them,

		What is in mind is to speak about prophecy, and, in order to show its applicability to the present time, I would cite a passage from Revelation which says that "the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:10">Revelation  19:10</a>), the <i>spirit</i> of it.<a name=135:1></a> So that, whilst there may be no ground for assuming that there are prophets today, we may assume that there is the spirit of prophecy, and that suffices.<a name=135:2></a> It certainly existed as spoken of in the book of Revelation, a book intended for the saints in our dispensation peculiarly and having special application at the present time.<a name=135:3></a> Another thought that comes out in Revelation, which helps as to the spirit of prophecy is in the word to John in chapter 10.<a name=135:4></a> It will be remembered that in that chapter our Lord Jesus is seen under the figure of a strong angel come down, putting his right foot on the sea and his left on the land, with a little opened book in His hand.<a name=135:5></a> That little opened book contained what would be an occasion or cause for bitter feelings on the part of all those who love God and love His people, for it implied much suffering for them.<a name=135:6></a> The history of Western Europe, as it is about to be fulfilled, dear brethren, will involve much suffering for God's people at the time, the history indeed of the world, speaking generally, and the prophet is directed to take the little book out of the hand of the angel, that is, out of the hand of Christ as the rightful Proprietor of the earth, who is about to deal with all that is contrary to Him, and the prophet was to take it and eat it, which he did.<a name=135:7></a> It was sweet, he tells us, in his mouth, but in his belly

		Well now, I want to show that this service of prophecy has marked God in all His dispensations; hence I read in Jude because he refers to Enoch representing this service in the antediluvian world; God had it then.<a name=138:5></a> I have no doubt it was there in others besides Enoch, but it was there, and points to what I have been saying, that <i>God would assert Himself</i>.<a name=138:6></a> Indeed the principle is seen in His first movement as sin came in, the enemy attacked and God would be at no disadvantage from the moral point of view, so that His voice is heard walking in the garden, not His <i>steps</i>, but His <i>voice</i>.<a name=138:7></a> Then we find that Adam, as clothed by God (wonderful grace that he was clothed by God!<a name=138:8></a>) calls, we are told, his wife's name Eve, meaning that she was the mother of all living, meaning life.<a name=138:9></a> That has a prophetic significance, that, instead of death, there should be life; a very great fact.<a name=138:10></a> Adam knew that; he had been accustomed to give names now, he had indeed given Eve a name before, but not this one; nor is she brought to him here to give her a name as she was before; it is his own matter, evidently the outcome of light in his soul, this name that he gives his wife, Eve.<a name=138:11></a> And no doubt Seth was on this line of prophesying in calling his son's name Enosh.<a name=138:12></a> It was the announcement of a man who knew, who was with God manifestly, and would let it be known that he was with God, and that his son was not going to be brought

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=155:6></a> I think it is important to call attention to the distinction, for revealing is not teaching.<a name=155:7></a> Teaching in the case of God, or of Christ is, of course, based on what They are as divine Persons, but teaching by any of us is based on gift.<a name=155:8></a> Revelation is entirely confined to divine Persons, They only can reveal, but many can teach.<a name=155:9></a> Teaching is a power, it is gift, but it may be by divine Persons; it is the same principle, I think, that a thing that is intended to be in your mind is forced into it by power.<a name=155:10></a> Revelation is revelation: I may not understand it; Peter did not understand the full bearing of the revelation, I am sure, though he confessed that the Person before him was the Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=155:11></a> But teaching is that the thing comes into my mind logically, as it were; that is, I understand the logical bearing of the thing, there is a reason for it.<a name=155:12></a> So in approaching the thought of the assembly in this gospel it is said that the Lord left the Pharisees and Sadducees and went away; then He says, "How is it that ye do not understand?<a name=155:13></a>" It is a question of the understanding.<a name=155:14></a> They thought He was speaking to them about bread; they were unable to seize the thought.<a name=155:15></a> You might say the whole environment was filled with the thought that He was the bread, and they were thinking of ordinary bread.<a name=155:16></a> "How is it that ye do not understand?<a name=155:17></a>" He says -- and that is a voice to us -- that you are to be no longer babes in the sense of being unable to use your minds.<a name=155:18></a> So I

		I was thinking, dear brethren, of love and how it may shine in discipleship, that is, in those who are learning or have learnt.<a name=163:1></a> Pupils are not always lovable: many, too, have ability for acquiring knowledge, but are by no means more lovable because of that ability, indeed, in the learning they are apt to be irritable and impatient.<a name=163:2></a> So I have selected these verses in John because they show love working out in discipleship.<a name=163:3></a> Of course one is not always learning; it is a poor thing if it has to be that and only that; indeed, in such a case it is very likely that we develop into learners who never arrive at a knowledge of the truth.<a name=163:4></a> It is in application that we become intelligent as to the truth in its parts.<a name=163:5></a> And so John is singled out here in this chapter as one who could answer a question, or who could cause, by his nearness to the Lord, the question to be answered.<a name=163:6></a> There is indeed such a thing as "knowing of whom thou hast learned them" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:14">2 Timothy  3:14</a>), a very important matter.<a name=163:7></a> It is well, especially for young people, to trace back anything presented to be learned and see the source.<a name=163:8></a> But still, if the question is answered, if the light is sought, our desires under the circumstances are satisfied.<a name=163:9></a> But the desire for the light here was satisfied by a certain person who was in the bosom of Jesus, and we are carefully told that he was there at that particular time.<a name=163:10></a> He was reclining, as I suppose, at table, which was a great privilege in view of all that comes out in the chapter, but he was in the bosom of Jesus; and then we are told that Jesus loved him.<a name=163:11></a> So we see the result of this enquiry on the part of Peter, who, if he was not near enough to the Lord to direct the question to Him himself, knew who was -- another

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the incident is a jewel in its proper setting, beloved; that is, the jewel is set in relation to other jewels.<a name=164:8></a> John is the great love gospel; we say it is the fourth gospel, but it is properly the love gospel.<a name=164:9></a> The great things in it could hardly be said without such conditions as are indicated.<a name=164:10></a> The more the love, the greater the thoughts, the greater the communications.<a name=164:11></a> In this gospel we have, of course, to do with Deity; let no one be afraid to have to do with the Deity.<a name=164:12></a> I mean to say the way is open to have to do with It, with God.<a name=164:13></a> And, as entering on the ground in this gospel, you feel at once that you have to do with God, and, as you proceed, what strikes you throughout is love.<a name=164:14></a> It could conveniently be said that the explanation of these great facts in these last days is that there is one thing that does not fail in the history of the assembly -- I am not referring to persons, but <i>things</i> -- and that is love.<a name=164:15></a> I believe that is one of the features that is brought forward in our times, that there is that, a thing which does not fail.<a name=164:16></a> Indeed, one is greatly impressed with the thought of the advantage there is in the perusal of

		this gospel from the standpoint of love, and the query in oneself is, Can I fit into that picture?<a name=165:1></a> Have I any place at all in it, or have I to be ruled out?<a name=165:2></a> I may do a little in Matthew.<a name=165:3></a> Matthew will let me go to the care meeting, as we say, and make it imperative on me to go.<a name=165:4></a> Mark will say to me, If there is anything to be done, do it.<a name=165:5></a> Mark will not listen to me if I say, 'I must wait for a certain condition of soul'.<a name=165:6></a> No, if a thing is to be done, do it and do it at once.<a name=165:7></a> A lazy christian is intolerable to Mark.<a name=165:8></a> "Cursed be he", says another, "that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#48:10">Jeremiah  48:10</a>) -- that is a very strong word.<a name=165:9></a> You say, 'He is doing a little;' but he is not doing it well, he is doing it negligently, and God resents it.<a name=165:10></a> Luke would say, Well, you must be ornamental; ornament is a great point with God.<a name=165:11></a> Jerusalem of old was said to be the ornament of the earth, and it will be that.<a name=165:12></a> And I think Luke is the evangelist who would help us out in that way that, if one has to do with anything of God, he does not detract from it by his clumsiness or his way of doing it, he enhances it.<a name=165:13></a> But I think John sets out the wonderful ground we are on, the wonderful position it is.<a name=165:14></a> Can I stand in that position?<a name=165:15></a> One great person after another is caused to pass before us, indeed the great testimony is from God -- "Love is of God, and every one that loves has been begotten of God, and knows God" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:7">1 John  4:7</a>).<a name=165:16></a> It is a question of origin; the word 'children' in that sense is a matter of whence you have come parentally.<a name=165:17></a> He that loves is born of God and knows God, we are told in the epistle, and so, "God so loved;" that is what John brings out.<a name=165:18></a>

		the Son".<a name=166:1></a> That is a great objective thought, beloved, for the mind, for the intelligent mind, the renewed mind, of the christian: "The Father loves the Son".<a name=166:2></a> And the Lord says of Himself that He loves the Father.<a name=166:3></a> What a picture for us, dear brethren, in this gospel -- "The Father loves the Son".<a name=166:4></a> 'Well', you say, 'He will have Him eternally to love', but He is not speaking of that, He is speaking of how things are to be done down here when He says that.<a name=166:5></a> So that if you are going to do what Matthew says or, indeed, if you are going to do anything, you must remember that is the principle, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand".<a name=166:6></a> And then you find things coming in as bringing out the love of Christ.<a name=166:7></a> I am just touching on certain points, so as to bring out what God has in mind for us, something that will never give way, that is the idea of divine love in its working out amongst us.<a name=166:8></a> Jesus loved Mary and Martha and Lazarus; He loved the three, but He loved them severally as well.<a name=166:9></a> I believe the lesson, dear brethren, is as to what we find in a brother's house; it is a question of a household.<a name=166:10></a> God is bringing out the idea of a household; He would furnish every feature of love so as to fortify us in these last days; that is, in entering a brother's house, a sister's house, or the house of two sisters and a brother, <i>you find love</i>.<a name=166:11></a> That is the sort of thing that John brings to our attention; what is done for love, what is done because of love under all circumstances.<a name=166:12></a> Be the world what it may, be the wind what it may, it is a question of what love will do.<a name=166:13></a> So this wonderful chapter which I have read brings out that the Lord Jesus loved His own, "Having loved his own".<a name=166:14></a> To add anything to that, 'His own disciples', or 'His own brethren' will not really add to it -- He "loved his own who were in the world;" that is, He loved them there, where they were, and because (in a sense) of where they were.<a name=166:15></a> Let no one

		I wish to speak about divine sowing, which is the subject of this section in Matthew.<a name=210:1></a> Satanic sowing is also spoken of in this section, which I only mention now, perhaps coming to it a little later, but the thought in my mind is divine sowing.<a name=210:2></a> God had it in mind from the outset.<a name=210:3></a> The more we look into the first chapter of the Bible, the more we shall be impressed with what God had in mind as opened out later.<a name=210:4></a> What we get there is the earth as come out of the general chaotic engulfed state of things, out of the waters, and it is called "the dry land".<a name=210:5></a> "Let the dry land appear" was the divine word.<a name=210:6></a> And then, as it appears, we have the great general features of fertility or fruitfulness, so that the earth was to cause the grass to spring forth; that is, there was in it latently the power of life, set there by God.<a name=210:7></a> No doubt the submerged conditions may be regarded as tending to this power of fertility, which God intended in His wise ways to use, and "the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in them" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:12">Genesis  1:12</a>).<a name=210:8></a> We have thus, dear brethren, the idea of soil for sowing, which is never lost sight of throughout the Scriptures, having in mind men, women and children divinely prepared for the reception of the work of God.<a name=210:9></a> The idea may also cover a certain barrenness from mere profession, but the general thought is that God should sow in soil which would bring forth a crop.<a name=210:10></a> Later the idea was marred in the sin of Adam and Eve which caused the curse, and briars and thorns came up.<a name=210:11></a> Fertility was in it indeed, but the land yielded but a little, not in its full strength, showing how sin affects the soil in men and women.<a name=210:12></a>

		Then we find that in the histories of the heavens and the earth, before sin came in, there is an allusion to the "herb of the field before it grew" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:5">Genesis  2:5</a>), God taking account of us potentially, as He can, as knowing the end from the beginning.<a name=211:1></a> He reckons according to the end, for everything must conform to His mind and there can be no discrepancy between the divine requirement and the divine results -- they fit exactly.<a name=211:2></a> In the histories of the heavens and the earth we have the herb and the shrub all taken account of before they grew; and then, as I said, they come under the curse.<a name=211:3></a> How terrible the curse, and how terrible the possibility of our bringing the curse upon ourselves.<a name=211:4></a> It is not characteristically the time of curse, thank God, but the idea is not excluded, the idea applies, and the solemn warning is that the action of sin or will in us renders us sterile and unfruitful.<a name=211:5></a> Peter deals with this, as other writers do.<a name=211:6></a> But the flood, the deluge, was a wonderful matter, much more wonderful than we are prone to think it, not simply in the outpouring of the waters and the springing up of the waters, but in the divine design that entered into it, in the presentation of Christ and His death in it.<a name=211:7></a> So that we return in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8">Genesis  8</a>to seed-time and harvest; there is no suggestion of sterility at all.<a name=211:8></a> You can understand it, beloved brethren, because it is a question of God's way of looking at things abstractly, ignoring that which is not in accord with that with which He is dealing.<a name=211:9></a> He has a right so to regard things and He does, so that it says He "smelled the sweet odour", a savour of rest, and it says "Jehovah said in his heart .<a name=211:10></a>.<a name=211:11></a>.<a name=211:12></a>" One of the most interesting things is that God says things in His heart.<a name=211:13></a> The words of God are not very often mentioned in Scripture -- they are mentioned -- but what He says in His heart is certainly most interesting; His whole Being, so to say, is in it.<a name=211:14></a> He "said in his heart .<a name=211:15></a>.<a name=211:16></a>.<a name=211:17></a> Henceforth, all the days of the

		We get later the idea of a field, not simply as used in chapter 11, a general plain or level place, but a field as a special part of the earth.<a name=212:6></a> God deals with specialities as well as generalities, and so does Satan.<a name=212:7></a> So when Jehovah directed Abraham to look to the east and to the west and to the north and to the south, the whole breadth of the land, and said it should all be his, that is a great generality.<a name=212:8></a>

		The gospel presents great generalities, that is to say, great truths that are applicable to all, but it also presents specialities.<a name=212:9></a> And so you find with Abraham the purchase of a field.<a name=212:10></a> A field that I believe will yield a greater crop of fruit than any field.<a name=212:11></a> That is the field that Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite with current money of the merchant.<a name=212:12></a> It was a definite transaction on both sides.<a name=212:13></a> It had reference, beloved brethren, to the burying place of the lovers of Christ, of the dead in Christ.<a name=212:14></a> You will observe in reading the well-known chapter which treats of the subject of the first burial recorded in Scripture, that much more is made of the field and the cave than is made even of the dead saint, that is, Sarah.<a name=212:15></a> Not that she is not spoken of as she should be, for Scripture is not only verbally accurate but spiritually accurate, and so we find the years of the life of that dear saint

		such as Matthew outlines for us, and hence it is said that He spoke a parable saying, "The sower went out to sow".<a name=218:1></a> It is, I apprehend, the sower, not simply any sower, but the real one, for the sower here is Christ, although it does not say so.<a name=218:2></a> He went forth to sow; the idea is He is the Sower -- it is the characterising word of this passage that He is the Sower, and He has gone forth to sow, and He outlines the soil.<a name=218:3></a> There are four different kinds of soil, as we have often noticed.<a name=218:4></a> I only read of the fourth kind so as to show you what is current, that <i>the Lord is having results</i>, and no one can afford to be out of those results.<a name=218:5></a> The results are a hundredfold, sixty, and thirty.<a name=218:6></a> I apprehend the meaning is that, whilst there is a certain decline, the sowing is generally satisfactory.<a name=218:7></a> But no man of faith will be content with what is generally satisfactory, he wants the full amount; the Lord does, He looks for it, and hence you will find in the exhortation in the epistles, it is <i>more and more</i>.<a name=218:8></a> So that whilst we are not discouraged in what is generally satisfactory, we do not settle down in -- <i>more and more</i> is the word -- that you may "exceed and abound" more and more -- that is the idea.<a name=218:9></a> Well now, the result, as I said, is generally satisfactory, and the Lord's explanation of it is given, because the disciples asked Him not about the soils mentioned or even the seed mentioned, but about the manner of His ministry -- why was He ministering in this way?<a name=218:10></a> I have not a doubt that the manner of the ministry in these last days in unique, not that it is contrary to what was at the beginning, but it is unique, it belongs to this time.<a name=218:11></a> There the enquiry referred to the kind of ministry: Why was He speaking like that?<a name=218:12></a> Why was it parabolic?<a name=218:13></a> And the Lord explains and He points out that God is acting sovereignly, that He is discriminating in the ministry between persons who are, as we say, mere public professors and persons who have eyes to see; that is

		I have in mind to speak of one word that is found in each of these passages I have read from the ordinary translation.<a name=281:1></a> In the first passage it is translated "Prince" and also in the second passage, but in the third passage it is translated "Author;" and in the fourth "Captain".<a name=281:2></a> These English words, Prince, Author and Captain, represent one Greek word of which I want to speak.<a name=281:3></a> The Lord Jesus is designated by these words in these four settings.<a name=281:4></a> There may be a certain shade of difference in each as to meaning, but the primary and general significance of the word in the original is one who inaugurates, or originates, or begins something, as of himself, and sets it out, so that the idea is exemplified.<a name=281:5></a> Then the idea presented in each is to be passed on and is to be absorbed in the intelligences of the saints.<a name=281:6></a> The four features in the four passages read, as I hope we shall see by the Lord's help, are to give us a general idea of the great confession called our confession, the great confession or profession in which we have part.<a name=281:7></a> First of all, dear brethren, we have the idea of life.<a name=281:8></a> Without this and its corresponding effect in result, all our profession must be ineffective, and so we have the great thought set out in Christ that He is the Originator or Author of life, and that He has exemplified it, for christianity is not a matter of doctrine merely; it is a matter of substance.<a name=281:9></a> Hence we find that the Lord is alluded to by the apostle John as "That which was from the beginning;" he has in mind the life, what was seen, heard, handled, looked upon, and contemplated.<a name=281:10></a> Now this is the first great feature that I would dwell upon, and what is to be remarked at the outset as to life is that we have it in its vegetable form in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, and also in its animal form.<a name=281:11></a> It is seen in the vegetable

		Now that is what I had especially to bring before you as to this matter of the Author of life, and what stands related to it in Peter's mind, that is, the man standing beside him, this man who lay at the gate of the temple and who had been lame.<a name=284:1></a> Peter saw that this man attracted attention, as Lazarus had attracted attention, for many believed on Jesus because of Lazarus -- the idea being the representation of life.<a name=284:2></a> They saw this man, it says; Peter saw that, he saw that the man drew attention.<a name=284:3></a> He himself, of course, drew attention, and John drew attention also, but not much.<a name=284:4></a> Even as regards the man, Peter had to direct his attention to them; he said, "Look on us;" but the lame man who had been made whole did not need to ask anybody to look on him.<a name=284:5></a> They looked on him, knowing what he had been, and now they see what he is.<a name=284:6></a> And Peter, knowing this, speaks about Jesus as the Author of life.<a name=284:7></a> He says, "By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong whom ye behold and know;" and then he adds to that, "the faith which is by him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all".<a name=284:8></a> It is not in heaven, it is "before you" (chapter 4: 10), before men.<a name=284:9></a> Now you see what is in mind.<a name=284:10></a> Peter immediately brings in what I have been speaking of -- the idea of strength.<a name=284:11></a> Well, that is one thing.<a name=284:12></a> We have been speaking of young people; I believe the ministry is largely for them.<a name=284:13></a> Why is it for them?<a name=284:14></a> Is the ministry arising from those who minister?<a name=284:15></a> It arises from Christ; He is the Author of all these things; He is the Author of every bit of spiritual ministry.<a name=284:16></a> He is the Author of everything that is of God, and He is the Author of the present ministry that is of the Spirit.<a name=284:17></a> It is no question now of praising it, but if there be anything that is spiritual, He is the Author of it; and what has He in mind?<a name=284:18></a> He wants to get the young ones.<a name=284:19></a> The old ones are necessarily passing away, and others come; it is the coming

		Now I pass on to chapter 5, where you get the same word but it is in the sense of making things effective.<a name=286:9></a> We have been speaking today of the onus the Lord took on and how in Luke He says "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=286:10></a> And <i>ye</i> are witnesses".<a name=286:11></a> Now Luke, in this second narrative of his, in quoting Peter again and the other apostles, says that the Lord is a Leader, not now of life, but to give effect to things.<a name=286:12></a> He is by the right hand of God exalted, and He is that to give effect to things.<a name=286:13></a> He uses one and another, but He is the Author of this great service of making things effective amongst us, for after all, what is light unless it becomes effective?<a name=286:14></a> He is the "leader and saviour, to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins".<a name=286:15></a> How much these things are needed that we might correspond with the Lord in this great initiative way of making things effective, for it is not only what is said on the platform, but making the thing effective.<a name=286:16></a> So Peter says, "<i>We</i> are

		on earth all this comes into prominence, what is for God, and in leading many sons to glory, that is the thought.<a name=293:1></a> Not simply taking them up in power, but <i>leading</i> them means that the sons are intelligent; the idea involves intelligence, for it is said that "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>).<a name=293:2></a> They understand leadership, and not merely in an objective leader, but in the promptings of the Spirit within them.<a name=293:3></a> It is a very great matter, to be so clear in your soul of uncertainty, uncertain promptings, that you discern the Spirit, that you discern the gracious impelling movements of leadership in the Spirit.<a name=293:4></a> "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God".<a name=293:5></a> They are marked off, you see them moving; the locusts have no king but they move, they move together, they go forth, we are told, in bands (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:27">Proverbs  30:27</a>), a very great thought, a great spectacle for heaven to see persons who are linked up in this way in intelligence as possessed of the Spirit of God moving together.<a name=293:6></a> Well, this thought is extended in the passage I read, "In bringing many sons to glory", He makes "perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings".<a name=293:7></a> Now I want to finish with this thought of being perfect, that the Leader of our salvation, dear brethren, is perfect.<a name=293:8></a> You say, 'What salvation is it?<a name=293:9></a>' Oh, this is a glorious salvation; this is <i>salvation</i>.<a name=293:10></a> When in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>the apostle is speaking about saints being raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ, he says, "By grace ye are saved", he is speaking about salvation <i>from place</i>, as well as from what is evil, from the world.<a name=293:11></a> The Leader of our salvation has been made perfect through sufferings.<a name=293:12></a> He is leading us into complete salvation, that is to say, the laying hold of the heavenly position and the taking a place in it, that you belong to it, that you are fixed in it, and that, as there, you apprehend Christ as

		My address this evening will be on refinement, spiritual development and refinement, and I selected John's writings because he has this in mind, he himself being spoken of by himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=296:1></a> If we are to know what is refined spiritually, we learn it from examining the features of the examples of persons who are said to be loved divinely, either by divine Persons or by persons who typically represent divine Persons.<a name=296:2></a> For where persons are said specifically to be loved by God, or by Christ, or by those who represent Them typically, these persons are lovable, either potentially or in result.<a name=296:3></a> God has an eye, dear brethren, for what is refined, His beloved Son being the infinitely perfect model of it.<a name=296:4></a> As we often say to the Father and to one another, He opened the heavens to Jesus and said to Him, "Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased".<a name=296:5></a> That was not potential, that was actual, for every breath of that blessed Person from the time He drew breath, and indeed His life before, every pulsation, was pleasing to God.<a name=296:6></a> We take in but little -- and I speak for myself -- of the humanity of our Lord Jesus, how in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>He addresses God as dependent upon Him, and throughout that psalm and others, He expresses His feelings in His own way and in His own language, as to Himself as Man.<a name=296:7></a> All these feelings, and all the movements of His heart towards God were delightful from the very outset.<a name=296:8></a> So the word as to Himself was, "Thou art my beloved Son;" as to others, "This is my beloved Son;" that was as He "began to be about thirty years of age".<a name=296:9></a> He had grown from infancy to

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find in the types examples of what pleased God, and in every case it is a question of what He anticipates in Jesus.<a name=297:5></a> In all the epochs you find some representation of what I am speaking of, and there were many others doubtless not spoken of in Scripture, but existent.<a name=297:6></a> We have, for instance, Enoch, who, "before his translation .<a name=297:7></a>.<a name=297:8></a>.<a name=297:9></a> has the testimony that he had pleased God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>).<a name=297:10></a> God was so pleased with him that He took him to Himself.<a name=297:11></a> I have no hesitation in saying that God has found pleasure in Enoch ever since, and myriads like him whose names are not recorded, but all known up there.<a name=297:12></a> Then we find, after the flood, such cases as Abraham, and others, especially in youth, such as Isaac, "Thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:2">Genesis  22:2</a>), and again Rebecca of whom it is said that Isaac loved her.<a name=297:13></a> He is a type of Christ in His affection for the assembly, the assembly viewed as answering entirely to His own mind.<a name=297:14></a> He "loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it .<a name=297:15></a>.<a name=297:16></a>.<a name=297:17></a> that <i>he</i> might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a>, 27).<a name=297:18></a> He is labouring with every one of us.<a name=297:19></a> This meeting here even now is to that end, to present us to Himself all glorious.<a name=297:20></a> It would be, as I might say, dear

		Then we find with Jacob that his mother loved him.<a name=298:3></a> Her love was in keeping with God -- a very great matter for mothers if their affections for their children are in keeping with what these children are for God, whether actually or potentially.<a name=298:4></a> She loved Jacob, and hundreds of years afterwards we are told that God loved him too.<a name=298:5></a> She knew prophetically what was in the mind of God about him and she loved him; she was spiritual.<a name=298:6></a> Then Joseph is an outstanding example of what I am saying; as a boy of seventeen his father loved him.<a name=298:7></a> Was he not lovable?<a name=298:8></a> Oh, he was lovable!<a name=298:9></a> The world cast its eye on him typically but he was proof against it, a most striking example for young men and young women.<a name=298:10></a> He suffered for his faithfulness but he was proof against the temptation of the world.<a name=298:11></a> Then we have David, who is an outstanding case.<a name=298:12></a> The first mention of him by name is not that his name was David, but that <i>he was David</i>.<a name=298:13></a> You say, 'What do you mean?<a name=298:14></a>' Well, I mean, beloved brethren, that that young man as described by the Spirit of God as he stood before Samuel to be anointed, was David, because David means Beloved.<a name=298:15></a> He was a delightful young man; he represents what I am speaking of; he represents typically, and in a sense, actually, what was delightful to God.<a name=298:16></a> There are many other examples, but they all point to the one thing, and that is what the divine ideal is and what the divine workings are to reach it, and how God would impress on each of us that He has this ideal and will keep to it.<a name=298:17></a> He is not going to be diverted from it.<a name=298:18></a> He has found it in Jesus, and He says, "In whom is my delight".<a name=298:19></a> He does not say 'All my delight' -- not that I would detract for a

		Well now, these examples of which I have read are outstanding, and I proceed to speak of them in order, first as to what is acceptable or refined in worship, beginning at the top, as it were.<a name=299:4></a> It is often well to do this, to begin with the divine thought at its height, and what we find is that it appears, as is usual with John, informally.<a name=299:5></a> The less formal we are, dear brethren, the better; not that there should be any irregularity or disorder or unseemliness in anything that christians do, for love never fails, love never behaves itself in an unseemly manner; but it always avoids officialism if it can.<a name=299:6></a> Officialism is stilted and awkward if by itself and tends to militate against family affection.<a name=299:7></a> So you find Mary of Bethany is a development of a family, all of whom were loved by Jesus.<a name=299:8></a> We are told in the chapter preceding this that the Lord loved the three of them, Mary and Martha and Lazarus; they were loved as a family.<a name=299:9></a> There are no parents mentioned; it may be a suggestion of what comes about even before headship is known.<a name=299:10></a> In truth, the absence of the parents was to make room for headship in its truest sense, that is, to make way for Christ.<a name=299:11></a> And so it is in all families that the more spiritual the head or heads, that is to say the parents, are, the more ready they will be to disappear and make room for Christ.<a name=299:12></a> Some have cards hanging in their houses to the effect that Jesus is the silent visitor in this house; but He is never silent if He is in the house and there is anything wrong.<a name=299:13></a>

		Well now, Martha complained about the Lord, as we know; that was not making room for headship.<a name=301:2></a> Had she known who He was, as she did later, she would have made room for headship, she would have said, 'Oh, what an opportunity for us!<a name=301:3></a>' Think of who He is!<a name=301:4></a> It says of another person of whom Luke speaks that he "sought to see Jesus who he was", and he received Him into his house gladly and gave Him His place in his house, and the Lord said to Zacchaeus, "To-day salvation is come to this house".<a name=301:5></a> He did not say that to Martha; not that He was not salvation, if she would have let Him save her from her naughtiness, from her critical spirit, from her unfairness -- for she criticises the Lord too.<a name=301:6></a> You may say, 'I would never do that;' but the Spirit of God would not record anything discreditable in the saints were it not intended to teach us.<a name=301:7></a> Let no one say he would not do that.<a name=301:8></a> "Dost thou not care .<a name=301:9></a>.<a name=301:10></a>.<a name=301:11></a> ?<a name=301:12></a>" she said.<a name=301:13></a> It is in those circumstances that Mary first appears and she was embracing her opportunity; she was sitting at the feet of Jesus listening to what He was saying; she was up to the mark as to what governed the moment.<a name=301:14></a> A little while before it had been said upon the mount, "Hear him;" it was said to Peter and James and John on the mount.<a name=301:15></a> Now Mary is hearing the Lord Jesus, and it is from this point, dear brethren, we get this wonderful development of which I have spoken.<a name=301:16></a> Luke does not give it to us; it is left to John to bring out informally the great results of the works of God; he makes more of them, I think, than any other of the evangelical writers do.<a name=301:17></a> And so he approaches this great subject very carefully, telling us that the Lord loved the three in the house, and telling us too that it was the Mary who anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair -- that

		Well now, I proceed to the Old Testament, having in mind Paul as the characteristic old person in christianity, that is, "being such a one", as he says, "as Paul the aged".<a name=312:1></a> I suppose, whilst he was not egotistical in the remotest degree, the Spirit had in mind that he was most distinguished, if not entirely unique, "being such a one as Paul the aged".<a name=312:2></a> That is to say, one who had gone through so much; for the Lord had said of him earlier, He is "an elect vessel to me .<a name=312:3></a>.<a name=312:4></a>.<a name=312:5></a> <i>I</i> will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>, 16).<a name=312:6></a> What a history prospectively lay stretched out from the Lord's point of view, what this elect vessel should be, what he should suffer!<a name=312:7></a> He says, "<i>I</i> will shew to him how much he must suffer".<a name=312:8></a> It became God "in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>), and this thought would apply in the Lord's mind to this potentially great servant, that he should suffer.<a name=312:9></a> That was the great thought initially in the Lord's mind that he should suffer, a thought that is not much relished by us, but yet, beloved brethren, it must be accepted.<a name=312:10></a> If God is bringing us as sons to glory, surely we should aspire to have some part in the sufferings, for our Leader is made perfect through sufferings.<a name=312:11></a> It is not that there was any want, anything lacking, in Christ at any time; all was perfectly normal in Him at every stage of His holy life, but perfection through suffering alludes to what was needed, in the mind of God, for us, a standard for us.<a name=312:12></a> It was needed for Christ to reach where He is on that line -- it became God.<a name=312:13></a> "It became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things".<a name=312:14></a> Think of what He had in mind, dear brethren, what He intends us to be as before Him, as in relation to our great Leader; He intends us to have part in the sufferings.<a name=312:15></a> You may say, 'It becomes us', but it became God; it was necessary from His point of view

		"Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death".<a name=345:1></a> He is not going to visit that brother any more; that is a settled matter.<a name=345:2></a> He has the right principle, the matter is settled, the mind of God is clear: he is the rejected man.<a name=345:3></a> But still I am hankering after that man; there is something there, there is a link between him and me.<a name=345:4></a> I am not going to visit him, but I am mourning about him.<a name=345:5></a> The Lord says, 'I am repenting about him; you are different from Me'.<a name=345:6></a> I am not with God.<a name=345:7></a> I am with God as to the principle, but not as to my feelings, and God says, 'I want you to be right in your feelings -- I want <i>you</i>.<a name=345:8></a> I do not want a man mourning for a man I have rejected, I want you to be with Me in My feelings'.<a name=345:9></a> Well, that is how the matter stood.<a name=345:10></a> God says, I am repenting about it.<a name=345:11></a> When God says that, there is something very peculiar, it is a question of His feelings.<a name=345:12></a> He did not like to give up Saul, but He did give up Saul, and it is a finished matter; He will never have recourse to him again.<a name=345:13></a> These finished matters are very rare amongst us, dear brethren.<a name=345:14></a> Finishing things is a great idea in Scripture.<a name=345:15></a> So the next chapter opens with this, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?<a name=345:16></a>" He says, 'You know you are not with Me in this'.<a name=345:17></a> How God must have felt that, speaking to such an honoured servant of His.<a name=345:18></a> But it is a voice to the most outstanding brother there is, how we may be out of accord with God because of personal predilections in regard of brethren, some personal link that holds us together, and we are not with God in it.<a name=345:19></a> Now He says, "Go".<a name=345:20></a> He must be obedient, for he had already established the principle of obedience in chapter 15.<a name=345:21></a> Obedience is a mark of the new man, and Samuel had the principle; he had put off the old and put on the new, in that sense, but not in his feelings.<a name=345:22></a> God says, "Fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse, the

		matter'.<a name=347:1></a> This matter of kingship is too important to be left in the hands of a man who is held in his affections by the man God has rejected.<a name=347:2></a> So Samuel says, "Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him".<a name=347:3></a> Jehovah says, 'He is not before Me; you are making a mistake, and the secret is you have been held in your affections by the man I have rejected'.<a name=347:4></a> And all seven sons pass before him, and the word as to each is, "Neither has Jehovah chosen this one".<a name=347:5></a> Samuel is adjustable, thank God!<a name=347:6></a> and it is very beautiful how readily he comes in for adjustment.<a name=347:7></a> He is gradually coming into the idea of the new man, and presently the new man appears before him, the most beautiful man as the Spirit of God presents him to us; he is ruddy, of beautiful appearance, and he is beloved -- there he is.<a name=347:8></a> Samuel knows him, but still God says, I do not trust you with that -- "Arise, anoint him; for this is he".<a name=347:9></a> So, dear brethren, it is a most important thing to learn to keep the right man before us in the administration of the things of God.<a name=347:10></a> Not only that the person is nominally christian, or even a true christian, but can I see the characteristics of the new man?<a name=347:11></a> That is how the matter stands.<a name=347:12></a> And it says, "The Spirit of Jehovah came upon David;" that means, that kind of man, he is beloved.<a name=347:13></a> God says, 'I commit Myself to a man who is spiritually lovely'.<a name=347:14></a> Samuel had not been doing this, but he will do it hereafter -- and he did, he stood by David.<a name=347:15></a>

		I go on to Chronicles to show you how all Israel is brought into this, for one great thought in christianity is not only that there are leaders, prominent men and women, but that all are to be brought into the thing.<a name=347:16></a> "Leaders led in Israel", and, if that is so, Israel will fall into the lead, and they become right, they see with God.<a name=347:17></a> So what you get in this chapter is how David became very attractive.<a name=347:18></a> In the first part of the chapter we see how people came to him in certain positions, first at Ziklag, then in the

		Then we have the position of the tribes that came to David, and that is what I want to finish with, so that I might bring you all afresh into this great matter of the new man, so that there is no doubt in your mind as to what is meant, that you are thoroughly on that side.<a name=348:9></a> So in the second part of the chapter you have characteristics; each of the tribes has his own distinctive feature, and I would particularly allude to the Aaronites, the tribe of Levi.<a name=348:10></a> In all this part of the chapter, you will observe there are no names given to us but those of these two men, Jehoiada and Zadok.<a name=348:11></a> Zadok is said to be a young man; he is one of the most distinguished men in Scripture, so much so that God carries him right through into the millennium and he is to be the priest there.<a name=348:12></a> He represents the divine thought in youthfulness and valour in his day, and God carries him right through -- the priesthood in that day is to be the sons of Zadok.<a name=348:13></a> I think it is a very great thing to get a long-distance outlook in divine things and to see how God carries things right through; that what I am going on with

		Then we get other tribes, such as the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times; that is a trait of the new man.<a name=350:3></a> I do not apprehend that that is mere political times, or international times, or business times, but divine times.<a name=350:4></a> I attach no importance to anything but divine divisions of time.<a name=350:5></a> When Daniel gets the word from Gabriel it is a question of divine times: "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people;" that is a divine time that passes over myriads of years of human time.<a name=350:6></a> It is not a question of what is current in the newspapers, beloved friends.<a name=350:7></a> Statesmen may scan the newspapers to know what they ought to do, but Issachar "had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do", that is, what the saints ought to do -- and that is the whole matter with God.<a name=350:8></a> The times of the nations, as they are called, are just appointed of God in relation to the saints.<a name=350:9></a> When the matter of the saints is finished, the times of the gentiles finish too; it is all a matter of the saints.<a name=350:10></a> What happens to the people, that is, Daniel's people, to make an end of sin and to bring in righteousness and holiness, and Issachar would understand, and God would have us, beloved brethren, to understand the times in that sense and know what Israel ought to do.<a name=350:11></a> As I said, the different tribes have different traits.<a name=350:12></a> Then we are told, in verse 38, "All of them men of war, keeping rank in battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king".<a name=350:13></a> This is an appeal to everyone, and that is what I had in mind, a perfect heart, at Hebron; it is not simply David, but David at Hebron.<a name=350:14></a> We often speak

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are to see that the assembly exists in the moral sense right to the end and that, though the actual members of it may not be available always, are not indeed, in our times -- the idea of the assembly remains and the members of it are included in the word 'congregation'.<a name=353:12></a> All are taken account of in this early mention; and so they are in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, "all together in one place", all there.<a name=353:13></a> That is the great general thought that the idea of the assembly and of the congregation synchronised at the beginning and doubtless continued for a considerable time.<a name=353:14></a> The members would gradually disappear; did, as a fact; they were not all available, but the assembly as a moral thought functioning without all the members continued, and does continue, only that the general failure obscures it: so that the verses in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>help us to identify members in character, that is "two of you", persons with a known status or character, and then "two or three".<a name=353:15></a> And then <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>shows how these prove themselves as the general failure existed, "The firm foundation of God stands, having this seal".<a name=353:16></a> The foundation has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is in mind in reading these scriptures is to show how the Lord continues until the end of the dispensation in which we are, such service as may be required.<a name=376:1></a> Outward appearances might seem to indicate that He has failed in this or relinquished His charge, as I might say, but the passages I have read show that the Lord continues throughout.<a name=376:2></a> Of Samuel it is said, as I read, that he judged Israel all the days of his life, and yet for a considerable part of his life Saul reigned.<a name=376:3></a> Now what I have to say requires that I should touch on the Lord's judicial service as well as His direct service to His own whom, as it is said, He loved to the end.<a name=376:4></a> We have to consider that the Lord has His own and that they continue to the end, that His love remains for them peculiarly until the end: He "loved them to the end".<a name=376:5></a> But their history, that is the public history of the assembly, shows that at times they were found sorrowfully mixed with what was not His own, and so it is today.<a name=376:6></a> So that, in view of such mixture, the Lord has had to resort to judicial service; not indeed that it is not the service of love, because it is, it has His own in mind -- what He would be to all indeed.<a name=376:7></a> The blessing of Esau, as over against the blessing of Jacob, shows that Esau came in for favour as typical of those who may not be in themselves regarded as the Lord's own.<a name=376:8></a> So the Lord has to take on, as I have said, a judicial service, and this is quite compatible with love.<a name=376:9></a> Indeed we read of a rod of iron used, not only by the Lord Himself, but by the overcomer in Thyatira, and yet it is not to destroy the nations.<a name=376:10></a> A rod of iron might seem to be for destruction, but it is not so; it is a question of severity because of the state of things.<a name=376:11></a>

		So that the overcomer is to shepherd the nations with that rod.<a name=377:1></a> The nations are not to be annihilated as in the days of Joshua.<a name=377:2></a> Some of them will be, of course, but in the abstract they are not to be annihilated.<a name=377:3></a> The type is rather David who subdued the nations with great severity at times, but still he subdued them with that method.<a name=377:4></a> So the Lord Himself in the future, shepherds the nations with a rod of iron.<a name=377:5></a> They will need strong firm handling, but still they are the nations to be blessed; the blessing of the nations was announced to Abraham, and the blessing will come about.<a name=377:6></a> It has arrived at us now, we come into it by the gift of the Spirit, but the nations themselves will be blessed as nations.<a name=377:7></a> "The nations shall walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory to it" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:24">Revelation  21:24</a>).<a name=377:8></a> They will contribute to the heavenly city.<a name=377:9></a> But I am speaking now of severity as being quite compatible with love; indeed more than that, it <i>is</i> love, because of what has to be done, because of the state of things.<a name=377:10></a> And so in the last of these addresses to which we so often and rightly refer, the address to the Laodiceans, we have this same principle of severity in service.<a name=377:11></a> The Lord is presented to the bondman John in judicial garb, not in the sense of being attractive personally.<a name=377:12></a> When He was inaugurating this wonderful period, He presented Himself, we are told, living -- that is the beautiful side, "white and ruddy", He presented Himself as attractive to His own, living after He suffered, the suffering One but now alive.<a name=377:13></a> Here He does speak to John as living; He lays His right hand on him to infuse, as it were, the spirit of life into him for the service that was now opening up to him.<a name=377:14></a> John needed that; but the general appearance of the Lord is that of a judge, a judicial person clothed with a garment down to the feet and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle; His hair like

		wool and His feet as fine brass, and so forth, and His voice like the voice of many waters.<a name=378:1></a> It is impressive, and yet He is about to serve.<a name=378:2></a> There is a girdle, a usual sign of service, but service by One whose love is driven back; He is not able to love freely, but still the love is there.<a name=378:3></a> So the apostle says, "Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:11">2 Corinthians  6:11</a>).<a name=378:4></a> That is, there is a change, but before that he was restrained in seeking to serve them.<a name=378:5></a> And that is often so, dear brethren, at the present time, for all services such as this should take on the character of Christ's service.<a name=378:6></a> What are they if they are not Christ's service?<a name=378:7></a> The service is carried on mediately by this and that one as He pleases, otherwise of what value would it be?<a name=378:8></a> So He is presented in a judicial garb, and as the Son of <i>man</i>, not the Son of <i>God</i> -- that is a term that denotes much in the way of affection and glory.<a name=378:9></a> He does speak of Himself as the Son of God to Thyatira, because there was interference with His rights in the house, as I apprehend.<a name=378:10></a> But all judgment is given to Him because He is Son of man, and we may expect the utmost sympathy and consideration; although He has to act judicially, He will not fail to be as considerate as possible, and the chastisement or judgment will be as lenient as possible.<a name=378:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, in speaking thus, I have to refer to His comings, for His judicial service requires that He comes Himself; so He, on three occasions, speaks about coming to the assemblies.<a name=378:12></a> Singularly enough He is not said to have come to Smyrna, a church against which He has nothing to say; nor is He said to have come to Philadelphia, an assembly against which He has nothing to say but has rather to approve.<a name=378:13></a> We might have expected He would come to these rather than to those He threatens to come to, but it is, dear brethren, just because of what I have been saying, that He is dealing judicially, not in the direct

		but there were certain there that had the doctrine of Balaam and taught the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes; but He says, "Repent therefore: but if not, I come to thee quickly".<a name=380:1></a> The whole assembly has to take account of this; it was in their midst; whatever is in our midst in any gathering, whether with one or two or more, is the responsibility of all.<a name=380:2></a> But He says, "I come to thee quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of my mouth".<a name=380:3></a> It is the word of God, a sure weapon against all such opposition.<a name=380:4></a> That is seen in Pergamos.<a name=380:5></a> How the Lord has served in that way, how He dealt with the terrible evil teachings that had their root at that time and have come down to us!<a name=380:6></a> The Lord has not been quiescent in the presence of all these things, nor is He ever, so as long as the Spirit of God is down here and there are those who answer in any way to Him.<a name=380:7></a> This service is going on and will go on to the end.<a name=380:8></a>

		These Scriptures, as no doubt most will have observed, speak of persons leaping or springing, and I have put them together so as to speak of this matter, of the power of spring in the saints.<a name=432:1></a> It appears early in the christian dispensation, and it is recorded with such detail as to leave on the mind the impression that it is to be a main feature in the dispensation that there should be the power of spring, which of course, implies the Spirit of God.<a name=432:2></a> Peter and John, as we have often noticed, go up together to the temple, and the lame man is, as usual, at the gate.<a name=432:3></a> It is said that he had been lame from the outset of his being, but it is also said that he was carried to this spot.<a name=432:4></a> A similar incident is recorded later in this book, a gentile incident, far away among the nations at Lystra; the man is spoken of as not having walked at all.<a name=432:5></a> Nothing is said about any assistance rendered to him, he was just there: he never had walked.<a name=432:6></a> In the fact that no one is spoken of as assisting him, we are no doubt reminded that there was no real assistance in the gentile world at all spiritually, whereas there was some little consideration in Israel, even as it was, the Spirit of God being ever ready to acknowledge whatever there was to be acknowledged among God's ancient people.<a name=432:7></a> For it was a question at that time of saving them, and everything that would prejudice them unnecessarily against the gospel was avoided; everything, however small, that might encourage them spiritually was brought forward.<a name=432:8></a> So that the man was carried by some, whoever it was; someone cared for him to that extent, and laid him there; not indeed that they expected the temple or those in it

		to help him in a spiritual way, but that those who went in by that gate might be moved charitably.<a name=433:1></a> And then what is stated of Peter and John is another touch.<a name=433:2></a> Nothing was being said about the barrenness, the poverty, of the temple; indeed these two great servants were going up to it; there was no thought of disparaging it then, but gently they hint that there was something else -- "Look on us".<a name=433:3></a> These are levitical touches that we should note in our service so as to gain the most possible, or if by any means to save some.<a name=433:4></a> The difficulties are increasing and hence the need of levitical skill in those that would serve.<a name=433:5></a> And then Peter gives the man his right hand.<a name=433:6></a> Here we are in the presence of the beginning of a wonderful dispensation and the kind of service that marked those who had part in it, how, as in this instance, they would say, We will do our best for you.<a name=433:7></a> There were no half measures, no laziness, in those days; the right hand was there.<a name=433:8></a> In the gospels, especially in Mark, before we have the appointment of the apostles, the right hand of the man which was withered was healed, as if the Lord would say, These men that I am about to appoint are to understand that their very best is to be employed.<a name=433:9></a> And so, whilst God did everything, of course, "The Lord working with them", yet great stress is laid on how they did things, that God was not at any disadvantage in employing them for the best that they had was available.<a name=433:10></a> Their appearance in relation to one another, their countenances, their outlook, would all be involved in the direction to the needy man.<a name=433:11></a> "Look on us" -- there is something there.<a name=433:12></a> No disparagement formally of the temple, the Beautiful gate is mentioned, whatever there was is there mentioned, but there is something else.<a name=433:13></a> There is nothing in an outward way; there was no prejudice to anybody in suggesting, "Look on us;" it gives no unnecessary offence, there was something to look at.<a name=433:14></a> Perhaps no

		two men like them ever appeared together in this way before.<a name=434:1></a> We have twos, of course, and threes, operating in the service of God throughout the Scriptures -- Moses and Aaron, and many others in that way; but I am sure that no two men ever appeared like these two just in this way before.<a name=434:2></a> And Peter uses his right hand, and speaks of the Nazaraean, no eloquence, no bringing forward of the great immortal, invisible, or anything like that, it is "Jesus Christ the Nazaraean".<a name=434:3></a> The position is equal to that.<a name=434:4></a> There is no need yet of these great titles which we get later; they have their place, of course, and we love to use them, and indeed the Lord would put it on us as to whether we are using them, what we <i>are</i> saying about Him.<a name=434:5></a> But here it is, "Jesus Christ the Nazaraean", in His name this man is to rise up and walk; but notice, it is not the mere word, it is the right hand of the servant -- he is able to do something.<a name=434:6></a> So that it is "the Lord working with them" -- they are doing it, they are doing what is being done, but the Lord is there; things are well done, not only were they worth looking at, but the way they did the thing was worth looking at.<a name=434:7></a> So we have this result that he walked and leaped and praised God.<a name=434:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is the great general thought I have in mind and it is found in this particular setting as bearing on the whole dispensation to the end of which we have come.<a name=434:9></a> It is written for us, dear brethren, so that there might be something to look at in the sense of spiritual formation and attractiveness, and that there might be something in the way of ability to work the works of God.<a name=434:10></a> The Lord says of a blind man that he was blind just so that the works of God should be made manifest in him, and that is the position, it is a question of the works of God.<a name=434:11></a> But the works of God are to be done by workmen who enhance them, and that is what we get here.<a name=434:12></a> So that we have a spring in this man; it was not simply

		that he sprang up, like the man in chapter 14, but he was walking and leaping and praising God; he is seen that way.<a name=435:1></a> That is another thing to be noticed, that what is effected is manifest, he is seen in this way, he is seen by the people as a testimony, walking and leaping and praising God.<a name=435:2></a> I have no doubt that these three words, walking, leaping, and praising God, are in their proper order -- of course they are.<a name=435:3></a> Walking is balance, that we are sober, as the apostle says.<a name=435:4></a> As regards man his testimony was sober, balanced, but to God, he says, "I speak as being beside myself".<a name=435:5></a> The power that we have by the Spirit is affected by environment; the more we are in assembly where every whit says, Glory, the more effective we are as spiritual.<a name=435:6></a> It is a living scene, it is a glorious scene, and we are not to detract from the glory but to add to it.<a name=435:7></a> Leaping, I think, alludes to excess or increase of spiritual power under certain conditions, that is, where it is seemly.<a name=435:8></a> And praising God is the final thought.<a name=435:9></a> I believe the Lord is working very effectively in this way among His people so that there should be something of this kind, praising God.<a name=435:10></a> Whether or not this man used the psalter, whether or not he used hymns I cannot, of course, say, but he praised God, that is, there is further excess; praising God is a further thought of spiritual power, not in mere words but in attitude.<a name=435:11></a> The Old Testament is constantly helpful as illustrative of what we are called to.<a name=435:12></a> So you find that with the sweet psalmist of Israel, the leader of the praises of God: he danced mightily, with all his might, before the ark.<a name=435:13></a> That is a real thing, not mere sentiment, but a real movement of the person before God.<a name=435:14></a>

		Well now, that is what resulted from these remarkable incidents recorded, what was to be seen and what was to be heard, in connection with Peter's right hand.<a name=435:15></a> The name of the Nazaraean, that which was under reproach in the world, was already taking on glory in the spiritual realm.<a name=435:16></a> This is the beginning

		of matters, and it is intended to cast rays all down the ages to ourselves.<a name=436:1></a> Spiritual matters are not brought down merely by books written, but by the real presence of the Spirit of God in the assembly.<a name=436:2></a> So that we get, for instance, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>, the beautiful reference to the Spirit bringing things to remembrance; the Lord says of Him, "The Comforter .<a name=436:3></a>.<a name=436:4></a>.<a name=436:5></a> whom the Father will send in my name" -- the Father would send Him in the Son's name and He would bring to remembrance whatever the Lord had said.<a name=436:6></a> It is the Spirit that brings to our attention what we need; He brings to our remembrance.<a name=436:7></a> The thought of His having come in the name of the Lord Jesus fits in with these last days when things are peculiarly done in His name as over against other names; so that He says to Philadelphia, "Thou .<a name=436:8></a>.<a name=436:9></a>.<a name=436:10></a> hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name".<a name=436:11></a> The Spirit of God, dear brethren, is bringing things up constantly in all these meetings through one and another, bringing things to our remembrance, so that there should be what God intended there should be in the last days, what there was at the beginning, in some little way.<a name=436:12></a> Here it is walking and leaping and praising God, a real spring in it, and it is to continue.<a name=436:13></a> It is a remarkable thing that there is very little in the early chapters of the Acts about the service of God in the assembly; it awaited the full thought of the assembly for that; but here is the idea; there is the material for it.<a name=436:14></a> How lustily a brother like this would take part in the assembly meeting, spiritually formed, how he would join in with heart and voice in the praises of God.<a name=436:15></a>

		Now I want to show you briefly from Rebecca how the thought works out, for Rebecca really fits into this chapter; she is the assembly brought into this position.<a name=436:16></a> She was, of course, a failing creature, like all of us -- alas we have to own that!<a name=436:17></a> -- she was just a woman of like passions with ourselves; so that,

		whilst we honour her as a woman of faith, and she is a type of what I am speaking of, we must remember that in all the scriptural narratives it is a question of the Spirit of God selecting that which is needed for what He has in mind.<a name=437:1></a> How much is left out who can say?<a name=437:2></a> It is just His own selection of incidents and His own way of putting them together that makes them speak to us.<a name=437:3></a> And so Rebecca is just, as you might say, what we get in this chapter.<a name=437:4></a> Sarah's tent is in view in the history of Rebecca, but Isaac comes into view.<a name=437:5></a> That is, before you can have Sarah's tent or Rebecca in it, Isaac must come into view and he must be recognised.<a name=437:6></a> Here Peter calls Him the Nazaraean, that is the Christ.<a name=437:7></a> How much more He was to this man!<a name=437:8></a> We can understand how readily this man, who walked and leaped and praised God by the power of that Christ, would listen to anyone who could tell him more of that glorious Person.<a name=437:9></a> God had His man ready for that a little while after, that is Paul; but Peter and all the others could speak wonderfully of Christ.<a name=437:10></a> You can understand how this man would be ready for any additional thought about Christ.<a name=437:11></a> And so Isaac is just Christ in this particular narrative in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>.<a name=437:12></a> He is out in the field coming from the well Beer-lahai-roi.<a name=437:13></a> Why was he coming from that place?<a name=437:14></a> He was coming from having gone to it indeed, as it should read; he had gone there.<a name=437:15></a> He did not despise the well because Hagar had had to do with it.<a name=437:16></a> It was a well, it was a spring.<a name=437:17></a> Whatever there was in Israel the Lord Jesus took it up and made the most of it.<a name=437:18></a> Meditating in the field, he is alone.<a name=437:19></a> We sometimes sing.<a name=437:20></a> 'No longer now alone;' how worthy He is of companionship suited to Himself!<a name=437:21></a> Now you can see, dear brethren, how this man would answer to all this in so far as he could at that time, walking and leaping and praising God.<a name=437:22></a> Rebecca draws near on the camel and she sees Isaac; he was meditating in the field.<a name=437:23></a> She saw him and she

		asked about him.<a name=438:1></a> What a figure he was, I mean spiritually.<a name=438:2></a> How often it is the Lord comes into our view in one way and another.<a name=438:3></a> We say, What was said was very nice; but what about the enquiry as to this Man?<a name=438:4></a> It is a question of the assembly coming into view in each of us.<a name=438:5></a> What about enquiring as to this Man?<a name=438:6></a> Who is He?<a name=438:7></a> Well, she is told who He is; the servant said, "That is my master!<a name=438:8></a>" -- not, 'my master's <i>son</i>' now.<a name=438:9></a> It is Christ.<a name=438:10></a> Here is a man ready for that; you cannot say too much about that Person, Jesus of Nazareth, to this man.<a name=438:11></a> Zacchaeus wanted to see Jesus who He was.<a name=438:12></a> You can understand that thought would be presented in a living way in that lame man now able to walk and leap and praise God in the power of the name of Jesus.<a name=438:13></a> So it is said that Rebecca, having enquired, sprang off the camel.<a name=438:14></a> There is a real movement.<a name=438:15></a> That is what one would look for in Christ being presented to the saints, presented as He is in Isaac, that there is real movement, real response of heart.<a name=438:16></a> She took a veil and covered herself too in a seemly way, a beautiful feminine touch; there is seemliness.<a name=438:17></a> But then, there is the power of spring: she sprang off the camel.<a name=438:18></a> What enters into all this passage is that it is the testimony that is in mind.<a name=438:19></a> It is what is to go on and what is going on here up to this present time that is in mind in this passage.<a name=438:20></a> It is briefly stated but it is typically, dear brethren, what we are enjoying at this very moment, the testimony that goes out from a risen glorified Christ to the assembly viewed in this way with a spring in her and seemliness marking her in the position.<a name=438:21></a> No pretence, no gold or artificial beautification with her, as it is said in Peter -- I mean that is the idea in the New Testament -- it is what is spiritual, and how beautiful that is as the Spirit of God depicts what He intends to convey to us.<a name=438:22></a> He depicts such facts as He intends to create an impression in us as to what the assembly is; and, of course,

		Rebecca is but a type of ourselves.<a name=439:1></a> And so she is leadable now; one has often referred to that, but it is a very practical thing: he <i>led</i> her into his mother's tent and he was comforted.<a name=439:2></a> It does not say he was grieved about his mother's death, as it does of Abraham when Sarah died; it is the release from grief that is noted; it is to bring out what Rebecca is, the satisfaction that the Lord finds in this one, one who has the spring and who puts on the veil, and who is leadable.<a name=439:3></a> Many of us are not leadable, you know; she is.<a name=439:4></a> He led her into his mother Sarah's tent.<a name=439:5></a> It does not say he loved her until she was there; that is, it is the assembly in the place of testimony that is lovable to Jesus; it is not yet the assembly in heaven.<a name=439:6></a> He loved her there in that position.<a name=439:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, you can see that Rebecca fits into <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>, and the type in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>is brought down to us by the Spirit even to this very moment, so that there may be some little correspondence with the Lord in us in this way of spring.<a name=439:8></a> There is a remarkable reference in the types in Leviticus to the creatures that are clean and the creatures that are unclean.<a name=439:9></a> Creatures that crawl upon the earth, although they may be four-footed, are unclean.<a name=439:10></a> I may listen to all the ministry and speak of it, and yet be on the earth; I have never got the idea of spiritual power to leap off the earth.<a name=439:11></a> So in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#11">Leviticus  11</a>there is a difference in this particular case, there are certain ones that have legs above their feet by which they spring up from the earth.<a name=439:12></a> There is nothing much to say about them, they are more or less characterised as the others are, but still it is that which saves them that they do have power to leap up sometimes off the earth; there is that relieving feature about them.<a name=439:13></a> And so it is that the Lord would remind us that it is not what we hear, or appropriate even, for we may hear things and assimilate them too, like chewing the cud, and

		yet not be clean, for the reason that there is no rising from the earth: we just stay there.<a name=440:1></a> When we are in the assembly we are away from home.<a name=440:2></a> You understand me, I do not say we can stay very long together; it is not so, because God considers for us: addresses are to be short, prophets are to speak only two or three.<a name=440:3></a> The idea is you are perfectly at home while you are there.<a name=440:4></a> Do not make it appear that you are away from home while you are there, but that you are enjoying the thing, you are satisfied, you have been made to drink into one Spirit.<a name=440:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think from what I have said you will see that Rebecca fits into the chapter in the Acts from which I have read and that it is the position of the assembly all the way down.<a name=440:6></a> The Lord has brought us back to it in some little way, and what I am speaking of now is the spring, that, in respect of Christ, there is a real movement at all times, as soon as He is presented.<a name=440:7></a> I have no doubt that Beer-lahai-roi, being the first mention of a well, although it was connected with Hagar, was God's provision, and the Lord would say it is all a question of the Spirit in this matter; He had gone there and He was coming back from there.<a name=440:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I go on to Achsah, a well-known figure too, another type of the assembly, but not as in Sarah's tent; she is in the inheritance.<a name=440:9></a> Sarah's tent is not the inheritance of the assembly, it is another side of the position.<a name=440:10></a> The Spirit is the earnest of it and the Father "has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:12">Colossians  1:12</a>).<a name=440:11></a> So that now it is a question of ability to occupy the inheritance, not merely in words or mental assent, but in a real living way that I can leap, I can spring.<a name=440:12></a> It is a question of Caleb, the great inheritance man; he is another wonderful type for us in this sense, a man that steadily went on year after year patiently enduring maybe the jibes of Israel at times, but he went on day in and day out

		Jerusalem about four years before he wrote this epistle, for he was a long time at Caesarea and two years at Rome.<a name=442:1></a> Could he have written this epistle at Jerusalem?<a name=442:2></a> The environment would have been against him, but he had gone through much and now the whole vista of the inheritance of God is opened up to him by the Spirit.<a name=442:3></a> How can we live in these things?<a name=442:4></a> Only by the Spirit, and by the Spirit in this plural way, the upper and the lower springs; it is the variety, the unsearchable riches that are involved; there is no slackness in it.<a name=442:5></a> See the variety there is even in our little way in these days, how the Lord is helping us.<a name=442:6></a> He will help every one of us.<a name=442:7></a> It is a question of seeing the need; you are brought into this wonderful position, and you want to be in it in a suitable way.<a name=442:8></a> Not simply a field, she was emboldened to ask for what she really needed, springs; and she got the upper and the lower springs, which would fit her down here in regard to the inheritance and which would enable her up there, typically, to enjoy the full liberty and dignity of her portion in Christ.<a name=442:9></a> That is what Achsah means as I understand, and we can easily follow that; it applies to each christian here.<a name=442:10></a> We are brought into this and we need to make room for the Spirit, not only to keep us here but to enter into and enjoy the great things of God, things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard and which have not come into man's heart to conceive, but which God has prepared for those who love Him.<a name=442:11></a>

		Well now, I finish with Dan; he is a lion's whelp, we are told.<a name=442:12></a> It is a very brief comment on Dan, but a great relief from what is said in Jacob's blessing.<a name=442:13></a> He leaps from Bashan.<a name=442:14></a> The allusion, I think, is to persons being, it may be, in an inferior spiritual position, or even a wrong position.<a name=442:15></a> Bashan is not to be despised, it is divine territory, but it is not Canaan.<a name=442:16></a> Now I am not here to criticise, but to state facts.<a name=442:17></a>

		There are many of us who are well content with the other side, the wilderness side, of Jordan.<a name=443:1></a> Is there power in our souls to get out of it?<a name=443:2></a> As we come together in assembly (one never tires of alluding to the collective side for it is there that the concrete thing is worked out fully) is there sufficient power in my soul as I sit down to partake of the Lord's supper, which is a wilderness position, to leave the wilderness?<a name=443:3></a> It is a question of where He is, not where I am.<a name=443:4></a> Christ is away, but is there power in my soul, as I apprehend Him in the emblems, to get out of the wilderness for the moment, to spring from one position into another?<a name=443:5></a> A right position, it may be, certainly the position in the Lord's supper is quite right, but it ceases to be right if I stay there and others are enabled in the power of the Spirit to go further, to go over Jordan in spiritual power.<a name=443:6></a> I want to be with them, to move on, and I think that is what is meant here by the brief comment on this remarkable man Daniel He is able to leap from Bashan, to leave one position for another with a spring and a leap.<a name=443:7></a> That is what I had in mind, that we might finish with that and be concerned that, as we come together in assembly, we might be in power and that we might understand what enters into the assembly, what possibilities there are as this idea of spring is laid hold of, as we avail ourselves of it.<a name=443:8></a> "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>).<a name=443:9></a> That means I have laid hold of the power; the Spirit of God is leading, I am leadable, and I am marked off as one of the sons of God.<a name=443:10></a> Now I think that Dan as capable of leaping from Bashan would come under that heading, fitting in with the glorious outline of the tribes as presented by Moses the man of God.<a name=443:11></a>
