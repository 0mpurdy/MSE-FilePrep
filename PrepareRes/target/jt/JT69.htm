		THE SPHERE WHERE CHRIST IS KNOWN

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have a few simple thoughts which I desire to put together in connection with the Lord as viewed in three aspects.<a name=1:1></a> First at the passover, the second at the Supper and the third in the garden.<a name=1:2></a> There is a good deal for souls to reflect upon in these relations in which Christ is viewed.<a name=1:3></a> I wish to engage you for a moment with them, and to shew you how the believer today may be guided into the sphere where Christ is known.<a name=1:4></a> The Lord suggested that the passover should be prepared and be celebrated in a place that was to be discovered by certain indications.<a name=1:5></a> These indications given by the Lord to the disciples are illustrative of how the believer today may be guided into the sphere where Christ's interests are.<a name=1:6></a> In that sphere we find certain elements -- some divine, beloved friends, and some alas, the fruit of the working of the flesh.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to shew you the sphere where Christ has influence.<a name=1:8></a> There must be a suitable place where He can celebrate the passover with His disciples.<a name=1:9></a> No one observant fails to recognise the exceedingly perplexing condition that prevails today.<a name=1:10></a> What is needed is guidance.<a name=1:11></a> Without guidance we are sure to miss the way or defile the spot -- the spot influenced by the Lord Jesus.<a name=1:12></a> There is guidance to be discerned by those with affection, those who desire to reach the spot influenced by the Lord Jesus.<a name=1:13></a> That there <i>is</i> a spot is certain, but many of the Lord's people are unacquainted with it.<a name=1:14></a> I wish to shew you that the Lord Jesus gives guidance, and how it is discerned.<a name=1:15></a> First, the man with the pitcher of water -- he is a very interesting man, if you are interested.<a name=1:16></a> It is not simply a man (using a pitcher of water as a figure) with the direct teaching; teaching is to have the Spirit behind it, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.<a name=1:17></a> I want you to discover the Spirit's guiding.<a name=1:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The man with the pitcher of water is very interesting to those who have a need -- those with spiritual thirst.<a name=2:1></a> If you are thirsting after righteousness, that man has something for you.<a name=2:2></a> He is not stationary, he is in movement.<a name=2:3></a> You want to keep your eye on him; if you want to know where he is going, follow him, he leads you on, "There shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water".<a name=2:4></a> Directly you become exercised in regard to God's things, someone will meet you; one who has something for you will meet you.<a name=2:5></a> I am not wishing to direct you to an individual; the Holy Spirit is here, and He has taken up His abode in vessels, in men.<a name=2:6></a> The word is an "earthen pitcher", the Holy Spirit takes up His position in men.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Directly you are exercised, the Spirit will meet you; He is in movement.<a name=2:8></a> If there is anything one desires to see, it is movement.<a name=2:9></a> Immediately you come into touch with the activities of the Spirit, you find there is a movement in a certain direction; but the question is, do you move?<a name=2:10></a> You may say that was a wonderful meeting, that was wonderful ministry: but do you move?<a name=2:11></a> The disciples were to follow the man with the pitcher of water.<a name=2:12></a> He entered into a house.<a name=2:13></a> I shall here call attention to another feature.<a name=2:14></a> The goodman of the house expected Christ; keep your eye on that man.<a name=2:15></a> Directly you get into the house, you find the house has an owner, "Say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?<a name=2:16></a>" The goodman of the house respected and recognised the word of Christ.<a name=2:17></a> He understood something of teaching.<a name=2:18></a> The Lord says, "He shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready".<a name=2:19></a> If you want to reach the spot where Christ has influence you must look for the recognition of His authority.<a name=2:20></a> I would not place my foot where the authority of Christ is questioned.<a name=2:21></a> It is no place for you.<a name=2:22></a> Look for these marks -- the man with the pitcher of water, and the recognition by the owner of the house

		of the Teacher or Master.<a name=3:1></a> It is a day of lawlessness in which we live.<a name=3:2></a> The authority of Christ is rejected.<a name=3:3></a> In <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>we have a perfect exhortation: "Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity".<a name=3:4></a> You must recognise the authority of the Lord.<a name=3:5></a> There is no possible hope for the preservation of the testimony apart from recognising His authority.<a name=3:6></a> The next thing is, the room is furnished.<a name=3:7></a> If anything marks the religious world, it is furniture.<a name=3:8></a> You find people very particular in regard to furnishing.<a name=3:9></a> I want to shew you that furniture is important: you do not want a choir -- an important part of furnishing in the religious world -- it is a confession of the absence of the true Singer.<a name=3:10></a> The Lord Jesus is the sweet Psalmist of Israel.<a name=3:11></a> He is the true David -- He alone leads the choir -- the spiritual choir.<a name=3:12></a> David placed the ark in Zion, and composed a psalm to be sung.<a name=3:13></a> God's house is a house of song; that you will not find in the furnishings around.<a name=3:14></a> There is not an atom of furniture according to God in the religious forms.<a name=3:15></a> Today all true furniture is divine.<a name=3:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I now come to another indication; the upper room.<a name=3:17></a> The Spirit never uses a word without a purpose.<a name=3:18></a> The upper room is, in a way, secluded from the earth, and divinely furnished.<a name=3:19></a> I cannot describe the furniture of the assembly, but it is the spot where the Lord meets with His disciples.<a name=3:20></a> Everything is there for the celebration of the passover.<a name=3:21></a> Enter!<a name=3:22></a> I have only indicated it to you, specially for young souls, so that they might have guidance into the circle influenced by the Lord Jesus.<a name=3:23></a> In that room the twelve were with Him.<a name=3:24></a> He says to them, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you".<a name=3:25></a> I am not saying the passover is the Supper, or the Supper the passover, I am only speaking of the Lord's desire.<a name=3:26></a> As you enter that circle the Lord impresses you with His desire.<a name=3:27></a> When the Supper was instituted -- when He gave them the cup He said, "Drink ye all of it" -- no one was to be absent.<a name=3:28></a>

		We have Him here in relation to the passover, the Supper, and the garden.<a name=4:1></a> The Passover has reference to His undergoing the judgment -- being subject to God's holy judgment with regard to sin.<a name=4:2></a> The Supper is the Lord's affection for His people.<a name=4:3></a> The garden is His submission to the will of the Father.<a name=4:4></a> The garden is exclusively for the Father -- the question of the Lord taking a body to do the Father's will, "Not my will, but thine be done".<a name=4:5></a> I have indicated the distinction between these three, and now wish to dwell on the Supper.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Supper is not a meal we partake of in regard to our bodies.<a name=4:7></a> It was instituted after the passover, which He tasted according to what it meant -- God's holy judgment in regard to sin.<a name=4:8></a> He did not eat the Supper.<a name=4:9></a> He broke the bread.<a name=4:10></a> He appropriated the passover, but at the Supper He thinks of us.<a name=4:11></a> The Supper is entirely for believers, not for Israel, but for the assembly.<a name=4:12></a> It was instituted after the passover.<a name=4:13></a> The Lord broke the bread -- that was His part in it, the Lord giving His body in death.<a name=4:14></a> He gave the Supper to us, and it remains with us.<a name=4:15></a> He gave it to the disciples, and afterwards it is given to the Gentiles by the apostle Paul.<a name=4:16></a> He leaves it with the assembly.<a name=4:17></a> The Lord has given His body in death; no other one could have done that.<a name=4:18></a> He did so, not as the passover or for the accomplishment of the Father's will, but "my body which is given for you".<a name=4:19></a> The Lord misses you, if you are not there.<a name=4:20></a> I was saying to some, the Lord has given us all the same food, and the same drink; and the object in it is, that there might be similarity.<a name=4:21></a> If christians are not alike, it is because they do not feed on the same food, and drink the same drink.<a name=4:22></a> We are all partakers of the one loaf.<a name=4:23></a> There is only one loaf.<a name=4:24></a> As it is broken, we are reminded of Christ, not as the passover, but as giving His body in death for us.<a name=4:25></a> You put forth your hand and partake of it, committing yourself to the communion of the saints.<a name=4:26></a> There is only one communion -- the christian communion.<a name=4:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If it is not that, it is not to be recognised.<a name=5:1></a> We are all partakers of the same spiritual food -- all been made to drink of the one Spirit, "Drink ye all of it".<a name=5:2></a> Mark gives the bright side, "they all drank of it".<a name=5:3></a> It would be a wonderful thing if christians were all drinking of the one Spirit -- one Spirit in unity.<a name=5:4></a> We are not united against our will.<a name=5:5></a> Drink is enjoyment -- except where the Lord drank the bitter cup.<a name=5:6></a> If all were to drink of the one Spirit there would be satisfaction, a common joy, unity -- no effort in it.<a name=5:7></a> Unity is a necessity because of the common joy.<a name=5:8></a> Divine thoughts are held in common, and that produces unity.<a name=5:9></a> Sections, nationalism and the like, are judged.<a name=5:10></a> We hold in common the things of God given to us.<a name=5:11></a> If you partake of the loaf, and your associations outside are not in accord, you are inconsistent.<a name=5:12></a> In 2 Corinthians we have one common object in heaven, "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit".<a name=5:13></a> There is a similarity between christians.<a name=5:14></a> If I meet a spiritual man here, and one at the other side of the world, there is a similarity.<a name=5:15></a>

		I now want to dwell for a moment, on the condition that arose in the presence of all this, "Behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table" -- a solemn statement!<a name=5:16></a> In the presence of all this light; there, where all that love was displayed, was the hand of the betrayer.<a name=5:17></a> Could Satan proceed further?<a name=5:18></a> The table was the spot where the Lord spread out the expression of His love; moreover the one who had loved Him, denied Him.<a name=5:19></a> Judas is typical of the Romish system.<a name=5:20></a> It has betrayed Him, and cannot be trusted.<a name=5:21></a> Protestantism has denied Him.<a name=5:22></a> You may not betray Him, and yet deny Him.<a name=5:23></a> The denial of Christ is simply that you have another name than His before you.<a name=5:24></a> There were a few names in Sardis (i.<a name=5:25></a>e.<a name=5:26></a> Protestantism) that were worthy and "they shall walk with me in white".<a name=5:27></a> The

		Lord loves an open confession of His name.<a name=6:1></a> There is only one Name.<a name=6:2></a> It is remarkable that in the beginning of Acts they spoke of it as <i>the</i> Name -- not another should be known.<a name=6:3></a> Remember how the Lord speaks of those who shall deny Him, and says "him will I also deny".<a name=6:4></a> Things are reversed there -- the person that denies Christ, is not worthy to be recognised in God's world.<a name=6:5></a> Peter denied Him, yet loved Him.<a name=6:6></a> There were two elements at work -- the hand of the betrayer; and Peter who gave way and denied Him.<a name=6:7></a> I only touch on Peter.<a name=6:8></a> It is of all importance that we should be faithful.<a name=6:9></a> If you confess Christ, all the power of God will support you.<a name=6:10></a> There is a power here, the power of the Spirit.<a name=6:11></a> Then "there was also a strife among them, which of them should be held to be the greatest".<a name=6:12></a> These things are all familiar to us.<a name=6:13></a> We are exposed to ambition, especially if we have any little bit of gift.<a name=6:14></a> Then the Lord said to them "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them .<a name=6:15></a>.<a name=6:16></a>.<a name=6:17></a> but ye shall not be so: but .<a name=6:18></a>.<a name=6:19></a>.<a name=6:20></a> he that is chief, as he that doth serve".<a name=6:21></a> Among the Gentiles they exercised authority, and such are called benefactors.<a name=6:22></a> But you cannot patronise the christian, you may have means, gift and education, but these things are not great enough.<a name=6:23></a> The great one in christianity is to be a servant, "Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth?<a name=6:24></a> is not he that sitteth at meat?<a name=6:25></a> but I am among you as he that serveth".<a name=6:26></a> If I am serving you tonight, it is by ministering a portion of meat to you.<a name=6:27></a>

		The Lord puts the saints at His table, and ministers to them.<a name=6:28></a> That is the path for the man of gift, if after the pattern of Christ.<a name=6:29></a> The Lord takes a towel, pours water into a basin, girds Himself with the towel, retaining the servant's place, and wipes their feet, with the towel wherewith He was girded.<a name=6:30></a> If serving, you are serving those who are greater than yourself.<a name=6:31></a> These things are grouped together by the Spirit in connection with the passover, the Supper, and Gethsemane.<a name=6:32></a>

		And the whole <i>does</i> disappear; for if we take Noah as figurative of that race, <i>he</i> disappeared in the ark because he was connected with that race.<a name=20:1></a> The ark refers to Christ in the sense of being constituted to survive death, to go through it and survive it.<a name=20:2></a> Christ went under death, but He is out of it.<a name=20:3></a> He was a new order -- He was always that personally, but He took upon Him our place vicariously, and rose out of it.<a name=20:4></a> Now, we are allowed to remain here, but it is not as the ungodly; we are here as a matter of righteousness, only one's title to be here is on the ground of faith -- we have no title in ourselves.<a name=20:5></a> Christ established a title for us to remain here.<a name=20:6></a> He is the standard of our title to be here; we are taken up under a new Head; He is the One who vindicates God's name.<a name=20:7></a> Noah vindicated His name in that he carried through the ark, he carried through clean beasts by sevens, not by twos, but by sevens -- which clean beasts he could take and offer to the Lord; and the Lord smelled a sweet savour.<a name=20:8></a> So in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9">Genesis  9</a>Jehovah makes a covenant, not only with the world, but with Noah and Noah's sons.<a name=20:9></a> They are taken account of formally by God.<a name=20:10></a> They were saved on the strength of Noah's faith; but now <i>they</i> are viewed and a covenant made with <i>them</i>.<a name=20:11></a> Now, if we are to live to God, as the apostle says here -- the Lord has established a title for us; it is a matter of judgment -- "having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died".<a name=20:12></a> Now, if you live, and we do live, through grace, it is to Him.<a name=20:13></a> Do you remember the passage in Hosea?<a name=20:14></a> "After two days will he revive is: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight".<a name=20:15></a> That is the position -- we are raised up really in the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=20:16></a> That is the ground in Colossians.<a name=20:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>we are said to be raised up by faith, but faith in what?<a name=20:18></a> Faith in the power or operation of God who raised Him from the dead.<a name=20:19></a> That is the position we are regarded in there.<a name=20:20></a> The great point in Colossians is that Christ might have His place in the hearts of the

		Well now, this passage opens up a wide and large sphere to us.<a name=21:11></a> Let us refer for a moment to the epistle to the Romans.<a name=21:12></a> I would suggest that the idea of living to another -- "to him who died for them" opens up room for the marital relationship; it is in that connection that the thought in Romans of being to Christ fits in.<a name=21:13></a> I connect it in my mind, in the types, with the covenant.<a name=21:14></a> You remember the children of Israel, after they were delivered from Egypt Jehovah referring to it afterwards -- to their original love -- says, "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals", etc.<a name=21:15></a> Israel was holiness to Jehovah and they followed after Him.<a name=21:16></a> The covenant, in principle, is God's proposal for a marital relationship -- God would take the part of Husband to Israel; and it has reference in that way to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>.<a name=21:17></a> The subject could be easily opened up in the Old Testament.<a name=21:18></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>is really a question of the Red sea.<a name=21:19></a> The passage of the sea was the one thing in which it was said the people acted in faith, they were in earnest.<a name=21:20></a> Many people are baptised who have not got faith, but the point is that you <i>should</i> have faith about

		it; and when it is a matter of light to you, when you have faith, the moral force of it is that you are baptised to Christ, and that is to His death.<a name=22:1></a> Now, being baptised to Christ, He has a claim over you, and the result is your body is subject to His will.<a name=22:2></a> I would warn young people that unless your will is broken you are useless to the testimony; your will must go.<a name=22:3></a> When the will is gone, the body is the Lord's and it becomes a wonderful thing.<a name=22:4></a> The fact is it becomes an instrument of righteousness, or rather our members become instruments of righteousness to God.<a name=22:5></a> It is in the hands of the Lord; that is where we become really qualified for the testimony.<a name=22:6></a> Old people, those who have been long on the way, in the service of the Lord and brought into subjection to Him -- whose wills are gone -- it is wonderful how the Lord takes them away -- I have often thought they are the ones who ought to stay -- but the Lord knows best.<a name=22:7></a> The Lord said to Peter, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not".<a name=22:8></a> The former is will -- -- "whither thou wouldest", but when old, the Lord says, "another shall gird thee".<a name=22:9></a> His will is broken, and he is brought into accord with the ark of the testimony.<a name=22:10></a> Instead of his own will, it was a question of the testimony now, "another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not".<a name=22:11></a> He suffered martyrdom for the testimony.<a name=22:12></a> I have often thought in that way, how important it is that we should begin early in subjection to Christ.<a name=22:13></a> It is a simple question of recognising that, as baptised to Christ, we should be subject to Christ, and you are able to be consistent with His death.<a name=22:14></a>

		Well now, in Romans we get some light as to the Lord's body, which is in full keeping with the idea of the covenant.<a name=22:15></a> The Lord, as you will remember, has given the institution of the Supper, and He said, "This

		J.T.<a name=27:1></a> I suggest that we might consider a little the object of ministry, and this chapter I think would furnish us with the subject, in the commission given to Peter, and also introducing John in his service.<a name=27:2></a> You will observe their service was to be based on what they were in their attachment to Christ.<a name=27:3></a> <i>Attachment to Christ is the basis of service</i>.<a name=27:4></a> John always emphasises love to Christ.<a name=27:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is rather remarkable that there is nothing in Peter's commission here, as to his having the keys of the kingdom.<a name=27:6></a> The fact is overlooked entirely, for in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>it is not the question of order, but of feeding or shepherding individuals.<a name=27:7></a> It is not the assembly: in fact the assembly is not taken up by John.<a name=27:8></a> Service is taken up with individual love to Christ; you may have any number of individuals, but they love Christ and they love one another.<a name=27:9></a> That is how John puts it.<a name=27:10></a>

		I think this chapter gives us that line of ministry; it is an appendix to the gospel.<a name=27:11></a> John did not finish his ministry without seeing the state of things amongst the servants.<a name=27:12></a> This chapter presents a very distressing state of things amongst those who served, so that we, who serve now, should never be discouraged when such conditions exist.<a name=27:13></a> The Lord Himself begins His interview with them by serving.<a name=27:14></a> He did not wait for them to bring in all the fish; He has got all things in control -- all in His own hands -- the fire, the coals and the fish were all prepared and ready.<a name=27:15></a> This suggests to us the infinite superiority of Christ in regard to all His servants.<a name=27:16></a> The chapter begins with breakdown.<a name=27:17></a> Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee, and two others -- seven in all -- they all go on a fishing expedition.<a name=27:18></a> Peter and Thomas head the list.<a name=27:19></a> Peter had denied the Lord, and Thomas was absent from the first meeting after He

		I wish to say a word about priesthood, particularly the instincts that mark it, and the clothing, and to show also the sphere in which it is exercised.<a name=44:1></a> The instincts of priesthood are of great importance, for without them we either ignore what is of God or act clumsily in regard of it.<a name=44:2></a> When Jacob had the great privilege opened up to him of being in the house of God "he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place"!<a name=44:3></a> indicating that he was wanting in priestly instincts and sympathies, not to say priestly clothes, he was certainly wanting in them.<a name=44:4></a> Now David, referring afterwards to the ark said "we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood" and called upon Jehovah to arise and enter into His rest, He and the ark of His strength.<a name=44:5></a> He had priestly instincts, for under David the priesthood was subordinated to the king; the priest was to walk before Jehovah's anointed, that is, the king had the first place; but then, happily, David was truly a priest; he was a priest in the principle to his instincts and desires; so he neglected his natural comforts, that is one mark of priesthood, and another is that one neglects one's natural relations.<a name=44:6></a> Levi said to his father and his mother "I have not seen him", he was true to God and so God gave unto him His covenant of peace, "My covenant was with him of life and peace".<a name=44:7></a> Levi was true when Israel proved deceitful.<a name=44:8></a> Levi stood by Moses and maintained things for God.<a name=44:9></a> And so David had priestly instincts; in fact we are told that he was clothed with the linen ephod and danced before the ark of the Lord, a remarkable exhibition of, not only priestly instincts, but priestly delights; the ark was everything to him, and so He says, "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy".<a name=44:10></a> These were the desires

	<div class="paragraph">
		of David, and so God answers him.<a name=45:1></a> I mention this, because it is encouraging when we have right desires.<a name=45:2></a> God answers David immediately and says, "I will also clothe her priests with salvation".<a name=45:3></a> Now, righteousness in us necessarily precedes salvation.<a name=45:4></a> You must have on the robe of righteousness before you can have the robe of salvation.<a name=45:5></a> It is of great importance that we should understand what such clothes as that are, that as we have to say to God and His things we are righteous in all our relations, and, on the other hand, we are free from all earthly influences, we are saved.<a name=45:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I brought those points forward so that you might see how priestly instincts develop and how God answers them, and so I take it that the letter to the Hebrews is that of a priest.<a name=45:7></a> Throughout the letter he is concerned as regards what is due to God.<a name=45:8></a> He begins by the divine speaking: "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son".<a name=45:9></a> That is the language of a priest, "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law".<a name=45:10></a> He does not profess to be that, there is no official assumption in the letter; Christ is said to be the Apostle and High Priest; nevertheless, the whole letter is stamped with priestly instincts and desires, so that he takes up the ark, as one may say, in the first chapter, and speaks of Christ in the most touching and yet the most reverential way; he brings forward what Christ is personally, that is the first thing with a priest, Christ must be considered first, His dignity, His glory.<a name=45:11></a> Then he proceeds, in the second chapter, to bring in Christ in relation to us, for he is really laying the basis for priestly exercise and service in the saints, so he brings in Christ in relation to man and says "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one".<a name=45:12></a> That is the priestly family.<a name=45:13></a> It is wonderful, dear brethren, that God is pleased so to regard us.<a name=45:14></a> If you recall the genealogy in

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6">Exodus  6</a>, when the Spirit of God arrives at Levi, He stops.<a name=46:1></a> There is no further genealogy given there; that is to say, He has arrived at the priestly family, and then He finally brings in "this is that Moses and Aaron".<a name=46:2></a> If you have the priestly family, then you have the service of God secured, and that is the first thing with God -- "that he may minister unto me in the priest's office".<a name=46:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I need not say that priesthood in us is not a development.<a name=46:4></a> It would be a very great mistake if we were to assume that.<a name=46:5></a> Priesthood is a calling, a priest is one who belongs to the family of priests.<a name=46:6></a> I was endeavouring to point out this morning how in Luke the atmosphere of heaven is brought down here.<a name=46:7></a> Directly the Babe is born there is a ministry of the angels to the shepherds, announcing glad tidings of great joy, and then presently there was a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God.<a name=46:8></a> It was priestly.<a name=46:9></a> And then, following upon that, you find Simeon coming into the temple by the Spirit.<a name=46:10></a> That is a priest.<a name=46:11></a> So that Luke brings in, in that way, the priestly family; and the Lord, in the last chapter is seen ascending into heaven in the attitude of the High Priest; He lifts up His hands and blesses His people and "as he was blessing them, he .<a name=46:12></a>.<a name=46:13></a>.<a name=46:14></a> was <i>carried up</i> into heaven", and the blessed ones, returning to Jerusalem, enter into the temple of God and are found there praising and blessing God.<a name=46:15></a> So the priestly family is brought to light.<a name=46:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Peter we have the formal statement that we are "a holy priesthood".<a name=46:17></a> It is not that you should be that.<a name=46:18></a> I would call attention to that, dear brethren, because, although, no doubt, most here know that, we should be clear about it, that it is not a question of development; it is that I belong to the family, and I cannot make myself a member of the family.<a name=46:19></a> Jesus has done it; as the scriptures say, "Unto him that .<a name=46:20></a>.<a name=46:21></a>.<a name=46:22></a> hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father".<a name=46:23></a> That belongs to every believer, and I would seek to

		dwell upon it at this time.<a name=47:1></a> I wanted to show how in Ezra the things that I have been speaking of came into evidence.<a name=47:2></a> He is very careful to tell us at the outset (chapter 7) that he belonged to the family of Aaron.<a name=47:3></a> I might say in passing that Ezra makes a great deal of genealogy.<a name=47:4></a> I have no doubt that it was he who wrote the Books of the Chronicles, and so in the last days of the dispensation of the church the book of Ezra fits in, because the point is that each of us should shew his genealogy.<a name=47:5></a> Am I a priest or not?<a name=47:6></a> I may claim it, but I have to prove it.<a name=47:7></a> And so Ezra is very careful to prove his genealogy, and having proved it he tells us that he "prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord".<a name=47:8></a> That is what is proper to a priest.<a name=47:9></a> If you claim priesthood, then prove it, prove your genealogy.<a name=47:10></a> You may ask me, How?<a name=47:11></a> By nature I must bring forward in my manner and spirit the traits of the priest; and so Ezra, in unmistakable language, says that he set his heart to seek the law of his God, and seeking it, he became a "ready scribe" in it.<a name=47:12></a> We must not deprecate writing.<a name=47:13></a> Writing has a great place in scripture.<a name=47:14></a> Now the Lord Jesus Christ is really that, if you understand me.<a name=47:15></a> It is He who writes, and I believe that His writing on the christian proves the christian's genealogy.<a name=47:16></a> The apostle John speaks of the things that the Lord Jesus did.<a name=47:17></a> He says, I have been writing to show seven signs, and he hung up on these seven signs a tablet, which we may read and run: "these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name".<a name=47:18></a> That is what he wrote them for; he did not write in any exhaustive way, he wants us to understand.<a name=47:19></a> Not a scriptural writer writes exhaustively: holy men of old were moved by the Holy Spirit and they wrote what they were moved to write, but no scriptural writer attempts to be exhaustive.<a name=47:20></a> John says formally, I have made no attempt to be exhaustive.<a name=47:21></a> I have simply written these things for you, but if all the other things were written,

		he says, "I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written".<a name=48:1></a> So that if anybody wants to write christianity exhaustively he has a very big order.<a name=48:2></a> But the Lord Jesus can do it, and I believe that everything will find an answer in some way so that things will be written, nothing will be lost.<a name=48:3></a> In John's gospel we are told that the fragments are all to be gathered up so that nothing is to be lost.<a name=48:4></a> Ezra was a ready scribe, he wrote the law of God, and I have no doubt that one finds touches, as I said, throughout the Books of Chronicles: he makes a great deal of David, they are written from the standpoint of the house of David and I have no doubt that in the last days of the church the Holy Spirit would work so that Christ should be supreme -- as I have remarked on a previous occasion -- the Headstone.<a name=48:5></a> Zerubbabel lays the foundation, but he puts up the Headstone also and they shout, "Grace, grace unto it".<a name=48:6></a> It is Christ in the affections of the saints.<a name=48:7></a>

		Well now, Ezra heard that the people of God were contracting unholy alliances.<a name=48:8></a> That, alas!<a name=48:9></a> is a practice that is very prevalent today among the people of God.<a name=48:10></a> As we maintain distance from God in our souls it is inevitable that we should contract unholy alliances, and Ezra, with true priestly instinct, humbles himself about it.<a name=48:11></a> One would love to see that now, that the Holy Spirit would bring about a sense that the alliances which many of the people of God have formed are unholy.<a name=48:12></a> The priest notices it, because he considers for God, and so Ezra sat down overwhelmed and rent his mantle and his garment and plucked off the hair of his head -- remarkable exercise; and now at the evening oblation he arose.<a name=48:13></a> That is, as he apprehends Christ as He is before God, he has confidence.<a name=48:14></a> He has confidence in God.<a name=48:15></a> And we have every reason to have confidence at the present time, for what Christ was at the beginning He is now, not only us-ward, but God-ward.<a name=48:16></a> He stands before God in all the efficacy of His work, and the

		If we have an altar, and if we eat at it, it is obvious that sacrifice has to be made, and the sacrifice is such as Peter calls a priestly sacrifice, a sacrifice of praise, spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<a name=53:7></a> So that in that way we come into the public service of God and we are found answering to the gospel of Luke.<a name=53:8></a> The gospel of Luke is the gospel of joy, joy that is brought in from heaven, and this epistle shows us the saints offering to God the fruit of their lips, giving thanks to His name.<a name=53:9></a>

		F.L.<a name=74:4></a> There is a moral line which underlies all this and which in a way gives a suggestion as to where what is vital is to be found.<a name=74:5></a> In chapter 6, to which reference was made, the apostles said it was not right for them to serve tables; in a sense it was beneath them, and it suggests they had made but poor use of the time when they sat with the Lord over against the temple and the Lord puts His valuation upon what a certain <i>widow</i> was doing.<a name=74:6></a> That is, she was putting all her living into the house of God, and the Lord estimates that, He assesses it, and they were with Him.<a name=74:7></a> When it came to a question of the widows they say in effect, it is beneath us and we will give ourselves to the word of God and to prayer.<a name=74:8></a> The answer of the Lord to that is in Stephen and Philip, and then again later on, when the door is open, as we get it here, and Jew and Gentile have to be brought together.<a name=74:9></a> Saul and Barnabas are distinguished in this; in their ministry they have committed to them, as it were, the serving of tables.<a name=74:10></a> They gathered the bounty and carried it to Jerusalem, and in that act, so to speak, of vitality, gave practical evidence of how the Lord was bringing together the Jew and Gentile, so making of twain one new man.<a name=74:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=119:4></a> Well, it affords a further evidence of the levitical skill with which the apostle carried on his labours, inasmuch as it gives us an example of his manner in speaking to <i>Gentiles</i>; the 13th chapter shows how he spoke to <i>Jews</i>.<a name=119:5></a> Verse 15 says -- "Men, why do ye these things?<a name=119:6></a> <i>We</i> also are men of like passions with you, preaching to you to turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things in them; who in the past generations suffered all the nations to go in their own ways, though indeed he did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness".<a name=119:7></a> That is an example of how he preached to the Gentiles.<a name=119:8></a> Taking both together we have examples of how he became all things to all men, that he might gain the more.<a name=119:9></a> To the Jews he became a Jew, but to the Gentiles he did not become a Gentile, but he spoke as a <i>man</i>.<a name=119:10></a> He was a man as they were, so that he begins, "<i>We</i> also are <i>men of like passions with you</i>".<a name=119:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=119:12></a> You see the same example in Athens when he came to that city and saw it given over to demon worship, which I suppose was the sort of idolatry which involved that the things of nature were deified.<a name=119:13></a> Paul speaks of the altar "To the unknown God".<a name=119:14></a> He says, "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you", And then he proceeds as <i>a man</i>: "For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.<a name=119:15></a> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God".<a name=119:16></a> And then he brings in the new order of Man in the new sphere as God's answer to that -- Jesus and the resurrection.<a name=119:17></a>

		I have in mind to present the idea of a model, knowing that God works on that principle.<a name=143:1></a> Even in the formation of the creation of man God wrought on this principle: He had Christ in His mind.<a name=143:2></a> He intended that what He had in His mind -- wisdom expressed in man -- should find some expression beforehand in Adam.<a name=143:3></a> The book of Proverbs shows that wisdom was there in all God's operations.<a name=143:4></a> We have brought out in the gospel of Luke divine wisdom in One come near to us, come so near and outwardly in such a small compass that He may be known from every point of view.<a name=143:5></a> John says "the Word became flesh" without breaking up for us into detail what the incarnation conveyed.<a name=143:6></a> He was concerned about the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, and he hastens to tell us that having become flesh He dwelt among us, and "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", chapter 1: 14.<a name=143:7></a> We are introduced to the Person immediately, but in verse 18 His relation to the Father is made prominent: He stands in a unique place, the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=143:8></a> But Luke presents Him in relation to man, and identifies Him in His genealogy <i>with</i> men.<a name=143:9></a> So Luke, in his own divinely taught way, breaks up for us in beautiful and effective detail, the manner of the incarnation, and the wisdom attaching to it.<a name=143:10></a> We find Him at eight days old in the arms of a priest in the temple, and thus the light radiates, not yet exactly from the Babe, but from the prophetic words uttered by the Spirit from the priest.<a name=143:11></a> And so the Lord is presented to us until He appears at the baptism of John.<a name=143:12></a> These chapters to which I allude radiate with divine wisdom -- wisdom was there, had come nigh to man in the most intimate possible way, not only in Mary but in the arms of Simeon.<a name=143:13></a> One commends these chapters as food for young ones, especially young priests,

		I have it before me to speak about the witness of the Spirit, and have selected these passages because they set out the features in the main, of that witness; but I refer to the Acts in order to call attention to that in which He bears witness; so that we may have before us the conditions in which the Spirit witnesses amongst the people of God.<a name=171:1></a> The Book of the Acts furnishes us with the conditions in which the Spirit witnessed at the outset.<a name=171:2></a> These conditions can never be attained, I need not say, as they then existed, but nevertheless, the Scriptures contemplate that there should be the continuance of the witness of the Spirit.<a name=171:3></a> And so in the addresses to the assemblies in Revelation, we find that in the last four assemblies addressed, the idea of overcoming is introduced before we have the speaking of the Spirit; that is to say, the overcomers in these assemblies furnish the Spirit with conditions in which He speaks.<a name=171:4></a> And so one is encouraged to urge overcoming personally, and I may say, collectively, in order that there may be conditions in which the Holy Spirit witnesses.<a name=171:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these conditions indicated in the Acts contemplate at the outset the saints together in one place.<a name=171:6></a> Those who were thus together had been under the Lord's tuition; they had seen how He had operated in His service, and that in Him there was a vessel in which the Holy Spirit could operate without hindrance.<a name=171:7></a> A wonderful opportunity!<a name=171:8></a> an opportunity that none since have had.<a name=171:9></a> It was by the Spirit of God He operated.<a name=171:10></a> They saw, or could have seen, that, as anointed of the Spirit, He was carried into the wilderness to be tempted; that is to say, the Spirit of God was in a vessel in perfect freedom to take the initiative, although, after the temptation in the wilderness, the Lord is said to have returned in the

		power of the Spirit.<a name=172:1></a> He returned into the sphere of His service in the power of the Spirit, indicating that that service would be carried on in the power of the Spirit; and so, in the synagogue of Nazareth He said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor".<a name=172:2></a> He thus announces that His service was to be carried on in the power of the Spirit; and so those who companied with Him could see how He moved in the power of the Spirit and how the Holy Spirit operated here in a vessel.<a name=172:3></a> And so, as risen from the dead, He charged the apostles by the Spirit; that is what we find in the opening of the Acts.<a name=172:4></a> They would thus be reminded that the dispensation should be in the power of the Spirit.<a name=172:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to touch for a moment on the conditions that prevailed in Jerusalem, because Jerusalem was to be primarily the theatre of the Spirit's testimony.<a name=172:6></a> The apostles were to abide there until they were clothed with power from on high, so that the first great witness of the Spirit was in that city.<a name=172:7></a> It is well to take note of that, that the first great testimony of God was rendered to a city, shewing the place that cities have in the mind of God.<a name=172:8></a> They are centralisations of population; they represent the power of the world; they represent what Satan does, and what man does, and what he is capable of, "Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11:4">Genesis  11:4</a>.<a name=172:9></a> That is what was in the mind of man, and God came down to see that city and that tower, indicating that He shewed His interest in men, even though they had turned away from Him.<a name=172:10></a> So we are told in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#10">Genesis  10</a>that Nimrod "began to be a mighty one in the earth", and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and that the builder of Nineveh was of the kingdom of Nimrod; "From that land went out Asshur and built Nineveh".<a name=172:11></a> Nineveh was a city therefore which had its origin in a man who was a

		<a name=173>[Page 173]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		mighty one upon the earth -- one who represented the energy of man supremely.<a name=173:1></a> There is nothing about a city to attract divine interest save as we understand what God is, as infinitely above man's will and man's sin.<a name=173:2></a> So we find later that He sends the prophet, His servant Jonah, to preach to that city.<a name=173:3></a> I refer to that so that you might see how God regards cities, and how He, in the infinitude of His grace, rises above man's guilt, and bears witness to His grace where guilt is at its height.<a name=173:4></a> And so the Lord commanded the apostles to remain in the city of Jerusalem until they should be clothed with power from on high; signifying that He would have a witness there, and He would have it in heavenly power; it should lack nothing; it should be representative of God as set forth in the ministry of Christ and in the death of Christ, and they were to begin in Jerusalem.<a name=173:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the conditions are seen in the opening of the 2nd chapter of Acts; they were together in one place.<a name=173:6></a> I do not know that the same expression -- "in one place" -- is found again in the Acts.<a name=173:7></a> What you find here is that the Holy Spirit came to persons who were great enough morally to receive Him; and as the Holy Spirit sat on each of them, they began to speak as the Spirit gave them utterance.<a name=173:8></a> They were morally qualified to be the vessels of the Spirit.<a name=173:9></a> Now, what I would point out in regard of the conditions at Jerusalem is that you find in the succeeding chapters a representation of all that with which the people of God are familiar at the present time in the way of gatherings, In chapter 2 there is first the breaking of bread in houses; Scripture gives us no clue as to the number of houses, but there were three thousand at least in Jerusalem who were believers on the day of Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit says that they were together, although He does not say "in one place".<a name=173:10></a> They were together characteristically; wherever two of them met, they were heart and soul one; wherever a dozen of them met, they were heart and soul one; wherever

	<div class="paragraph">
		fifty of them met, they were of one heart and one soul; and those two, or those twelve, or those fifty, were severally vessels through which the Holy Spirit witnessed.<a name=174:1></a> The witness permeated the city, and it was alleged that they were filling Jerusalem with their doctrine.<a name=174:2></a> In order to provide for this, the Lord in His wisdom had ministered in houses; He had set before the eyes of His apostles how houses could be employed in the testimony, and furthermore, in feeding five thousand persons at one time, He had directed that they should be divided up into a hundred groups.<a name=174:3></a> They would thus have become familiar with the divine way that, whilst the transaction was one -- five thousand being fed at one time -- they were fed in one hundred companies; so that those in Jerusalem would understand that the administration of the Spirit -- the witness of the Spirit to Jerusalem -- should reach Jerusalem thus.<a name=174:4></a> And so we find, as I said, in chapter 2 the breaking of bread in houses, or, as it should read "in house", meaning that that was the <i>character</i> of the thing.<a name=174:5></a> That there were plenty of houses available, there cannot be a question.<a name=174:6></a> Then, in chapter 5, we find that the apostles preached the glad tidings that Jesus was the Christ, in houses, as well as in the temple; and furthermore that they taught in houses, as well as in the temple, verse 42.<a name=174:7></a> We see, therefore, that Jerusalem was permeated with the testimony of God, both in the way of preaching in houses and in the way of teaching.<a name=174:8></a> Houses, therefore, became available for the Spirit to witness in in the way of announcing that Jesus was the Christ, in the way of announcing the gospel, and in the way of teaching; in other words, there were gospel meetings in the houses and readings in which the apostles and others taught.<a name=174:9></a> Then, passing on to chapter 12, we find that the whole assembly is praying.<a name=174:10></a> Peter was in prison, and prayer was made for him by the assembly; and then, as he is released, doubtless in answer to their prayers, he goes to the house of Mary,

		which was one of the places of prayer.<a name=175:1></a> Thus we can see how the customs that God has brought about amongst is marked the early believers.<a name=175:2></a> There was the breaking of bread, there was the preaching, there was the teaching, there were the prayer meetings in houses, and finally there was what we call the 'care' meetings -- a meeting which obtains different designations amongst us but which implies that the interests of Christ are taken care of in wisdom; where those who have the care of things on their hearts draw together to take counsel, and, indeed, to discuss them.<a name=175:3></a> In chapter 15, we read of "much discussion having taken place".<a name=175:4></a> From the book of the Acts we see that the Holy Spirit operates in all these relations in meetings.<a name=175:5></a> Referring again to chapter 15, it says that the apostles and elders came together to consider the question which had arisen as to circumcision, and "much discussion having taken place".<a name=175:6></a> Peter stands up, and speaks, and conveys the mind of God, and James stands up and confirms it; and then the apostles and elders, with the whole assembly, endorse the decision; and then the Holy Spirit is said to be with them.<a name=175:7></a> "It seemed good", they say, "to the Holy Spirit and to us".<a name=175:8></a> It is encouraging thus to see that the things that God has revived -- the customs, the means by which the Holy Spirit operates amongst us -- marked the early christians; and in no case is the care meeting the least important.<a name=175:9></a> In it we take care of the interests of Christ and we find His support so that right principles and right practices are maintained, and thus there is transparency amongst the saints.<a name=175:10></a> One of the most baneful things that one observes in moving about amongst the saints is the handling of matters by a group.<a name=175:11></a> Every believer in the assembly is a priest, and the priests are the custodians of the law, and every believer is responsible to see that the principles governing the assembly are maintained.<a name=175:12></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>, after the death of Christ in its bearing upon our consciences is dealt with, we have this remarkable statement, "The Holy Spirit also is a witness <i>to us</i>", and what comes out is a quotation from the Book of Jeremiah.<a name=180:9></a> The Old Testament is brought into <i>present</i> service.<a name=180:10></a> It is not "it is written", or "as saith the prophet" here: it is a question of what the Holy Spirit says -- what He is saying at the present moment for us.<a name=180:11></a> Jeremiah is brought into the present moment, and made to be a vessel for the witness of the Spirit; hence the great value of the Old Testament, it is brought in livingly by the Spirit who wrote it.<a name=180:12></a> You say, Jeremiah wrote it; it is not said so here: the Holy Spirit wrote it; but here it is that the Holy Spirit <i>bears</i> us witness; He bears a present witness as to the new covenant.<a name=180:13></a> "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says".<a name=180:14></a> What does He say?<a name=180:15></a> Many things; but above all He will tell us about the love of God.<a name=180:16></a> He will keep that before us.<a name=180:17></a> He will keep the water before us, He will insist on that; He will keep the blood before us in its bearing on the conscience, for "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin"; but He will keep the love of God before us -- He is a

		There is just one other thing I would speak of, and in a way it is the most touching of all, and that is, that "the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God".<a name=181:8></a> I think you can see the order of these Scriptures.<a name=181:9></a> The witness of the death of Christ maintains us in purity and with a good conscience; the witness of the covenant maintains us in the light of the love of God.<a name=181:10></a> We cannot do without the love of God, and there should be response in the brethren in the way of affection in the light of the love of God.<a name=181:11></a> Aaron kissed Moses, we saw, then they went together.<a name=181:12></a> There was a witness, for witness on the part of God is not only a question of light, but of love; they went together to Pharaoh; Moses did not go alone.<a name=181:13></a> But now we have in this verse in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>the Spirit witnessing with our spirit -- it is the Holy Spirit <i>in</i> us.<a name=181:14></a> He witnesses with our spirit, that is to say, He makes us conscious in our spirit, that we are the children of God.<a name=181:15></a> The spirit belongs to God, I need not remind you, and it returns to God; He is the Father of spirits.<a name=181:16></a> Every man, woman and child in the world has his spirit from God; and God knows every one; but what comes out here is that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.<a name=181:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will thus see, dear brethren, the great gain of maintaining conditions for the Holy Spirit to witness in, and maintaining that witness amongst us of which these scriptures speak.<a name=182:3></a> And I would again refer to the addresses to the assemblies; these conditions amongst us depend on overcoming, and overcoming is in individuals -- "he that overcometh".<a name=182:4></a> The overcomer maintains the link with God, and God comes in through him, and the Holy Spirit witnesses through him.<a name=182:5></a> I believe the overcomer in all these four assemblies will insist on the first principles, he will insist on being in accord with what obtained in Jerusalem -- the breaking of bread, the preaching, the teaching, meetings for prayer; and there would be care for the saints.<a name=182:6></a> It is out of all reason to think that the saints should not be the subjects of care, and that the government of God should not be maintained amongst them.<a name=182:7></a> This requires wise counsel, and every bit of experience should be called into action, so that the mind and will of God should prevail and that there should be conditions in which the Holy Spirit can witness.<a name=182:8></a>

		John's writings are recognised by those who have spiritual intelligence as specially intended for the last days, and in this connection it is significant that the Son as such is seen in service, for it is a question of undoing the works of the devil, as John says, in the epistle from which I read.<a name=192:1></a> The devil sins from the beginning, so that his works extend far back and are multitudinous, God knowing well where to place responsibility.<a name=192:2></a> Not one of his works fails to come under divine scrutiny.<a name=192:3></a> He will be dealt with accordingly.<a name=192:4></a> God will deal with him.<a name=192:5></a> He never deals with him in a disciplinary way as He does with man, but in a punitive way; and so he will be dealt with according to the sure, discriminating, calculating judgment of God.<a name=192:6></a> The Revelation leaves us in no doubt as to this, nor as to his identity, for he is seen there as bearing all his identifying titles.<a name=192:7></a> But what is going on now is the undoing of what he has done.<a name=192:8></a> He is robbed of his power; not that he has not power, for it is said that he has the might of death; not that he had, but that he has; he is not without power, and he is active in the use of what he has, especially in relation to what God is doing.<a name=192:9></a> These meetings, thank God now so numerous, occasion special activity on Satan's part; for we learn in the Old Testament that as God would take Joshua the high priest and clothe him with festival-robes, removing the filthy ones, Satan was there to resist Him.<a name=192:10></a> And so it is that in what God is doing.<a name=192:11></a> Satan is active -- a very solemn consideration!<a name=192:12></a> -- a consideration that should induce prayerfulness with regard to all the service of God, that the enemy, as in the days of Job, as he goes up with the sons of God, should be rebuked; as it is said, "The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee".<a name=192:13></a> We may reckon on that at every meeting, but it should induce intense care

		Christendom is in a general way the evidence of the last great phase of his works -- not being able to obliterate the testimony in the early christians, for they endured, thank God; they suffered, they would not give up the truth, and therefore they founded the assembly, so to speak; they founded it immutably.<a name=193:2></a> God did it through them.<a name=193:3></a> Being unable to obliterate or root up what was thus established by God, he set about to corrupt.<a name=193:4></a> So that in reading the early history of the assembly it is painful to observe the rapid decline from apostolic times, the rapidity with which the truth and the testimony were dragged down and corrupted.<a name=193:5></a> The Spirit of God foresaw this in the apostles' times.<a name=193:6></a> They were energetic in foreseeing and preparing the saints for the attack, so that Paul says to the Corinthians, "If any one corrupt the temple of God, <i>him</i> shall God destroy", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:17">1 Corinthians  3:17</a>.<a name=193:7></a> Strong word!<a name=193:8></a> But the corruption has gone on, so that we see abroad a huge system -- we speak of it as system -- corrupted.<a name=193:9></a> And now the question is how the undoing of this is to proceed and whether we have a part in that, whether we see what God is doing.<a name=193:10></a> It is a question of the Son of God, the manifestation of the Son of God: "To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil".<a name=193:11></a> It is a question of how the work of the devil, this widespread work of the devil, is to be undone.<a name=193:12></a> It is not that God is setting it aside in a public way, it will be presently; but it is a question of how it is undone in a moral sense now, so that we escape its consequences -- at least so as to worship God.<a name=193:13></a> Now it is a matter of the profoundest importance, dear brethren, how this extensive, elaborative work of the devil, his masterpiece indeed, is to be undone.<a name=193:14></a> It is a great thing to have a part in this service.<a name=193:15></a> It is for us to have part in it, because there is nothing God has more interest in

		than to bring His people into the thing that He is doing, like Jonathan who wrought with God on one particular day: he and another undertook to do something which meant the undoing of Saul's folly, the consequences of it.<a name=194:1></a> He wrought with God on one day; and that is the thing Paul suggests in addressing the Corinthians, that very thing -- we are fellow-workers of God, otherwise we shall be contravening what He is doing; for the Lord says as to the principle: "He that gathers not with me scatters", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:30">Matthew  12:30</a>.<a name=194:2></a> We must be <i>with</i> Him.<a name=194:3></a> And so, to illustrate this, you will all remember the woman of whom Luke writes, who was bent over for eighteen years -- a well known incident.<a name=194:4></a> I refer to it now because one has seen persons, known of persons amongst us, nominally so, not really, who had been eighteen years under the influence of some work of the devil, some wrong principle -- I will say no more; and they went back to it when they might have been straightened, made to stand upright and worship God, children of Abraham.<a name=194:5></a> They went back.<a name=194:6></a> That is a sorrowful consideration, because the undoing of the work of the devil is to be permanent or it is not done at all.<a name=194:7></a> What the Son of God does is done, and done for ever.<a name=194:8></a> There is no record that that woman ever became bent over again; not but what there are instances in the Lord's service where the moral effect of His gracious service seemed shallow, as in the case of the man at the pool of Bethesda.<a name=194:9></a> The Lord said to him when He raised him up, "Sin no more".<a name=194:10></a> That meant He was not sure of him; He had no confidence in the man.<a name=194:11></a> And also the woman in this 8th chapter, He said the same thing to her, "Sin no more".<a name=194:12></a> It is a solemn thing to receive benefit in this way, to find the work of the devil in some way undone, and yet to sin again.<a name=194:13></a> A worse thing comes upon us.<a name=194:14></a> I refer to that in a practical way, dear brethren, because my object here tonight is to show how that the undoing of the works of the devil by the Son of God, is done; it is a perfect, permanent thing.<a name=194:15></a>

		Well now, John, as I said, brings in the Son of God, and that is what has been emphasized for several years -- the Son of God.<a name=195:3></a> So that in speaking with our brethren in various systems (if we are to come in for the undoing, if they are to come in for the undoing of the works of the devil) nothing can be more helpful initially than to ask them, 'What do you think about Christ?<a name=195:4></a>' The Lord raised that question even with His followers.<a name=195:5></a> He raises it with every one of His followers, I am sure.<a name=195:6></a> He says "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?<a name=195:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:13">Matthew  16:13</a>.<a name=195:8></a> Well, some said that He was this one and that one of the servants of God of the Old Testament, such as Jeremiah or one of the prophets, but He says, "Who do ye say that I am?<a name=195:9></a>" for that is what everything hinges on.<a name=195:10></a> Without the knowledge of the Person we must be defective, nor shall we stand without it; as He says to the disciples in another place, "Will ye also go away?<a name=195:11></a>" There has been a certain drift here, to be simple and practical, in this region, it was a going away, "Will ye also go away?<a name=195:12></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:67">John  6:67</a>.<a name=195:13></a> The Lord would challenge us.<a name=195:14></a> I remember receiving a letter from a brother once who was questioned as to some conduct of his, some reprehensible conduct, and he sat down and wrote a letter, and said, 'I withdraw from fellowship'.<a name=195:15></a> What fellowship did he withdraw from?<a name=195:16></a> What did he understand?<a name=195:17></a> What are you withdrawing from?<a name=195:18></a> If you use the word fellowship -- the scriptural use of the word is that it is the fellowship of God's Son -- are you withdrawing from that?<a name=195:19></a> If he said that the fellowship is not that fellowship and I cannot go on, it would be quite intelligent and commendable.<a name=195:20></a> But he says, 'I withdraw from fellowship'.<a name=195:21></a> There is always a cause, and it is not always given; the real root cause is not always stated.<a name=195:22></a>

		These scriptures present to us the maternal idea which has great significance in the mind of God, and which most believers understand, and hence the loss as in the churches of Galatia, one idea being that the mother, as the wife, is trustworthy and is counted upon to look after the affairs of the husband in his absence.<a name=204:1></a> At all times, of course, but there is no need of accentuating the idea when he is present.<a name=204:2></a> It is always there, but it is in the absence of Christ that the mother feature is emphasised, and the absence of it became apparent in the assemblies of Galatia.<a name=204:3></a> Whilst the apostle was there he was professedly greatly valued; they would have plucked out their eyes to give them to him, and they received him as an angel of God; he represented the authority of Christ among them, but in his absence the mother spirit failed.<a name=204:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mother spirit is presented typically in Sarah.<a name=204:5></a> It is that spirit which pervades the assemblies that would discern in detail the activities of the bond-slave -- of Hagar and her son.<a name=204:6></a> The gatherings of the saints are exposed in that whilst there may be full recognition of government and even leadership, all goes well while such are present and in action, but in their absence there is want of the acceptance of responsibility to care for the Lord's interests.<a name=204:7></a> There is the absence of vigilance, not in certain distinguished ones in the gatherings, but in all forming the gatherings, so that all working of the flesh is not discerned and is allowed to work until those who have the special ability to deal with it reappear.<a name=204:8></a> There should be the dealing with it promptly, for, although the gatherings of the saints may be wanting in individuals of moral power, there is always the opportunity of recourse to prayer and the resolve that this must not be.<a name=204:9></a> If I cannot deal with it, it must not be; the Lord can and will.<a name=204:10></a>

		So that in Sarah we have the great initial idea, and first in her faith.<a name=205:1></a> She is reckoned as having faith in regard to the birth of Isaac.<a name=205:2></a> If we have faith as regards the work of God in our localities, we shall appraise the result of it.<a name=205:3></a> Even although it be a weak brother he must not be destroyed; he is valuable in our eyes.<a name=205:4></a> Faith understands at what cost he has been brought about, and so Sarah being vigilant discerned the mocking.<a name=205:5></a> Ishmael was not persecuting Isaac corporally; he was not striking him; there was no evidence of that.<a name=205:6></a> What he was doing might pass without notice by an unspiritual eye.<a name=205:7></a> It might be a matter to be passed over as of little or no consequence, but not so with a true mother.<a name=205:8></a> Fleshly elements springing up, especially amongst the young, are passed over very often by the unspiritual, but not by the spiritual.<a name=205:9></a> I could perhaps enumerate evidences of it more or less present in every gathering represented here.<a name=205:10></a> Whereas the true Sarah would discern it at once.<a name=205:11></a> It is the element of the mother in regard of the saints viewed in their infancy, as I may say; not viewed according to the relative value of infants, but according to the mind of God about them.<a name=205:12></a> Isaac is viewed by Sarah in the light of the mind of God, and it makes an immense difference whether I view a believer according to his stature and spiritual power or whether I view him potentially.<a name=205:13></a>

		The weaning time had come, the weaning time of Isaac -- the child of promise, that is, a child previously spoken of, a child spoken of prophetically, and every one of us has been previously spoken of.<a name=205:14></a> How far back I cannot tell, but we have been previously spoken of, our very names have been matters of counsel.<a name=205:15></a> It is as viewing the saints thus that their potentialities become great, for we have all been previously spoken of in relation to counsel.<a name=205:16></a> Hence his value, and we cannot afford to have him damaged; we cannot afford to have such persecuted, for Ishmael was persecuting the child born after the Spirit.<a name=205:17></a> Isaac had been previously spoken of, and he was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Sarah saw.<a name=206:5></a> It does not say that Abraham saw.<a name=206:6></a> Abraham is the specially responsible side, the father, but the mother is with the children all the time.<a name=206:7></a> That is the principle.<a name=206:8></a> She knows them from the very outset, she sees all that happens, and she must not disclaim responsibility.<a name=206:9></a> Let no one assume irresponsibility if anything dishonouring is seen.<a name=206:10></a> We cannot say it belongs to the elder brethren.<a name=206:11></a> I am responsible, even if they do not see, and if I see I act, and God respects my action.<a name=206:12></a> This mother principle brings all into responsibility and consequent vigilance, and not only vigilance, but action based on vigilance, based on what is seen.<a name=206:13></a> So that Sarah says, "Cast out this handmaid and her son".<a name=206:14></a> Ishmael is not to "inherit with my son".<a name=206:15></a> If things are to continue according to God, all that is of the flesh in its activities must be expunged in the gatherings of the saints.<a name=206:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find in regard of Jacob afterwards that Esau himself has to recognise that he obeyed.<a name=208:11></a> You may depend upon it, the secret of promotion in the service of God is obedience, not only to the father but to the mother.<a name=208:12></a> Esau had to recognise afterwards that Jacob "had obeyed his father and his mother", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:7">Genesis  28:7</a>.<a name=208:13></a> There can be no promotion in the service of God aside from subjection, not only to the Lord but to the brethren.<a name=208:14></a> For that is the idea -- submission to the brethren.<a name=208:15></a> "Submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:21">Ephesians  5:21</a>.<a name=208:16></a> It is the way to promotion; if there is to be effective service there has to be obedience to the father and to the mother.<a name=208:17></a> When I say the father, I refer to divine authority, whether it be in Christ or in others here, those who represent Christ; but when I speak of the mother, it is a subjective thought, what there is in all the saints, whether locally or generally.<a name=208:18></a> So that Esau has to own that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother.<a name=208:19></a> That is the way the matter stands in regard of the saints, viewed individually first in their infancy spiritually, and then in their grown-up relations, when the time has come for them to be taken up to be distinguished, to receive the blessing.<a name=208:20></a>

		you how this principle extends from individuals to the general position -- "a mother in Israel".<a name=209:1></a> A mother in Israel is more than a mother in a local meeting.<a name=209:2></a> She is universal, that is to say, it is when the saints become enlarged and begin to think of things universally, of all the interests of Christ on earth.<a name=209:3></a> In speaking thus one is reminded of what one observes in attending meetings for prayer.<a name=209:4></a> It is one's privilege to attend many meetings, perhaps more prayer-meetings than many brethren attend, and it is in the prayer-meeting that this mother spirit is seen.<a name=209:5></a> It is there you begin to feel the power of it, and what one longs for is to see more expansion, prayers inclusive of all the interests of Christ on earth, for that is the idea of a mother in Israel.<a name=209:6></a> There is only one Israel, and that is the "Israel of God".<a name=209:7></a> I have no doubt the apostle had that in mind when he said to the Galatians "Peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God", chapter 6: 16.<a name=209:8></a> That is a spiritual thought.<a name=209:9></a> Our prayer-meetings should exhibit the spirit of the mother in relation to the Israel of God.<a name=209:10></a> That is to say, a saint in the Antipodes is as valuable to Christ as a saint in this country; he is of the "Israel of God".<a name=209:11></a> We do not want to make saints inferior to one another because of their geographical position; that has nothing to do with our value or our place in the counsels of God or in the testimony down here.<a name=209:12></a> Some may occupy the outposts.<a name=209:13></a> How much do we think of the brethren who under the will of God are driven out into isolation, unprotected by the fellowship and society of their brethren, but they are of great interest to heaven.<a name=209:14></a> They deserve our prayers; if we are mothers in Israel we shall pray for them; they belong to Israel.<a name=209:15></a>

		LAYING DOWN OUR LIVES FOR THE BRETHREN

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read somewhat lengthily, but it is necessary in order to bring forward certain thoughts with reference to the brethren, as to whether they are regarded as worth while laying down our lives for.<a name=250:1></a> Their worth is obviously to be established, and John's epistle sets out the intrinsic value of the brethren: that is, they are born of God and so partakers of the divine nature; so much so that the writer of the epistle says that if one does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God, whom he has not seen -- a simple statement, but of immense import as to the value of the brethren.<a name=250:2></a> They are products of the divine nature, and if one does not love <i>that</i> in a brother, he will not love it in God.<a name=250:3></a> So that a brother-hater is a God-hater.<a name=250:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what should be kept in mind in reading John's epistle.<a name=250:5></a> He is not dealing with externals, but with intrinsic worth, going so far as to say, "Even as <i>he</i> is, <i>we</i> also are in this world".<a name=250:6></a> The saints are thus peculiarly precious to God.<a name=250:7></a> In the midst of this world, marked as it is by hideous corruption, the saints, as manifesting His holy nature, are like refreshing green in His eye.<a name=250:8></a> There may be those who are merely called brethren, but that is another matter.<a name=250:9></a> There are those who cast stones at the real ones.<a name=250:10></a> And so the idea of the <i>Jew</i> enters into this, and I desire to work out that thought in Esther, linking it with the significance of the name of Jew as seen in the New Testament.<a name=250:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we take the gospel of John, it is a term that denotes religious opposition.<a name=250:12></a> But then the apostle Paul has clarified the name, so that it has real worth.<a name=250:13></a> He says, "he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, .<a name=250:14></a>.<a name=250:15></a>.<a name=250:16></a> but he is a Jew who is so inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart,

		in spirit, not in letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2:28">Romans  2:28</a>, 29.<a name=251:1></a> I am not speaking of literal Jews but rather of professed christians.<a name=251:2></a> For the Lord, in addressing Philadelphia, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>, speaks of them as such, "Who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie".<a name=251:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, what I have said indicates the idea of the Jew in the mind of God and I wish to work it out through the book of Esther.<a name=251:4></a> It is exemplified in Mordecai, that is, one who lays down his life for the brethren; indeed, in this he is a leader.<a name=251:5></a> There are many senses in which we may be leaders, and Mordecai is a leader in laying down his life for the brethren.<a name=251:6></a> In a striking way he leads another; I refer to Esther, who, being a woman, represents more than herself; she represents the subjective principle, that is, the capability of being led; and led on to actual surrender of herself for the brethren.<a name=251:7></a> The youngest here can enter into this, for Hadassah is a young person as she is introduced to us, and one capable of being influenced by another in the right direction.<a name=251:8></a> We are all capable of being influenced in the wrong direction; it is a thing to be watched, even by older ones, that we may not come under influences that are inimical to fellowship, the peace of the brethren and the progress of our own souls; that we see to it that our companionship is wholesome, for if I company with a person who is stronger minded, and he or she has unwholesome proclivities, I shall certainly be damaged, for "evil communications corrupt good manners", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:33">1 Corinthians  15:33</a>.<a name=251:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Mordecai was a Jew.<a name=251:10></a> That is how he is introduced to us; and, so that there should be no mistake as to his genuineness, we get his pedigree.<a name=251:11></a> Pedigree has a great place in Scripture.<a name=251:12></a> It has a considerable place among men, too, but in Scripture it has a spiritual significance; it means that I establish my genuineness as a believer.<a name=251:13></a> I must do that, or the brethren are sure to be chary of me.<a name=251:14></a> It is extremely difficult to determine some,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and so the apostle Peter stands out in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>in his discernment, which is one of the scarcest things among the people of God; the discerning of good and evil is rare, and especially when we have to do with persons of 'education'; they may elude our sensibility unless we are much with God in prayer.<a name=252:1></a> Simon was detected by Peter, who says, "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter".<a name=252:2></a> What those who seek to keep the Lord's commandments are going on with is very great, whatever the opinion of men may be.<a name=252:3></a> Nehemiah said, "I am doing a great work", and it is a sorrowful thing if anyone is found with neither part nor lot in it.<a name=252:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the Holy Spirit gives us the genealogy of this man: he is a real Jew, and would measure up with the apostle's requirements.<a name=252:5></a> He was a Jew inwardly, and the first feature is that he looks after his relative, a cousin.<a name=252:6></a> Not that our brethren who are not walking with us are only our cousins; although in a <i>practical</i> way, many among them are such and removed even five or six times!<a name=252:7></a> Esther was Mordecai's near cousin, and her father and mother had died.<a name=252:8></a> It refers to spiritual condition: a person bereft of protection.<a name=252:9></a> She was left fatherless and motherless, but she had a cousin, and he proved to be "a brother .<a name=252:10></a>.<a name=252:11></a>.<a name=252:12></a> born for adversity", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#17:17">Proverbs  17:17</a>.<a name=252:13></a> He behaves himself towards this relative becomingly, which is an important matter, indeed it is a feature of the book of Esther, that all things are done in a seemly way.<a name=252:14></a> The book teaches us spiritual seemliness, so that we may know how to behave ourselves in certain circumstances.<a name=252:15></a> External circumstances are constantly varying, so we must know how to act.<a name=252:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The name of God is not mentioned in this book, indicating that certain conditions among the people of God necessitate that He cannot openly identify Himself with them.<a name=252:17></a> As we shall see, Mordecai and Esther recognise this and behave accordingly.<a name=252:18></a> Things are to be done in a seemly way, as determined by the attitude

		Comparison of the thoughts of the sea and the laver in 1 Kings, with what we find in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#19">Numbers  19</a>, brings out the difference between what exists in the assembly viewed in its heavenly relations and what is provided for its members in the wilderness.<a name=268:1></a> In the former we have volume -- the sea "held two thousand baths", and the ten lavers each "contained forty baths;" the sea is stationary, the lavers are movable.<a name=268:2></a> Both the sea and the bases which sustain the lavers convey the thought of great ornamentation -- richness of thought and feeling, love in the administration of cleansing; whereas in Numbers, instead of quantity we have running water; it is living, active, and we have ashes; the running water is put upon them for cleansing.<a name=268:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Consideration of these matters will perhaps help us, especially in seaside resorts such as this where we are now.<a name=268:4></a> Numbers has to do with our external movements, so we have much made of <i>death</i> -- a dead man, a dead bone -- and the need for cleanness because of defilement from these -- not so much holiness as cleanness; we cannot have holiness without cleanness, but cleanness is not such a strong thought as holiness, but it precedes holiness.<a name=268:5></a> The latter stands in connection with our inward state and the other with our outward actions.<a name=268:6></a> The ashes are not said to be in a holy place, but in a clean place.<a name=268:7></a> A clean man looks after the ashes: "they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel", verse 17.<a name=268:8></a> The priestly side is recognised in the beginning.<a name=268:9></a> The teaching here generally applies to the believer in his outward relations, and our outward movements should be kept clean enough not to interfere with our enjoyment in the place of privilege.<a name=268:10></a> It does not call so much for special spirituality; it is teaching intended to be

		Peter appropriated this means of cleansing in his own experience -- when he remembered the word of the Lord he went out and wept bitterly.<a name=270:20></a> Mark tells us this.<a name=270:21></a> The Lord did not look on Peter in Mark.<a name=270:22></a> The <i>word</i> affected him.<a name=270:23></a> Any of us should be able to remember the word when we get defiled.<a name=270:24></a> In this chapter God graciously makes things convenient for a low state of spirituality.<a name=270:25></a> You can act for yourself and judge yourself at once even when there is no priest available.<a name=270:26></a> Thus the ashes are just in a clean place, not in the tabernacle.<a name=270:27></a>

		In the eighth chapter of Proverbs where God's operations are enlarged on, it says wisdom was there.<a name=277:4></a> The morning stars and the sons of God say nothing about man.<a name=277:5></a> Wisdom does.<a name=277:6></a> Wisdom carries the thought on and speaks anticipatively of the actual realisation of the divine thought, in that it says my "delights were with the sons of men".<a name=277:7></a> You see, dear brethren, what a note of intelligent jubilance runs through.<a name=277:8></a> Wisdom was occupied particularly with the habitable parts of the earth.<a name=277:9></a> It was speaking anticipatively, showing that it was in the divine mind to have intelligent beings in the habitable parts of God's earth, and that its delights were with the <i>sons</i> of men.<a name=277:10></a>

		You can see, therefore, beloved brethren, how John's gospel fits in with all that.<a name=277:11></a> It is stated there that by Him who was in the beginning, all things were made that were made, and that without Him not one thing was made; all had being through the Word, and whilst that is asserted, what is in view immediately is man, and hence the statement, "In him was life; and the life was the light of men".<a name=277:12></a> That is to say, the true Light.<a name=277:13></a> Not that the light previously referred to is not true of its kind.<a name=277:14></a> Physical light, of course, is true -- the sun and whatever other light there may be in the physical system -- but it refers here to the true or perfect light for men, that it was something that should become substantive; not merely an abstract thought, but something here within man's range; something that men could touch, and so it says, "In him was life; and the life was the light of men".<a name=277:15></a> So as to prepare our minds for the thought, we have to dismiss all earlier conceptions of light, for hitherto light had dispelled darkness, so that darkness was driven by it into its own area, and a name given to it.<a name=277:16></a> The light He called day, the darkness was dispelled by it.<a name=277:17></a>

		Here, however, we have introduced to our minds an entirely new thought, that the true light appears in darkness and the darkness comprehends it not; that moreover witness has to be made to it, in the person of John the Baptist.<a name=278:1></a> No one needs to call attention to the sun as it shines in the heavens.<a name=278:2></a> It is there; nothing is hidden from its heat.<a name=278:3></a> Its light goes out throughout all the earth, and its rays negative the darkness, so that in its presence, darkness ceases.<a name=278:4></a> Now a new thought has to be apprehended, and we are told the light shines "in darkness", and that the darkness does not comprehend it.<a name=278:5></a> Attention has been called to it.<a name=278:6></a> We are told immediately, "There was a man sent from God".<a name=278:7></a> This is not historical, it is moral.<a name=278:8></a> It is a man that was with God, for he was with Him, and was sent as from "with him".<a name=278:9></a> He came for a witness to the light.<a name=278:10></a> He was not it, the Spirit tells us, although the Lord later pays such a beautiful tribute to John in saying that he was a burning and a shining light or lamp, which is more local and limited in thought.<a name=278:11></a> He burned and he shone.<a name=278:12></a> You can see that as those Pharisees came to him to be baptised, how he burned, as he called them a generation of vipers.<a name=278:13></a> He would wither them up.<a name=278:14></a> But the light was there.<a name=278:15></a> They rejoiced for a season in his light, it says, but it was local and national, for after all, John was for the sons of Israel.<a name=278:16></a>

		Now that is what I understand to be the application of this passage.<a name=284:16></a> You are following the Lord; having moved out of the world, and in moving with Him you have "the light of life".<a name=284:17></a> A living state of things exists in your soul.<a name=284:18></a> One has often pictured pioneers in the Western Continent.<a name=284:19></a> They are concerned about "the light of life" in a material way.<a name=284:20></a> They avoid the deserts and seek the rivers.<a name=284:21></a> They have colonised on the St.<a name=284:22></a> Lawrence, the Potomac, the St.<a name=284:23></a> James, and so forth, and as they went westward the question of how they should live was ever before them.<a name=284:24></a> So in every new country.<a name=284:25></a> It is a question of life.<a name=284:26></a> Vegetable life in this sense, I need hardly say, is of all moment to such men.<a name=284:27></a> So it is now.<a name=284:28></a> What lines am I pursuing?<a name=284:29></a> I do not go into the desert to live.<a name=284:30></a> I may be there in the government of God, to bring me down to nothing.<a name=284:31></a> My affections, my needs lead me to where the people of God are.<a name=284:32></a> How may I find them?<a name=284:33></a> Where the life is?<a name=284:34></a> Wherever the Spirit is there is life; "the Spirit is life", we are told.<a name=284:35></a> You see the fruits of it there among the saints.<a name=284:36></a> Oh, you

		I want to show in closing that all this is involved in the new commandment.<a name=285:12></a> In John's epistle, the apostle deals with life; something very tangible, as you will observe in the beginning.<a name=285:13></a> It was what his hands had handled, what he had seen and heard.<a name=285:14></a> It was no abstract thing of which John was speaking.<a name=285:15></a> It was substantive; to be seen and felt in a living Person.<a name=285:16></a> If this Person who was the Light went and dwelt in Capernaum, what a thing it would be to live next door to Him, He was light there.<a name=285:17></a> John is dealing with that.<a name=285:18></a> Now he says, "I write no new commandment unto you, but an old".<a name=285:19></a> It was lest anyone should think that the old was being discarded.<a name=285:20></a> The old surely was as much of God as the new; whatever ministry has been received earlier, it could not possibly be displaced by new.<a name=285:21></a> John's ministry was of God.<a name=285:22></a> The Lord challenges the Jews as to it.<a name=285:23></a> It was of God, but it was not the true light.<a name=285:24></a> No ministry that is of God can be discarded, however ancient.<a name=285:25></a> It has its own value; it stands, but then it may not be everything, "I write no new commandment unto you, but an old", so as to emphasise that the old stood.<a name=285:26></a> What was the old?<a name=285:27></a> The word which they had heard, which was from the beginning; no doubt, the ministry of Christ from the outset, the word which they had heard.<a name=285:28></a> It was not to

		Then he says in the next verse, "Again, a new commandment I write unto you".<a name=286:6></a> What is this?<a name=286:7></a> Why!<a name=286:8></a> it is a new one.<a name=286:9></a> That is the whole point.<a name=286:10></a> The new commandment, it says, is true in Him and in you.<a name=286:11></a> Are you afraid of being occupied with that?<a name=286:12></a> Do not be afraid.<a name=286:13></a> If you have not this verse, you have not the true light.<a name=286:14></a> The new commandment is what is true in Him and in you, that is in Christ and in us.<a name=286:15></a> And then he says "because".<a name=286:16></a> That word "because" is confirmatory.<a name=286:17></a> What he is going to say proves it, "The true light now shineth".<a name=286:18></a> It was shining, and it was obvious therefore that the true light, true in Christ, had expelled the darkness by becoming true in the saints by the Spirit.<a name=286:19></a> Marvellous fact!<a name=286:20></a> Is that going to end?<a name=286:21></a> Not at all.<a name=286:22></a> That is going on.<a name=286:23></a> What has become true in us has come into this world, and has come to stay.<a name=286:24></a> The true light is shining, and the darkness is passing.<a name=286:25></a> This verse is simple christianity, and anyone who does not accustom himself to the new commandment, to the principle of the new commandment, must miss it.<a name=286:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read this passage in Hebrews hoping to amplify it and make it applicable at the present time in a forceful way from the passages in Nehemiah and Zechariah.<a name=288:1></a> The fact that the writer to the Hebrews is obliged to enjoin that the saints should not forsake the assembling of themselves together reminds us of the tendency to do so.<a name=288:2></a> The date of the epistle was comparatively near the brightest period of the church's history.<a name=288:3></a> The Jewish christians had the greatest ministry -- that of those who had been the immediate companions of the Lord, who were "eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word", the Holy Spirit as having just come actuating them.<a name=288:4></a> They were the immediate handiwork of the Lord, having been with Him before His death and after He rose, especially the period of His sojourn of forty days down here in which they had most marvellous experiences; and then the incoming of the Spirit from heaven -- all occasioned a ministry of peculiar excellence and freshness.<a name=288:5></a> The christians addressed in the epistle to the Hebrews were the product of that ministry; so that they are enjoined to remember their leaders that spoke the word of the Lord.<a name=288:6></a> Others were still alive amongst them, whom they were to obey; yet they had to be enjoined not to forsake the assembling of themselves together.<a name=288:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I have this in mind because of the prevalence of absenteeism from our gatherings.<a name=288:8></a> The Lord would convey to us that He has given us to each other.<a name=288:9></a> He has selected us for Himself.<a name=288:10></a> The assembly is for Christ and for God, but we are also for each other; and that should be a powerful incentive to our assembling ourselves together.<a name=288:11></a> The Lord assembles us, too, for the assembly is His.<a name=288:12></a> But there is the assembling of ourselves together; the Lord has given the saints to each other and we are

		to be respected mutually.<a name=289:1></a> The saints are worthy of respect.<a name=289:2></a> Were heaven to call attention to us, it would say something distinctive about each of us, and that would be an incentive for mutual respect and affection among us.<a name=289:3></a> There is great variety resulting from the work of God, and this is calculated to draw us together.<a name=289:4></a> It will be a feature in heaven.<a name=289:5></a> Some of you may recall that when Abraham was shown the land of promise, there were no saints named.<a name=289:6></a> He saw it from the level -- north, south, east, and west; but Moses was shown it from mount Pisgah, and what he was shown was the territory of the saints -- where the saints should be, the positions of certain of the tribes being mentioned.<a name=289:7></a> Heaven with God, heaven with Christ, heaven with the angels, heaven with the Holy Spirit, of course, but <i>heaven with the saints</i>.<a name=289:8></a> So that the gathering of the saints implies that we love each other and hence there is enjoyment; enjoyment not to be found elsewhere.<a name=289:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show from Nehemiah how this worked out in a remnant period, corresponding to the one we are in.<a name=289:10></a> We are in remnant times, and this book is intended to instruct us, both by direct teaching and by example, how to avail ourselves of what is available, however small and despicable outwardly; to avail ourselves of it and make the most of it.<a name=289:11></a> And so that the thought should be stressed, Nehemiah makes much in his opening words of <i>Jerusalem</i>.<a name=289:12></a> It caused him tears.<a name=289:13></a> I speak of Jerusalem as representing the assembly.<a name=289:14></a> That is how it should be regarded.<a name=289:15></a> The gospel of Matthew treats of the assembly transitionally.<a name=289:16></a> It shows how the testimony and all the interests of God merged from Jerusalem into the assembly.<a name=289:17></a> In that gospel Jerusalem is called the city of the great King -- the Holy City, but it is the gospel that presents the assembly; the only gospel in which the assembly is directly mentioned, and the first mention of it is the well-known passage from the Lord's mouth, "on this rock I will build my

		assembly".<a name=290:1></a> <i>My</i> assembly.<a name=290:2></a> Now every lover of Christ must think of that -- what the Lord stressed in that way -- <i>My</i> assembly.<a name=290:3></a> And as I learn what it means in any little way, then I see that I am of it, for every true christian, every one who has the Spirit of God is a member of it.<a name=290:4></a> How then am I found?<a name=290:5></a> How do I regard it?<a name=290:6></a> If it has passed out of view in its original pristine glory here, how am I to regard it today?<a name=290:7></a> Does it exist concretely at all?<a name=290:8></a> Is it reachable?<a name=290:9></a> These are the questions that normally arise in every heart that loves Christ.<a name=290:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I said, Jerusalem in this book answers to the assembly.<a name=290:11></a> I may say, prefigures it, and Nehemiah may be taken as representative of every heart that is loyal to God and to Christ as regards His assembly.<a name=290:12></a> In Nehemiah's day Jerusalem was in ruins, causing him the profoundest sorrow.<a name=290:13></a> So he visits Jerusalem, "the city", he says, "of my father's sepulchres".<a name=290:14></a> We are not occupied with sepulchres now, but with what is living.<a name=290:15></a> The assembly represents what is living; it is "the assembly of the living God".<a name=290:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nehemiah arrives at Jerusalem and he tells us what God had put into his heart to do there.<a name=290:17></a> A person into whose heart God has put things is most interesting.<a name=290:18></a> He puts His love in our hearts by the Spirit, and this leads normally to the assembly.<a name=290:19></a> Nehemiah speaks of what God had put in his heart, to do for Jerusalem.<a name=290:20></a> What am I doing for Jerusalem?<a name=290:21></a> If you read the book you will find that Jerusalem is the great thought.<a name=290:22></a> What is there in my heart to do for it?<a name=290:23></a> Men who challenge themselves thus, God will take up and make useful.<a name=290:24></a> See what Nehemiah did.<a name=290:25></a> In the first passage he says, "the wall was <i>built</i>"; that is, there is a man that undertakes to do something and <i>finishes</i> it.<a name=290:26></a> And it was done under great pressure; the enemy attacked the workers, so that they had to hold the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other.<a name=290:27></a> But the passage read in chapter 7 says the wall was built.<a name=290:28></a> It says, "when the wall was built, and I had

		set up the doors, that the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed".<a name=291:1></a> I speak thus of Nehemiah because he is a model for us in our time -- a man who takes things up of himself.<a name=291:2></a> You say, I have no gift, but there is not a word about Nehemiah having a gift, nor is he said to be sent.<a name=291:3></a> He came to Jerusalem -- his heart being pressed because of its condition; and the walls were built.<a name=291:4></a> It is a question of what each of us is doing.<a name=291:5></a> Am I feeling the state of the assembly?<a name=291:6></a> And when I undertake to do something, do I finish it?<a name=291:7></a> Here the wall was built.<a name=291:8></a>

		Then the next thing is that the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.<a name=291:9></a> Now we have an order of things involving security.<a name=291:10></a> We have men that will watch so that no false brother will get in unawares to spy out our liberty.<a name=291:11></a> Those are the porters.<a name=291:12></a> And we have the singers -- those who praise God in song and will also entertain us; men that will make the place attractive, men and women that will sing the songs of Zion <i>in Zion</i> -- not in a foreign land.<a name=291:13></a> And then we have the Levites -- burden bearers, men who are there to serve us.<a name=291:14></a> That is their business -- united to the priest to serve with him.<a name=291:15></a> Is all this going to be attractive?<a name=291:16></a> Or is it an order of things that is so little in my eyes that because it rains I will sit in my house rather than walk half a mile to have part in it?<a name=291:17></a> That is how this book tests us.<a name=291:18></a>

		Nehemiah goes on: "I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many".<a name=291:19></a> Now, these are men that you can count upon.<a name=291:20></a> Would you not like to meet these two men, Hanani (he is Nehemiah's brother) and Hananiah?<a name=291:21></a> Where you get the brother of a man that typifies Christ in any way you have the idea of brethren presented in an attractive way.<a name=291:22></a> Aaron was Moses' brother; he was glad in his heart when he saw his brother.<a name=291:23></a> He is one of the brethren.<a name=291:24></a> Thus the brethren would be represented in these two men,

		Nehemiah further says: "I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them, and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house".<a name=292:16></a> Surely with all this care and provision generally.<a name=292:17></a> Jerusalem is going to be full of people!<a name=292:18></a> The apostle Paul for instance was the great servant of Christ, yet he stresses the fact that <i>one</i> man came to Rome and sought him out diligently and found him, <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:16">2 Timothy  1:16</a> - 18.<a name=292:19></a> You would think every saint who had opportunity would go to see him, but his warm appreciation of the visit of Onesiphorus indicates that very few did it.<a name=292:20></a> And so Nehemiah has to say here mournfully, "Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not

		My remarks will bear on the human mind, how it is affected for good or for evil, particularly for good, and how the word of God is intended to affect it.<a name=297:1></a> The word of God as such is specially stressed in the ministry at Corinth, whether orally or in the written form.<a name=297:2></a> The soil there was divinely selected for the divine sowing; it was no accident, for Corinth represents mankind in its cultivation, and, corresponding with this, secret wickedness, for education tends to wickedness, skilfully concealed.<a name=297:3></a> In the Lord's service, no one should assume that public conditions must of necessity forbid the work of God; the work of God goes on and He selects His own soil for His sowing, as well as His own battleground.<a name=297:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:11">Acts  18:11</a> stress is laid upon the word of God, not simply that it was preached, but that it was <i>taught</i>.<a name=297:5></a> Now I refer to this because of the current operations of the enemy through our minds, and especially the youth amongst us.<a name=297:6></a> He selects the mind, knowing that if the mind is secured the will may act and continue acting, but carefully veiled.<a name=297:7></a>

		Before proceeding in regard of Corinthians, I desire to illustrate this from Genesis.<a name=298:2></a> In this chapter in Genesis we are in the presence of the believer representing all believers, for Abraham is called the father of us all, that is, all who believe; and it is in this chapter that he is specifically said to have believed God.<a name=298:3></a> The apostle Paul cites it, saying, "Abraham believed God" -- a very great matter for young christians to face, because, in principle, this is the young christians' chapter; not indeed as called out, but as progressing and standing out against the temptations of the world.<a name=298:4></a> The world, in the king of Sodom, was ready to honour and enrich Abraham, but he refused.<a name=298:5></a> So you find in this chapter the first reference in the Scriptures to the word of God.<a name=298:6></a> Not that the word of God had not been spoken, but it is here in its formal statement twice over for the first time in the Scriptures, corresponding with Corinthians.<a name=298:7></a> "After these things", we read in the first verse of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>, that is, after the chapter in which Christ comes in to support the believer in his conflicts and to furnish him against the seductions of the world.<a name=298:8></a> Abram triumphed in these two settings, and "after these things" God proceeded with his education.<a name=298:9></a> We find in this chapter that very important formula, "the word of Jehovah".<a name=298:10></a> God was now dealing with Abram the believer on the principle that there was such a thing as the word of Jehovah.<a name=298:11></a> Not that it began at this time, for it began much earlier than man, much earlier than <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>; it began formally, as we are told, in the creation, in the beginning, "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>.<a name=298:12></a>

		There was a Person here who was equal to opening up all that was in the mind of God, able also to unfold it, to make it intelligible to His disciples.<a name=299:1></a> Hence the importance of John's ministry in this sense, that we might understand that there is such a thing as that, not merely as an abstract thought, but in a Person, so that concurrently with our knowledge of the Lord Jesus in His Person He unfolds the mind of God.<a name=299:2></a> How wonderful that there is in the world at the present time the methodical unfolding of the mind of God in the power of the Spirit.<a name=299:3></a> What a range of things is opened up for us to enter into, and the Lord in His grace ready to help us at every point!<a name=299:4></a> As we consider what is said, the Lord gives us understanding in all things.<a name=299:5></a> This ought to have the greatest attraction for us, for in it there is an escape from current importations of knowledge, which indeed, in very great measure, is "false-named knowledge".<a name=299:6></a> Everything that is disclosed is coloured by what is false in the importations of knowledge amongst men, the world of human wisdom.<a name=299:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought I have in mind relates to the circumstances ordered of God for our testing, especially as seen in these three scriptures.<a name=308:1></a> The circumstances are seen in connection with <i>water</i>: first a sea, then a river, and then a well.<a name=308:2></a> Water as a type has a very wide bearing in Scripture.<a name=308:3></a> Each mention has to be understood from the context, for we never really understand Scripture save as we look at it thus; particularly in any reference to water, because it may mean the opposite in one to what it means in another.<a name=308:4></a> For instance, "the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, and whose waters cast up mire and dirt", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#57:20">Isaiah  57:20</a>.<a name=308:5></a> A remarkable figure; the allusion would be to the incessant action of the masses of men, their unsteadiness and their liability to be affected by various influences.<a name=308:6></a> The world as a whole is constantly affected by one influence after another; terrible things are happening and newspapers are spreading it abroad, carrying defilement everywhere.<a name=308:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we have water as seen in the gospels, where it is perhaps more applicable to ourselves.<a name=308:8></a> For instance, in the passage which speaks of the Lord being in the boat and saying, "Let us go over to the other side", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:35">Mark  4:35</a>.<a name=308:9></a> Such a movement always invites Satan's attack, "the other side" meaning another position, which the testimony or the development of the truth requires.<a name=308:10></a> Christendom, with its cathedrals, which has been stationary for a thousand years, never goes to the other side.<a name=308:11></a> It has no idea of making a change to the other side, whereas you find that the Lord is constantly moving from this point to that, not in the sense of unrest and sightseeing, as the word, "Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12:4">Daniel  12:4</a>.<a name=308:12></a> The Lord's word is, "Let us go over to the other side"; and as the

		movement began the enemy attacked.<a name=309:1></a> It is not here a question of mire and dirt, but <i>agitation</i>, and this may mark the saints.<a name=309:2></a> We are capable of being thus affected under these circumstances.<a name=309:3></a> Here are the two elements, wind and water -- it is the wind that causes waves.<a name=309:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to acknowledge that there is scarcely a christian, great as the name of christian is, who is not capable of being affected in this way.<a name=309:5></a> The sea became agitated in Matthew.<a name=309:6></a> Matthew gives one phraseology, Mark another, and Luke another.<a name=309:7></a> Luke says that "they were filled with water, and were in danger"; they were thus affected.<a name=309:8></a> If we apply this to ourselves, all agitation, useless talk, recrimination suggests that we are in danger.<a name=309:9></a> Sometimes a gust comes up and you scarcely know where it comes from; but it is Satan, who is said to be "the prince of the power of the air", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:2">Ephesians  2:2</a>.<a name=309:10></a> The air moving as wind, agitates; disturbing things are spoken, at first it may not be known by whom, but they are spoken, they are passed on, and agitation ensues.<a name=309:11></a> Matthew says, "the ship was <i>covered</i> by the waves"; that was obscured in which Christ was.<a name=309:12></a> Mark says the ship was "already filled", and Luke that "they were filled with water" and that they "were in danger".<a name=309:13></a> There is preservation from all this in manhood according to God, in that maturity and stability that will refuse to be influenced by Satan's ways.<a name=309:14></a>

		In the book of Exodus water has a great place, and the Red Sea stands out in this respect.<a name=309:15></a> Although inland, the Sea of Galilee corresponds to it in the New Testament; properly it is a lake, but the Red Sea <i>is</i> a sea.<a name=309:16></a> I read the passage, not to develop a gospel address out of it, although it is full of gospel matter, but what I have in mind is to bring out this thought of <i>testing</i>.<a name=309:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		This test brought out a great deal of <i>complaining</i>, and other things too, of course.<a name=310:3></a> There was complaint against Moses -- Why did you bring us out of Egypt?<a name=310:4></a> They did not say a word about their bitter sufferings there, these are all ignored; it is the irritability of the flesh, and Moses must suffer.<a name=310:5></a> The irritability of the flesh without control, vents itself in attacking those who in serving God, serve His people.<a name=310:6></a> The christian is enjoined to be under self-control.<a name=310:7></a> Things happen over which I have no control, but I should have control over <i>myself</i>, and not cause others to suffer; otherwise Satan will ruffle me to attack those who serve God, and in this way I may sin against Him.<a name=310:8></a> That is what the children of Israel were doing here.<a name=310:9></a>

		but in the end he says that they were to tell their children that Jehovah "delivered our houses"; not the firstborn only, but the <i>house</i>; the household is stressed.<a name=311:1></a> In many other ways they were cared for most marvellously, and now God tests them.<a name=311:2></a> He told them to "encamp by the sea", and "Pharaoh will say .<a name=311:3></a>.<a name=311:4></a>.<a name=311:5></a> They are entangled in the land, the wilderness has hemmed them in".<a name=311:6></a> By this means God would draw out the enemy as by an ambush.<a name=311:7></a> Jehovah is a Man of war, He caused Pharaoh to be exposed by placing the people there by the sea, but alas!<a name=311:8></a> as in that position, they complained against Moses; they failed in the test.<a name=311:9></a> We are enjoined to obey our leaders and to be in subjection; instead of this they complained.<a name=311:10></a> The passage reads, "And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.<a name=311:11></a> And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?<a name=311:12></a> wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?<a name=311:13></a> Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?<a name=311:14></a> For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#14:10">Exodus  14:10</a> - 12.<a name=311:15></a>

		It is against Moses that they are complaining; later, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, they spoke against God and against Moses, but here it is against Moses.<a name=311:16></a> Think of the man against whom they were speaking, what he had been to them!<a name=311:17></a> The people of Israel were agitated, the enemy was blowing upon them and the waves of complaint were rising.<a name=311:18></a> Moses answers in beautiful grace and is an example to all who are prominent amongst us.<a name=311:19></a> He does not call them rebels here; in verse 13 he says, "Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you today: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for

		So we read that "the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night", verses 19, 20.<a name=312:13></a> That is <i>God</i> dear brethren.<a name=312:14></a> Think of the angel going round from their front to a position behind them!<a name=312:15></a> That is divine love, He did not do that because of their murmurings.<a name=312:16></a> He did that because of Himself.<a name=312:17></a> That is God's way, He loves us; our agitation, such as appears here, does not turn God away from us.<a name=312:18></a> See the way they spoke about Moses!<a name=312:19></a> There was no cause for it.<a name=312:20></a> They were tested, and by that test they were exposed.<a name=312:21></a> It is written for our learning, these things happened as examples, and are recorded for us that we may not fall into the sin of unreasonable complaint.<a name=312:22></a> The end in view in all ministry and in every experience is to develop manhood amongst us, that we should be <i>men</i>.<a name=312:23></a>

		Now in Joshua we have another instance of water.<a name=312:24></a> It says in chapter 3, "And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan".<a name=312:25></a> There is no complaining here at all; the people <i>have learned</i>.<a name=312:26></a> They are seen here, typically at least, as grown

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wonder if we all understand this great movement.<a name=313:6></a> They <i>came</i> to the Jordan; that is, water in the form of a river overflowing its banks, suggestive of the power of death.<a name=313:7></a> Some of us may have to face it in sickness at any time; God may bring us to it physically unless we arrive at it spiritually.<a name=313:8></a> It is a great thing to reach it spiritually.<a name=313:9></a> Mary and Martha did so in the death of their brother, and when any one near to us is taken it always peculiarly affects us.<a name=313:10></a> Martha said to the Lord, "if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died".<a name=313:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So they came to the Jordan, and lodged there for three days.<a name=313:12></a> What are we to learn in this test?<a name=313:13></a> They are not complaining, they are men, there is not a word against Joshua; even the forty thousand of the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh were all subject to Joshua.<a name=313:14></a> We can have no assembly conditions without this; we are enjoined to be subject.<a name=313:15></a> All these chapters denote leadership according to God and the principle of subjection in each.<a name=313:16></a> Only persons under control themselves are able to give orders; "joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ" says Paul to the Colossians (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:5">Colossians  2:5</a>).<a name=313:17></a> Thus he can propound to them the great thoughts of God.<a name=313:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So here there are great things for us to learn.<a name=313:19></a> We are to be two thousand cubits behind the ark, and as soon as we see it move we must go after <i>it</i>; we are not to go after this story and that story, but after the ark.<a name=313:20></a> Listening to this and that is sure to cause agitation: there is nothing of the kind in this beautiful passage; the great power of God in the ark is to deal with Jordan, symbolising

	<div class="paragraph">
		death, and the people are to follow in a respectful way.<a name=314:1></a> Two thousand cubits are equal to three thousand feet, and this is no little distance.<a name=314:2></a> As the ark was not large, it required good eyesight to see it clearly.<a name=314:3></a> So, typically, you get a view of Christ, as exercising the power of God when He entered into death and overthrew it -- in Gethsemane, on the cross, and in resurrection -- as recorded at the end of each gospel.<a name=314:4></a> But I am speaking for the moment of the faith order, and of the subjective spirit that is characteristic of believers seen here typically, and who understand that, through the death and resurrection of Christ, death is abolished.<a name=314:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in the assembly we are brought into a deathless state of things; death does not belong to it, and this instruction is necessary if we are to understand it rightly.<a name=314:6></a> It is not here a question of the 'babe condition' as set forth in Corinthians, but a state like that spoken of in the epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians; not persons carried about with every wind, but men who know how to discriminate.<a name=314:7></a> They were told to keep their eye on the ark and they did so, and the ark remained in the Jordan until they all passed over.<a name=314:8></a> Those passing over into Canaan are men: we are not to be in heaven as babes but as full-grown men, spoken of in Ephesians.<a name=314:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage in Judges brings us to a <i>well</i>, a small subdivision of water.<a name=314:10></a> There is a remarkable correspondence in the movements of the people here with those at Jordan.<a name=314:11></a> They rise early and pitch "beside the well of Harod"; their position is beside the well.<a name=314:12></a> They numbered thirty-two thousand, quite an army, and it may be that Gideon was pleased with the number.<a name=314:13></a> It would be gratifying to any leader to be able to call forth so many; but God says, 'They may suit you, but they do not suit Me -- there are too many of them'.<a name=314:14></a> "Bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee <i>there</i>".<a name=314:15></a> He does not tell Gideon how He will do it.<a name=314:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=330:1></a> In this chapter Luke groups what may be called the component parts of a local meeting -- the man, the woman, and the girl.<a name=330:2></a> They may be multiplied, of course, for a local company; more men, more women, and more young people, but it is easier to examine each of the features separately, as in one person.<a name=330:3></a> In Scripture we have examples of divine thoughts being exemplified in one person.<a name=330:4></a> All God's thoughts are exemplified in Jesus, and no one portrays these more beautifully than Luke.<a name=330:5></a> The assembly is of Christ, and in this chapter we have the elements divinely intended to compose it, at least in a local sense.<a name=330:6></a> What marked these three persons spiritually is of Christ.<a name=330:7></a> The Lord may help us, and use the chapter to give us a better understanding of what is His mind for our gatherings.<a name=330:8></a> Then we may see how Matthew supplies the <i>administrative</i> side, Mark the <i>ministerial</i> side, and John would fill us with <i>God</i>, as in Christ.<a name=330:9></a>

		<a name=331>[Page 331]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		and clothed and sensible.<a name=331:1></a> A brother needs those three characteristics -- to be restful, learning, at the feet of Jesus, and clothed and sensible.<a name=331:2></a> The man represents what a brother should be initially; he is ready to learn; there is nothing obtrusive about him, nothing that will hurt anyone, but then, he wants to be <i>with</i> the Lord, wherever He is, and the Lord shows that He has confidence in him, that He can leave him alone in the place.<a name=331:3></a> No brother is of much value in a locality unless he can be relied on to stand himself.<a name=331:4></a> We are not much called upon to stand in this way, but still it is the divine thought, that each brother should learn to stand by himself, which this man does.<a name=331:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The woman has an internal trouble.<a name=331:6></a> It is one relieved of an old trouble, power having gone out of the Lord to effect this.<a name=331:7></a> He was conscious that power had gone out of Him, that is, there is something now in her that would work out in <i>subjection and transparency</i>; in the meantime she is endeavouring to conceal that she was cured.<a name=331:8></a> A great deal of trouble arises in our meetings because of the want of transparency.<a name=331:9></a> Here the Lord brought this woman to tell <i>all</i> the truth before <i>all</i>, and she is owned by the Lord as <i>daughter</i>, that is, she is in family relationship.<a name=331:10></a> Then the girl would be the potentiality of young people, and there we have the spiritual element stressed.<a name=331:11></a> The Lord orders out of the place those who derided Him, and detained only Peter and James and John, and the parents.<a name=331:12></a> So that this young person is revived into a very <i>spiritual environment</i>.<a name=331:13></a> We must not assume that young people are not capable of spiritual impressions; it is not wise to classify them by themselves; they will not get much help by themselves; the idea here is that they are brought into an atmosphere where they are impressed by what is spiritual.<a name=331:14></a>

		I have in mind to speak about the Father in relation to the economy into which believers are introduced.<a name=379:1></a> I use this word 'economy' because it has special significance in this connection, and it has relation to the various dispensations of God.<a name=379:2></a> It is expressed in the baptismal formula at the end of Matthew's gospel; the Lord directs His disciples to go and make disciples, "baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=379:3></a> The idea of the economy is expressed thus, and involves the supreme privileges and blessings of God.<a name=379:4></a> Matthew, in recording the Lord's charge to His apostles, tells us they were directed to "make disciples", which implied that they were persons of moral persuasion -- moral power; for to make a disciple is not simply to enlighten a man so that he believes, but it involves that one has power with him.<a name=379:5></a> The Lord, in view of that, said that "all power" had been given to Him in heaven and on earth, and that He would be with them always, so that they would have resources enough.<a name=379:6></a> In their missionary service they were to "make disciples of all the nations" -- a very large commission, the magnitude of which is scarcely taken in by us.<a name=379:7></a> The persons accepting the baptism were to be introduced to such an economy as that "of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit": a realm in which the Persons of the Godhead would be active; and active, not in judgment, but in blessing.<a name=379:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This condition is a very great advance on the old economy under Moses.<a name=379:9></a> That was the first economy; before that, it was simply a question of man with God, without any official intermediary.<a name=379:10></a> Under Moses, the first economy was set up; then again under David, while including that of Moses, there was an increase in advantages and privileges; for God was known not only

		in a mediator, but in a king, involving much in excess.<a name=380:1></a> But when we come to Matthew -- which gospel is an extension of the Old Testament, as I may say, for all that was of God in the Old is brought into the New -- we are introduced to this new economy of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<a name=380:2></a> The assembly stands in <i>that</i> relation.<a name=380:3></a> So when the Father is introduced in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>, it is as <i>their</i> Father, the Father of believers.<a name=380:4></a> The economy comes in in chapter 3, by way of a voice, manifesting Christ as the Son of God; but in chapter 5 the disciples are brought immediately into relation with God as their Father -- it has that advantage at once.<a name=380:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in John we have a different view; and I want to point out the difference, and show that he leads on to something beyond Matthew for us.<a name=380:6></a> So he speaks of the Father first as Christ's Father -- "the Father", or "my Father" -- the Lord never says "your Father" to the disciples, until we arrive at chapter 20.<a name=380:7></a> It may be inquired why there is this difference.<a name=380:8></a> I believe that it involves a clear understanding of our privileges as John presents them, and that we shall thus come the better to know Him with whom we shall presently be associated, and our relations with the Father -- a very great matter.<a name=380:9></a> So the Lord at the present time is stressing John's ministry, so that we should understand who the Lord Jesus is, and who the Father is.<a name=380:10></a>

		John begins his narrative with the "beginning" -- not the beginning of Israel's history, nor does he state of what it is the beginning -- he just says, "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=380:11></a> Then he goes on to say, "and the Word was with God" -- indicating thus the separate and distinct existence of His Person; and he adds, "the Word was God".<a name=380:12></a> Now that is to be known at the outset, if we are to understand John; He presents this as that which is to be laid hold of by us at once, and tenaciously held to.<a name=380:13></a> Then that One -- "the Word" -- has become flesh, verse 14, and was apprehended or seen by certain persons who

		Then in chapter 3, John says, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand".<a name=381:13></a> This is the economy; the Father hands everything over into the hand of One whom He loves -- One here designated "the Son".<a name=381:14></a> Think of the hand in which the Father has placed all things!<a name=381:15></a> Then chapter 5 is full of the relations of the Son to the Father; much is said as to the equality of the Son with the Father.<a name=381:16></a> "He who honours not the Son, honours not the Father who has sent him".<a name=381:17></a> Thus we gather light as to His Person.<a name=381:18></a> The Son, having

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 6 there is hunger; it was so in the world then, as it is now; men disregard the great economy that God has set up.<a name=382:7></a> So the sign in chapter 6 is food -- He feeds the five thousand.<a name=382:8></a> Those who benefited by the sign would seek to make Him a king, because He could meet their temporal needs, but that puts Him on a very low level.<a name=382:9></a> God could feed men without the need of the Son coming down.<a name=382:10></a> The material creation supplies more than enough for all the men and women on earth; there is fish, flesh, and vegetables in plenty for all, "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof".<a name=382:11></a> But these here would make Him a king because of the loaves and fishes.<a name=382:12></a> Then there is the question as to Moses in the wilderness and the manna; that too, was a question of food.<a name=382:13></a> It supplies the Lord with the opportunity He wanted.<a name=382:14></a> He shows them that Moses did not give them the true bread; the bread which they ate was not that, but they ate the manna in the wilderness and died.<a name=382:15></a> It was rained down on them -- showing that there was plenty of it; the face of the wilderness, we are told, was covered with it; all they had to do was to go out and gather it.<a name=382:16></a> It was pure and white; spiritually it was Christ, but actually it was food to nourish flesh and blood, and was therefore not the true bread out of heaven.<a name=382:17></a> So Jesus immediately introduces the divine

		In the synoptic gospels the Father is largely connected with material things; the Lord says, "your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things".<a name=383:4></a> He has made us and He knows us, and "like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him".<a name=383:5></a> It corresponds with the apostle's teaching in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6">2 Corinthians  6</a>"come out from among them, and be ye separate .<a name=383:6></a>.<a name=383:7></a>.<a name=383:8></a> and I .<a name=383:9></a>.<a name=383:10></a>.<a name=383:11></a> will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".<a name=383:12></a> But the Lord is not stressing that in John; He is aiming at higher things, something that is altogether beyond temporal things.<a name=383:13></a> That is all settled in the synoptic gospels, which are rightly placed first.<a name=383:14></a> We are already believers in John, but He wants to make <i>true</i> believers of us.<a name=383:15></a> Hence in the first sign in John we are told that He manifested forth His glory, and "his disciples believed on him".<a name=383:16></a> That is what the Lord is doing here, so He says, "my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven", that is, the <i>Father</i> sent it.<a name=383:17></a> I would seek help to express what it is to come into this economy, where every feature of what God is is connected with the Father as known in grace.<a name=383:18></a> The Father is always connected in John's gospel with the thought of grace.<a name=383:19></a> "The Father judgeth no man".<a name=383:20></a> He is occupied with grace, and the bread He gives is the best in heaven!<a name=383:21></a> It is spiritually the true bread which comes down out of heaven and gives

		J.T.<a name=403:1></a> I am thinking of the word 'Lamb' as expressive of sacrifice, and how the Lord is seen at the outset of John's gospel in this way as "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world", and how John met the overtures of the men from Jerusalem, verse 19.<a name=403:2></a> It is a question now of our witness; what we testify to.<a name=403:3></a> I thought this paragraph, verse 19 - 28, would help us as to calling attention to Christ.<a name=403:4></a> This is incumbent upon us in our ministry and service as to what we confess.<a name=403:5></a> It says, "And he acknowledged and denied not" and then a second time, "and acknowledged, <i>I</i> am not the Christ".<a name=403:6></a> In all their inquiries he is negative.<a name=403:7></a> He said he was not the Christ, not Elias, not the prophet.<a name=403:8></a> Then they say, "What sayest thou of thyself?<a name=403:9></a>" That will come up in our service in testimony.<a name=403:10></a> He says, "<i>I</i> am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of the Lord, as said Esaias the prophet".<a name=403:11></a> We are told they asked him why he is serving as he is: "Why baptisest thou then if <i>thou</i> art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?<a name=403:12></a>" John's answer is "<i>I</i> baptise with water.<a name=403:13></a> In the midst of you stands, whom <i>ye</i> do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal <i>I</i> am not worthy to unloose.<a name=403:14></a> These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan where John was baptising".<a name=403:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=437:1></a> These passages, the one in Genesis and the other in Numbers, are intended to fill out what came before us this morning as to ministry, especially in its dispensational bearing.<a name=437:2></a> What is thought now is that we should be engaged with the idea of brethren, an idea that has a great place in Scripture, working out into eternal relations too, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=437:3></a> But it is hoped that we shall learn something as to the subject, not only in its local or immediate relation, but its dispensational bearing.<a name=437:4></a> Therefore, the passage in Numbers was read as working out what began in Genesis; relations between Jacob and Esau in Genesis were personal, family, purely family at first.<a name=437:5></a> But as we see the relation of brethren between Jacob and Esau in Numbers, we have already passed through, we might say, hundreds of years; at least, a considerable time, to require consideration of the relationship between them as of a dispensational character.<a name=437:6></a> And so Edom is in mind in Numbers, that is, Esau in Genesis is called Edom in Numbers, so that it has acquired not only a family relation but national, and dispensational.<a name=437:7></a> And it is hoped that we shall see how the relation of brethren may be just merely national or dispensational and pass out of the primary thought of brethren; whereas the thought really of brethren, the thought conveyed in the term, runs into eternity.<a name=437:8></a> And as in these two men, that is, in the anti-typical meaning or teaching of the passages, the idea runs on.<a name=437:9></a> So that the Lord is to have many brethren; Christ is to have many brethren; and all to be of one family.<a name=437:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=440:5></a>P.<a name=440:6></a> Obadiah brings out just that, that right feelings should have marked Esau as a brother.<a name=440:7></a> He says, "Thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster", verse 12.<a name=440:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=440:9></a> Quite so.<a name=440:10></a> If God sees the need of discipline in us, He would not encourage any advantage being taken of that between us, lest personal feeling might enter into it, and the discipline would be annulled in that sense; He would take away the feelings of enmity or pride that might lead to the discipline being aggravated and extended.<a name=440:11></a> It is clear that, if discipline has to be executed, it is to be left with God, because it is said in 1 Corinthians that the incestuous man that was put under discipline, put away, indeed -- what is said in that respect, what qualifies the whole matter is that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<a name=440:12></a> He was to be delivered unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<a name=440:13></a> The matter is to be kept unto the Lord and not to be used for natural feelings or vengeance.<a name=440:14></a>
