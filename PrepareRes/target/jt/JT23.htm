		THE PREACHING OF THE SON OF GOD

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish, with the Lord's help, to speak about the preaching of the Son of God, and the result for God intended to be accomplished thereby.<a name=1:3></a> Paul writes that God had revealed His Son in him, that he might announce Him as glad tidings among the nations.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of God is on God's side, and has in view results for God -- both for time and eternity; whilst the Son of Man is on man's side.<a name=1:5></a> As becoming Man, He is available for man, and may be appropriated by men; and so in the gospel of Luke we have Him from this latter point of view, and He is seen in the weakness of a babe; He is seen in that gospel as in the temple of God having been brought there to fulfil the requirement of the law.<a name=1:6></a> Arriving in the temple, He is taken into the arms of one who had gone into the temple by the Spirit.<a name=1:7></a> He is held, as it were, by the race representatively, but nevertheless suitably, in a spiritual way -- in a priestly way.<a name=1:8></a> We have there God revealed on man's behalf.<a name=1:9></a> He should be a light, as it is said, for the revelation of the Gentiles.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think, beloved brethren, of the immense service rendered by Him who at that time was held in the arms of a man -- held on the side of man -- that He should remove the veil that lay upon us -- that He should bring us under the eye of God, and that He should secure for us God's thought for man.<a name=1:11></a> How much is in that blessed Man for us, and how wonderful that even tonight we can claim Him in all the infinite depths that are in His heart.<a name=1:12></a> As Mary sat at His feet and listened to His word -- what disclosures there would be of what was in the heart of God for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		man; and He undertook to secure for man what He knew was in that heart, so that men were not only brought under the eye of God, but through Him we have secured all that is in the heart of God for man.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the Son of God we have One who is here representatively for God -- He is concerned for God -- He is concerned to bring about the plan of God for God's pleasure; and so I wish, as I said, to bring out from these scriptures the manner in which the great preacher of the Son of God in his preaching (whilst announcing other things necessary for men) introduces the golden thread, as I may call it, of the light of the knowledge of the Son of God, so that there should be, as the passage that I read indicated, <i>sons of God</i>; that these sons conformed to the image of God's Son, should be representative of God in this world, and at the same time be those amongst whom the Son of God is "the first-born among many brethren".<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to show that this thought of sonship was indicated in the Old Testament, and was worked out there, even in persons not in Abraham's line.<a name=2:3></a> I want to show by references to the Old Testament that from the very outset of God's operations, the principle of sonship was in evidence.<a name=2:4></a> It shone particularly in connection with the two great lines of testimony -- namely, the testimony connected with written records and the testimony connected with the creation.<a name=2:5></a> These two collateral testimonies stand out, working the one in relation to the other, and each indicating that God intended the result of His testimony to be in man -- <i>sonship</i>.<a name=2:6></a> And in that connection one is encouraged to look at the ministry of Melchisedec, together with the ministry of Elihu and of Jehovah Himself in the book of Job.<a name=2:7></a> What we find in Melchisedec is that at a time when men generally had turned away from God, not liking to have Him in their knowledge, he appears in the service of God.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As representing the Son of God, it is said of him, that he was without father, without mother, without beginning of days or end of life.<a name=3:1></a> He was assimilated to the Son of God; being thus assimilated to the Son of God, he represents in his own person the features of the testimony whereby God will secure His great end.<a name=3:2></a> And so we find that he is presented to us as King of Righteousness, King of Peace, and Priest of the Most High God.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this remarkable personage (appearing suddenly without explanation) is seen the whole testimony, or means for the accomplishment of the whole testimony of God.<a name=3:4></a> It is to remind us that God is never taken by surprise, and that He has, in the face of general apostasy -- of a general turning away -- one who maintains His testimony in the very highest possible dignity and power.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For we have not only a righteous man, as in Abraham, but the King of Righteousness, who can be King of Peace, and being King of Peace, he can undisturbedly minister to the people of God, for he was a priest of the Most High God.<a name=3:6></a> So that we have there, standing out in solitary dignity, one who is assimilated to the Son of God.<a name=3:7></a> In the hands of the Son of God not one iota of the testimony can slip; every thread of it is held with a view to the great results which the Son knows are cherished in the heart of God.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in the book of Job, corresponding with this great independent witness of whom I have spoken, you have sons of God coming up on certain days to appear before Him.<a name=3:9></a> Who these sons of God were, I am not prepared to say; but I am prepared, on the authority of Scripture, to say that they were sons of God, and that they came up according to the instinct of sons to appear before Him.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a mere incident, beloved, that the Spirit of God records for us, that in those ancient days when
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the mass of men had turned away from God, there were those who came up before Him.<a name=4:1></a> They came up to present themselves before Him, and so, as He undertakes to reach His great end in Job -- which was no less than <i>sonship</i> -- He calls Job's attention, at the very outset, to the fact that when He began His operations upon earth, "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy".<a name=4:2></a> It is not a mere incident.<a name=4:3></a> It had a great place in the dealings of God which led to Job's collapse.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact is that God intended that He should be seen by Job.<a name=4:5></a> And so He intended in the incarnation that He should be seen by men.<a name=4:6></a> The great thought in sonship, therefore -- in the Son becoming Man from this point of view -- is that there should be adequate divine representation upon earth -- in other words, that God should be seen.<a name=4:7></a> Scripture tells us "No man hath <i>seen</i> God at any time" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=4:8></a> He dwelleth in light unapproachable, whom no man hath seen.<a name=4:9></a> But the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath <i>declared</i> Him.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the great representation on earth was through the Son, and we are told, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:9">John  14:9</a>).<a name=4:11></a> Hence Job says, "Mine eye seeth thee" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:5">Job  42:5</a>).<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Can we doubt, beloved, as to the representation presented to the eye of Job?<a name=4:13></a> What God presents to our eyes He intends to produce in us.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, in presenting the Son in the preaching, He intends to produce sons, and He does it.<a name=4:15></a> Hence Job says, "Now mine eye seeth thee.<a name=4:16></a> Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:5">Job  42:5</a>,6).<a name=4:17></a> Is that all?<a name=4:18></a> No, beloved, that is not all.<a name=4:19></a> God intended that that man should represent Him, and immediately He called upon the three friends of Job who had misrepresented Him.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How many are misrepresenting God at the present time, whilst professing to represent Him?<a name=4:21></a> Better
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		no representation at all than that God should be misrepresented -- falsely represented.<a name=5:1></a> So God immediately arraigns those who misrepresented Him in their speech.<a name=5:2></a> He says, you have not spoken rightly of Me like my servant Job.<a name=5:3></a> You see God now recognises His servant, and more than a <i>servant</i>.<a name=5:4></a> He says, you are a <i>priest</i>; the three men have to go to Job with their sacrifices.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see God had something in view for Himself in all that wonderful service He rendered to Job.<a name=5:6></a> He did not intend merely to give the lie to Satan, to bring to our attention the shame of Job, and the folly of his speeches.<a name=5:7></a> His great thought was to bring Job out a representative -- one to whom He could send even sinners.<a name=5:8></a> He was in his place like Melchisedec.<a name=5:9></a> He was a priest, he has seen God, and it is said that God accepted the face of Job.<a name=5:10></a> Who can deny that there was in his face a reflection of the face of God?<a name=5:11></a> He prayed for his friends -- and God accepted the face of Job, and then God ornamented him and set him up in suitable dignity as His representative in this world.<a name=5:12></a> He enriched him.<a name=5:13></a> He gave him seven sons and three daughters, and Job continued for many years seeing, it says, his sons' sons, even unto the fourth generation.<a name=5:14></a> What a great result in one man, beloved!<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It reminds us that God is working with every one of us with as many pains, with as much interest, with as much affection as He did with that man.<a name=5:16></a> For He has in view that there should be conformity to the image of His Son, for His Son is the image of Himself.<a name=5:17></a> He is the image of the invisible God.<a name=5:18></a> We have a perfect image of the invisible God in the Son of God, and the great thought of God is to extend that image so that there might be extended representation of Himself.<a name=5:19></a> Hence, as I said, we see all the skill with which this great preacher of the Son of God interweaves the blessed truth of it in his gospel; for
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the preaching of the Son of God is not merely the announcement of the historical fact that He was proclaimed the Son of God from heaven.<a name=6:1></a> It involves that demonstration has come about, for it is said that He was <i>declared</i> to be the Son.<a name=6:2></a> It is such an One that Paul preaches.<a name=6:3></a> One who is declared to be the Son of God.<a name=6:4></a> That is to say, there is a moral element for the soul of man in the great fact of the resurrection.<a name=6:5></a> So, as I said, it is not merely an announcement of doctrine.<a name=6:6></a> There is in the preaching of the Son of God, as declared to be such by the resurrection from amongst the dead, a moral element which, entering by light into our souls, received by faith into our souls, has its own effect -- an effect which, built into us in relation to other things, renders us impregnable.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the apostle begins by saying he was separated unto this great gospel.<a name=6:8></a> It was the gospel of God concerning His Son -- One, as he proceeds to say, <i>declared</i> to be Son of God.<a name=6:9></a> I would emphasise that, so that we might have the light of the declaration of the Son in our souls, so as to banish all fear of death and Satan's power from us.<a name=6:10></a> And so the apostle brings out clearly his position as a preacher of this gospel.<a name=6:11></a> How one is impressed by coming into contact with this great feature of the testimony which is introduced by this great servant, for it was not only when he actually preached that he served; he served always in his spirit.<a name=6:12></a> Coming into contact with his spirit, one would be impressed by the Son of God.<a name=6:13></a> He could say, "who loved me and gave himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=6:14></a> He would overwhelm you with the sense he had of that great Person, and of His love!<a name=6:15></a> How he served, as he says, in his spirit!<a name=6:16></a> It was the controlling force of his life, and I venture to say he was personally representative of Christ in his life.<a name=6:17></a> He would convey to one's soul constantly his estimate -- his vision of the Son of God.<a name=6:18></a> He could say, "who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so he refers in writing to the Corinthians to the Son of God, "Who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), etc".<a name=7:1></a> He could say, "In him is the yea, and in him the amen for glory to God by us" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:20">2 Corinthians  1:20</a>).<a name=7:2></a> How identified he was in his spirit with this great preaching committed to him.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I go on to show the links in this epistle, which lead up to chapter 8, where we find the great result.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 he says we are reconciled by the death of His Son.<a name=7:5></a> It is as if God would lay special stress on reconciliation as leading up to what He had in His mind.<a name=7:6></a> How can we arrive, dear brethren, at sonship without reconciliation?<a name=7:7></a> We cannot.<a name=7:8></a> And in order that we should be reconciled there was the death of His Son -- that expression of love.<a name=7:9></a> Think, beloved, of the death of <i>His Son</i>; think of what God had in view in the death of His Son.<a name=7:10></a> He intended that we should be reconciled -- that there should not be one shade of distance; and, moreover, as reconciled (for the chapter contemplates that we have received it -- it is something to be received, as sonship is to be received), it is said, "Much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life".<a name=7:11></a> How many of us understand what it is to be saved by the life of the Son of God!<a name=7:12></a> He lives in relation to us as the Son of God, but in order that we should live for God.<a name=7:13></a> That is what should be going on at the present time; the sons are to live and be saved by the life of His Son.<a name=7:14></a> These things are leading up to the great result.<a name=7:15></a> There are many other things in the book, I need not say.<a name=7:16></a> There are many details, but they are all involved in working out what I am speaking of, what I believe is in the mind of God.<a name=7:17></a> How He looks at the work!<a name=7:18></a> What it cost Him to bring about the result!<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is for us at the present the life of Christ.<a name=7:20></a> How many of us understand it?<a name=7:21></a> It is one thing to be reconciled, it is another to be saved from day to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		day in the sense of which I am speaking of it.<a name=8:1></a> Every reconciled soul will ultimately be saved, but what about today?<a name=8:2></a> God lives today as He shall live a million years hence.<a name=8:3></a> He wishes you to live, He wishes me to live.<a name=8:4></a> He is the <i>living</i> God.<a name=8:5></a> The thought is that we should be living, and be saved by the life of His Son.<a name=8:6></a> Think of being brought into the sphere of life.<a name=8:7></a> As He said "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a>).<a name=8:8></a> But there is not only the <i>light</i> of life, there is the thing itself, and that thing, as it says here, is no less than the life of the Son of God.<a name=8:9></a> "We shall be saved by his life".<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us go to chapter 8, from which I wish to show how this life works.<a name=8:11></a> God intends that the flesh shall have no place in us.<a name=8:12></a> There can be no representation of God in the flesh.<a name=8:13></a> It had its day.<a name=8:14></a> One marvels at the wonderful patience of God with man in the flesh.<a name=8:15></a> He had every possible opportunity to represent God, and there was no representation of God -- the very opposite.<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find God sends His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.<a name=8:17></a> Wonderful words!<a name=8:18></a> Were it not that the Holy Spirit uses them, one would dread to use them.<a name=8:19></a> Remember that God sent His own Son in the likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, so as to condemn sin in the flesh.<a name=8:20></a> It is <i>condemned</i>.<a name=8:21></a> And by no less means than the incarnation of the Son of God when He took on Himself the likeness of sinful flesh.<a name=8:22></a> God has dealt with it, and it need not trouble anyone.<a name=8:23></a> It is condemned.<a name=8:24></a> I have nothing more to do with it.<a name=8:25></a> And it is to the end, dear brethren, that we shall pay our debts, for we cannot represent God here as in debt.<a name=8:26></a> There has to be a complete discharge of all moral obligations if we are to represent God.<a name=8:27></a> See how He has done it; "That the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us".<a name=8:28></a> Just as in the well-known figure in 2 Kings, one paid her debts and lived
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of the rest.<a name=9:1></a> It is a question of the Spirit, beloved.<a name=9:2></a> In the life of God's Son, every moral obligation of His people on earth is discharged, every obligation is fully met -- more than met.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are all constructive references.<a name=9:4></a> So we read "As many as are led by the Spirit of God these are sons of God".<a name=9:5></a> You say: "What is it to be led by the Spirit of God?<a name=9:6></a>" The simplest way I can put it is you are led by the Spirit in the discharge of your moral obligations.<a name=9:7></a> In loving your brethren, for example, you are led by the Spirit of God.<a name=9:8></a> "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God".<a name=9:9></a> We are now emboldened, as we are led by the Spirit.<a name=9:10></a> As so dignified, as led by the Spirit of God, we are like the Son of God.<a name=9:11></a> We are told <i>these</i> are the sons of God, marked off as the sons of God.<a name=9:12></a> It is no longer a question of life; we are marked off as the sons of God, as led by the Spirit.<a name=9:13></a> So we have not the spirit of bondage, but we have the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father".<a name=9:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see the result for God.<a name=9:15></a> You have come along the shining way, commencing with the discharge of every moral obligation, led by the Spirit of God, not by the flesh, and you have reached God Himself.<a name=9:16></a> Think of reaching God Himself in our souls!<a name=9:17></a> Think of the road He took to reach us, and think of the road we must take!<a name=9:18></a> We cannot reach God in our souls in any conscious way except by the Spirit.<a name=9:19></a> We may use language others use, or sing hymns others have composed in the Spirit, and yet not reach God in our own souls.<a name=9:20></a> We may substitute mere terms for worship, but we cannot reach God consciously except by the Spirit.<a name=9:21></a> He has not given us the spirit of bondage, but the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father" -- the spirit of sonship -- the spirit by which all fear is cast out.<a name=9:22></a> We cry by that spirit, "Abba, Father".<a name=9:23></a> We have reached God.<a name=9:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would ask young people here: 'Have you reached

		God in your souls?<a name=10:1></a>' I do not mean do you know the doctrine of it, not that I would make light of doctrines, which are quite right in their place.<a name=10:2></a> But the thing is to reach Him!<a name=10:3></a> We cry: "Abba, Father", by the Spirit, and that cry is real.<a name=10:4></a> It is delightful to the heart of God, beloved.<a name=10:5></a> He gave up His only Son, and has received what delights Him.<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I just want to say a word about the last verse I read.<a name=10:7></a> You see we are now on the mountain top.<a name=10:8></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#104:8">Psalm  104:8</a>,10, "The mountains rose, the valleys sank, .<a name=10:9></a>.<a name=10:10></a>.<a name=10:11></a> He sendeth the springs into the valleys: they run among the mountains".<a name=10:12></a> What an atmosphere we live in!<a name=10:13></a> We breathe an atmosphere which is marked by the knowledge that we were predestinated and foreknown, even before the foundation of the earth.<a name=10:14></a> What an atmosphere to breathe!<a name=10:15></a> And so these verses deal with the hilltops of purpose, where we are by predestination.<a name=10:16></a> We read we were foreknown to be conformed to the <i>image</i> of His Son.<a name=10:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now come to what was in the heart of God in eternal purpose, and what actuated Him when speaking to Job, what He had in His mind as He laid the foundations of the earth -- sons of God.<a name=10:18></a> We were foreknown and predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son.<a name=10:19></a> I wish every one of us could take home with us the idea of the <i>image</i>.<a name=10:20></a> There can be no doubt that the idea will be carried on in the future period in which we shall be called upon to represent the Son of God in the administration of the world.<a name=10:21></a> I have no doubt about it.<a name=10:22></a> How shall we administer the affairs of a city or of ten cities, save as we know the Son of God?<a name=10:23></a> We shall be there in the image of the Son of God.<a name=10:24></a> Beloved, I would that the saints of God at the present time might be conscious of this coming day.<a name=10:25></a> Is that all?<a name=10:26></a> No.<a name=10:27></a> There is the present time, a time of representation, as that will be, and these constructive things in our souls enable us to be in true representation now.<a name=10:28></a>

		Then there is the further thought that He should be the First-born among many brethren.<a name=11:1></a> Here, you see, we reach what is entirely of God.<a name=11:2></a> He has His family, not merely <i>a</i> son of God, as Job was, but One in pre-eminenee amongst <i>many</i>.<a name=11:3></a> All are to be like Him -- all like the sons of the King -- all like Jesus.<a name=11:4></a> So that in being conformed to the image of His Son we are called His brethren, amongst whom He is the First-born.<a name=11:5></a> You see how God thus reaches His great thought.<a name=11:6></a> He has a family of sons after the image of His Son.<a name=11:7></a> Every one is seen, in whatever capacity, representing the Son of God; and as representing the Son, we represent God.<a name=11:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=60:1></a> As it is the first day of the week, it occurred to me that it was due to the Lord that we should be occupied with the assembly.<a name=60:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is that we may see it, as governed by a law; in this chapter in Ezekiel (lower down), he speaks about the <i>law of the house</i> upon the top of the mountain.<a name=60:3></a> That is the idea of the assembly.<a name=60:4></a> The assembly comes out of heaven, and the law that governs it comes out of heaven.<a name=60:5></a> It is set up on the top of the mountain, and what comes out, I think, in the law of the house -- which may be taken to be 1 Corinthians -- is that the activities which should mark it are those of fully developed men, <i>men</i> -- not children.<a name=60:6></a> In Ezekiel, where we have more minute detail given of the house of God than in any other part of Scripture, the idea of a <i>man</i> runs throughout -- indeed, the book contemplates the Son of man.<a name=60:7></a> The term, Son of man, is perhaps found in Ezekiel more frequently than in all the other books of the Bible combined, and the thought links up with the house.<a name=60:8></a> "The man", he says, "stood by me".<a name=60:9></a> The assembly, therefore, is not to be marked by undeveloped activities -- it is the intelligence of <i>the man</i>, the affections of <i>the man</i>.<a name=60:10></a> Every stage of spiritual growth, of course, is recognised there -- but it is to be characterised by <i>men</i>, so that it says, "in your minds be grown men".<a name=60:11></a> And for that reason I suggested the earlier part of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>in connection with the passage in Matthew, because it gives man his place as the representative of God.<a name=60:12></a> The anointing in Matthew is the fullest recognition of this.<a name=60:13></a> Matthew and Mark record for us the action of this woman, and the Lord directs that what she did was to be mentioned

	<div class="paragraph">
		as a memorial of her wherever the gospel would be preached.<a name=61:1></a> He says nothing in these two gospels about the memorial of Himself.<a name=61:2></a> It is the woman who is to be remembered, because unless there is the memorial of the woman, I doubt if there will be the conditions for the memorial of Christ; so that He says nothing about remembering Himself in regard to His Supper in Matthew and Mark, but He does say that the woman is to be remembered, and I think it is because of the place she gives Him.<a name=61:3></a> If her memorial is rightly apprehended I think the conditions will exist for the memorial of Christ, which Luke mentions.<a name=61:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=61:8></a> I think in Matthew it would recognise the government of God -- <i>that</i> Man to her represented government.<a name=61:9></a> She would not look elsewhere for regulation.<a name=61:10></a> In Mark, I suppose the anointing represents what is levitical.<a name=61:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=61:12></a>B.<a name=61:13></a> Is the thought in your mind that in the three scriptures read there is progressive development in our apprehension of what there is in the assembly?<a name=61:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=61:15></a> Well, I thought the passage in Matthew fits in with the early part of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, because it shows how the woman took her place, and not only took her place in relation to the man, but recognised by anointing His head, that at least He was her ideal; she would recognise Him, she would have a sign of authority on her head henceforth.<a name=61:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=62:2></a> That is exactly what I thought, and so the anointing in Matthew fits in with 1 Corinthians.<a name=62:3></a> It would save believers from turning to any other authority than Christ for their regulation.<a name=62:4></a>

		It occurred to me that a word about faith would serve us at this time, having in view that we are living in the dispensation of faith -- as it is said, "God's dispensation, which is in faith" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:4">1 Timothy  1:4</a>).<a name=77:1></a> The tendency with us, to speak simply, is to drift from a position taken up by faith into one marked by sight, and thus we may retain only the outward forms accompanying faith and the dispensation of faith, and we come short of their power, for we can only have to say to God by faith.<a name=77:2></a> It is said, "he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him" and that "without faith it is impossible to please him" (<a href="../bible/Hebrew.htm#11:6">Hebrew  11:6</a>).<a name=77:3></a> That is a very sweeping, solemn word.<a name=77:4></a> And so, in speaking of faith, what one suggests is not that we have not faith, for I have no such thought.<a name=77:5></a> I seek to speak to you as to those who have faith.<a name=77:6></a> Indeed, no ministry can be of any value, or have any effect, save as addressed to faith -- save there be faith in the hearers.<a name=77:7></a> But then this word of all words admits of degrees of comparison, and what I have particularly in view is to call attention, as I proceed, to that which marks all of us, and that is, failure to go the whole way.<a name=77:8></a> The disposition to proceed to half measures is perhaps realised in every one of us, and as it is according to our faith so be it to us, the measure of our faith is the measure of our blessing subjectively -- not objectively; for what God has got for us is not measured by our faith, but by His own love.<a name=77:9></a> We can rest in that, and that ultimately He will accomplish in us His purpose is also assured.<a name=77:10></a> But things are enjoyed now on the principle

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I ventured to read these two passages in Matthew, because they speak of "great" faith -- a degree of comparison which doubtless each one here would refrain from appropriating to one's self.<a name=78:2></a> We are not living in the time of "great" faith, but it is well to have a standard, because these things are recorded for us so that we might have them in view, that we might have these two personages in our minds as spoken of in this way by the Lord.<a name=78:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first, the Syro-Phoenician woman, was outside the range of religious privilege in that day, and this very fact brought out, through the Lord's gracious dealings with her, the benefit of the work of God in her soul, showing that the mere enjoyment of outward religious privilege in itself may not conduce to the work of God.<a name=78:4></a> For, as the Lord says of the centurion, "Not even in Israel have I found so great faith".<a name=78:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in regard to the Syro-Phoenician woman -- a personage well known to most of us, doubtless, as oft presented in the gospel -- all I wanted to say is that her faith enabled her to take account of the circumstances in which the government of God had placed her.<a name=78:6></a> The government of God has to say to us.<a name=78:7></a> It has to say to every person in the world, and to every nation, but it has to say, particularly, to the people of God, and what we may remark is that we are suffering among other things under the government of God in three distinct connections.<a name=78:8></a> Notwithstanding that we have faith, and have come into the benefits of faith, we are outwardly suffering, with all mankind, in three distinct connections.<a name=78:9></a> We are suffering, with all mankind, on account of Adam's sin.<a name=78:10></a> These may be very simple remarks, but they are practical, and it is well to have them in view, in order that the position may be clear.<a name=78:11></a> We are suffering

		under the government of God on account of Adam's guilt.<a name=79:1></a> All the outward circumstances and consequences of that guilt have come down to us, and it is our wisdom not to look for miracles.<a name=79:2></a> Faith accepts these circumstances, whatever they be.<a name=79:3></a> Faith accepts our conflicts, and goes through them with God.<a name=79:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, then, we are suffering on account of the sin of the race in the rebellion against God at Shinar.<a name=79:5></a> We are suffering on account of the national situation in the world.<a name=79:6></a> We know that God, having sent his angels out to minister on account of the heirs of salvation, is modifying these national conditions; but, nevertheless, they exist, and the national conditions entail suffering.<a name=79:7></a> They entail inconvenience and suffering, irritation of all kinds, to men.<a name=79:8></a> We pray for the powers that be, because they are mercies, but they cannot set aside these conditions which have come down to us, and we as believers accept them.<a name=79:9></a> We do not ally ourselves with any nation; as we understand our calling we are outside of them; but, nevertheless, we are subject to the powers that be, and we are thankful for those powers.<a name=79:10></a> But the national conditions into which mankind has been plunged involve suffering.<a name=79:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then there is that which comes home to us more keenly than all -- the failure of the assembly.<a name=79:12></a> After we understand it aright, we understand it entails untold spiritual suffering, as well as other sufferings.<a name=79:13></a> The addresses to the assemblies show what an overcomer has to contend with.<a name=79:14></a> But an overcomer accepts the conditions humbly, and acknowledges his own share in them.<a name=79:15></a> He accepts them from God, and the sufferings entailed.<a name=79:16></a> His faith enables him to regard them in the light of the government of God, and he suffers accordingly.<a name=79:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this woman in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#15">Matthew  15</a>is a model for us in that respect.<a name=79:18></a> That is, she is set down here as one who has great faith, and it is great faith shown in her

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then in the case of the centurion, that is a faith which enables us to say that, notwithstanding these conditions, the Lord Jesus is in heaven, and He is as "a man under authority".<a name=80:10></a> That is, He has received from the Father the administration of everything.<a name=80:11></a> The centurion says, "I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof".<a name=80:12></a> I think that could be rightly said of every one of us religiously.<a name=80:13></a> As we take conditions into account, as we take our own actual conditions and circumstances religiously into account, it seems to me that this word fits.<a name=80:14></a> We are not "worthy".<a name=80:15></a> But then, in acknowledging our own unworthiness -- and how meet it is that we should -- we say that He has power in heaven and upon earth, and that He does not <i>need</i> to come.<a name=80:16></a> He proposes to come, but He does not <i>need</i> to come.<a name=80:17></a> All He has to do is to say the word.<a name=80:18></a>

		I wanted to enlarge on these two or three thoughts in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#13">2 Kings  13</a>, because I find it is the Lord's way to use the Old Testament for the elucidation in detail of what is stated in the New Testament.<a name=82:8></a> The Old is Scripture as much as the New.<a name=82:9></a> It has the same authority.<a name=82:10></a> It was written in view of the New; the New now being in our hands comes first, so that the believer brings out of his treasures things new and old.<a name=82:11></a> I hope you see in this passage that the whole thing shines by its very age.<a name=82:12></a> Its very age enhances its beauty, for it is but a picture of what I am saying, only in a collective sense.<a name=82:13></a> In this passage you see how great results are missed because of our resorting to half measures instead of whole measures.<a name=82:14></a> Instead of great faith you have little faith.<a name=82:15></a> Instead of great consequences you have little consequences -- consequences of great value, surely, but not such as are available, and we want all that is available.<a name=82:16></a>

		Now the king of Israel comes down to Elisha, and what you observe is that, although his reign, as the context shows, was other than according to God's mind, yet grace was available.<a name=82:17></a> This picture is to impress us with the reign of grace, and how it overrules and overrides even our crookedness and unfaithfulness, and asserts itself, because God ever holds to the principle of the dispensation.<a name=82:18></a> The Christ is still on the Father's throne, and grace still rules, and God maintains throughout the principle of the dispensation.<a name=82:19></a>

		And so the king of Israel weeps upon the prophet's face.<a name=82:20></a> There was some respect for Elisha.<a name=82:21></a> And then he says, "My father!<a name=82:22></a> my father!<a name=82:23></a> the chariot of Israel

		and the horsemen thereof".<a name=83:1></a> How poorly this fine expression sits on the lips of this unbelieving king, but nevertheless, it was a fine expression.<a name=83:2></a> It was an expression first used by Elisha.<a name=83:3></a> It was an expression which entered into the dispensation, and characterised it.<a name=83:4></a> And God loves to have us go back to the beginning.<a name=83:5></a> We are now in a time of the most abject weakness.<a name=83:6></a> Elisha is sick of the sickness whereof he died.<a name=83:7></a> What a dark day!<a name=83:8></a> What a prospect!<a name=83:9></a> But he had <i>not</i> died.<a name=83:10></a> I have no doubt his sickness may be taken as a suggestion of the weakness that marks our own time.<a name=83:11></a> Let us accept it.<a name=83:12></a> We are living in a day of extremely small things -- outward weakness -- but Elisha still lives, and the reminder of his early ejaculation as he saw Elijah ascend brings out the latent strength that is there, and that is what I want to impress upon us, that there is latent strength.<a name=83:13></a> The Holy Spirit is still here.<a name=83:14></a> That does not mean that we can count on Pentecostal days, because the Holy Spirit is necessarily limited on account of the state of the vessel.<a name=83:15></a> You understand that I am not speaking of the <i>Person</i> of the Spirit of God, for He is God Himself; but the state of the vessel is so extremely paralysed and weak that the operations of the Spirit are necessarily limited; but, nevertheless, the blessed Spirit of God remains, and everything now hinges on our faith.<a name=83:16></a>

		And so as King Joash says, "My father!<a name=83:17></a> my father!<a name=83:18></a> the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof", Elisha says, "Take bow and arrows".<a name=83:19></a> It is through you that the power of these horsemen and the chariot is to be expressed.<a name=83:20></a> I take it to myself.<a name=83:21></a> If I speak of the Spirit, if I speak of Pentecost, and of the power of God that shone there, I take it to myself.<a name=83:22></a> It is for each of us to say to himself, "This power is to be exercised through <i>me</i>".<a name=83:23></a> It is thus we come into the power of God.<a name=83:24></a> And so the prophet says, "Take bow and arrows", these being the symbols in

		I want now to come to what is very searching, because whilst he shot that one arrow towards the east, the prophet's hands steadied him.<a name=84:14></a> It was not then a question of the king's power, because he had not any.<a name=84:15></a> It was a question of the power of Elisha, weak though he was in the sickness whereof he died.<a name=84:16></a> But there was power there.<a name=84:17></a> The apostle Paul realised that power as no one else -- "since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:3">2 Corinthians  13:3</a>) -- and moreover he preached the gospel by that power, by the power of Christ speaking in Him.<a name=84:18></a> From Jerusalem and round about Illyricum he preached it fully.<a name=84:19></a> He realised it more than anyone.<a name=84:20></a> Now we have come to a day of weakness.<a name=84:21></a> We cannot look for Pauline strength.<a name=84:22></a> What we can hope for now in humility is the hands of Elisha in his sickness.<a name=84:23></a> I hope that you will be able, spiritually, to understand that it refers not to the weakness of Christ, but to the weakness of the <i>vessel</i>.<a name=84:24></a> It refers to the limited conditions that

		You will observe in these passages in the Old Testament the occurrence of the word 'nail', or 'nails' and, no doubt, you will assume I have in mind to connect the thought expressed in them with the passage in the letter to the Corinthians, which I read, because I would seek to show how the things of God are <i>secured</i> and held together divinely.<a name=142:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to say at the outset that the idea of the nails enters into the truth of resurrection.<a name=142:2></a> There can be no holding things, save on that principle, and so I read from the second epistle to the Corinthians because the apostle speaks there of having preached among the Corinthians the Son of God.<a name=142:3></a> There had been, indeed, a threefold presentation of the Son of God to the Corinthians by Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus, suggesting to us that the apostle and the other preachers were concerned that the truth of the Son of God should be firmly in their souls, and Paul's preaching of the Son of God was on the principle, as we read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:4">Romans  1:4</a>, that He had been "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection <i>of the dead</i>" as it should read.<a name=142:4></a> Not simply His own resurrection.<a name=142:5></a> The declaration began to take form in His ministry in the raising of the widow's son at the gate of Nain, in Luke, and in the raising of Lazarus, in John.<a name=142:6></a> In these instances we have witnesses of His power as the Son of God.<a name=142:7></a> But then He invaded death <i>Himself</i>.<a name=142:8></a> We see in His <i>emotions</i>, His <i>groan</i>, at the grave of Lazarus, His deep resentment of death in its sway over the people of God, and so, in order to follow up that deep groan, and those tears at Bethany, He invaded death, and, as we read, "annulled" it.<a name=142:9></a> He came out of it.<a name=142:10></a> He

		And so you have at the outset in these passages the suggestion of a nail; that is, One great enough to sustain in His own Person every divine weight.<a name=143:7></a> In the Old Testament you have the thought in the book of Zechariah that <i>from God</i> comes the nail; (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#10:4">Zechariah  10:4</a>).<a name=143:8></a> The corner-stone, and the nail, and the battle-axe, and the ruler, all proceed from God.<a name=143:9></a> But I will confine myself to the nail, so that we may see how divine purposes, and divine thoughts and principles, are all gathered up and secured in Christ risen from the dead.<a name=143:10></a> It is impossible that one of them can slip.<a name=143:11></a> Not an iota, as He says, of the law can pass away unfulfilled.<a name=143:12></a> Not a counsel of God can remain unfulfilled.<a name=143:13></a> Not a promise of God can remain unfulfilled.<a name=143:14></a> Whatever promises there have been "in him are yea, and in him Amen", as we read in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:20">2 Corinthians  1:20</a>.<a name=143:15></a> And then, beloved friends, not only these abstract things, but all the persons that have been in divine counsel are hung on Christ, so to say.<a name=143:16></a> He is great enough to sustain every one of us.<a name=143:17></a> A]l vessels, great and small, as we read in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#22">Isaiah  22</a>, are hanging on this great Person, whom God has fastened as a nail in a sure place (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#22:25">Isaiah  22:25</a>).<a name=143:18></a> All the glory of His Father's house, whatever thought came out in David, whatever came out in Jacob, Isaac or Abraham,

		I have in mind to speak about the family of God, which, as you will see by the passage in the first chapter of John, is composed of those <i>who receive Christ</i>.<a name=154:1></a> God makes Christ the test in every connection, and those who receive Him belong to His family.<a name=154:2></a> It was in His mind from the beginning to have a family, and so with that family in view, as the descendants of Noah had decided to turn away from Him, He blessed Shem.<a name=154:3></a> He curses one family in the announcement of Noah, and He blesses Shem, because in Shem there should arise a family suitable to Him, Abraham being in the direct line of Shem; so God blesses Shem, and in calling out Abraham (whose name signifies, Father), He speaks of him later as "a wholly right seed".<a name=154:4></a> God intending to have a family wholly according to His own mind, He appeared to Abraham, we are told, which was a very great distinction, and subsequent developments bring to light the import of that appearing, for we have in Abraham a reflection of the heart of God in regard to his family.<a name=154:5></a> He, we are told, dwelt with Isaac and Jacob in tents, the heirs with him of the same promise.<a name=154:6></a> We have thus an indication, beloved friends, that God intends to dwell with His family.<a name=154:7></a> Hence how great a thing it is to belong to the family of God!<a name=154:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=165:2></a> I think these scriptures would indicate how Peter's ministry prepared the way for Paul's economy; I refer to the action of Peter in going down to Lydda of his own voluntary will, as it would appear he did.<a name=165:3></a> It is said that he, passing through all quarters, came down to the saints there and raised up neas, saying, "Rise up, and make thy couch for thyself".<a name=165:4></a> He anticipated what was to come about through Paul's ministry, namely, that there were to be assemblies formed, and these were to be so constituted that they could make, as it were, their own beds, and he indicates, I think, how the work of God was to proceed.<a name=165:5></a> He goes to Lydda as "passing through all quarters"; that is to say, it was in a universal way, but when he goes to Joppa it is as sent for, and the Spirit of God mentions that Lydda was <i>near</i> to Joppa.<a name=165:6></a>

		Paul's first letter to Corinth has a wider bearing than the second.<a name=166:2></a> The first is to the "assembly of God which is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=166:3></a> The second is "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia".<a name=166:4></a> Then the letter to the Galatians is addressed, not to the 'saints' in Galatia, but to the <i>assemblies</i> of Galatia, meaning in every instance that what was to exercise authority -- the authority of the Lord -- was the assembly.<a name=166:5></a> Others addressed with the assembly would indicate that they should be governed in their localities by the principles set out in the epistles.<a name=166:6></a> The apostle distinguishes between what is general and what is local by the pronouns 'we' and 'ye'.<a name=166:7></a> "The bread which <i>we</i> break" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a>) is the general thought.<a name=166:8></a> Peter's work, I believe, in these chapters indicates what underlies the whole system.<a name=166:9></a> Each company is to be able to make its own bed for itself, and if help be needed, the indication is plain enough that it is to be from the neighbourhood of need.<a name=166:10></a> They sent for Peter because Lydda was near to Joppa; and if help be needed at a distance, it is by the order of heaven and that has to be made plain.<a name=166:11></a> Peter did not claim liberty to go of himself; and he was very explicit in explaining his service at Caesarea when he went to Jerusalem; he showed that the movement was God's, not his.<a name=166:12></a> It was a long distance from Joppa to Caesarea, but these distances are of no moment to heaven; the point is whether heaven orders them, and if heaven orders them, this must make it plain.<a name=166:13></a> So Peter is very explicit; at Jerusalem he says, "What was I, that I could withstand God?<a name=166:14></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:17">Acts  11:17</a>).<a name=166:15></a> It is God's doing, and if it be God's doing, the saints bow.<a name=166:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These passages, as you will observe, treat of light.<a name=176:1></a> The apostle Paul says much about light, and I wish to draw attention particularly to the qualities of the light of which he speaks.<a name=176:2></a> John speaks much of light also, connecting it with the Person of Christ -- Son of God -- the Word become flesh and dwelling amongst men, but Paul speaks of it rather in connection with the place whence it came; so that we have in the first passage read his full estimate of the light that shone round him and those who were journeying with him, as he drew near to the city of Damascus whither he was going.<a name=176:3></a> The Holy Spirit tells us in chapter 9:3 that it was a "light from heaven", while the apostle himself, speaking to the Jews later (chapter 22:6), says it was "a great light" from heaven, but in speaking to king Agrippa and those with him on the occasion of which we have a record in this chapter, his heart seems moved, and it expresses itself with emphasis in the form of an exclamation.<a name=176:4></a> Wherever you have this in scriptural writers, you have movement of heart indicated.<a name=176:5></a> Exclamations mean that one is peculiarly touched by the matter in hand, so that we have here, "At midday, O king", and again, "Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision".<a name=176:6></a> His heart was in it, hence he says it was "a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me".<a name=176:7></a> It exceeded all known light in brightness.<a name=176:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I make these remarks, because I intend them to be the basis of all I have to say at this time.<a name=176:9></a> The light that shone round about Paul and his fellow-travellers was intended to convey to him, and to us,

		the character of the light that has come to us from Christ in heaven.<a name=177:1></a> It exceeds all other light, and it is what may be called 'our' light.<a name=177:2></a> Indeed, the quotation in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:14">Ephesians  5:14</a> refers undoubtedly to that remarkable chapter in Isaiah which speaks about Israel's light.<a name=177:3></a> The apostle speaks of what is written, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee".<a name=177:4></a> In Old Testament language it is, "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#60:1">Isaiah  60:1</a>).<a name=177:5></a> That word will be spoken to Israel in a coming day; she will be called upon to arise and shine for her light has come -- note, <i>her</i> light -- "<i>thy</i> light is come".<a name=177:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth written to the Ephesians corresponds, as developed in the saints, to this great light of which Paul speaks to Agrippa.<a name=177:7></a> Ephesians is, as developed by the Spirit in us, a light above the brightness of the sun.<a name=177:8></a> The heavenly city will not need the light of the sun or of the moon.<a name=177:9></a> God and the Lamb will be there, and they shall be the light thereof.<a name=177:10></a> In the interior of that city there will be immediate contact with the Father and the Son, so that the light will exceed all known light.<a name=177:11></a> The epistle to the Ephesians, as rightly understood by us, involves that we are already in that light that exceeds all known light -- a light which he mentions shone at midday, meaning that the sun was in its zenith, shining down in its eastern power and brilliancy upon him.<a name=177:12></a> Yet the light which shone out of heaven was brighter than that, so that the light that shines, works out in the epistle to the Ephesians as a light for our souls.<a name=177:13></a>

		I want to show further that when the apostle says, "When we were all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul", we are reminded that we cannot stand upon our feet as natural men and women in the presence of this light.<a name=177:14></a> No one then living, perhaps, had more

		I believe it laid on my mind of the Lord to speak about peace, and to show that it is of heaven, and that its product, a son of peace, is consequently of heaven.<a name=186:1></a> You will remember that Luke in recording the circumstances of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ speaks about a multitude of the heavenly host; they were praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:14">Luke  2:14</a>).<a name=186:2></a> They indicated that peace on earth was in the mind of God, and the Babe of whom they spoke and whose birth they celebrated was the guarantee of that peace.<a name=186:3></a> But later in his gospel as the Lord at the close of His life here was entering into Jerusalem, it was said, "Peace in heaven" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19:38">Luke  19:38</a>).<a name=186:4></a> Peace on earth was therefore deferred, for, indeed, the Lord in the meantime had said that He was not come to give peace on earth but rather division; but His entrance into Jerusalem was accompanied by the prophetic statement, for such it was, "Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest".<a name=186:5></a> He had already said that He beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.<a name=186:6></a> His fall would not promote peace on earth, but it would make room for peace in heaven.<a name=186:7></a> Peace on earth is deferred.<a name=186:8></a> It will come about in due course, but the establishment of peace in heaven precedes it, for God operates out of heaven beginning thence.<a name=186:9></a> And so I read from Ephesians because it refers to the position in heaven.<a name=186:10></a> It contemplates Christ there and the assembly there.<a name=186:11></a>

		Now I wish to show how this truth in Ephesians is to work out in local companies of the people of God at the present time.<a name=187:11></a> So I read from that section in Luke because, as I hope we shall see, it treats of local furnishings, and local furnishings are of a piece with general furnishings, for the economy of the assembly requires that there be no variations, hence the word is, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies".<a name=187:12></a> One heard recently in visiting a certain place that there was a custom there, a very simple thing, a mere item, but it was a local custom, and a local custom is simply an innovation, and an innovation is foreign to the assembly.<a name=187:13></a> The assembly is out of heaven morally, its furnishings are out of heaven,

		A son of peace, as having received the gospel, is one who has an understanding of what is in heaven.<a name=188:4></a> He has received the gospel preached by the Lord Himself -- glad tidings of peace.<a name=188:5></a> He is a <i>son</i> of peace, which means that he is developed in the idea of it; he will not give way to disturbance, but holds to that which rules in heaven and maintains it at all costs.<a name=188:6></a> The emissaries of Christ as entering into a town or place should look for such an one "If a son of peace be there".<a name=188:7></a>

		Are there to be localities in which Christ is received?<a name=190:1></a> There are; and so the Lord appoints seventy.<a name=190:2></a> I wish we might take this in, for it is of immense importance.<a name=190:3></a> The seventy are sent "two and two before his face into every city and <i>place</i> where he himself was about to come"; and He directs them, for He is bent on the success of their service.<a name=190:4></a> He goes into details as to how they were to be governed in this mission; He says, "and into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace to this house.<a name=190:5></a> And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it".<a name=190:6></a> The mission was to take account of houses, and as they enter into the house, they were to inquire if a son of peace were there.<a name=190:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is a very practical matter.<a name=190:8></a> Are we sons of peace?<a name=190:9></a> If local meetings do not begin with sons of peace, trouble will soon arise; as the <i>Psalmist</i> says, "I am for peace; .<a name=190:10></a>.<a name=190:11></a>.<a name=190:12></a> they are for war" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#120:7">Psalm  120:7</a>).<a name=190:13></a> So one must look into one's heart and see if one is formed out of heaven -- a son of peace.<a name=190:14></a> The son of peace corresponds with one of the assembly.<a name=190:15></a> "If two of you"; there it is two of the assembly, and what I would say about that passage in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>is that administration is in the assembly.<a name=190:16></a> Heaven has committed itself to the assembly.<a name=190:17></a> Administration is not in the hands of the elders of the assembly, it is in the hands of the assembly.<a name=190:18></a> "Tell it to the assembly", it says, not to the elders, "and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer".<a name=190:19></a> And then later, "Again I say to you", the Lord says, "If two of you", that is, two of the assembly.<a name=190:20></a> That calls up the question of responsibility.<a name=190:21></a> In the Old Testament the idea of eldership is intended to convey the idea of responsibility.<a name=190:22></a> The types have their own language and they convey the idea of responsibility in those who are the elders, but to carry that out literally now, would be to set aside the assembly
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=191>[Page 191]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and to assume that all administration is in the hands of elders, which is not true; whereas the truth of the New Testament is that administration is in the hands of the assembly.<a name=191:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord in addressing the assemblies addresses the angel, not the angels.<a name=191:2></a> "To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:1">Revelation  2:1</a>).<a name=191:3></a> That is not simply one person in Ephesus.<a name=191:4></a> It is spiritual language, for Scripture has its own vocabulary, and it means to convey that Ephesus had its own responsibility, and that that responsibility included every Christian in Ephesus.<a name=191:5></a> If any one disclaim it he is not of the assembly.<a name=191:6></a> He does not belong to "two of you"; but he who accepts it belongs to the assembly characteristically.<a name=191:7></a> He may say, I am very weak, but "If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven".<a name=191:8></a> The whole power of heaven is available to two of us, however weak; and again, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=191:9></a> Is there not power for administration in such a company?<a name=191:10></a> It is not a question of elders there, but of those gathered to His name; <i>He</i> is there.<a name=191:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, Peter, in order to make way for Paul's ministry, in visiting Lydda, says to neas, "Jesus Christ maketh thee whole".<a name=191:12></a> Jesus Christ is here to provide material for the assembly, "Rise up and make thy couch for thyself" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:34">Acts  9:34</a>).<a name=191:13></a> So neas is able to make his bed for himself, and that is the principle that underlies every local company.<a name=191:14></a> The Lord is with them; they face the problem; heaven is available to them; they can pray; and the Lord Jesus, in whose hands all power in heaven and on earth is vested, is with them.<a name=191:15></a> That is the position.<a name=191:16></a> That is the position of the assembly economy at the present time, and anything that sets that aside is against the truth.<a name=191:17></a> The Lord is with local companies, and He

		enables them to administer and to carry out the will of heaven upon earth.<a name=192:1></a> Any such local companies must be sons of peace.<a name=192:2></a> They must be formed of sons of peace, for the Lord is sure to come.<a name=192:3></a> He sends these seventy persons two and two into every place to which He intended to come; He is sure to come.<a name=192:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, if a son of peace be in the house into which ye enter, let your peace rest upon it.<a name=192:5></a> You have a house.<a name=192:6></a> Is it owned by a son of peace?<a name=192:7></a> If so, the peace of Christ, through His missionaries, will rest upon that house.<a name=192:8></a> We see thus that our houses have more to do with the peace or trouble of the assembly than we are apt to think, hence the importance of having peace reigning in our houses.<a name=192:9></a> The Lord is sure to come, and as He comes He finds not only a son of peace, but his house possessed of peace, and thus he represents the material for the local company.<a name=192:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is more that follows in the chapter to establish all this.<a name=192:11></a> As the seventy returned to Him and spoke of the power that was operative in them over what was evil, the Lord says, "In this rejoice not .<a name=192:12></a>.<a name=192:13></a>.<a name=192:14></a> but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven"; He is dealing really with material for the local assemblies, and whilst the overthrow of Satanic power is of great importance, what is greater is that their names are written in heaven.<a name=192:15></a> In other words the idea is introduced that we really belong to heaven, and are thus ennobled and fitted to receive Christ as He visits us, "every city and place, whither he himself would come".<a name=192:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show, just in passing, a very practical illustration of all I am saying.<a name=192:17></a> In the end of the chapter the Lord visits a certain village.<a name=192:18></a> Its name is not given, but it was the village of Mary and Martha.<a name=192:19></a> Martha had a house and she received the Lord into it, but what was the state of her soul?<a name=192:20></a> It were well indeed to receive Him, but what was the state of her soul?<a name=192:21></a> Was she a son of peace?<a name=192:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=193>[Page 193]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let the word itself answer.<a name=193:1></a> She complained about her sister; she complained that her sister was allowing her to serve alone.<a name=193:2></a> Who was her sister?<a name=193:3></a> She was a son of peace.<a name=193:4></a> Mary sat at the feet of Jesus.<a name=193:5></a> She knew how to sit.<a name=193:6></a> One of the greatest lessons to be learned by us is to learn how to sit.<a name=193:7></a> Many of us live in our service, others in the meetings, in the whirl of things; that is not sitting, beloved.<a name=193:8></a> If you were to enter into heaven, you would find no turmoil or disturbance there, no running hither and thither.<a name=193:9></a> Mary was one of those who had learned to sit at the feet of Jesus.<a name=193:10></a> We find her again in John sitting in the house.<a name=193:11></a> Martha ran out to meet Him, but Mary sat still in the house.<a name=193:12></a> Presently the Master calls and she moves at His call.<a name=193:13></a> She had learned to sit in the house; she had learned not to be governed by turmoil and excitement; she had learned to sit, and she sat still in the house until the Master came and called for her.<a name=193:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Martha is complaining against a son of peace.<a name=193:15></a> I do not say Martha was not one at bottom, for she was; she was one whom the Lord could rebuke effectively, and He says, "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: but one thing is needful" -- and a son of peace knows what that is -- "and Mary hath chosen that good part".<a name=193:16></a> It was not a mere accident; she <i>chose</i> to sit at His feet.<a name=193:17></a> It is a fine tribute to Mary that she chose something which should not be taken away from her.<a name=193:18></a> She was in accord with heaven.<a name=193:19></a> Heaven was interested in Jesus and she was in accord with heaven.<a name=193:20></a> A son of peace is the product of heaven, maintaining heavenly conditions upon earth, conditions that Jesus appreciates.<a name=193:21></a> How He valued that son of peace as she sat at His feet.<a name=193:22></a> It was a genuine pleasure to Him -- a delight to His heart.<a name=193:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Referring now to the next chapter, we find the Lord was praying in a certain place; "when he
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

		ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray .<a name=194:1></a>.<a name=194:2></a>.<a name=194:3></a> and he said unto them, When ye pray, say", meaning that He would teach the sons of peace.<a name=194:4></a> Not going into what follows, I just want to call attention to the reference to the Father as <i>of heaven</i>.<a name=194:5></a> If we are sons of peace on earth and desirous of having heavenly conditions for Christ in our localities, we may be sure that the Father who is <i>of heaven</i> (for that is how it ought to be read) will be with us.<a name=194:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a> it is, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is <i>in the heavens</i>".<a name=194:7></a> Matthew is "in heaven", because it is a question of the Father's administration in that gospel, but Luke is "of heaven"; it is the character.<a name=194:8></a> And so He says, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=194:9></a>" The Father answers the prayers of the sons of peace.<a name=194:10></a> They wish heavenly conditions here, and they ask the Father, and He gives according to the wealth of heaven; He gives in no niggardly way, but according to the bounty of heaven.<a name=194:11></a> He is of heaven, and what He gives is heaven's best gift, and it is only by the possession of the Spirit in our localities that we can have collective conditions according to heaven.<a name=194:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not add more, but I would urge the thought of <i>sons of peace</i> and <i>the result of their desires</i> -- the Father acting with them to have conditions suitable to Christ.<a name=194:13></a> The conditions that are entirely suitable to Christ are in heaven; He is the Son of man which is in heaven.<a name=194:14></a> Paul brings out our correspondence with Him; "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:48">1 Corinthians  15:48</a>).<a name=194:15></a> Our heavenly status is assured -- an assured heavenly status -- not a prospect, but a fact, so that we are in accord with heaven, and we seek conditions suitable to Christ in the meantime.<a name=194:16></a> The time of His receiving up is come, the Lord is

		J.T.<a name=197:14></a> That is what I was thinking.<a name=197:15></a> The manner in which the Holy Spirit is brought in here is very striking, because the Lord is speaking about Him as in the believer, not exactly as in chapter 14 -- another Comforter, but as in the believer.<a name=197:16></a> Another thing to be noted is, He is speaking in reference to the Scriptures -- "as the scripture hath said".<a name=197:17></a> This would lead to diligent inquiry, because He does not give chapter and verse, nor even the book.<a name=197:18></a> It is a wholesome reminder of the importance of reading Scripture.<a name=197:19></a> It is a very striking fact that John brings in the Scriptures in view of the last times; he emphasises in a most striking way the importance of the Scriptures; as it says in chapter 2:22, "When therefore he was risen from the dead .<a name=197:20></a>.<a name=197:21></a>.<a name=197:22></a> they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said".<a name=197:23></a> Many of us, I fear, are very deficient in regard to Scripture; unless we read it we cannot believe it, and, again, we are cast on the Lord as to understanding.<a name=197:24></a> Reading in itself is of little use; Philip said to the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest?<a name=197:25></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:30">Acts  8:30</a>).<a name=197:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak about victory -- a word that enters into our present circumstances in a peculiar way, for the history of the assembly, given us in Revelation, contemplates that in every age there should be victors or overcomers; and, in the last four addresses, an ear to hear what the Spirit has to say is made to depend on personal victory or overcoming.<a name=207:1></a> And so it is in my mind to show how provision is made, even in a day of weakness, for victory.<a name=207:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First you will observe that it is said, in Corinthians, that God <i>gives</i> it to us.<a name=207:3></a> It is not put as a matter of the future; it is given now.<a name=207:4></a> "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=207:5></a> And what is thus given is within our range.<a name=207:6></a> It does not imply that the Corinthians had it; had they had it, in a characteristic way, there would have been no need for this long, instructive chapter, a chapter which carries rebuke, for some of them said there was no resurrection.<a name=207:7></a> "How say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?<a name=207:8></a>" he says, and when the scripture uses such language, "Some among you", it means to convey that all are responsible, even as the Lord said to His disciples, "One of you".<a name=207:9></a> The obligation would come to all of us, and so if there be any, in any of our companies, denying any part of the truth, the onus belongs to all in it, and each has to see to it that he clears himself.<a name=207:10></a>

		God-given exactly, but as acquired, and so he mentions three things.<a name=208:1></a> The first has reference to every true Christian: "Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world".<a name=208:2></a> It is its character.<a name=208:3></a> It is not 'whosoever', but "whatsoever", and if that "whatsoever" does not apply to any of us, then we are not Christians, for every true Christian is born of God, and there is that in him which overcomes the world in the principle of it.<a name=208:4></a> Then what follows upon that is "our faith".<a name=208:5></a> If there be any one who has not this he cannot be regarded as a Christian.<a name=208:6></a> You will observe that the better translation reads, "This is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith".<a name=208:7></a> There is that which has been brought in by Christ, a system of teaching established in this world, held in the souls of the people of God, which has overcome the world.<a name=208:8></a> I apprehend that the apostles brought in that system of truth which was received into the souls of believers, and which overcame the world.<a name=208:9></a> There were systems before -- the Jewish system, many Oriental systems, and some Western ones, but they were essentially of the world.<a name=208:10></a> I know that the Old Testament system was typical, and in that sense was heavenly and of God, but as it existed in Jerusalem when the Lord Jesus taught there, it was worldly.<a name=208:11></a> It had deteriorated, so that it became a tradition, and rose no higher morally than any other Oriental system; whereas the Lord introduces a system of teaching, confirming it by the ministry of the apostles in the power of the Spirit, which in the very essence of it overcame the world.<a name=208:12></a> It brought down the world in the souls of those who received it, as seen in the ministry of Paul at Ephesus; there were no minds capable of standing against the teaching of Paul there, for the world was brought down; it was overthrown in the minds and hearts of those who received the testimony.<a name=208:13></a>

		Christians had something that rendered them different from any other system, religious or philosophical.<a name=209:1></a> They had something that overcame the world.<a name=209:2></a> The superiority of the system had been set out and displayed for all those who came into it.<a name=209:3></a> Those of us who have come into it have proved it; we have proved that it overthrows in our souls and in our minds every element of the intellectual and religious world, and all other features of the world.<a name=209:4></a> It is incomparable.<a name=209:5></a> The system that we have, beloved friends, is incomparable, to such an extent that it has overcome the world, and the world knows that it is overcome by that which is superior, and it can never lift up its head again in the presence of those who are in the faith.<a name=209:6></a>

		by which the Jordan was divided?<a name=212:1></a> The poor king knew nothing of that, like many of us.<a name=212:2></a> It is well, dear brethren, to humble ourselves, and to see the greatness of an earlier day as compared with our own.<a name=212:3></a> Nevertheless victory is available, and so the king is directed to take a bow and arrows, and the prophet in his weakness placed his hands upon the king's hands.<a name=212:4></a> For what latent strength was there in the poor king?<a name=212:5></a> The strength was in Elisha; nevertheless it was happy for the king that he placed himself so near the vessel of power.<a name=212:6></a> He had come to the source of power; he humbly submitted to the guidance of the prophet, and hence possible victory.<a name=212:7></a> It is well to understand the potentialities.<a name=212:8></a> What is not possible to us as we are subject to, and as we submit to be connected with, the vessel of power?<a name=212:9></a> There is such -- wavering power, it is true, because of the state of the vessel -- the state of the assembly; nevertheless it is the only vessel of power.<a name=212:10></a> There is none elsewhere.<a name=212:11></a> The Holy Spirit still remains, and He acts through vessels, and those vessels are believers who belong to the assembly.<a name=212:12></a> The power is available through them.<a name=212:13></a>

		But how many of us have part in it?<a name=213:6></a> How many of us are overcomers?<a name=213:7></a> That is the question for each of us.<a name=213:8></a> So the prophet says now, "Take the arrows".<a name=213:9></a> He says nothing about the bow; the bow has reference to what God has done in Christ, and to what He will do.<a name=213:10></a> God can act everywhere, and He does; but when you come to the arrow, I am dealing with myself.<a name=213:11></a> "Smite upon the ground", he says.<a name=213:12></a> That is another matter.<a name=213:13></a> It is another matter, beloved brethren, when I discover that the difficulty lies in my own breast.<a name=213:14></a> You will remember how one smote upon his breast, and said, "O God, have compassion on me, the sinner" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#18:13">Luke  18:13</a>).<a name=213:15></a> So Paul says, "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:18">Romans  7:18</a>).<a name=213:16></a> Then abandon it.<a name=213:17></a> Refuse to use it in your service.<a name=213:18></a> Have no confidence in it.<a name=213:19></a> It has proved a broken reed to millions, and it will prove that to you.<a name=213:20></a> Whatever form of the flesh you employ in the testimony, it will fail you, and not only fail you, but fail those who are trusting you, for we are all more or less influential.<a name=213:21></a> We are either influential for good or for evil, and if others lean upon me, and I lean upon the flesh, what will the end be but a reed piercing through us, to our sorrow?<a name=213:22></a> The apostle went through untold agony to discover the flesh, and he arrives at a definite conclusion; he has no hesitation whatever:

		Now it will be observed that in the beginning of the book, one man falls; the king of Israel fell down, and another man is taken up into heaven; so that Christianity, foreshadowed in Elisha, is set up here in that which, although outwardly retaining its power to oppose, is nevertheless known to be fallen.<a name=218:2></a> The foundations of the world were sapped in the death of Christ.<a name=218:3></a> The Lord said, as He was about to die, "Now is the judgment of this world .<a name=218:4></a>.<a name=218:5></a>.<a name=218:6></a> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:31">John  12:31</a>,32).<a name=218:7></a> It is on this ground that the testimony went out; the death of Christ settled the question of righteousness, and the resurrection of Christ demonstrated the superiority of divine power over this world and the prince of it; it involved the fall of the world.<a name=218:8></a> The Lord in Luke anticipates all that, for He says, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:18">Luke  10:18</a>).<a name=218:9></a> The Lord, entering in as having accomplished righteousness, must displace him who is there; so Satan falls as lightning; he is effectively displaced, and the powers of evil have been dealt with, and spoiled.<a name=218:10></a>

		So that the foundations of the world are broken up, and Elisha has returned across the Jordan in that power.<a name=218:11></a> It was in that power that the testimony was set up in the Acts.<a name=218:12></a> Elisha had said to Elijah, "My father, my father!<a name=218:13></a> the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof!<a name=218:14></a>".<a name=218:15></a> For the prophet went up in a chariot of fire with horses of fire.<a name=218:16></a> Could all the power of the world combined interfere with that ascent?<a name=218:17></a> The poor sons of the prophets would attempt to deny the great fact that Elijah went up, as many have sought to deny the great antitype; but Elijah could not be found; he <i>had</i> gone up, and Elisha was clothed with the spirit and power of Elijah.<a name=218:18></a> He set

		And so he proceeds from one point to another, indicating the various features of the testimony, in that power.<a name=219:4></a> I would that I could convey to you, beloved friends, the power in which the gospel was announced on the day of Pentecost, and the power that possessed believers on that day.<a name=219:5></a> It was a wonderful day; in Christianity grace is connected with power, and that is what runs through this section of 2 Kings.<a name=219:6></a> There is the power of God on the one hand, and grace connected with it on the other; in other words, it is the power of God acting in grace.<a name=219:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show how we are brought into accord with this, because God does not intend that the testimony should be carried on otherwise.<a name=219:8></a> As the Lord said to Philadelphia, "Thou hast a little power" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a>).<a name=219:9></a> There may be a diminution of quantity, but not of quality, and I wish to point out from chapter 4 how we come into correspondence with Christ.<a name=219:10></a> The chapter deals with the saints viewed as in possession of the Spirit; first there is the widow who becomes possessed of wealth, and then the married woman who has means, but is childless.<a name=219:11></a> Unless there be children, there can be no continuance of the testimony.<a name=219:12></a> So the prophet, through the aid of his servant Gehazi, discerned the need.<a name=219:13></a> The woman had means; she provided for the prophet, prepared a room for him; she behaved herself nobly.<a name=219:14></a> She was a spiritual person typically, she had the Spirit in that sense.<a name=219:15></a> She made room for Christ as the vessel of testimony.<a name=219:16></a> She discerned that Elisha

		You will notice, dear brethren, that whilst she is the wife, the initiative is all hers; the husband is in the background.<a name=220:4></a> We are therefore reminded of the saints in their exercises as having the Spirit; the subjective side is in view here.<a name=220:5></a> And so, when the lad becomes ill, he goes to his father, but his father immediately sends him back to his mother, and she takes him on her knees.<a name=220:6></a> I wish we had more maternal solicitude in regard to the young ones.<a name=220:7></a> We all know that young believers' minds travel much more rapidly than their feet -- and indeed that may be so with all of us; but with the young especially it is so, and they are apt to speak freely of things of which they know nothing spiritually.<a name=220:8></a> It is well, however, that they should speak of the things of God, and the people of God, rather than of the things of this world.<a name=220:9></a> The lad goes to his father at the time of harvest, and as they were reaping he says, "My head, my head".<a name=220:10></a> The trouble was in the head, and notwithstanding the nursing of the mother -- for the father discerned that it was a matter for the mother -- he died.<a name=220:11></a> His last words, so far as we know, were "my head, my head".<a name=220:12></a> You will recollect how, in Deuteronomy, the priest's portion from the sacrifices was the jawbone and the maw -- the stomach -- meaning that we have to live upon the truth; it is not merely food for the head, but it is to be assimilated in the system, so that I become, not in my head, but in my spirit, soul and body, characterised by the word of God; I am formed and nourished by it.<a name=220:13></a> But this young man had trouble in the head.<a name=220:14></a> It is important, surely, to have a mind, but the Holy Spirit, in Romans, brings about a renewal of the mind, and in Ephesians in the

		So the mother knew what was needed, and she went to the prophet.<a name=221:3></a> The prophet himself seemed to be below the mark at the time.<a name=221:4></a> She had laid the child on the bed of the man of God, for she recognised where the power was; and it is a great thing for us, dear brethren, to know just where to go.<a name=221:5></a> I believe this scripture indicates a disease common among the people of God, but the saints are to know where the remedy lies.<a name=221:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Gehazi is sent, with the prophet's staff, which he laid on the face of the lad, as Elisha had said, but that did not suffice.<a name=221:7></a> Experience will not do.<a name=221:8></a> There are old brothers amongst us; experience is most valuable, experience with God, none other.<a name=221:9></a> A man might live a thousand years twice told, but it is experience <i>with God</i> that counts.<a name=221:10></a> But even that suffices not, for the staff was laid upon the face of the child, but there was "neither voice nor hearing".<a name=221:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Elisha comes, and sees the child dead, laid upon his bed.<a name=221:12></a> Elisha had rights there; he could shut the door, and he did it.<a name=221:13></a> You will recall how Peter shut out the widows in order to raise up Dorcas.<a name=221:14></a> The prophet's bed was his, and the room was his; it had been given to him, and he had rights in that chamber.<a name=221:15></a> Is there a place amongst us, beloved, where the Lord has absolute rights to do as He wills?<a name=221:16></a> He looks for such a condition.<a name=221:17></a> He Himself put out the crowd when He raised the daughter of Jairus.<a name=221:18></a>

		Now the sixth chapter refers to our service.<a name=223:5></a> In chapter 4 the lad is brought into correspondence to Christ and he is in the bosom of the saints; the mother is invited to come and take him, and she worships; she is thankful; she values the son brought back in this way.<a name=223:6></a> He will never again die from disease in the head.<a name=223:7></a> In chapter 6 it is, as I have already said, a question of service, but here, again, we have what corresponds to a diseased head, that is, losing something morally.<a name=223:8></a> Christianity is not made up of borrowed things; it is what belongs to us -- what is our own.<a name=223:9></a> Christ has restored everything; He has gone up on high, passed through the heavens, and given gifts unto men.<a name=223:10></a> The Holy Spirit here is not borrowed; we have untold wealth of our own, but this axe was borrowed, and hence it fell into the water.<a name=223:11></a> They were cutting down wood; they had the best intentions; they were governed by right principles, because they had come to Jordan, but they have to learn that the enlargement must be with instruments out of death, not with borrowed ones.<a name=223:12></a> We have to understand that we have infinite wealth, but it has all to be used on the principle of life out of death.<a name=223:13></a> The instruments are for those who understand resurrection power, and in such wise as to be superior to death, because it says, the iron swam, in response to the wood.<a name=223:14></a> The figure refers to the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=223:15></a> We can only cope with the power of death as understanding the power of life in Christ, so that the weapons of our warfare

		Now I want to make a few comments on chapter 13.<a name=224:2></a> We have seen in chapter 4 a young man made to live according to Christ, which illustrates the truth in Colossians; then in chapter 6 we have the power of resurrection, in the iron being made to swim, but now we have in this chapter a man raised.<a name=224:3></a> So far the principle of burial has not been brought in.<a name=224:4></a> It says in verse 20 that Elisha died, and they buried him.<a name=224:5></a> From the resurrection of Isaac, typically, the principle of burial is prominent in Scripture; burial is thus in the light of resurrection.<a name=224:6></a> "Elisha died, and they buried him", we read; he may be taken to typify the saints, but he also represents the Lord Jesus, and he does so here, for Paul says Christ died, and was buried.<a name=224:7></a> It is part of the gospel; and if He were buried, it is obvious that all must be buried if there is to be correspondence with Him, so that our baptism is into His death.<a name=224:8></a> "So many of us as were baptised into Jesus Christ were baptised into his death .<a name=224:9></a>.<a name=224:10></a>.<a name=224:11></a> that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:3">Romans  6:3</a>,4).<a name=224:12></a>

		Now I want to make a few remarks on burial.<a name=224:15></a> Elisha died and was buried, and it says they were burying a man.<a name=224:16></a> I believe that at the beginning the moral import of burial was what marked the people of God; they had recourse to burial, that is to say, they were exercised to be true to their baptism.<a name=224:17></a> But the bands of the Moabites invaded the land, and I have no doubt that the bands of the Moabites have invaded all Christendom, and these bands hinder

		Now I think that is what God is bringing about.<a name=225:15></a> The thing was done irregularly; there are a great many things current amongst us that are irregular; let us accept it, dear brethren.<a name=225:16></a> Why should they not bury a man?<a name=225:17></a> They cast him into a grave; nevertheless he got into the right one.<a name=225:18></a> God is overruling everything, and so with us.<a name=225:19></a> He touched the bones of Elisha, and the result was he became alive and stood on his feet.<a name=225:20></a> What can the Moabitish bands do now?<a name=225:21></a> You have got a risen man -- for that is what has happened

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:4></a> It was thought that at the beginning a word on the Spirit would enable the younger ones to follow more intelligently our consideration of the epistle to the Colossians, so we looked at <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>and <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>in connection with <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>and 8.<a name=269:5></a> We saw that the Spirit is given in answer to the sufferings of Christ.<a name=269:6></a> Not only is He given administratively, as expressing the wealth of heaven, the divine gift as at Pentecost, but He is given in answer to the <i>sufferings</i> of Christ (the Rock was <i>smitten</i>), and as so given and recognised by the believer, formation takes place and the believer progresses and acquires territory -- spiritual territory.<a name=269:7></a> He learns to acquire territory, as illustrated in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>in the Israelites taking the cities of the Amorites and dwelling in them.<a name=269:8></a> It was thought that <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>answers to that and that the believer, having the Spirit, has begun to use the Spirit and by the Spirit to acquire things; he cries "Abba, Father", by the Spirit.<a name=269:9></a> He consciously knows relationship with God as his Father.<a name=269:10></a> And then we dwelt on the first chapter of the epistle to the Colossians, in which we saw that the Father delivers us from the authority of darkness and translates us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.<a name=269:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=277:1></a> You can see how in Paul, according to the way he presents himself in this epistle, we have before our eyes a model -- a man who had every means of acquiring the wisdom of this world; he had access to the princes of this world; the princes would be the leaders; he had every means of acquiring all that they had.<a name=277:2></a> He was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, he said, and yet see him at Corinth, he abode at Gilgal and maintained that outward lowliness -- outwardly "a simple person".<a name=277:3></a> As he says, he came "not with excellency of speech or of wisdom" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:1">1 Corinthians  2:1</a>), but maintained his relations with Gilgal.<a name=277:4></a> But it was not that he had not got the hidden wisdom: "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought, but .<a name=277:5></a>.<a name=277:6></a>.<a name=277:7></a> the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:6">1 Corinthians  2:6</a>,7).<a name=277:8></a> Now, that is what he would open up to us in this epistle; with this in view we get what you may call negative ministry, stressing what Gilgal represents.<a name=277:9></a>

		In reading these scriptures I have in mind to enlarge on the idea of judgment; not judgment as conveying what is punitive, but authoritative discrimination amongst the people of God.<a name=343:1></a> We have the announcement in the gospel that, "He hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:31">Acts  17:31</a>).<a name=343:2></a> The world will thus have an authoritative, discriminative rule, under which men will be in peace and prosperity.<a name=343:3></a> The Lord Jesus, I need not say, is that Man; and that God has approved Him in that He has raised Him from the dead.<a name=343:4></a> The divine approbation thus expressed has reference to His ability for this service -- ability which shone in Him in the days of His rejection.<a name=343:5></a>

		Gideon in mind, as we are the brethren of Christ, and thus qualified for judgment, I wish to briefly review the judges of Israel up to Gideon.<a name=345:1></a> Before proceeding to that task, I would be very direct, without having reference to anything special, but to the general state of things among the people of God.<a name=345:2></a> One of the crying needs of the moment is the expression of judgment, of righteous discrimination.<a name=345:3></a> So the apostle in writing to the Corinthians, who were misjudging him in the most ungrateful manner, says, "Now I pray to God .<a name=345:4></a>.<a name=345:5></a>.<a name=345:6></a> that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:7">2 Corinthians  13:7</a>).<a name=345:7></a> And again in treating of the people of God appealing to the law of the land, he says, "Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?<a name=345:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:5">1 Corinthians  6:5</a>).<a name=345:9></a> As it were, one of the royal lineage, one of the culture of the mother, who could adjudicate between his brethren according to God?<a name=345:10></a> You see how essential therefore in our gatherings it is that there should be at least a wise man, and if not a wise man, a wise woman; for how much good a wise woman can do!<a name=345:11></a> It was a wise woman, as recorded in the second book of Samuel, who saved the city of Abel.<a name=345:12></a> Sheba, the son of Bichri, had revolted against David and said, "We have no part of David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#20:1">2 Samuel  20:1</a>).<a name=345:13></a> There was open revolt against the authority of God in Christ, typically.<a name=345:14></a> He drew men after him, and he fled northward and Joab pursued him and besieged him in the city of Abel.<a name=345:15></a> Now there was a wise woman in that city, and by her wisdom she delivered it.<a name=345:16></a> You see she went to the men in the city in her wisdom.<a name=345:17></a> Joab was pressing the siege as an able general would (how often, with the best intentions, we press things!<a name=345:18></a>) the issue being that the inheritance of the Lord is destroyed.<a name=345:19></a> He would destroy a whole city in order to get Sheba.<a name=345:20></a> And it says, "Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom: and they cut off

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I proceed to review the judges of Israel so that we may see the features that are essential to judgment.<a name=346:6></a> Most of us doubtless know that the effect of good judgment among the people of God is that they <i>rest</i>.<a name=346:7></a> The first judge was Othniel.<a name=346:8></a> I wish to dwell on him, because unless we understand what Othniel represents, we shall scarcely be able to judge intelligently in Israel.<a name=346:9></a> He was the son of Caleb's younger brother, thus of excellent family connection.<a name=346:10></a> He belonged to the family of faith.<a name=346:11></a> And so when Caleb offered his daughter as a prize to him who should take Kirjath-sepher, Othniel takes it -- the city of the book.<a name=346:12></a> No one can exercise influence according to God among the saints until he has come to the overthrow of the books of this world.<a name=346:13></a> A man who lives in the religious or secular literature of the day cannot rule the people of God.<a name=346:14></a> We have to be on our guard as to the things by which we are influenced, and what can be more influential than the literature of the day?<a name=346:15></a> How steeped in darkness and confusion men are!<a name=346:16></a> And by such influence we become unfit to rule or sway the saints according to heaven.<a name=346:17></a> Othniel gets Achsah, a type of the assembly.<a name=346:18></a> He is in relation in a sense, typically, with the assembly.<a name=346:19></a> We have got to apprehend the assembly according to what it is to Christ in order to exercise right influence.<a name=346:20></a> We are reminded of one who rejoiced in his sufferings for the body of Christ.<a name=346:21></a> We have to see its intrinsic worth.<a name=346:22></a>
