		J.T.<a name=1:7></a> What is in mind is revival.<a name=1:8></a> We have a prayer in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#85">Psalm  85</a>that the saints might be revived, and in the prophet Habakkuk we have a further prayer that the work of the Lord should be revived.<a name=1:9></a> These prayers are applicable today.<a name=1:10></a> We always have a tendency to droop, to become cold; so that I thought the Lord would help us to consider the outstanding instances of revival in the Old Testament, and perhaps we may be led to go into the New.<a name=1:11></a> So that the thought is to consider Hezekiah first in two readings.<a name=1:12></a> The next chapter (30) introduces the passover which he kept.<a name=1:13></a> His revival is compared with the time of Solomon, "And there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had not been the like in Jerusalem" (verse 26).<a name=1:14></a> Then Josiah's passover -- the revival under Josiah -- is compared with the days of Samuel in chapter 35: 18: "And there was no passover like to that holden in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel hold such a passover as Josiah held .<a name=1:15></a>.<a name=1:16></a>.<a name=1:17></a>".<a name=1:18></a> That goes back further.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third allusion is in Nehemiah: the feast of tabernacles in his days goes back to Joshua.<a name=1:20></a> These comparisons will help us, and it will be observed that the feast of tabernacles is in remnant times.<a name=1:21></a> Nehemiah's time goes back further by comparison even than these two in 2 Chronicles.<a name=1:22></a> The further back we go in comparison the nearer we get to the original thought of God, and the greater evidence there is of true revival, not only in feelings and affections but in principles and truth.<a name=1:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention those three because of the comparisons made with them.<a name=2:1></a> There are other revivals we may look at with the Lord's help but this one under Hezekiah is particularly important.<a name=2:2></a> It begins with a man of mature years, twenty-five years, when he opened the doors of the house of God, "He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them" (verse 3).<a name=2:3></a> Then we shall see as we run down the chapter the development of the truth under his influence and direction, so that the Spirit of God tells us in the last verse of our chapter, "And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people; for the thing was done suddenly".<a name=2:4></a> It was a real revival by the grace of God, and though there was not much time to effect everything, yet it was reached.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=2:6></a>H.<a name=2:7></a> Do you place these revivals consecutively, the one following the other in our own soul's history?<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:9></a> They should be.<a name=2:10></a> The opening of the doors of the house of Jehovah is the first thing, and then the dealing with the evil that had existed, which we get in the succeeding verses.<a name=2:11></a> These revivals are very important as applicable at the present time.<a name=2:12></a> They are intended to stir us up.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.P.<a name=2:14></a> Is revival connected with some particular phase of the truth?<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:16></a> I think that is right.<a name=2:17></a> Some particular phase is stressed in each revival.<a name=2:18></a> We can see the house is the prominent thing here.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=2:20></a> It says, "And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah".<a name=2:21></a> Would that be the moral basis for the movement seen in this chapter?<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:23></a> Quite so, "And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done".<a name=2:24></a> There is a standard mentioned, that is the principle, there is always a standard in mind.<a name=2:25></a> We may thank God for any outstanding servants we can allude to who have gone, but of course the great standard is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=3:3></a>P.<a name=3:4></a> These revivals are not based upon the need of men, the low level of man's need, but on what is according to God, starting at the higher point.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> Revivals in the history of christendom are not to be classed under the headings of these the Scriptures allude to; such usually refer to great activity in evangelical work.<a name=3:7></a> But what you observe here is that the principles governing the work, the right standard, is to be in mind from the start.<a name=3:8></a> It says in verse 25, "And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet".<a name=3:9></a> They have the higher standard in mind; that is a matter to be kept before us.<a name=3:10></a> The word 'revival' is common; many activities might be alluded to under that name but they do not fit here at all.<a name=3:11></a> Revival today according to God must involve the assembly, and Christ as Head of it.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:13></a> Is there not importance in the fact that it gives his mother's name, Abijah?<a name=3:14></a> The previous chapter closes with, "And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead", and this chapter begins with the mother's side.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:16></a> You get that frequently in the histories of these kings.<a name=3:17></a> In order to have a right product you must not only have a right father but a right mother.<a name=3:18></a> That principle is set out in Genesis, the principle of a right father and a right mother, so as to have a wholly right seed.<a name=3:19></a> We have what is partial, and even mongrel, like Ishmael, but a wholly right seed is in mind in the things of God, so that Genesis not only provides the patriarchs but the sisterhood too; it supplies suitable wives and mothers.<a name=3:20></a> I suppose that is the suggestion in the mother's name being mentioned here, so that it says in verse 2, "And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done".<a name=3:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=4:1></a>D.<a name=4:2></a> You get the allusion to David in connection with Philadelphia.<a name=4:3></a> I was wondering whether the thought of Hezekiah's reigning referred to the dispensation of God and sovereignty in regard to the period of revival.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:5></a> That opens up an instructive line of thought.<a name=4:6></a> It is remarkable how David is introduced in connection with the gospels.<a name=4:7></a> Matthew had in mind the assembly, and introduces David at once -- "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham".<a name=4:8></a> Paul brings him in in connection with the gospel in Romans, and Timothy is reminded of it in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:8">2 Timothy  2:8</a>: "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David", a very striking matter in remnant times.<a name=4:9></a> Then in the address to Philadelphia, which of course alludes to the remnant times in our dispensation, it is "He that has the key of David"; and when He finally addresses Himself to the churches in the close of Revelation, the Lord says, "<i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that I think in Hezekiah's connection with David here we see that David is the standard thought.<a name=4:11></a> We have the suggestion of what is best spiritually; David represents what is best, most refined spiritually.<a name=4:12></a> In a revival God would have that before Him, not merely what may accrue to men but what will accrue to God.<a name=4:13></a> David is the leader in the service of God in the Old Testament, the sweet psalmist of Israel.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=4:15></a>H.<a name=4:16></a> What is the distinction between Joshua's line and David's?<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:18></a> Joshua goes back further; it is earlier.<a name=4:19></a> But there is nothing really higher in quality than what we get in David.<a name=4:20></a> The comparison here in our section is with Solomon, as already remarked, it is "since the time of Solomon the son of David".<a name=4:21></a> Joshua's spiritual power is not, I think, in relation to the kingdom.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses represents that side -- spiritual power in the kingdom in the way of authority and rule.<a name=5:1></a> Joshua is Christ known inwardly, that is, the power by which we enter on our inheritance, our heavenly position.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:3></a> Is it helpful to see the lead that Hezekiah gives in clothing what is levitical with the peculiar dignity he does, as in verse 11: "My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him, and to be his ministers and incense-burners"?<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:5></a> Yes, that passage indicates that he is exercising his proper function as king.<a name=5:6></a> The first book of Samuel shows that the priesthood was henceforth to be subservient to the king and Hezekiah exercises that prerogative.<a name=5:7></a> He speaks in a fatherly way to the Levites.<a name=5:8></a> It would be the Spirit of Christ in authority amongst us in revival, in whatever way that may be shown.<a name=5:9></a> To stir up the Levites, he calls them "My sons"; it is a fatherly thought.<a name=5:10></a> As a king he is a young man, but he, as a king, represents the authority of Christ.<a name=5:11></a> He exercises his functions in that way, to stir up the Levites, that is the point; to get the Levites moving spiritually he gives them their highest place.<a name=5:12></a> "For Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him, and to be his ministers and incense-burners".<a name=5:13></a> It is well in stirring up people to remind them of their dignity, there is an incentive in that to move in true dignity.<a name=5:14></a> He had already called them to attention in verse 4: "And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them into the open place eastward".<a name=5:15></a> They are to be lectured; it was, so to speak, the Spirit of God calling on the brethren for in a certain aspect there has been lethargy.<a name=5:16></a> "He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them into the open place eastward; and he said to them, Hear me, ye Levites: hallow yourselves now, and hallow the house

		of Jehovah the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the sanctuary".<a name=6:1></a> And then he acknowledges the guilt that had preceded, and in verse 11 he calls them his sons and addresses them in their dignity; he shows what their proper function is, positive service God-ward, "ministers and incense-burners".<a name=6:2></a> Verses 3 to 11 contain an appeal to us at the present time.<a name=6:3></a> It seems to me that each of us should take it to heart as to himself, his house and his local position, as to where he has been and as to where he is in regard to all this, and whether there is not a voice to us in this scripture.<a name=6:4></a> They are addressed by the king as sons, and their dignity is fully owned.<a name=6:5></a> The thing is to exercise what we are called into, what we are as called into the service of God.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.R.<a name=6:7></a>A.<a name=6:8></a> Would the thought of eastward suggest the coming in of the Lord?<a name=6:9></a> He opened the doors and then they gathered in the open place eastward.<a name=6:10></a> Conditions have to be suitable to His coming in.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:12></a> I think so, there is always a hopeful outlook.<a name=6:13></a> We are likely to be doleful and say there is no hope, but the eastward direction is hopeful; it suggests hopefulness.<a name=6:14></a> There is plenty of scope, he "gathered them into the open place", and gave them the suggestion of liberty and room.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=6:16></a> Would Peter in chapter 3 of the second epistle have revival in his mind in saying, "I stir up, in the way of putting you in remembrance, your pure mind, to be mindful of the words spoken before by the holy prophets", and he goes on in connection with the day of the Lord and their waiting?<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:18></a> I think stirring up their pure minds could take that character, 'Stirring up' is a good thought, but the thing is not to stir up what is impure.<a name=6:19></a> It is pure minds.<a name=6:20></a> I think it would have the bearing of a revival.<a name=6:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=7:1></a>H.<a name=7:2></a> You were speaking of David setting forth the standard.<a name=7:3></a> It says that Hezekiah "opened the doors of the house of Jehovah".<a name=7:4></a> Would that have reference to the key of David?<a name=7:5></a> Would that come in there?<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:7></a> Yes, it is a question of the right to do it.<a name=7:8></a> The Lord has a right.<a name=7:9></a> The word to Philadelphia in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:7">Revelation  3:7</a> is, "And to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write: These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open".<a name=7:10></a> I think it involves the right of Christ.<a name=7:11></a> Christendom had come under foreign authority and influence; if we go back to the Reformation.<a name=7:12></a> Rome had the key of everything except the Eastern church, and that had become dead.<a name=7:13></a> The Lord did much in the Reformation, but there was not much opening in it for what was positive.<a name=7:14></a> The key of David refers to the right to open up things in the way of what is positive.<a name=7:15></a> The allusion would be to what has happened in that spiritual initiative has been taken out of the hand of Rome, and all that goes with it has lost its place -- not in an official way but in a spiritual way.<a name=7:16></a> There has been complete release from that influence.<a name=7:17></a> The Lord has come in and opened up things to us; there is an entrance into those things and it continues now as much as ever.<a name=7:18></a> The Lord continues things as He opens up the doors to us, that is what is in mind.<a name=7:19></a> Hezekiah did that, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and repaired them; he exercised the right that belonged to him.<a name=7:20></a> It is a question of the Lord's authority, a right to open and no one shall shut, "Behold, I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut".<a name=7:21></a> It is a very encouraging thought, so that it looks as though the Lord will keep the doors open for us.<a name=7:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=7:23></a>P.<a name=7:24></a> When local difficulties arise the suggestion is sometimes made to close up the meeting.<a name=7:25></a> I was

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		wondering whether this scripture, in conjunction with the one suggested in Revelation, might afford to us the procedure by which the door should be kept open for the Lord and His service.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:2></a> Yes; it is the holy and true One that opens.<a name=8:3></a> We know how much has been opened up externally by imitation, leading nowhere except toward the world; but there is only One who opens up these things, and He opens with the key of David.<a name=8:4></a> It refers to what is most exalted and refined spiritually, the service of God and all that goes with it.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=8:6></a>H.<a name=8:7></a> The previous king introduced foreign elements into the worship of Jehovah, but in this chapter they judge that and definitely name it as being evil.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:9></a> Quite so.<a name=8:10></a> He not only introduced idolatrous elements, but we are told in verse 19 of "the vessels that king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression".<a name=8:11></a> That is, he would cast away what is of God as profane.<a name=8:12></a> There is much of that.<a name=8:13></a> But these vessels are now restored, and that is the sort of thing going on today.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=8:15></a>D.<a name=8:16></a> Would 2 Timothy be rather the rallying of what is priestly and levitical in the brethren, and the opening of the doors be more the Corinthian epistles?<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:18></a> The rallying of the priestly elements would be 2 Timothy and the introduction of David there is striking.<a name=8:19></a> That epistle opens up everything to us; it is the avenue of all that is of God.<a name=8:20></a> It is, I believe, a sort of charter given to us that we may fall back upon.<a name=8:21></a> Any one person has that mandate; he does not need to wait for anyone else; any true believer in Christ is not required to wait for anyone else, for he can release himself in separating from vessels to dishonour, and then "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=8:22></a> I believe the door is open in that way.<a name=8:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that we have in 1 and 2 Corinthians and all that we have noted is available to us.<a name=9:1></a> So Hezekiah here renders a wonderful service in opening the doors and repairing them that there may be access to the things of God.<a name=9:2></a> But there may be access and yet much repair needed; even now there are a lot of things held that need correction, and access to the things of God is hindered because of these conditions.<a name=9:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.G.<a name=9:4></a>McA.<a name=9:5></a> Is individual exercise expressed in Hezekiah in verse 10?<a name=9:6></a> Particularly in verse 5 he gathers the priests and Levites to face the situation found in the temple, so that the individual exercise moves out to take in the whole company in revival.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:8></a> That is the way the passage stands.<a name=9:9></a> The first thought is in bringing the Levites to the open place.<a name=9:10></a> It is authoritative; it is the king that is doing it; he has the right to do it according to 1 Samuel.<a name=9:11></a> Now that he has delivered his message to them in the open place as to the uncleanness of the conditions, he comes back to the thought of positive service, and it is there he tells us what is in his heart.<a name=9:12></a> You want to get what God has put into some brother's heart who has a care, some brother who has the lead.<a name=9:13></a> Some brother has a secret understanding with God, but in carrying that out he may have trouble.<a name=9:14></a> Hezekiah told them what was in his heart; it was "to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us" (verse 10).<a name=9:15></a> And then he calls the Levites out, "My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him, and to be his ministers and incense-burners".<a name=9:16></a> That is a beautiful appeal to us, recognising the dignity of the Levites, calling them sons, touching our affections.<a name=9:17></a> See what you are called into!<a name=9:18></a> It seems to me that this is a great appeal to us.<a name=9:19></a> You can see the course he takes here, the course that is needed now -- cleansing, and repairing what is out of the way, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.P.<a name=10:3></a> Even though Hezekiah gives the lead, the germ is there to respond to the lead.<a name=10:4></a> And then in verse 15 the movement is from them: "And they gathered their brethren, and hallowed themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah".<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=10:6></a> Yes, that is good.<a name=10:7></a> One man cannot make a revival, though he may lead in it.<a name=10:8></a> More than one man is needed.<a name=10:9></a> You can see that Hezekiah had an understanding with God in his heart.<a name=10:10></a> But then in the next section it says, "Then the Levites rose up".<a name=10:11></a> (verse 12), and then their names are given, which is important.<a name=10:12></a> It is well to read all these names, because if the Spirit of God has taken pains to write down a man's name it is well to read it.<a name=10:13></a> These names have been read in our hearing and there is a goodly number of them.<a name=10:14></a> It says in verses 15 - 17, "And they gathered their brethren, and hallowed themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.<a name=10:15></a> And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and carried forth all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah, into the court of the house of Jehovah.<a name=10:16></a> And the Levites took it to carry it forth into the brook Kidron.<a name=10:17></a> And they began on the first of the first month to hallow, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah; and they hallowed the house of Jehovah eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end".<a name=10:18></a> It seems to me that is very fine.<a name=10:19></a> The matter is finished.<a name=10:20></a> There are external things, but then there are the inner things that have to be dealt with, that is, things that are professedly nearer to God, that

		might be concealed; because with many of us as gifted men or even in the place of spiritual men there are things that cannot be seen; but priestly intelligence understands and they come to the inner part to deal with all that, and it is carried outside; and then it is brought to what suggests the death of the Lord Jesus, the judgment of God, in the brook Kidron.<a name=11:1></a>

		REVIVAL (2)

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=27:1></a> We read chapter 29 this morning in order to bring out the idea of revival as instanced in the reign of Hezekiah.<a name=27:2></a> It was pointed out that he began at the mature age of twenty-five, and immediately, we are told, he "opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them".<a name=27:3></a> I thought that the opening of the doors corresponded to Philadelphia where the Lord Jesus speaks of Himself as "the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:7">Revelation  3:7</a>.<a name=27:4></a> He has moved in our times in the way of revival in the past century and opened the doors of the house of God to us.<a name=27:5></a> It says, "he who opens and no one shall shut".<a name=27:6></a> It would mean the entrance into the divine thought, the whole scope of the Lord's mind opened up.<a name=27:7></a> Then the cleansing of the house engaged us, how Hezekiah brought the priests and Levites into the open place eastward and spoke to them authoritatively as to their service and the need of cleansing, confessing the guilt of those that preceded him.<a name=27:8></a> Then he spoke to them as his sons in a fatherly way, in their dignity as ministers of Jehovah.<a name=27:9></a> Then we had the actual account of the cleansing, and the provision made by the king and his princes for the service of God to be resumed; four creatures, seven of each, for the burnt-offering and the sin-offering, so that the service of God was resumed.<a name=27:10></a> The burnt-offering began and the song of the Lord began and proceeded.<a name=27:11></a> We ended with the joy: "Hezekiah rejoiced", it says in the last verse, "and all the people, that God had prepared the people; for the thing was done suddenly".<a name=27:12></a> It was a divine movement, it was not any effort on man's part to work up a revival.<a name=27:13></a> It was God's work and His people were ready, He prepared them indeed.<a name=27:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence we have in chapter 29: 10 the great fundamental position of revival, things are being done according to order, the saints are being stirred up to give so that there is wealth and joy; in fact it is brought out that "God had prepared the people", a very great matter.<a name=28:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what we have to look at next in the revival is the ordered feasts, what characterises the dispensation in the way of stated feasts, beginning with the passover.<a name=28:2></a> If there be a revival, God would have things in some sense in keeping with the whole dispensation.<a name=28:3></a> There is that which distinguishes our dispensation from the past one and from the future one.<a name=28:4></a> I suggested reading chapter 30 to show that we have now arrived at the features which characterise the whole dispensation in the sense of appointed feasts.<a name=28:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=54:1></a> We can see, I believe, in this inquiry that each revival in Israel has an especial feature.<a name=54:2></a> So in Hezekiah's revival we see the wealth developed, and then how they had recourse to what should mark the dispensation publicly.<a name=54:3></a> It is obvious that in a revival attention has to be paid to moral conditions first; and as we saw in the reading yesterday morning, the process brings out the latent wealth that is there, increasing as the feast goes on and as the season of blessing goes on.<a name=54:4></a> In chapter 30 there was the passover which suggests what marks the dispensation, what marked that dispensation; the Lord's supper correspondingly marks ours, and the public service of God, the order that attends it.<a name=54:5></a> Thus I think the brethren will have seen that this line of truth is most important for us, verified in our own times in the revival that God has graciously granted in our dispensation, into which we have come and which we are now enjoying.<a name=54:6></a> Our responsibility is to maintain it.<a name=54:7></a> There was nothing, we are told, like that which Hezekiah inaugurated in the way of revival since the days of Solomon.<a name=54:8></a> It lasted fourteen days, it is a double feast marked by joy.<a name=54:9></a>

		he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherahs and the graven images into powder, and cut down all the sun-pillars throughout the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem".<a name=56:1></a> This is a remarkable range of service, the greatest service rendered by a young servant.<a name=56:2></a> But we have to take him not only as a person but as a principle of youthful energy in whomsoever it may be seen acting authoritatively for the general purgation of the saints.<a name=56:3></a> There is a ministry which deals with the house of God and the service of God and a ministry that deals with the general state of the saints.<a name=56:4></a> The latter requires courage and moral authority, and I think that is seen here.<a name=56:5></a> The royal power that this king exercises is symbolical or typical of the authority of Christ exercised now in the power of the Spirit, which will always accompany spiritual ministry.<a name=56:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=82:16></a> I think that is instructive because Ezra's movement is linked with the movements under Zerubbabel and Jeshua, though Ezra came in much later, contemporary with Nehemiah.<a name=82:17></a> The movement under Zerubbabel and Jeshua is a movement under the direct government of God; the proclamation was by Cyrus according to Ezra that they should return and build.<a name=82:18></a> Cyrus is a prophetic monarch: he had been spoken of in Isaiah before he was born, showing that God had had this matter that is indicated in Ezra long in mind, and the movement corresponded with his pre-revealed thoughts.<a name=82:19></a> Ezra is positional.<a name=82:20></a> The proclamation runs in <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#1:1">Ezra  1:1</a> - 4, "And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in writing, saying, Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=102:4></a> Quite so, it is the dispensation that is seen in Ezra.<a name=102:5></a> The position is clear, and now what marks the dispensation is that it is the dispensation of God that is in faith.<a name=102:6></a> The original word 'dispensation' involves the house of God; it is the economy house-wise and the house is essential to it.<a name=102:7></a> The walls are the protection of it.<a name=102:8></a> You cannot have the dispensation of God without the presence of God house-wise, and that is what is in mind here.<a name=102:9></a> "This house" is such as we have, and in "this house" God is pleased to be with His people on His own terms.<a name=102:10></a> Now the point is to dedicate that, to show that we are thoroughly and fully committed to that.<a name=102:11></a> So that it says they "kept the dedication of this house of God with joy; and they presented at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.<a name=102:12></a> And they set the priests in their classes, and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem: as it is written in the book of Moses".<a name=102:13></a> So that we can see how the dispensation is here characteristically, the people are committing themselves to it with joy.<a name=102:14></a> This house and the offerings are in relation to the twelve tribes, it is a universal thought.<a name=102:15></a> The house is always a universal thought.<a name=102:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=103:14></a> I think so.<a name=103:15></a> The idea of measure is most important in the things of God, beginning, as you might say, with Exodus.<a name=103:16></a> Exodus is the great central thought of the house, the dwelling place of God.<a name=103:17></a> Everything there is according to measure.<a name=103:18></a> We now arrive at what belongs to God.<a name=103:19></a> The inner side is mentioned earlier, but administration would have more to do with the announcements; the gates would be important at that point.<a name=103:20></a> Passing on we come to the offerings, that is what is entirely for the heart of God; that belongs to the inner position.<a name=103:21></a> The gates and the walls have to do with what is external, so we rightly have our announcements at first and then we proceed to the inner thought in the assembly service.<a name=103:22></a> In order to make clear that the dispensation is in mind, the next paragraph beginning with verse 19 says, "And the children of the captivity held the passover upon the fourteenth of the first month".<a name=103:23></a> They are in keeping with the thought of Josiah, but the house of God comes first here and its dedication.<a name=103:24></a> The next thing is the formal ordinance that characterises the dispensation; that is for us the Lord's supper, but here it is the passover.<a name=103:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=107:1></a> I have in mind that we might finish with the feast of tabernacles, and link it up a little with the verses read in Malachi.<a name=107:2></a> In order that we might have the position clearly in view, attention should be called to the year -- the spiritual year, and the seventh month.<a name=107:3></a> The chapter really begins, "When the seventh month came", the month of great spiritual events, the feast of trumpets and the day of atonement, the feast of ingathering, or the feast of tabernacles.<a name=107:4></a> And what may not have been observed by some of us is the stress laid on the people in the first section of the chapter, the general movement amongst the people to hear the word of God; not a movement arising from leadership, though the leaders come into it and help the people.<a name=107:5></a> The word in verse 1 is, "And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in their cities, all the people gathered together as one man to the open place that was before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel".<a name=107:6></a> It seems that particular notice should be taken of this because God would give us to understand that the position, the truth, is not to be carried and maintained only by leading brothers or sisters, but that all are brought into it in the sense that they want to know more about the law of Moses.<a name=107:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=107:11></a> That is the way it stands here.<a name=107:12></a> You mean Ezra was ready, "And they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses"; is that what you mean?<a name=107:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=108:4></a> The question arises at this point as to these meetings that are now annual, you may say, these general meetings, as to what underlies them.<a name=108:5></a> Is it a movement of the people in the place?<a name=108:6></a> Or is it to have a big affair, the matter of serving the saints being secondary?<a name=108:7></a> Or is it that we would know more about the will of God?<a name=108:8></a> The point the people make is, "They spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel".<a name=108:9></a> Is that the underlying thought?<a name=108:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.P.<a name=108:11></a> Does that show a willingness on the part of the people to come under the law and commandments as being morally suitable to this gathering together?<a name=108:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=108:13></a> That is what I was thinking.<a name=108:14></a> It seems to be a movement among the people, a united one; "All the people gathered together as one man".<a name=108:15></a> They have recourse to a man available whom God can use, so that "They spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel".<a name=108:16></a> Then we are told, "Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation, both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month".<a name=108:17></a> He is amenable to call, ready, but he moved according to the proposal of the people; a remarkable thing, I believe.<a name=108:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=108:19></a> In the first verse you read it says, "they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses", and then in the second verse it says, "And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation".<a name=108:20></a> Is there any significance in that?<a name=108:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=108:22></a> I think the word 'scribe' is a characteristic word connected with his name.<a name=108:23></a> It is used in chapter 7 of his own book (verse 6).<a name=108:24></a> His priestly status is

		unquestionable, shown to be unquestionable in that chapter, and he also was "a ready scribe in the law of Moses".<a name=109:1></a> It would seem as if the first thought in asking him to take on this service is "the scribe", that "he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses"; not simply a man that can write well, but a man that can write in the law of Moses, conversant with things relative to the mind of God, ready in that.<a name=109:2></a> Evidently the people knew his qualifications.<a name=109:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=109:4></a>H.<a name=109:5></a> I suppose the meaning of his name, 'help', would have that in view; the people were seeking help from Ezra.<a name=109:6></a> It was not like the prophetic word direct from God; it was more the prompting of the people.<a name=109:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=109:8></a> Seemingly it was a question of exposition, which is not exactly prophetic; an exegetical service to open up, to bring things out that are already there; not a special message from God, but what was already existent in the written page.<a name=109:9></a> He is qualified for that, that is the point; it is a question of exposition rather.<a name=109:10></a> The Lord Jesus as risen exemplifies this ministry, "he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:27">Luke  24:27</a>.<a name=109:11></a> It was no question of a prophetic word but bringing the Scriptures to bear upon them.<a name=109:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=109:19></a> A very large place.<a name=109:20></a> God seems to use these meetings to open up what is in the Scriptures.<a name=109:21></a> A prophetic word is of course immediately from God supported by Scripture, but exegetical service is to bring out the thing that is already there, what God has embedded in the Scriptures, the immensity of the resources in the Scriptures.<a name=109:22></a>

		Ques.<a name=110:1></a> Referring back to the fact that this was held in the seventh month, had you in mind that the saints should come to this matter spiritually in a locality, according to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>?<a name=110:2></a> The first day was to be a day of rest, and we were going to consider the matter from that point onward.<a name=110:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=110:4></a> I thought it would be well to call attention to the periods of the year.<a name=110:5></a> It is not the lunar year that is in mind but what is called the ecclesiastical, spiritual and agricultural year.<a name=110:6></a> The year is a matter of crops from the divine point of view, "seed time and harvest", and this month is the harvest month.<a name=110:7></a> The idea is therefore to reach the great end in mind in the year, culminating at its end.<a name=110:8></a> The year is to be productive.<a name=110:9></a> I thought it would be very appropriate that we should finish our readings at the feast of tabernacles, in the end of the spiritual year.<a name=110:10></a>

		S.McC.<a name=110:11></a> Is it like the crown in that sense?<a name=110:12></a> "Thou crownest the year with thy goodness", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#65:11">Psalm  65:11</a>.<a name=110:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=110:14></a> It would be that exactly.<a name=110:15></a> The seventh month is not the twelfth month, though they had twelve months in their year; the seventh month is the end of the agricultural year, and the agricultural year is the year that tells, because the point in the original divisions after the flood was seed-time and harvest.<a name=110:16></a> Other things are subservient to this, "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>.<a name=110:17></a> Hence the question that arises, What is the harvest in all our exercises?<a name=110:18></a> What is the result in the whole matter?<a name=110:19></a> If there is no harvest there is nothing gained; there may be a sowing without a harvest.<a name=110:20></a> The idea of a harvest is what God brings in.<a name=110:21></a> You put your seed into the ground; God causes it to grow; God gives the result.<a name=110:22></a>

		As I said, in speaking of this I have in mind to call attention to the sphere of these operations at the present time, that is, the saints.<a name=135:4></a> Of God's work in relation to creation we are told, "By whom also he made the worlds", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a>.<a name=135:5></a> It is a wonderful thought, how they were made: "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>), but the actual means, the detail, is not disclosed.<a name=135:6></a> The immensity of the matter indeed, dear brethren, places it beyond the compass of the creature: "by faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God".<a name=135:7></a> That does not mean we can compass the matter, for it is so vast; it is beyond the creature's mind to grasp.<a name=135:8></a> Still, we are not left out of it; God would not leave us out of anything in that sense.<a name=135:9></a> "The sons of God shouted for joy" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>), at the time of the foundation of the earth; God let them into it in some sense so that they understood something of it and rejoiced, "shouted for joy".<a name=135:10></a> Divine operations always carry that thought; they are wonderful, not simply awe inspiring, but cause joy to those who are in the relation of sons, the sons of God.<a name=135:11></a>

		We have come into that relation on a higher level than those sons spoken of in the book of Job.<a name=135:12></a> We are in relation to Christ, and let into more than they were let into.<a name=135:13></a> So that our joy should certainly be always full; every vista of creation ought to occasion joy.<a name=135:14></a> Wisdom says that in all this, "I was there" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:27">Proverbs  8:27</a>), and I was "rejoicing".<a name=135:15></a> It says wisdom rejoiced, showing that there was good reason for it,

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Scriptures are freighted with the idea of delight and joy, dear brethren, carrying us along like a river triumphantly in glory.<a name=136:3></a> The Spirit of God is here today bringing in the whole matter, in principle at least, "the earnest of our inheritance" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:14">Ephesians  1:14</a>), bringing it into all our hearts.<a name=136:4></a> Well now, the sphere of all the operations of God in the economy is men: "rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the sons of men", showing that that is the great idea with God in His creation -- that God brought Christ in where men are, and expressed His delight in Him.<a name=136:5></a> That is, He gives the real, supreme lead in all that, both to God and to us: "in whom I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>.<a name=136:6></a> That voice at the Jordan was intended to give impetus to all that was there, all that was current in the way of faith, to stimulate the whole matter and bring the new order of things into being and set it going by the glorious Man "in whom I have found my delight".<a name=136:7></a> It has never ceased, never; it has widened to the inclusion of all the sons.<a name=136:8></a> We are brought into that blessed relation to God, with the One "in whom I have found my delight".<a name=136:9></a> So God is working with material entirely congenial; that is what I wanted to speak on in Jeremiah.<a name=136:10></a>

		First I want to show that the prophet in each case is brought into a sphere, directed into a sphere, and the operation is going on, or about to go on.<a name=136:11></a> In Jeremiah the sphere is styled "the potter's house", not a potter's factory, but a potter's house.<a name=136:12></a> The antitype is in the mind of the Spirit, dear brethren, always, and so God is operating house-wise in this wonderful time.<a name=136:13></a> The beautiful thought in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:35">John  8:35</a> is that the son abides in the house for ever; He is

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what one observes in difficulties amongst the people of God is that generally we are governed by persons in our judgment and in our movements.<a name=137:5></a> In a certain sense it is right for young people, especially, to follow their leaders, obey their leaders, but if that be mentioned we are introduced to the thought of Christ, "the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:8">Hebrews  13:8</a>.<a name=137:6></a> We are not to slip away from Christ through any leader.<a name=137:7></a> The true leader says, "<i>Ye</i> became our imitators, and of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:6">1 Thessalonians  1:6</a>); he passes them on to the Lord.<a name=137:8></a> I should be exceedingly grieved to think I misguided anybody through personal influence.<a name=137:9></a> Any lead one gives should direct to the Lord, should go on that line.<a name=137:10></a> So that the truth is the first thing in this matter; the Lord says, "The truth shall set you free" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:32">John  8:32</a>) -- the truth will do it.<a name=137:11></a> Hence the point is to begin with the facts of any case and the principles involved governing it.<a name=137:12></a> "The truth shall set you free"; and then in the beautiful passage I quoted, the precious pre-eminent Person must be "the Son".<a name=137:13></a> He is operating in the house; He would have us in the house; it is the place of affection.<a name=137:14></a> So He says, "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:36">John  8:36</a>.<a name=137:15></a> He abides in the house for ever, the servant does not.<a name=137:16></a>

		And so here it is not the potter's factory, but the potter's house, for God would not descend to the thought of a factory or a workshop; He would say to us, I am operating in a sphere of affection.<a name=137:17></a> The very surroundings would help you in the operation.<a name=137:18></a> Well, what is the operation?<a name=137:19></a> He is making something,

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=149:1></a> I was thinking of the anointing; we get it first seen in the Lord Jesus.<a name=149:2></a> In this series of meetings I want to refer first to the Lord, and then to the way a believer comes in as having part in it; then to how the assembly comes into it in a collective sense, and then to the priesthood in which the saints come into it as priests and as prophets.<a name=149:3></a> It is thought that the consideration of this great subject will help us in view of current conditions.<a name=149:4></a> I have in mind how they affect the saints individually and in our local settings, our care meetings, the meetings for the service of God, meetings for discipline, in fact all meetings.<a name=149:5></a> The idea is that it implies dignity in a moral sense in us and ability to take in divine things and speak of them one to another, and, especially, ability in those who serve, specifically essential gift.<a name=149:6></a> It is thought that we should consider it first as seen in Christ, as setting out the full thought, and so Luke has been selected.<a name=149:7></a> Both books selected in the New Testament were written by Luke, and he has in mind order and dignity, ornamentation in christianity, especially in the specific services.<a name=149:8></a> Hence this incident in Nazareth is selected because it is a local position where the Lord was brought up, where He is seen in His service as representing all these things, beautification in the service.<a name=149:9></a> He is seen in a personal sense as serving, but He is also seen in a personal sense as known in the place.<a name=149:10></a> Therefore we shall not lose power in the locality where we reside if the anointing has its place with us.<a name=149:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is significant that the Lord began, according to Luke, in the synagogue at Nazareth.<a name=149:12></a> In this gospel He bases his service on a scripture from the Old Testament, linking on at once the ministry in the Old Testament with the New, so that both Old and

		New Testaments are bound together in His ministry as having equal authority.<a name=150:1></a> The Lord's own personal attractiveness is seen in this passage; it is said they wondered when He sat down: "The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him"; and then He said, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears.<a name=150:2></a> And all bore witness to him, and wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth".<a name=150:3></a> In Acts in Peter's account of Him it says that He was anointed by God and went about doing good, and it adds that the anointing was "with the Holy Spirit and with power".<a name=150:4></a> So we have this specific instance of the anointing with power.<a name=150:5></a> Anointing carries the idea of power with it, and then God follows up what He does in selecting a vessel by being with Him in His services.<a name=150:6></a>

		Ques.<a name=150:7></a> Would the incident of the baptism of the Lord in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3">Luke  3</a>give us an indication of what kind of experience preceded this?<a name=150:8></a> The fact there of the Father speaking after the Lord comes out of the water, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", expresses the feelings of the Father, so that when He goes to the synagogue in Nazareth He is in dignity and power in the sense of it.<a name=150:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=150:10></a> That is very good, entering into our inquiry.<a name=150:11></a> It is what precedes the anointing, what is historical; and then the Person anointed comes into view.<a name=150:12></a> There is always a moral ground for what God does and what may be added is that in the beginning of chapter 4 He was led by the Spirit: "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness".<a name=150:13></a> That is not simply that He was led <i>into</i> it, but led <i>in</i> it, laying the basis as an example for us, "for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>.<a name=150:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=177:1></a> The link between these two scriptures will be apparent to most of us; at least it will be as we proceed in our inquiry.<a name=177:2></a> The passage in Corinthians is really the antitype of <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#40">Exodus  40</a>.<a name=177:3></a> Chapter 12, verse 12, reads, "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ".<a name=177:4></a> The allusion there is to Christ as the anointed One; what is mainly in view is Christ in Person.<a name=177:5></a> It is not Christ exalted but more the vessel down here, the saints viewed as united to Him.<a name=177:6></a> The term 'the Christ' means the anointed one or vessel, and Exodus will help us to see the detail which is in God's mind for us in this way.<a name=177:7></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#39">Exodus  39</a>shows that all the parts of the tabernacle passed through Moses' hands.<a name=177:8></a> It says, "According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, so had the children of Israel done all the labour.<a name=177:9></a> And Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as Jehovah had commanded -- so had they done it; and Moses blessed them".<a name=177:10></a> It is a corresponding allusion there to Christ as the Mediator, so that as believers we all come under His examination, and we are only passed, as it were, by Him if we conform to the requirements that the book presents to us.<a name=177:11></a> It is said that "Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as Jehovah had commanded".<a name=177:12></a> Then it is said that Moses blessed them.<a name=177:13></a> It is a very auspicious moment, the tabernacle is passed now in all its parts but it is not all set up yet.<a name=177:14></a> In chapter 40 it is set up and then anointed.<a name=177:15></a> It is thought that what we had yesterday afternoon fits in, for Jacob reached the collective idea; however much or little he understood it, he named the place Beth-el.<a name=177:16></a> It was a place where God had come down

		These chapters in Exodus are written to instruct us in detail as to Christ in ourselves, for we are not dealing with something at a distance, indeed there is something that exists at the present moment in this room for Christ and for God.<a name=203:4></a> God would impress us with the greatness of the priestly family, Aaron and his sons.<a name=203:5></a> Chapter 28 speaks of the garments of the high priest and also of the sons of Aaron, but is very brief about the latter.<a name=203:6></a> The chapter is expressive of God's thoughts, every item they wore expressed something of God, something to dignify and consecrate Him in: our thoughts; that is what the garments really mean.<a name=203:7></a> And then chapter 29 is to bring out how the priests were anointed as thus garbed.<a name=203:8></a> Underlying the anointing are the thoughts of God, the dignity and holiness attached to the priestly family, and so it is incumbent on each one of us to be sure that we belong to that family and to associate ourselves with our Aaron as the great High Priest above.<a name=203:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=221:1></a> It is hoped that through this book of 1 Samuel the Lord will add much to our subject, especially as we have Christ in mind as King; and then in 1 Kings it is in mind to touch on the idea of the anointing of prophets.<a name=221:2></a> We have seen Christ in the gospels anointed in relation to the preaching, and in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>anointed by God in relation to His general service, and God being with Him in that service.<a name=221:3></a> Then we have had the general thought of the anointing of the saints and how we come into it, and the assembly viewed as anointed in the types of the tabernacle and of the priesthood.<a name=221:4></a> So what remains is what enters into these scriptures that we have read, that is the king and the prophets.<a name=221:5></a> Inasmuch as the saints are regarded as kings there will be a reference necessarily to us in that capacity; but 1 Samuel will also afford opportunity to bring in the general position of ministry yielding fruits as seen in Hannah and Abigail.<a name=221:6></a> Hannah alludes to the anointing in a very significant way in her prophetic message as she says, "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed".<a name=221:7></a> In the phrase, "his anointed".<a name=221:8></a> David was undoubtedly in mind as a type of Christ, and the Spirit of God stresses his personal appearance as entering into his qualifications for the anointing.<a name=221:9></a> That is perhaps additional to anything we have had in mind so far.<a name=221:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Abigail, she comes in after Samuel, a prophet of God, dies.<a name=221:11></a> He is a great minister in the book and clearly she has profited by his ministry because she corresponds with David femininely.<a name=221:12></a> This will profitably come in for review, and I should like to remark that the feminine side is really the product of

		ministry, for clearly Abigail is the product of Samuel's ministry.<a name=222:1></a> She was informed of David, although not necessarily acquainted with him personally, and she had the mind of God about him as the anointed so that she speaks of him in chapter 25 as "bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God", as she says, "because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil has not been found in thee all thy days.<a name=222:2></a> And if a man is risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God".<a name=222:3></a> Thus she has a clear view of David and she is introduced in the chapter as bearing a correspondence to him in a personal sense, as verse 3 says, "The woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance".<a name=222:4></a> The understanding would allude to what was of God in the ministry at the time, chiefly through Samuel, so that there is a certain richness in this connection which the Lord brings before us as obtainable at the present time and the anointing is in line with it in view of results for God.<a name=222:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=222:6></a>S.<a name=222:7></a> How would the thought of judging come in in relation to the anointing: "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth"?<a name=222:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=222:9></a> I suppose it shows the wide outlook the prophetess had, if we can speak of Hannah in that way in relation to the whole of her word.<a name=222:10></a> Among other things she said, "My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up in Jehovah", and later, "For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed", and further, "Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.<a name=222:11></a> Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up, he raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, to set him among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; for the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=223:7></a> Is there a suggestion in Abigail of the result of this stabilising effect prefigured in the pillars?<a name=223:8></a> Her knowing David as the prevailer, and being strengthened by God against the elements set out in Nabal might be suggestive of our knowing Christ as the Prevailer and King in the presence of the elements around that are opposed.<a name=223:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=223:10></a> In that light the repudiating of her husband is an element that is important because we are to repudiate natural links if they have turned away from God.<a name=223:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=223:15></a> That idea is seen in Abigail and I think she has thus to be viewed as a product of ministry.<a name=223:16></a> Christ as typified in David, the anointed of God, is said to be "ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance".<a name=223:17></a> He manifests the vigour of life, and Abigail does so too.<a name=223:18></a> Saul would represent the opposite, the want of freshness and vigour; he was a big man, but David was taken up because of the evidence of life in him.<a name=223:19></a> And so with Abigail, she comes in as replacing

		J.T.<a name=224:6></a> Abigail takes the place of the assembly, the espoused of Christ, corresponding to Him in life over against the system and those in it, so that Saul is just called "a man" by her.<a name=224:7></a> The position, therefore, is held in the vigour of life both in Hannah and in Abigail.<a name=224:8></a> The book began with Hannah forecasting the same thing, bringing out the prophetic spirit in a woman.<a name=224:9></a> She spoke of the anointing of God, and the whole book becomes one of the most prolific in our subject especially in view of current conditions on the earth.<a name=224:10></a> What a need there is for David, that is Christ, that we might have the thought of the assembly in this aspect!<a name=224:11></a> Great difficulties will then be overcome as to Saul and Nabal.<a name=224:12></a> Nabal is still the nominal husband and Saul is still the nominal king but there are great prospects of victory because of the vigour of life connected with the anointing.<a name=224:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=225:12></a> I was thinking of that.<a name=225:13></a> She is exceedingly interesting because from the outset she is an object of rivalry, a very bitter experience, and she has an outlet in prayer; it is all to promote the house of God.<a name=225:14></a> In her there is already displaying itself what is God's objective to reach in Samuel, because Samuel is the fulness of his mother.<a name=225:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=225:20></a> Well, it runs through, quite so.<a name=225:21></a> One of the most suggestive thoughts is the proposal in <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#9">Judges  9</a>to anoint a king over the trees.<a name=225:22></a> Very great partisan feeling was current, a leader was put forth and he only accepted the proposal because he was useless, he was a thorn bush, that was what Jotham's parable taught.<a name=225:23></a> Such a one would oppose the anointing of God, for His anointing is not of a thorn bush; similarly Adonijah was supposed to be king, but Solomon was the Lord's anointed.<a name=225:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=265:1></a> The first ten verses of chapter 2 represent a point reached in the field of testimony.<a name=265:2></a> We have referred to the discipline through which Hannah passed, and the incoming of Samuel, but now we get the spiritual product, it is a contribution; these verses 1 to 10, are a contribution to the service of God, and they stand as a point reached to be observed henceforth.<a name=265:3></a> The Scriptures contemplate the products of exercise, which are usually introduced by the conjunction 'and' throughout Scripture, especially in the early books, so that this is entitled, "And Hannah prayed, and said".<a name=265:4></a> It is a sort of heading such as we have in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>Paul and Silas "in praying were praising", it says (verse 25).<a name=265:5></a> This is not a prayer really, or if it is, it is more in the attitude of her heart than in her words; it would be observed, I think, in all the history of the testimony that there are such products as this which stand out as landmarks.<a name=265:6></a> So that during our own times, extending back for over one hundred years, we have had products from exercises that were experienced by the people of God, such, for instance, as the house, the truth of God's house is outstanding -- the product of the Bethesda sorrow.<a name=265:7></a> We have had the outstanding truth of eternal life after another sorrow, another conflict.<a name=265:8></a> Then following on that we have had the truth attached to the local setting of the assembly and much ministry under that head, and other things, such as the sonship of the Lord Jesus.<a name=265:9></a>

		Hannah's contribution here corresponds, and we can see how outstanding it is and distinct from what she had been through, although it is the product of what she had been through in measure; but still it is a prophetic utterance.<a name=265:10></a> The great prophet had potentially already come in, but she is a prophetess

		J.T.<a name=266:15></a> That is the principle of it.<a name=266:16></a> The psalmists usually have experiences; they begin with that, but they go beyond their own experience.<a name=266:17></a> That is, the Holy Spirit carries us along far beyond anything that we have experienced, as we shall see in this inquiry, and in that particular psalm too.<a name=266:18></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>is one of the maschil psalms; it is a teaching psalm; this is similar.<a name=266:19></a> So that we have, "There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee, neither is there any rock like our God".<a name=266:20></a> She is speaking to God; she has been speaking of Him, now she is speaking to Him, "For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.<a name=266:21></a> The bow of

		J.T.<a name=268:11></a> Just so, he widens out the experience; chapter 22 of 2 Samuel is a good link because it leads us into the book of Psalms.<a name=268:12></a> It is called a psalm there, and it is a psalm in the book of Psalms, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#18">Psalm  18</a>.<a name=268:13></a> It is very beautiful!<a name=268:14></a> David says, "I will love thee, O Jehovah" (verse 1).<a name=268:15></a> Not only had he composed the psalm triumphing in God, but he prefaces it in putting it into the book of Psalms by his love for God, which gives him increased authority in writing.<a name=268:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=273:14></a> I have no doubt it is the framework of the psalm; we see it is carefully worded, if we have time to follow in detail what is in it: "Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.<a name=273:15></a> Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up, he raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, to set him among nobles"; that is an added thought; and furthermore: "he maketh them inherit a throne of glory" (verses  6 - 8).<a name=273:16></a> She stops there to bring more out of that one point as indicating what God is doing now through the gospel.<a name=273:17></a> But anyway the general thought is what God can do, so that we have a basis for prayer in so many things.<a name=273:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=292:1></a> Pursuing our subject, we shall with the Lord's help see suffering of a peculiar nature in these first two instances; that is, the wife of Phinehas, and the milch-kine employed to draw the cart on which the ark was.<a name=292:2></a> Then in the third scripture we shall see the intelligence that may attach to young sisters, spiritual intelligence; the maidens mentioned there had a remarkable knowledge of Samuel, and became guides to reach him.<a name=292:3></a> The first scripture follows on our inquiry of yesterday, and relates to the government of God according to what had been announced by the man of God to Eli; and in the execution of that government this woman appears with right feelings and intelligence -- negatively of course -- but still she had an apprehension of the glory and that it had departed.<a name=292:4></a> It is important to have discernment enough to know when glory that had been attached to a position departs, so that there may be suitable humiliation and inquiry about it.<a name=292:5></a> She leaves a landmark for us in Ichabod, for in the acceptance of the negative -- which he represents -- we come again to the positive, as we duly apprehend the situation and humble ourselves.<a name=292:6></a> The line of recovery, as over against Ichabod, is in the milch-kine.<a name=292:7></a> They are not dying in maternal exercise but are living milch-kine, meaning they provide milk.<a name=292:8></a> They leave their calves behind, sacrificing in doing so, and die at the end of their service.<a name=292:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=295:14></a> That was suitable, but that would not be her meaning in the use of the word 'Ichabod', in saying that the glory had departed.<a name=295:15></a> She says, "The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband" (verse 21).<a name=295:16></a> The latter would be legitimate natural feelings, the death of our father or mother ought to occasion feelings to us; to be without natural affections is condemned in Scripture; it is a right feeling.<a name=295:17></a> But the ark of the covenant was undoubtedly what governed her soul.<a name=295:18></a>

		Well now; as to Solomon: as Paul says of Jacob and Esau, there was nothing good or bad in the children before God pronounced His thought of them: "I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:13">Romans  9:13</a>.<a name=320:3></a> That was the historical result of what was there in those two children before they were born; one was lovable and the other was not.<a name=320:4></a> Esau was not lovable, whereas Jacob was lovable; that was prophetic; the historical part had not come in yet, but it would come, and it is Malachi that is quoted there.<a name=320:5></a> So Jedidiah is a prophetic name, "And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:25">2 Samuel  12:25</a>.<a name=320:6></a> But David gives him another name; he had good ground for knowing that he would be a Solomon, a man of peace, for that had been announced to him before, but Jedidiah had not been announced to him before.<a name=320:7></a> That name did not appear before; that was from Jehovah Himself at that particular time.<a name=320:8></a> All that would come out in Solomon came into his mind, that he would be lovable.<a name=320:9></a> Jehovah loved him in a prophetic sense you might say, because of what would come out in him; I think that is the way it stands.<a name=320:10></a> So it is with ourselves: God knows what will come out in us; though in one sense we are all lovable, "chosen .<a name=320:11></a>.<a name=320:12></a>.<a name=320:13></a> in him" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a>), and "taken .<a name=320:14></a>.<a name=320:15></a>.<a name=320:16></a> into favour in the Beloved" (verse 6).<a name=320:17></a> That is, "beloved" is the idea, the great thought of God, and we are "taken .<a name=320:18></a>.<a name=320:19></a>.<a name=320:20></a> into favour in the Beloved" -- that is David.<a name=320:21></a> I do not think we are accepted in Solomon.<a name=320:22></a> It is the word 'beloved' in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:6">Ephesians  1:6</a>: "He has taken us into favour in the Beloved".<a name=320:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=346:1></a> This chapter is the climax of our present inquiry.<a name=346:2></a> Abigail presents typically the full thought that is in mind.<a name=346:3></a> Experience is contemplated here, so that we have to assume history, preceding history, in looking into this chapter.<a name=346:4></a> She is a product of ministry; Samuel represents the ministry in this book.<a name=346:5></a> Abigail has to be taken as one who, as her own words showed, was conversant with history; she knew the history of David and the history of the opposition to him, so that she is seen as corresponding with David in a personal sense.<a name=346:6></a> What we noted yesterday in chapter 16 enters into this chapter as to his personal appearance and his lovability, indeed, his name means 'beloved', a word that has a great place in the Canticles.<a name=346:7></a> Canticles is a book which has to be taken in connection with all these types of the assembly, because it furnishes poetic forms of expression and marital forms; it is full of them; it is a love book, and is called "The song of songs, which is Solomon's".<a name=346:8></a> There are masculine and feminine sides there presented in the forms of expression in the book; it is typically Christ and the assembly, or Christ and Israel.<a name=346:9></a> God has hardly any place in it literally, so that it enters into the service of God in relation to the Lord's supper.<a name=346:10></a>

		We rightly designated chapter 18 of 1 Samuel the love chapter, but it is the hate chapter too.<a name=346:11></a> Hatred is there, and the intervening chapters between that and this, between chapters 18 and 25, contemplate the bitter hatred of Saul; but David is progressing, personally progressing.<a name=346:12></a> In chapter 19, without referring to it formally, we have him saved by three elements inclusive of Michal; his preservation hinges on her among two other elements.<a name=346:13></a> First Jonathan saves him from destruction, or threatened destruction,

		and then Michal, and then the prophetic ministry saves him.<a name=347:1></a> I am referring to all this because it enters into our subject, how love will protect Christ or what represents Him here.<a name=347:2></a> Christ as He is known here; and the last element used in chapter 19 to preserve David is, as I said, the prophetic ministry.<a name=347:3></a> Samuel is presiding, a sort of president of a college of prophets, so to speak, which is very significant, because it is real prophecy; so real that it absorbed and overwhelmed the messengers of Saul in their murderous intent, and overwhelmed Saul himself.<a name=347:4></a> It is real prophecy; the Spirit of God came even on Saul.<a name=347:5></a> That is a great feature at the present time -- it is increasing in importance -- the prophets and their ministry.<a name=347:6></a> We have spoken of the glory of the ministry; well, the prophetic is the most effective especially because, as here, it acts even upon unconverted people.<a name=347:7></a> They may remain unconverted, but for the moment they come under the power of the prophetic word and serve the purpose as did Balaam.<a name=347:8></a> Then what follows is Saul definitely rebuked by David; and now we come to this chapter where Samuel dies, as if to remind us that that ministry is over and what replaces it is Abigail, but Abigail and David.<a name=347:9></a>

		Now he is seen as approached by David in a most gracious way.<a name=348:5></a> This is all to bring out the details of the position.<a name=348:6></a> It is said, "Then David sent out ten young men" (verse 5), these have to be noted too; the young men of this chapter have to be well noted because they are important.<a name=348:7></a> There are a great many young men now, it is remarkable how many of them appear at these meetings, and young women too; it is always a challenge as to why they are here, why they are at these meetings.<a name=348:8></a> I think we shall see that these are so to speak, assembly men, at least one of them is; they are with David.<a name=348:9></a> We are told in verse 14 that one of Nabal's young men "told Abigail", as if he understood that she was in the position to arbitrate; she is the leading person, as the assembly is the deciding body in Matthew -- the last word is there.<a name=348:10></a> These are important facts because we are in the presence of the assembly in type, in fulness, like the queen by the side of the king in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:9">Psalm  45:9</a>, "upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir".<a name=348:11></a> It is the qualities of Abigail that have to be noted, but one of Nabal's young men apprised her of Nabal's rejection and of the scorn heaped upon David.<a name=348:12></a> These ten young men were sent to Nabal and David says to them, "And thus shall ye say, Long life to thee!<a name=348:13></a> and peace be to thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be to all that thou hast!<a name=348:14></a> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers; now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missed by them, all the while they were in Carmel.<a name=348:15></a> Ask thy young men, and

		J.T.<a name=351:3></a> As just what she is called, "a woman of good understanding" (verse 3), which means she is conversant with matters; she has used her mind; she was conversant with David because she knew what to say to him about himself, about the matter that had risen up against him and about other things.<a name=351:4></a> I believe that is why she is such a striking type of the assembly viewed as having experience with the things of God; possibly typical of the beginning of the Acts when the saints had experience with the Jewish conditions.<a name=351:5></a> They had to do with the Sadducees and other such conditions; the remnant of Israel was there and was still in relation to those conditions.<a name=351:6></a> The saints had to arrive at a judgment of them, which they did.<a name=351:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=351:10></a> Yes; the saints have to deal with these 'fool' conditions, conditions under that influence.<a name=351:11></a> What is said of him is, "Nabal is his name, and folly is with him" (verse 25).<a name=351:12></a> The clerical system involves that, and the saints have had to do with it, and they have learned it in experience; they take on church qualities in the experience, that is, they take them on because they are to be taken on in the ministry.<a name=351:13></a> However weak the ministry may be, the real thing is current and the real saints are taking it on.<a name=351:14></a>

		I wish at this time to speak a word to the dear brethren in regard to leadership; not leadership by persons (although bearing in mind at the same time that properly leadership is by persons), but for the present purpose I intend to speak on leadership by <i>things</i>.<a name=374:1></a> This phase of the matter will help us to be practical, and the constant demand is for breaking things up into parts so that the education may be simplified.<a name=374:2></a> Young learners often ask in meetings: Say something about this or about that; not, Say something about him or about her; it is a question of <i>things</i>.<a name=374:3></a> In truth we come to follow persons, that is, the leadership of God and of Christ, and of the Spirit; but what is in mind now is things, broken up, dealt with severally and yet in relation to one another, for the truth is one whole.<a name=374:4></a> But we learn in part; we may as well admit that for it would be very foolish to deny it even in natural things.<a name=374:5></a> But before approaching and dealing with this one verse, very well known amongst us, I wish just to read a verse or two from <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1">2 Peter  1</a>to bring out what is meant in my remarks: "Simon Peter, bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have received like precious faith with us through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ" (verse 1).<a name=374:6></a> That is, the "like precious faith" is seen here not through God, but through His righteousness; so that we have to understand righteousness to understand how "precious faith" is to be received -- not simply known, but received; because believers are nothing if they are not receivers.<a name=374:7></a> And then he goes on to say, "Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord"; that is, peace is multiplied "in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our

		Lord", that is how it comes.<a name=375:1></a> And again in verse 3, "As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue".<a name=375:2></a> Now, dear brethren, notice these things as they are mentioned; His "divine power" has given to you certain things; it is not said that <i>God</i> has given to you these things -- of course that is true -- but "His divine power" has given them, and they "relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue".<a name=375:3></a> Notice the things that are mentioned, and how they act on each other, great phases of the truth broken up for us and seen acting.<a name=375:4></a> And then he goes on to speak of "glory and virtue, through which he has given to us the greatest and precious promises" -- not simply that God has given them to us, but He has given them to us "by glory and virtue".<a name=375:5></a>

		Now several good sermons could be preached from these verses, I am not preaching from them; I am simply bringing them in as a prelude to what I have in mind so that we may get down into the lowest class of learning, as I would like to get down to it myself in seeking to unfold the ABC of the truth.<a name=375:6></a> Finally Peter says, "that through these" -- not through me, not through God or Jesus or the Spirit, but "through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature".<a name=375:7></a> I would urge every young brother and sister here to write down these things in the order in which Peter gives them here, positive things, each acting of itself in relation to the other things.<a name=375:8></a> Scientific people use one thing to promote another, and use that other to promote something else, always having a great end in mind.<a name=375:9></a> That is how Peter starts his second letter.<a name=375:10></a> Second letters usually deal with the state ensuing from the first.<a name=375:11></a> What is the reaction from the first letter of this great servant Peter?<a name=375:12></a> He had evidently heard as to it.<a name=375:13></a> One is impressed with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will see how material Peter is, how substantial he is in the matter of the source of things; so in the second letter he says, "to stir you up by putting you in remembrance" (verse 13), and he goes on to the utmost bounds, as I might say, of the universe, the spiritual universe and the material universe.<a name=376:6></a> It is somewhat of a drop from the spiritual to the material, and if the Spirit of God has to have recourse to the material then it is pretty evident we have not been living in the spiritual.<a name=376:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I leave that now; that is my preface, and I go on to my text to bring out these leaders, four of them: "righteousness, faith, love, peace".<a name=376:8></a> These are the leaders, and we are to follow them; not severally; for they are one, the truth is one whole, but apprehended in parts.<a name=376:9></a> The first part here is righteousness.<a name=376:10></a> There are four as I said: "Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace".<a name=376:11></a> You do not devote Sunday to righteousness, and Monday to faith, and Tuesday to love, and Wednesday to peace; you follow them all every day, and other ones besides.<a name=376:12></a> These are not the only things that lead us; wisdom also comes in.<a name=376:13></a> But the first one here is righteousness, and it is one of the scarcest things there is in this whole world -- righteousness; yet it is here -- it has always been here, and it is contemplated as moving first in this passage.<a name=376:14></a> The word is 'pursue', which suggests a little more than following, because you might follow leisurely, but this will not admit of that.<a name=376:15></a> We are in an

		emergency time, dear brethren; things are coming up every day that have to be met, and righteousness enters into every one of them, and it is moving fast.<a name=377:1></a> If you are not diligent, if you are just dilatory or neglectful, it will get out of your sight so far that you cannot see it, meaning that you cannot see afar off.<a name=377:2></a> That is what Peter says; he speaks of certain things that you might have seen that should have been added to what you have, and if you have not got them he says your sight is poor, and you have forgotten that you were purged from your former sins; not the present ones, but the former ones.<a name=377:3></a> You "cannot see afar off", he says.<a name=377:4></a> And that answers a lot of questions as why people do not see when issues arise; the fact is that the light is moving so fast they lose sight of it -- they cannot see afar off.<a name=377:5></a> You would not wish to be afar off from righteousness, but in case you do get far away from it by your conduct, then you do not see it at all; and you call light darkness and darkness light, and you call evil good, and good evil.<a name=377:6></a> These are most serious matters, and they are common even among the people of God.<a name=377:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the word 'pursue' has to be noticed here.<a name=377:8></a> You can test yourself as to how much agility you have in looking out for righteousness in every issue that comes up, and they are constantly coming up.<a name=377:9></a> Here is a man in the ninth chapter of John's gospel and both his eyes are closed, he is blind; and the Lord's disciples inquire from the Lord, "Who sinned, this man or his parents?<a name=377:10></a>" (verse 2).<a name=377:11></a> Their minds were moving on fairly good lines in asking that question.<a name=377:12></a> The Lord said, Neither is true; neither his parents nor he have sinned.<a name=377:13></a> Later on the Pharisees say to the man, You were born in sins.<a name=377:14></a> They were blind; the Lord says it was not so at all; they could not see.<a name=377:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, as to this matter of righteousness, I venture to connect it with Matthew's gospel.<a name=377:16></a> Timothy is like Mark; these two young men were taught by
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=378>[Page 378]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the apostle.<a name=378:1></a> There are a great many young men amongst us now, and their safety lies in keeping near to spiritual people -- not launching out by themselves too much; yet they have to learn to stand on their own feet and find their own way too, but they should not ignore examples.<a name=378:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I venture to bring righteousness into Matthew.<a name=378:3></a> Timothy, as I say, was a young man, and he doubtless read Matthew's gospel -- probably it was written in his time (the gospels were all written, I judge, after the epistles).<a name=378:4></a> Paul says, "Give thyself to reading", (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:13">1 Timothy  4:13</a>); he told Timothy that, and I would urge everyone to give attention to reading.<a name=378:5></a> You say, What reading?<a name=378:6></a> Certainly not the magazines or the novels; some do read them and get blinder and blinder by doing it.<a name=378:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Timothy might say to Titus, or to any other young brother he knew (I may say Timothy was going on pretty well most of the time, but the apostle had to say to him at one time, "Be not negligent of the gift that is in thee", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:14">1 Timothy  4:14</a>.<a name=378:8></a> And here he says, "But youthful lusts flee"; so that no one of us is beyond the necessity of these exhortations, even the most spiritual).<a name=378:9></a> Timothy might say to Titus, Did you see the gospel of Matthew?<a name=378:10></a> That is a bit of news; Titus might say, I have not heard of it yet.<a name=378:11></a> He would be very interested to see it.<a name=378:12></a> And at this point I may say that the gospels are written to amplify and exemplify the epistles, that is what they are for; to corroborate, amplify and exemplify the epistles.<a name=378:13></a> And the two brothers Timothy and Titus might say, Well, it would be very interesting to hear what Matthew has written about the Lord; because they would know that Matthew was an apostle.<a name=378:14></a> He was a tax-gatherer and became an apostle; he became a follower of Jesus, he rose up from his desk and laid all aside to follow.<a name=378:15></a> There is nothing said about whether he tidied up his money matters, not a

		word.<a name=379:1></a> He just left his desk as it was and followed Jesus, and he made a great entertainment for Jesus.<a name=379:2></a> Obviously he was greatly affected by something the Spirit of God caused to affect him in the walk and life and ways and words of Jesus.<a name=379:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew was a money man, a banker; and more than that, he was a tax-gatherer.<a name=379:4></a> What would Matthew say about Jesus?<a name=379:5></a> What would be his point of view?<a name=379:6></a> It is most important to get the writer's point of view, no matter what the book is, because the principle in divine things is that the Lord lays out the basis of the book; He lays out the basis of an address.<a name=379:7></a> So it is in John's case for example, John the apostle and the prophet.<a name=379:8></a> The Lord told him how to write his book of Revelation as a prophet.<a name=379:9></a> He laid out the basis of the book -- the great outline.<a name=379:10></a> He said to him, "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:19">Revelation  1:19</a>.<a name=379:11></a> Now what is the principle of Matthew's book?<a name=379:12></a> There are going to be twenty-eight chapters; although that was not under the direction of the Spirit of God.<a name=379:13></a> Chapters and verses are useful, but divine books are not written on that principle; they are written for intelligent people, persons who can read paragraphs as well as sentences, persons that know the alphabet.<a name=379:14></a> Even the psalms contemplate the alphabet, letter by letter; certain psalms are laid out on that principle.<a name=379:15></a> How will Matthew view Jesus in his book?<a name=379:16></a> The righteous One -- that is the basis of the outline, the great general thought in Matthew.<a name=379:17></a> I do not indicate that there is nothing else in it, because Jesus is presented -- "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham".<a name=379:18></a> That is the way it begins.<a name=379:19></a> And He is righteous; His reputed father, Joseph, is a righteous man.<a name=379:20></a> The Spirit of God, dear young people and brethren, has in mind to make us righteous if we are not that yet, and if we are christians at all the

		absence of righteousness is a shame, a disgrace; in fact, we are not characterised as christians if we are not righteous.<a name=380:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Matthew enlarges on the righteousness of Joseph, the reputed father of Jesus.<a name=380:2></a> It is very important to have a righteous father, it is a God-given thing to have a righteous father and a righteous mother; but if you do not follow in their steps you will gain nothing in that sense.<a name=380:3></a> God has given you a righteous father to pay attention to his ways, and the Lord's reputed father was a righteous man; he was righteous in relation to his wife.<a name=380:4></a> It is the greatest demand to be righteous in regard of your wife, or the wife in regard of her husband.<a name=380:5></a> Then when it comes to the Lord Himself in ministry, when He was about to be baptised, He says to John the baptist, "It becometh us" (you and Me, John, or Me and you), "to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=380:6></a> That is how Matthew presents the Lord Jesus -- "all righteousness" -- not only the claims of your wife or your husband or your children, but the claims of all or any with whom you have to do.<a name=380:7></a> As I said, righteousness has been in the world since its outset; it has never left, the devil has never been able to drive righteousness off this earth.<a name=380:8></a> The first one that is called righteous is Abel, God said that his blood is righteous.<a name=380:9></a> If we are to shed our blood, dear brethren, it is to be in righteousness; we are not to suffer for evil but for righteousness.<a name=380:10></a> Abel heads the list of the righteous people who shed their blood in righteousness.<a name=380:11></a> If you look into it you will find Matthew says more about righteousness than any of the other evangelists; he has the assembly in mind, the great judicial vessel that God has here to deal with matters, "Tell it to the assembly" is the injunction in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:17">Matthew  18:17</a>.<a name=380:12></a> It is the residence of righteousness, so that your matters will find a fair examination and decision there.<a name=380:13></a>

		Now I come to faith, that is the next thing that we are to pursue.<a name=381:1></a> The thing is here, thank God; He has kept it here, but it moves fast.<a name=381:2></a> An emergency arises; it is there in a moment.<a name=381:3></a> Things come swiftly, so do not get your eye off it, keep your eye on faith and let your feet keep up with it, dear brethren; "pursue" it, the apostle says.<a name=381:4></a> It is an emergency matter, this epistle is an emergency epistle; and the words 'pursue' and 'flee' are before us.<a name=381:5></a> 'Flee' evil things; do not be dilatory about dealing with them, do not stop around them or give them any place at all, 'Flee' them, it says -- "Flee youthful lusts".<a name=381:6></a> Joseph is a great example for young people in the fleeing of youthful lusts and the pursuing of what is right.<a name=381:7></a> Both words are energetic words; flee the evil and pursue the good, "pursue .<a name=381:8></a>.<a name=381:9></a>.<a name=381:10></a> faith" which, like righteousness, has been in the world since the beginning.<a name=381:11></a> The world has never been without it, the presence of it here has put the world under judgment.<a name=381:12></a> You may say, Where does faith come in?<a name=381:13></a> I would say in Mark's gospel; faith is connected with Mark.<a name=381:14></a> But, you say, it is everywhere in the New Testament.<a name=381:15></a> So it is, and it is very little in the Old -- the <i>thing</i> is there but the word is hardly used.<a name=381:16></a> Then why do I say it is in Mark?<a name=381:17></a> Is it not more in Romans than in Mark?<a name=381:18></a> The words 'believing' and 'faith' are about the same; but I am speaking of Mark and I want you to follow what I am saying.<a name=381:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark says in two passages what I have in mind.<a name=381:20></a> In the first passage he quotes the Lord Jesus as saying, "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe in the glad tidings", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:15">Mark  1:15</a>.<a name=381:21></a> That is, have faith in the thing; that is the point -- follow that.<a name=381:22></a> Do not be without faith, because whatever is not of faith is sin; you will be beset in every direction if you have not faith in activity.<a name=381:23></a> Mark quotes the Lord Jesus as saying, "Believe in the glad tidings".<a name=381:24></a> You say,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is one of the most practical expressions, because it is believing in the Lord Jesus.<a name=382:1></a> But "believe in the glad tidings", it is the <i>thing</i> that I am talking about.<a name=382:2></a> But how does this work out?<a name=382:3></a> Well, if I am to believe in the thing, it is like a book; it is a book full of the idea of faith, and it is for me to read that book and re-read it and understand it.<a name=382:4></a> Believe in it; every word in it is to be gone into and believed, so that you are a 'faith' person: you have faith in your soul and you do not let it get away from you but you pursue it.<a name=382:5></a> A believer is a faith person, a person of faith; in other words, he is a believer.<a name=382:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the passage I have just quoted is in the first chapter, but the one I am going to quote is in the last chapter, there the Lord says, "He that believes and is baptised shall be saved" (verse 16).<a name=382:7></a> Notice, "He that believes", "and he that disbelieves shall be condemned".<a name=382:8></a> Notice the word 'believe' in both clauses of the verse.<a name=382:9></a> It is an awful thing to have hanging over your head that if you have not faith you will be damned!<a name=382:10></a> It is an awful thing to speak of but it is necessary; you are in such danger!<a name=382:11></a> It is not simply that the Lord has done certain things to save you, it is a question of your state and that you shall 'pursue' this thing, 'faith', and never lose it.<a name=382:12></a> And then Mark goes on to quote what the Lord says after that -- I will just read it to you to call attention to what faith ensures to us.<a name=382:13></a> Notice when I read the verses that it is not a question of what is apostolic, the matter is for us christians.<a name=382:14></a> "And these signs shall follow those that have believed [notice that!<a name=382:15></a>], in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well" (verses  17, 18).<a name=382:16></a> These are the things that people who have faith can do -- believers, those who believe.<a name=382:17></a>

		Dear brethren, listen to what Mark is telling us here; he is telling us about what we are to pursue, having fled youthful lusts: "pursue .<a name=383:1></a>.<a name=383:2></a>.<a name=383:3></a> faith".<a name=383:4></a> And Mark is telling us what the Lord Jesus said about this matter of believing and what accrues from it to persons who believe.<a name=383:5></a> The verse says that in the Lord's name "they shall cast out demons".<a name=383:6></a> You say, There are no miracles like that now.<a name=383:7></a> But I am speaking of principles now, and I am not going to say there are no such miracles as these; there are such miracles as these, if I may call them that.<a name=383:8></a> If there are not there is no christianity; God would make us real christians, real believers in things to prove the reality of what faith yields to us.<a name=383:9></a> And the first thing that is said is that in the name of the Lord Jesus they shall cast out demons.<a name=383:10></a> Now the invocation of the Lord's name is essential to our very existence in this world; there is no power against the devil without it; every time we meet it is on this principle.<a name=383:11></a> So that "in my name they shall cast out demons", cast out the power of the devil.<a name=383:12></a> Is that not a reality?<a name=383:13></a> It certainly is.<a name=383:14></a> If there is anything I am more conscious of than another it is that the Spirit of God is greater than the devil, and greater in me than the devil.<a name=383:15></a> Whatever length that may go is a question; it may vary under certain conditions, as at the beginning compared with now, but the fact remains that the power in the believer is greater than the devil, and it confounds him.<a name=383:16></a> We must rely on this power and invoke it; and we do invoke it without knowing it.<a name=383:17></a> The devil would snatch up all our meetings if it were not for it.<a name=383:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=388:1></a> In divine incomings there is the idea of coming and <i>seeing</i> and then there is the idea of coming and <i>remaining</i>.<a name=388:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11">Genesis  11</a>God came down to see what the children of men were building, He did not come to stay but rather to see and condemn; then what Moses and the children of Israel built in Exodus also had in mind divine incomings, but the tabernacle of God was in mind there and God came to stay.<a name=388:3></a> There was a full examination of the structure and it was approved, Moses representing God in that sense, and also anointing it to show that it was approved, and then God came in Himself in glory, came in and remained, as it were.<a name=388:4></a> Now these scriptures are typical of what is in mind in the closing chapters of the evangelists regarding the Lord coming after He arose, and here verse 16 is particularly in mind, "But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them.<a name=388:5></a> And when they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted.<a name=388:6></a> And Jesus coming up spoke to them"; what follows shows that they were approved and commissioned.<a name=388:7></a> The idea of the assembly had been introduced by the Lord in chapters 16 and 18, viewed in both chapters as having an administrative constitution, and it is hoped that we may be able to confine our thoughts to that, involving as it does the kingdom of God which is largely treated of in this gospel, and the assembly in relation to it.<a name=388:8></a> The idea is authority with administrative service, not service God-ward exactly but service in an administrative and authoritative sense.<a name=388:9></a> So there is means in the assembly to deal with matters whatever they may be so that we can carry on.<a name=388:10></a> The whole chapter has been suggested, with the exception of the first verse,

		because it bears on what has been remarked and indeed in a larger sense the whole gospel does this.<a name=389:1></a> Righteousness is greatly stressed in view of this administrative institution because there should be moral authority as well as divinely appointed authority, and moral authority develops on moral grounds.<a name=389:2></a> Therefore we have from the very outset great stress laid on righteousness, particularly in the tenth chapter in which we have certain valuations which enter into this great matter.<a name=389:3></a> The Lord says after appointing the twelve, "He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.<a name=389:4></a> He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.<a name=389:5></a> And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward".<a name=389:6></a> The position is greatly strengthened on these moral lines as well as on commissioned or authoritative lines, and we have a list of values as they stand, namely a prophet, righteous man and a disciple.<a name=389:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=391:6></a> It is very good to bring that in because he was occupied administratively, sitting at the receipt of taxes, and the Lord inducted him; there was no 'if', it was just "Follow me".<a name=391:7></a> The first principle on the moral line is the authority of the Lord, and Matthew did follow Him.<a name=391:8></a> He is also to be regarded as a man of importance, and he used this importance immediately for the Lord and brought in certain ones that the Lord could evangelise.<a name=391:9></a> His calling was not a bad calling; it was an administrative matter and he was carrying it on, but the Lord said, "Follow me", and he did it.<a name=391:10></a> He is called Levi but his apostolic name is Matthew, which is very instructive; he is going to be employed now by the Lord in administrative matters.<a name=391:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=404:5></a> Well, it is a question of what is in mind in English because the word 'power' covers both, it covers both commandment and authority, and power supports the command; the two ideas are expressed in the same word.<a name=404:6></a> Suppose a policeman arrests a man, he must have something to show that his authority is from the government.<a name=404:7></a> Well, these men here are just eleven Jews, you may say, and they are told to go and make disciples of all nations.<a name=404:8></a> But are they just Jews?<a name=404:9></a> Presently, ten men shall take hold of the skirt of a Jew, "saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you", <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#8:23">Zechariah  8:23</a>.<a name=404:10></a> There will be power with them then, but that is not so here, this is simply going out amongst the nations to convert them and is more the thought of moral power because the Spirit of God is with them, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations" -- a great order!<a name=404:11></a> Making disciples is not simply telling a man what to do but relates to what the man is himself, as when the Lord said to them, I will make you fishers of men.<a name=404:12></a> There is clearly the suggestion of power in what they were commanded to do and these things must be in ourselves individually; that is the point in what we are looking at, that we might learn to <i>do</i> these things and be governed by these principles.<a name=404:13></a>

		THE LORD'S COMING TO HIS OWN AS SEEN IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (2)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=409:1></a> The same subject is in view as in our first reading, that is, the Lord coming to His own, only we are to look at it now from the standpoint of Luke's account, having his first treatise in mind and leaving Acts until perhaps the last reading.<a name=409:2></a> But I think we should again call attention to the women that enter into the account, and especially as Luke has the assembly in mind as functioning, not merely in an administrative or disciplinary sense but in the service of God, and therefore sisters are immediately in mind as set out in 1 Corinthians, Timothy, Titus and indeed generally.<a name=409:3></a> Luke gives us what may be called the constitutional side of the assembly as presented in chapter 8 in a man, a woman and a child; the girl of twelve years of age is raised up, the demoniac man is sitting, clothed in his right mind, and the woman is healed from the issue of blood.<a name=409:4></a> She is called "daughter", and it is the daughter of Jairus that is raised up, so these three seem to form the foundation proper to the assembly and there, as in this closing chapter, much prominence is given to women.<a name=409:5></a> It is said of them in the end of chapter 23, "And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed".<a name=409:6></a> That word 'placed' is to be noticed, it is not 'lay', and earlier we have the word that the Lord placed Himself at table in view of the Supper.<a name=409:7></a> But then chapter 23 goes on, "And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the commandment", showing that these women were governed by right principles outwardly, "But on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=430:1></a> It seems as if we should continue to look at Luke as bearing on our subject, that is, the Lord coming to His own as presented in the four gospels and in the Acts.<a name=430:2></a> His coming to them after He arose and before His ascension happened in a corporeal sense; He actually came to them, as Luke says in the Acts, "To whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:3">Acts  1:3</a>); so that many infallible proofs marked all the activities of the Lord in the forty days.<a name=430:3></a> Luke is singular in that in his gospel he makes no allusion to the forty days, but he does so in the Acts; the other gospels say nothing as to the actual time involved before His ascension after He arose though they all indicate that some time elapsed.<a name=430:4></a> Matthew does not mention the ascension at all, so that we have to keep in mind that according to Matthew the Lord is here in some sense with us, as He says, "all the days".<a name=430:5></a> John does not formally state that He ascended; however, he mentions, without specifying time or circumstances, that the Lord said, "I ascend".<a name=430:6></a> Mark and Luke are definitely specific, Luke saying that He was carried up into heaven and Mark that He was taken up.<a name=430:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thought that we should see the meaning of Luke's allusion to time in the first day after He arose and before His ascension because it is as if the Spirit would suggest that there was haste in reaching heaven, that actual dispensational operations could not begin until He reached that position, and that everything should issue from heaven so that there should be no delay in reaching that point.<a name=430:8></a> Hence this chapter leaves us with the impression that the Lord was very active on the first day, and that He finished and went

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=431:9></a> I think that it would be that it was already detached from the idea of the temple.<a name=431:10></a> The temple was still owned in Jerusalem as the public centre of divine service, but the Lord's supper was not to come into that setting; it belongs to the christian position and I believe the things that happened at that time would indicate that.<a name=431:11></a> It took the character of a household matter at first; they broke bread from house to house, but it was just the house in contrast to a religious building; I think that is how the matter stands.<a name=431:12></a> It was a transitional period, showing the compassions of God as lingering over the Jews.<a name=431:13></a> The Lord went up from Bethany, which is the remnant position, and the disciples are immediately linked with the temple in the gospel, but in Acts it is not mentioned.<a name=431:14></a>

		At the end of chapter 14 there is a break, "Rise up, let us go hence", the Lord having already said that the ruler of this world comes; that means that something is going to happen; the Lord is moving on now, and then chapter 15 points to the vine, really the earthly dispensation, and chapter 16 brings out the position of the disciples.<a name=490:1></a> "These things I have spoken unto you that ye may not be offended.<a name=490:2></a> They shall put you out of the synagogues; but the hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God".<a name=490:3></a> This is the position of the disciples as having to suffer and to be killed on His account; then chapter 17 is His prayer to the Father.<a name=490:4></a> What is in mind in this section from chapter 14 on is evidenced in the present day, the Spirit's day.<a name=490:5></a> It is not speaking of what happened during the forty days; it is expressed before that but alludes to the Spirit coming.<a name=490:6></a> What happens here after the Spirit comes is the thing we want to get at, so that we might be strengthened.<a name=490:7></a>

		J.D.<a name=490:8></a> Verse 21 says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me".<a name=490:9></a> What would those commandments be?<a name=490:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=490:11></a> I would say if I were specifying them that they would take in the epistles to the Corinthians, in fact all the Pauline epistles, because they convey the commandments to us, possibly 1 Corinthians especially so.<a name=490:12></a> In connection with prophecy we have in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment".<a name=490:13></a> That is the way really, and the whole epistle is concerned with this; no one need expect to have visitations who does not obey the commandments.<a name=490:14></a>
