		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> We get in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>the question of housing.<a name=1:3></a> The Lord knew the number that would come so there was no need of hastily improvising accommodation.<a name=1:4></a> I thought it would help us to consider the facts which bear on this point, that we might see how the Lord had a place in mind large enough, and how readily the subjects of the work of God fitted in, so that they were quite at home there.<a name=1:5></a> It occurred to me that this section in Luke would serve to show that the Lord had something large before Him, and that it should be cherished.<a name=1:6></a>

		It will be observed that the initiative was taken by the Lord in this gospel, He sends Peter and John; in the other gospels they enquire.<a name=1:7></a> I think Peter and John would represent vigilance and administrative provision on the one hand, and family feeling on the other.<a name=1:8></a> There can be no right housekeeping without these two features -- administration on the one hand which keeps things in order and brings in supplies, and the family feeling and affections on the other without which we cannot have right house conditions.<a name=1:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=1:10></a>C.<a name=1:11></a> I suppose the administrative order would safeguard and give room for the development of the affections.<a name=1:12></a> You would suggest that Peter gives administration and John the family.<a name=1:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=1:14></a> Yes.<a name=1:15></a> Order and supply go together.<a name=1:16></a> The part Peter had in the opening of the dispensation shows that he represents the administrative side.<a name=1:17></a> He stood up with the eleven, making one of the twelve, representing in what he said what he stood for: it

		As a rule we have much difficulty in housing our numbers, but in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>there seemed to be no inconvenience in the fact that three thousand came in at once: there was house accommodation for all of them.<a name=2:8></a> These verses do not describe what marked the first day, but they describe a period after Pentecost, conditions that marked the early christians, not only that day but for a definite period.<a name=2:9></a> The more you look into them the more delightful they are, so easy, nothing forced; there was no confusion and no one lacked anything.<a name=2:10></a> All the house principles were present, there was subjection and they persevered steadily in spite of the current against them: "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers".<a name=2:11></a> We have in these features elements of the house; they involve principles that survive, that cannot be overthrown by the current against them.<a name=2:12></a> First they persevered in the apostles' teaching and fellowship; it was that kind of teaching, and there was subjection to the authority of Christ in those men who were acting as Christ's representatives.<a name=2:13></a> That is easily applicable at the present time and there can be no house conditions apart from that.<a name=2:14></a> One could understand how each one of these three thousand believers would have a great regard for Peter, the light had come into their souls through Peter, and they would

		The subject of housing in spiritual things is of great interest, because it is a principle of God.<a name=3:20></a> We get the elements of it in these verses in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>; they indicate the elements that make up the houses.<a name=3:21></a> These twelve men were remarkable people, those who stood up with a hundred and twenty in the background.<a name=3:22></a>

		My exercise is to speak about light on this occasion.<a name=35:1></a> It is a very extensive subject, I need not say, but I desire to present it in connection with one or two features bearing on christians.<a name=35:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be remembered that Scripture says God is light, and that He dwells in light.<a name=35:3></a> The latter passage alludes to His infinite, eternal existence; for it is written that He dwells "in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see".<a name=35:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:16">1 Timothy  6:16</a>.<a name=35:5></a> But when it is said that God is light, we have a reference to revelation -- that He has come out.<a name=35:6></a> It was said in the Old Testament that He dwelt in thick darkness.<a name=35:7></a> <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#6:1">2 Chronicles  6:1</a> That, of course, is not His eternal existence, to which I have already referred.<a name=35:8></a> It is a reference to the dispensation in which He dwelt beneath curtains; for although the candlestick was in the holy place there was no light within the veil -- no material light.<a name=35:9></a> So that the expression that He dwelt in thick darkness is relative, referring to the Old Testament times; and the statement that God is light, and that He is in the light, has reference to the present time.<a name=35:10></a> And it is with this, beloved friends, that we have to do immediately, for we are enjoined to walk in the light as God is in the light.<a name=35:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, as you will all remember, God said, "Let there be light", and it says, "There was light".<a name=35:12></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:3">Genesis  1:3</a> Of course, the allusion is to physical light, but it may be taken up as a type of what we have at the present time, namely, that God is working in the light.<a name=35:13></a> All the work in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>follows upon the command or word that there should be light and that there was light, and that that light obtained a definite name, 'Day', pointing to the period

		Now, having said so much, I want to come to chapter 1 of John's gospel, and what I have in mind, beloved friends, is very practical, namely that we should see that the light that shines in our day is universal.<a name=36:9></a> I want to show by the Lord's help that we are to be brought into accord with it, that we should be universal in our outlook and in our affections, for one's outlook is one thing, but how much of it you can include in sympathetic interest is another.<a name=36:10></a> And the more we know of God, the more we shall include in sympathetic interest what He is interested in.<a name=36:11></a> So that you have John the baptist introduced, first as a witness, that all men should believe.<a name=36:12></a> The bearing of John's witness was that <i>all</i> men should believe, which is an important thing to notice.<a name=36:13></a> And then it says, lest anyone should be misled as to John's great ministry, "He was not that light".<a name=36:14></a> Now I want to dwell on that.<a name=36:15></a> Indeed it was what was in my mind particularly, for so many of the people of God are misled.<a name=36:16></a> You may say, John the baptist would not mislead anybody!<a name=36:17></a> Surely not!<a name=36:18></a> Of all the witnesses of Christ he is the truest.<a name=36:19></a> I mean that up to his time there was not a greater, and the apostle John seems to make him a model for us.<a name=36:20></a> In this chapter you will find how faithfully, and, I may say, affectionately John the baptist pointed away from himself to Christ.<a name=36:21></a> And not only that but his testimony had such an effect upon his followers that they turned away from him and followed Jesus.<a name=36:22></a> And yet with all that, one may be misled by even such a witness; that is to say, by assuming that he was the light; that he represented what was shining.<a name=36:23></a> Now I believe there is a warning set down here in these words, "he was not that light".<a name=36:24></a>

		The Lord himself said John was a burning and a shining light, but he was not <i>the</i> light.<a name=37:1></a>

		And so the Holy Spirit calls attention to this lest anyone should be diverted even by such a great and true witness of Christ, for believers have been misled, beloved friends, by persons who were themselves true.<a name=37:2></a> And so we have in christendom so many denominations, each assuming to have the light.<a name=37:3></a> One says, "<i>I</i> am of Paul".<a name=37:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:12">1 Corinthians  1:12</a> Was Paul misleading anyone when he called attention to that?<a name=37:5></a> Not at all.<a name=37:6></a> The person who spoke thus was being misled through partisan preference.<a name=37:7></a> And so Paul says immediately, "Was Paul crucified for you?<a name=37:8></a>".<a name=37:9></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:13">1 Corinthians  1:13</a> if not, how then could he represent fully the light of God?<a name=37:10></a> And so John the baptist was not the light.<a name=37:11></a> There have been great preachers and great ministers.<a name=37:12></a> Take Luther, for instance, a great servant of God; as we may say, one in whom light arose out of the darkness.<a name=37:13></a> Out of medieval darkness and superstition and idolatry the light arose in an obscure man, and men became followers of that servant of God, and have continued to be up to the present time.<a name=37:14></a> What is the secret of that?<a name=37:15></a> They have misapprehended the person.<a name=37:16></a> They have lost sight of this great statement in the first chapter of John, that no servant, however true, can be the light.<a name=37:17></a> And so with many others whom I might mention, but it is needless.<a name=37:18></a> The word is "That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world".<a name=37:19></a> That is the <i>true</i> light.<a name=37:20></a> And, beloved brethren, we want to get that definitely and clearly into our souls, that the light in which we are is a light that shines universally, and it will never lead us to localism, nationalism, or metropolitanism.<a name=37:21></a> It will maintain us in thoughts in relation to God.<a name=37:22></a> It will maintain us in broadness of outlook and sympathy with God.<a name=37:23></a> And so you look up into the face of Jesus in which shines the light of God.<a name=37:24></a> That light shines in Asia, in Australia

		In taking up this scripture tonight I have in my mind to speak of it as representing Christ.<a name=46:1></a> I wish particularly to present it in relation to its measurements, having in view that God is a God of measure (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:13">2 Corinthians  10:13</a>).<a name=46:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well that we should have before us that He is a God of measure.<a name=46:3></a> The physical creation attests the accuracy of His measurements, and the principle enters into every part of the creation.<a name=46:4></a> And as it marks the physical system, so it marks the moral system.<a name=46:5></a> The moral system is pictured in the tabernacle and its appurtenances in the book of Exodus, and there, as most of us know, we find the principle of measure, beginning with the passage I have just read, and working out from the ark to the curtains of the court; in other words, working out from Christ to the uttermost boundaries of the moral system.<a name=46:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Taking up this principle, the apostle Paul enjoins young believers, as at Rome -- indeed, all believers -- to be governed in their service by the measure of faith given to each.<a name=46:7></a> Then in writing to the Corinthians he calls attention to the fact that he himself was governed by that same principle.<a name=46:8></a> His service was according to the measure that God had apportioned to him.<a name=46:9></a> He points out that that measure enabled him to reach even to the Corinthians (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:13">2 Corinthians  10:13</a> - 16).<a name=46:10></a> Every convert through his ministry was an evidence of that measure.<a name=46:11></a> It is noteworthy that this appears in the letter to the Corinthians.<a name=46:12></a> This is no doubt in keeping with the fact that the truth is developed in those letters from the standpoint of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and so it was important that these refractory converts, which, alas!<a name=46:13></a>, they

		I mention all this in a prefatory way, believing in its practicableness if we are to move here so as not to disturb the divine equilibrium.<a name=47:4></a> God works according to the principle of weight and measure; otherwise we should not have the physical universe as it exists.<a name=47:5></a> And these same principles apply in the moral system.<a name=47:6></a> It is a question of weight, as it were, and measure -- I have measure particularly in mind -- and unless each of us discovers his measure, the measure that God has apportioned him, we shall disturb, as I said, in so far as we may, the divine equilibrium -- a most serious matter!<a name=47:7></a> The Corinthians were doing it, and what began there has extended in our day throughout the length and breadth of christendom; and in it we find a perfect travesty of the poise which marked the divine moral system at the outset.<a name=47:8></a> It is for us, therefore, as being recovered through the grace of God, to recognise this great divine principle, so that each of us may be found moving according to the measure which God has apportioned him.<a name=47:9></a>

		The gospel of John bears on the last days.<a name=65:1></a> This is stamped on it throughout, and so this answer or inquiry of the Lord from Pilate bears on our day too, in which much is given out that is heard from others: "Sayest thou this thing of thyself .<a name=65:2></a>.<a name=65:3></a>.<a name=65:4></a> ?<a name=65:5></a>".<a name=65:6></a> There is great light, thank God, and much writing -- there is much to write about and there is much to speak about.<a name=65:7></a> John's gospel fits in with this, for it says that if all the things which Jesus did were written, "even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written"; <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:25">John  21:25</a> so that there is plenty of substance and plenty of matter too for conversation amongst the people of God.<a name=65:8></a> It is right surely that we should transmit to one another the things that we know, according to what marked earlier believers, of whom we read they "spake often one to another"; <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a> indeed it is not only right and of God and profitable, but imperative that the saints should thus converse.<a name=65:9></a> I do not suppose there will be any writing or discourse in heaven, but there will be holy converse, and this holy conversation begins now on earth.<a name=65:10></a> We are made accustomed to it now as being of the family of God, for we speak often one to another.<a name=65:11></a> As of old, too, God has His part, for it is said, "He harkened and heard", <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a> and so God has delight in it.<a name=65:12></a>

		The features of the new man which are delightful to Him appear, as the saints thus dwell together in holy conversation, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, and singing with grace in our hearts to the Lord, and even speaking to ourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in our hearts to the Lord.<a name=65:13></a> All these things are delightful to God but then dear brethren this

	<div class="paragraph">
		But then this inquiry of the Lord bears on us, as I have said, for it is not written as a mere item of historic interest.<a name=66:4></a> It <i>is</i> that; but God never confines Himself to mere historic records.<a name=66:5></a> The Bible is not history; so much could have been written that is left out, and therefore what is written has to be noted as of great value and as bearing upon us not in a historical way but in a moral way.<a name=66:6></a> If, as I said, books that could fill the world have not been written, how valuable must the one be that is written, though relatively small.<a name=66:7></a> Every word of it is pure gold, so to speak, whether spoken to a Roman governor, or to a Jewish high priest, to a thief on the cross, or to a Pharisee or a Sadducee.<a name=66:8></a> Every word recorded from the lips of Christ is pure gold tried in the fire.<a name=66:9></a> As the psalmist says, "The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#12:6">Psalm  12:6</a>.<a name=66:10></a> "The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:72">Psalm  119:72</a>.<a name=66:11></a>

		God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, and so we cry, "Abba, Father".<a name=68:14></a> So if you preach the gospel, what you say you are to say of yourself, as the apostle says, "I believed, and therefore have I spoken".<a name=68:15></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:13">2 Corinthians  4:13</a>.<a name=68:16></a> When you believe, it is not what another brother says; it is a question of light in your soul in connection with God.<a name=68:17></a> You apprehend something -- you apprehend God in Christ, you apprehend the significance of the death of Christ, and the cleansing value of His blood.<a name=68:18></a> "I believed", the apostle says, "and therefore have I spoken".<a name=68:19></a> It is what you apprehend on the principle of faith that you speak of yourself, and not more than that; and then if you speak to the Lord's people (and I know well enough what a bearing this has on oneself) the exercise should be to speak of yourself, that is to say, to speak of what you believe -- of what you apprehend in relation to God in Christ and what God is in Christ in relation to the saints.<a name=68:20></a> The gospel is what God is in Christ in relation to all men; the ministry of the new covenant

		The only way to get a true view of the work of God is to see it abstractly.<a name=133:8></a> So 1 Chronicles gives us the spiritual David, standing up upon his feet.<a name=133:9></a> He is handing the responsibilities of the kingdom and the house over to Solomon, and many times he says, "My God", just as the apostle Paul in similar circumstances, "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:19">Philippians  4:19</a>.<a name=133:10></a> What a spiritual statement was that, and so David says, "Because I have set my affection to the house of my God", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:3">1 Chronicles  29:3</a>.<a name=133:11></a>

		In reading these scriptures I have before me the thought of simplicity.<a name=135:1></a> In 2 Corinthians the apostle refers to "simplicity as to the Christ", a word which we might not expect in regard to Christ, but which we learn from the gospels has striking application to Him.<a name=135:2></a> Those also, who are after Christ, who have faith and are marked by His character, never fail of simplicity.<a name=135:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle alludes to Satan's first onslaught upon our race in introducing this matter.<a name=135:4></a> The serpent, he says, beguiled Eve: he was operating on the same principle at Corinth.<a name=135:5></a> The true Eve -- the assembly -- was found locally at Corinth.<a name=135:6></a> The apostle alludes to what precedes the marriage relation; he had espoused the Corinthians unto one Man, to present them as a chaste virgin to Christ.<a name=135:7></a> <i>He</i> had done it, showing that he had remarkable insight into the Lord's feelings and affections.<a name=135:8></a> John the baptist was a friend of the Bridegroom, and rejoiced greatly at the voice of the Bridegroom.<a name=135:9></a> He heard it and says, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom".<a name=135:10></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:29">John  3:29</a>.<a name=135:11></a> He says nothing about her in a concrete way as having any part in his remarkable ministry; but as a man pre-eminently affected by spiritual instincts, he recognised the Bridegroom and that the bride was <i>His</i>.<a name=135:12></a> John was unique in that the Holy Spirit was in him from infancy, controlling his faculties and senses.<a name=135:13></a> He had a fine sense of what was morally beautiful; he looked upon Jesus as He walked (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:36">John  1:36</a>), and said, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=135:14></a> Then in chapter 3:29, he rejoiced because of the Bridegroom's voice, and his joy was full.<a name=135:15></a>

		So in going into Corinth Paul had the desires of Christ before him.<a name=136:9></a> The Lord says to him, "No man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city".<a name=136:10></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>.<a name=136:11></a> He assured him of safe conduct, for He knew what was in Paul's heart; not simply that they should be converted, but that they should be espoused to Christ.<a name=136:12></a> Supreme simplicity marked the espousal; he himself was very simple, he was a craftsman.<a name=136:13></a> But for all the simplicity, the most wonderful work was going on.<a name=136:14></a> Think of such a ministry as that!<a name=136:15></a> Every convert in that town, in the apostle's mind, was part of what was espoused to Christ.<a name=136:16></a> Even as to his speech he says, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified".<a name=136:17></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>.<a name=136:18></a> He would bring in Gethsemane and the cross, but all was in simplicity, so that the youngest there would understand that their faith "should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God".<a name=136:19></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:5">1 Corinthians  2:5</a>.<a name=136:20></a>

		Now I beg you to take note of this espousal to Christ.<a name=137:11></a> I do not believe any young person, brother or sister, is fit to be espoused in a natural way according to God, until such an one is espoused to Christ.<a name=137:12></a> If young people were more concerned about being espoused to Christ, they would find their legitimate desires fulfilled under the government of God.<a name=137:13></a> You have Christ first: it is God's way.<a name=137:14></a> He has title to us, He has redemptive rights over us.<a name=137:15></a>

		Well, the Corinthians were taught that they were espoused to one Man and Satan saw that.<a name=137:16></a> He saw what God was doing, what Paul was aiming at, and he sought to spoil it.<a name=137:17></a> Hence the apostle says, "I fear .<a name=137:18></a>.<a name=137:19></a>.<a name=137:20></a> as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ".<a name=137:21></a> The first letter however became effective, but there remained the danger among others, that the saints should be corrupted in their minds from simplicity as to the Christ.<a name=137:22></a>

		Now I want to show you briefly how this simplicity is worked out typically in David.<a name=137:23></a> I take him for the moment as a type of the believer.<a name=137:24></a> There is a readiness with him to take on whatever was divinely available in his service or for his spiritual help, avoiding pretension.<a name=137:25></a> As he appears in the presence

	<div class="paragraph">
		David wisely laid aside the showy habiliments of Saul, and took for the conflict what he was accustomed to.<a name=138:6></a> We are told there was a pocket in the shepherd's bag which he had, indicating the simplicity of his equipment.<a name=138:7></a> His weapons were a sling and stones and a staff.<a name=138:8></a> All was simple, such as he was accustomed to use.<a name=138:9></a> It may be remarked here, that it is well to use artillery in connection with the enemy, but artillery service will never do with the brethren.<a name=138:10></a> So David selects five smooth stones out of the brook, water-worn doubtless and thus made suitable for his purpose; for spiritually it is a question of the word of God, not a matter of show or man's device.<a name=138:11></a> It was extremely simple, and the result showed that such warfare is effective.<a name=138:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to chapter 21, David is definitely rejected; he is under pressure.<a name=138:13></a> But he maintains his simplicity, he comes to the priest at Nob who says, "Why art thou alone?<a name=138:14></a>".<a name=138:15></a> <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#21:1">1 Samuel  21:1</a> I wonder how many of us have had the experience of being alone as rejected.<a name=138:16></a> I am thinking of the solitariness of Gethsemane and Calvary.<a name=138:17></a> All forsook the Lord and fled.<a name=138:18></a> He looked for comforters and found none.<a name=138:19></a> It was a solitary matter, and the Lord would have us to know what it is to be alone in rejection.<a name=138:20></a> But although in such circumstances David retains his simplicity, he says to the priest, "What is under thine hand?<a name=138:21></a> give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present".<a name=138:22></a> <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#21:3">1 Samuel  21:3</a> What have you there?<a name=138:23></a> That is all: no

		J.T.<a name=145:3></a> To bring in the levites in their heavenly relation.<a name=145:4></a> That is an advance on what we are speaking of.<a name=145:5></a> The seventy had gone out representative of levitical service from the standpoint of Numbers, that is, those who carry things, and toil and labour.<a name=145:6></a> Well, they were successful in their service, but the Lord in His remarks directs them away from Numbers, without naming the books as to their teaching.<a name=145:7></a> Deuteronomy and Joshua generally contemplate the priests and the Levites as the same -- "the priests the Levites".<a name=145:8></a> The distinction between the priests and the Levites in Deuteronomy and Joshua is not very marked.<a name=145:9></a> Indeed those who carry the Ark are definitely called priests in Joshua (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#3:8">Joshua  3:8</a>).<a name=145:10></a> In Numbers they are under the supervision of Eleazar (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#3:32">Numbers  3:32</a>), but in Deuteronomy and Joshua they are the priestly tribe.<a name=145:11></a> That is what the Lord has in mind, to lead us out of the service of toil into our heavenly relations.<a name=145:12></a> So that He says, "Rejoice not that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:20">Luke  10:20</a>.<a name=145:13></a> Now if you compare that with <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>you will see it says, "Ye have come to .<a name=145:14></a>.<a name=145:15></a>.<a name=145:16></a> the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:23">Hebrews  12:23</a>.<a name=145:17></a> That refers to the Levites in Joshua; their portion is heavenly.<a name=145:18></a> It is in that way, I think, that there is correspondence here with heaven, not because we are toiling labourers, but because we are heavenly already.<a name=145:19></a> The clerical idea would set that aside, but the true Levites of God are heavenly; their names are written in heaven, and if they toil here, they bring the heavenly in, but their service is as priests.<a name=145:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=146:8></a> Yes, the divine thought is for us all.<a name=146:9></a> But it is a great thing, I think, to see the distinction between the levitical position in Numbers which implies toil -- the carrying of things, and the priestly position in Deuteronomy and Joshua.<a name=146:10></a> That is, in the land the position is changed.<a name=146:11></a> Our names are said to be written in heaven, and thus we are to represent heaven here in a priestly way.<a name=146:12></a> The seventy were engaged with their service -- their success in ministry, and they relate to the Lord what they had done, whereas He directs them to their heavenly portion, "Rejoice", He says, "that your names are written in the heavens".<a name=146:13></a> We ought to understand that we have a fixed place there.<a name=146:14></a>

		In our hymn, dear brethren, reference was made to <i>the will of God</i>, and this strikes one as peculiarly fitting to form a basis for our communications together at this time.<a name=167:1></a> As having known our beloved brother intimately for many years, one is impressed with the applicability of it to him and his part in the service of God.<a name=167:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In referring to the will of God, we are reminded of how prominently it occupied our Lord's mind as having become Man, and as Man in His service, and in view of His departure.<a name=167:3></a> One is affected in referring to the unspeakable depths of feeling which marked the Lord in facing death: He was "amazed", we are told, "and deeply depressed".<a name=167:4></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:37">Matthew  26:37</a>.<a name=167:5></a> So thoroughly had He taken up man's place, and so thoroughly did He understand the import of the will of God as to this position that He felt it; hence the deep agony, and the words: "Not my will, but thine, be done".<a name=167:6></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:42">Luke  22:42</a>.<a name=167:7></a>

		In David, as foreshadowing all this, we have a remarkable example (which one believes corresponds with that set by our beloved departed brother), that he ministered to the will of God in his own generation.<a name=167:8></a> The Holy Spirit dwells on the life of David peculiarly.<a name=167:9></a> Although not, as we would speak today, a very long life, it was a life of compression, a life into which immense events were compressed.<a name=167:10></a> In referring to the idea of compression in such a path, one cannot but think of the compression of the life of Jesus, especially the three and a half years of His service.<a name=167:11></a> What a life!<a name=167:12></a> What events of eternal import were compressed into that life, and how in every moment

		So to David, a man of like passions with ourselves, we have this beautiful tribute by the apostle Paul: "Having in his own generation ministered to the will of God, fell asleep".<a name=168:8></a> This is a greater thing than to minister to others, for it fills out what the mind of God delights in.<a name=168:9></a> So as I said, this is what marked our brother; not great exploits outwardly (for there may be these without ministering to the will of God), but steady adherence to and support of what pleased God.<a name=168:10></a> After all, it is what God has in a brother that is the whole matter.<a name=168:11></a> "Fear God, and keep his commandments", <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#12:13">Ecclesiastes  12:13</a> one has said, is "the whole matter".<a name=168:12></a> It is what accrues to God that will tell; it is what has told, beloved brethren, and what will tell in that day when things are manifested.<a name=168:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to our brother, I know of none who felt more keenly current spiritual events amongst the saints of God.<a name=168:15></a> "The times that went over him" in all the years of his service involved serious crises and conflicts, local and general, and I never knew him to fail of the mind of God, nor shirk the responsibility

		It is very beautiful that the Holy Spirit mentions such recorders of David's life as the prophets Samuel, Nathan and Gad, We may be assured that the sum total of that ministry to the will of God was gathered up faithfully for the food, the encouragement and the stimulation of later servants, as these books of Samuel, Nathan and Gad were read.<a name=169:3></a> To the same end I venture this afternoon to call attention to the ministry of our brother, what it was for the will of God.<a name=169:4></a> What a stimulation to ourselves to pursue the path of faith humbly, unostentatiously, but letting nothing miss us that ministers to the will of God that we may know how the will of God enters into the times that pass over us and minister to it.<a name=169:5></a> May the Lord help us, dear brethren, and comfort our beloved ones here, our dear bereaved sister especially.<a name=169:6></a>

		The first part of the chapter read suggests the number that God requires for the accomplishment of His purpose; the second part contemplates unlimitedness as to those who avail themselves of what He provides.<a name=181:1></a> I thought we might profitably look at the chapter from these two viewpoints.<a name=181:2></a> What He requires is dictated by the demands of His throne; what He provides in a limitless way stands related to the love of His heart, and we go out in the gospel on that line, but what God has in His purpose for administration He necessarily limits.<a name=181:3></a> It is not that a hundred and forty-four thousand indicates a limit, but there is such a thing as limitation in the divine scheme -- <i>countability</i>.<a name=181:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The divine requirements from the standpoint of sovereign counsel will be met, and I thought we might profitably consider first whether we are ranged under the head of those who are countable, because from the standpoint of administration, divine administration, love is essential in those who have part -- those who are to be used -- so that they may be employed at the divine pleasure, according to the very great divisibility of the number given.<a name=181:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We also have in the Scriptures mention of His <i>turning</i> round, one notable instance being the sorrowful moment when He stood before the high priest and Simon Peter denied Him.<a name=192:2></a> As the cock crew, it is said by Luke, the Lord turned round and looked at Peter (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:61">Luke  22:61</a>).<a name=192:3></a> If it were merely the fact that He looked at him, the action of turning round need not have been mentioned, but the action denotes the great interest which the Lord had in an erring one, even in that supreme moment of sorrow in which there was before Him the most intense suffering, well known to Him in anticipation, and which would necessarily occupy Him.<a name=192:4></a> It had, indeed, as we know, occupied Him as recorded earlier, for He prayed with the deepest earnestness and intentness in regard to the cup that He was about to drink.<a name=192:5></a> It had not left His mind as a passing matter; it was a supreme matter that entered into that moment, that governed that moment, and never was lost sight of by the Lord, and yet we are told that He turned round to look at Peter, at an erring follower or disciple!<a name=192:6></a> And the movement and the look brought about the desired end.<a name=192:7></a> In the Lord's account it was well worth while to turn aside, as it were, from what was so intense in His spirit, and look on an erring disciple.<a name=192:8></a> Such is the restoring grace of the Lord.<a name=192:9></a> He is always a Man of great affairs.<a name=192:10></a> Joseph represents Christ as a man of great affairs, occupied all day; he came in at noon to dine.<a name=192:11></a> There were twelve hours in the day, and he filled them out, and so with the Lord, He was always a man of great business.<a name=192:12></a> We read of Him "upholding all things by the word of his power" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>), but

		Well, that is all I have to say, but I think you can see how it applies.<a name=225:19></a> If we are to be in the assembly according to God we must follow out these features and see how God works out, in spite of the flesh, a state of love and spirituality among His people so that His mind prevails; it never will prevail while the flesh has place, as long as nature moves us in relation to the things of God.<a name=225:20></a> God prevails, we must make up our minds to it, He will turn the world upside down; God will have His way.<a name=225:21></a> So here Israel put Ephraim before Manasseh, and Ephraim was never displaced, for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance.<a name=225:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=226:1></a> I have been noticing lately how the gospel of Luke would furnish conditions to enhance the service of the gospel, and it occurred to me that it would be profitable to consider a little those conditions so that the gospel might go out from us more effectively, and I thought this section would serve to indicate the place this feature has in Luke.<a name=226:2></a> The word in Ephesians clearly puts it upon us to have our feet shod with the preparation of the glad tidings of peace, and the Lord in this gospel speaks about His feet.<a name=226:3></a> Indeed, we have in this very chapter the evidence of how far He would travel to get souls.<a name=226:4></a> But what occurred in the gathering as He came in plainly indicates that He had in mind that the gospel should be unhindered, that nothing should stand in its way, and that conditions among the saints should be suitable to it.<a name=226:5></a> In this gospel the Lord is seen at the outset as very attractive in preaching -- His manner of reading and speaking, and His mouth; not only the words that He uttered but the manner in which He uttered them all tended to enhance the message, He being anointed.<a name=226:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=227:3></a> Yes; the feet shod, so that even the footsteps would denote preparation.<a name=227:4></a> In Canticles one enquires about the Lord: "Tell me, thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock, where thou makest it to rest at noon; for why should I be as one veiled beside the flocks of thy companions?<a name=227:5></a> If thou know not, thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock" <a href="../bible/Songofsongs.htm#1:7">Song of songs  1:7</a>,8.<a name=227:6></a> The "footsteps of the flock" have their own distinction.<a name=227:7></a> So that the footsteps of the brethren in any locality are to be traced; they have their own distinction so that others are guided by them.<a name=227:8></a> It is not, therefore, that one invites persons to hear the gospel or even to preach it, but that the footsteps, the preparation of the glad tidings of peace, are on the feet.<a name=227:9></a> That is what I was thinking.<a name=227:10></a>

		That was how matters stood at the outset, and so that we might see the continuance of the Lord's attitude and service 2 Timothy speaks of the apostle Paul at Rome in the very mouth of the lion, as if nothing could save him.<a name=250:1></a> What exercises the apostle must have gone through as at the lion's mouth, for what hand could stay, as far as man could see, the emperor, and what hand could stay the mouth of lions, not only one lion but lions in a den with a Daniel there unprotected?<a name=250:2></a> But the lions' mouths were stopped.<a name=250:3></a> The lion at Rome did not have his mouth stopped, but the apostle was delivered from it, which is equal, and, in a way, a more remarkable exploit.<a name=250:4></a> "The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; .<a name=250:5></a>.<a name=250:6></a>.<a name=250:7></a> and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion", he says <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:17">2 Timothy  4:17</a>.<a name=250:8></a> It was the same Lord that, as ascended, sat at the right hand of God and worked with the earlier servants.<a name=250:9></a> But now, in a day of brokenness -- for 2 Timothy contemplates that -- our own times indeed -- it is the same Lord, and He stands by His servant when all forsake him.<a name=250:10></a> "At my first answer", he says, "no man stood with me".<a name=250:11></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:16">2 Timothy  4:16</a>.<a name=250:12></a> How well the Lord understood that, for when He was taken, "They all forsook him and fled", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:50">Mark  14:50</a>.<a name=250:13></a> He stood there solitary and went through the judgment alone.<a name=250:14></a> None but He could do that.<a name=250:15></a> But He knew well the heart of His servant at that moment as forsaken, and He stood by him and delivered him from the lion's mouth, and then he adds, "that by me the preaching might be fully known".<a name=250:16></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:17">2 Timothy  4:17</a> It is as if the Lord, having taken him up, would see him through and see him through victoriously, triumphantly.<a name=250:17></a> How he would realise at that moment the power and the sympathy of Christ!<a name=250:18></a> How he could say, as he does here in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=250:19></a> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord".<a name=250:20></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:57">1 Corinthians  15:57</a>.<a name=250:21></a>

		In brief, that is how this subject stands in the New Testament, and, as I have stated, 2 Timothy brings it down to our own times, and that epistle contemplates no surrender at all, but a continuance in the work.<a name=251:1></a> "Do the work of an evangelist", Paul says <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:5">2 Timothy  4:5</a>.<a name=251:2></a> That is what I am speaking of particularly, and so I wish to show from Isaiah how this works out in a remnant, because, according to 2 Timothy, we are in remnant times.<a name=251:3></a> So, as you will observe, the word is, "Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord".<a name=251:4></a> That is exactly the 2 Timothy position, for, as naming the name of the Lord we withdraw from iniquity.<a name=251:5></a> How could we meet the position otherwise?<a name=251:6></a> Iniquity is so powerful in this world and is now contemplated as in religious circles, the word of certain wicked men eating as a gangrene, so that the system has been leavened and there is no hope save by withdrawing.<a name=251:7></a> But in withdrawing, it is as naming the name of the Lord, so that the Lord is on our side in the position, even although one has to stand alone like the apostle Paul, but the Lord will stand by you, and there is no power that can cope with Him.<a name=251:8></a> As the apostle says elsewhere, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?<a name=251:9></a> are we stronger than he?<a name=251:10></a>", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:22">1 Corinthians  10:22</a>.<a name=251:11></a> With the Lord on our side, as one said, "I shall not be moved".<a name=251:12></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#10:6">Psalm  10:6</a>.<a name=251:13></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:8">Psalm  16:8</a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#62:6">Psalm  62:6</a>.<a name=251:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in addition to that, you have a seal in 2 Timothy: "Having this seal".<a name=251:15></a> That is, the withdrawing person -- the person naming the name of the Lord who withdraws from iniquity -- has a seal, that is to say, he has a moral right to serve.<a name=251:16></a> The seal is moral, but nevertheless a mandate that cannot be contested.<a name=251:17></a> It bears the divine stamp, for it has on one side, "The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".<a name=251:18></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a>.<a name=251:19></a>

		The position, therefore, is, "those that are his" -- "The Lord knows those that are his".<a name=252:1></a> As at Corinth so today, He knows everyone in christendom that is His, and we want all those.<a name=252:2></a> The work of God has all those in view, no less than that.<a name=252:3></a> We do not know them, it may be, or only a few, but the Lord knows them all, and as we move under His direction we shall find them; He will not fail to direct us.<a name=252:4></a>

		Then in the passage in 2 Timothy there is the idea of a great house, in which there are vessels to honour and to dishonour, and if one "purge himself from these", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:21">2 Timothy  2:21</a> that is, those to dishonour, "he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use".<a name=252:5></a> That is to say, 'the Lord' involves protection, but 'the Master' is to be served.<a name=252:6></a> And what a Master!<a name=252:7></a> And then it goes on, "Flee also youthful lusts", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a> a very important word, because the burden of active service must be on the young men and the young women.<a name=252:8></a> "I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:14">1 John  2:14</a>.<a name=252:9></a> Hence, "Youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=252:10></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>.<a name=252:11></a> It is such persons who are addressed here in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51">Isaiah  51</a>.<a name=252:12></a> The prophet fits exactly; "Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord", and then, "Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged".<a name=252:13></a> It suggests the remnant position, separated under the Lord's direction and following righteousness.<a name=252:14></a> That leader never dies.<a name=252:15></a> It is an important thing to remember that God's principle is to work by leadership, and He is never without leaders, and certainly righteousness never dies, and that is the leader: "Ye that follow righteousness".<a name=252:16></a> Righteousness has been in the world since Abel, and never leaves it,

		so that one has always a guide or leader in righteousness.<a name=253:1></a> Here it is not this school or that school as in Corinth, but the one great leader that God gives His people, holding at all times, for there is never a time in the history of this world when the idea of right does not exist, and I can follow that even if I have to die for it.<a name=253:2></a> So it is, "Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.<a name=253:3></a> Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him".<a name=253:4></a>

		Now I wish you to follow this intently, because it enters, as I might say, into the present position exactly, involving the work of the Lord, and how we may proceed in it in humility and smallness, for we could not be any smaller than Abraham when he was called.<a name=253:5></a> He was just one.<a name=253:6></a> If God could begin with one to bring in a multitude, as it says, "As the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:17">Genesis  22:17</a>.<a name=253:7></a> He may do that now; I mean, He can work on that same principle.<a name=253:8></a> So that we need not be deterred or discouraged by smallness or fewness; it is a question of accepting the circumstances.<a name=253:9></a> As Paul said, "Luke alone is with me".<a name=253:10></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:11">2 Timothy  4:11</a>.<a name=253:11></a> The company may be reduced, but the Lord stood by him; that is the principle, and if we are in a locality with one or two, is there nothing to be done?<a name=253:12></a> Abraham was only one, for the way it should read is, "I called him when he was alone", not simply 'alone', but "when he was alone".<a name=253:13></a> He was only one.<a name=253:14></a> What may not God do with one person?<a name=253:15></a>

		Now, to show how all this works out from smallness and from a remnant character I direct you to the later verses I have read in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51">Isaiah  51</a>.<a name=256:7></a> Verse 3 speaks most encouragingly of what God will do: "For the Lord shall comfort Zion; he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody".<a name=256:8></a> Is that not most exalting in the work of the Lord?<a name=256:9></a> As elsewhere it is said, "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former", <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:9">Haggai  2:9</a>.<a name=256:10></a> It is the prospect that is before us.<a name=256:11></a> We are not looking for things to ebb out or die out or wear out; we are looking on to the greatest possible things, and that is the suggestion here.<a name=256:12></a> Then it goes on, "Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation".<a name=256:13></a> Although these are days of small things, God has His own way in such circumstances of conveying to us that we are actually His people.<a name=256:14></a> Not that we assume to be anything distinctive; that it not the point here; it is what God says.<a name=256:15></a> As the Lord says, to Philadelphia <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a>,9, "I have set before thee an opened door", and "<i>I</i> have loved thee".<a name=256:16></a> That means the assembly, but He is saying it to us, that is to say, to those who, as loving Him, do not deny His name and keep the word of His patience.<a name=256:17></a> He has His own way of conveying His thoughts of us.<a name=256:18></a> We do not need to assume to be the assembly; that would be a falsehood

	<div class="paragraph">
		What remarks I may make have in view the acceptance of responsibility in regard to the things of God by the people of God.<a name=260:1></a> The non-acceptance of responsibility in regard to the things of God in connection with His people is very objectionable to Him, and fraught with loss to the testimony in regard to men, and in regard to service towards Himself.<a name=260:2></a> This non-acceptance of responsibility implies that much is neglected, and that there are many loose ends in regard of the service of God, and, consequently, opportunity to the enemy to attack and do damage, affecting the public testimony and the service of God.<a name=260:3></a> This responsibility applies to all, and anyone formally refusing it is disqualifying himself or herself for the fellowship.<a name=260:4></a> Not that such a one among us is not an object of care (as the weak brother in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14">Romans  14</a>), but he is incapable of service.<a name=260:5></a> But anyone formally rejecting responsibility disqualifies himself for reception into fellowship.<a name=260:6></a> The weak brother is to be received, for the assembly of God, normally, is quite equal to taking on a charge.<a name=260:7></a> But where responsibility is denied and not accepted, there is no material for the assembly.<a name=260:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I feel encouraged to call attention to the acceptance of responsibility, not only for oneself, but also for others.<a name=260:9></a> The apostle Paul, in the widest way, accepts responsibility for <i>all</i> the assemblies.<a name=260:10></a> No one else that I know of, except the Lord, accepts such wide responsibility.<a name=260:11></a> He comes very near the Lord.<a name=260:12></a> The high priest of old had <i>all</i> the names of the children of Israel on his heart and on both shoulders.<a name=260:13></a> The saints are so precious in the eyes of Christ that all His strength -- both shoulders -- is for them, and it is subservient to His love.<a name=260:14></a> It was in this love that He

		went into death for them, even referring to their very sins, saying, "They are more than the hairs of my head" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:12">Psalm  40:12</a>, a wonderful thing, showing how the Lord accepts our responsibility -- not that we do not take them on in the way of contrition, but that He has done so in the way of removing them from before God.<a name=261:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul in this eleventh chapter of his second epistle to the Corinthians, presenting himself as one to be followed, comes nearest to the Lord, in taking on the burden of all the assemblies, saying: "Who is weak, and I am not weak?<a name=261:2></a> Who is stumbled, and I burn not?<a name=261:3></a>" (verse 29).<a name=261:4></a> He presents himself as a model.<a name=261:5></a> Similarly, to the Thessalonians (young believers), he says, "Ye became followers of us, and of the Lord", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:6">1 Thessalonians  1:6</a>.<a name=261:6></a> Well now, you see how he takes on this wide responsibility.<a name=261:7></a> What his prayers must have taken in!<a name=261:8></a> He said that he combated in prayer for the Colossians and for "as many as have not seen my face in flesh", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:1">Colossians  2:1</a>.<a name=261:9></a> And to the Ephesians he said: "For this cause I bow my knees", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a>.<a name=261:10></a> This does not mean kneeling at a comfortable couch, which may not involve much sacrifice, but <i>intense exercise</i>.<a name=261:11></a> So with Elijah; he "put his face between his knees", <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#18:42">1 Kings  18:42</a>.<a name=261:12></a> Think of what exercise this involved!<a name=261:13></a> There is hardly a service more valuable or more fruitful than agonising in prayer -- and in our prayers we enlarge our horizon as we pray for those whom we have never seen.<a name=261:14></a> The Lord, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, said, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word" <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:20">John  17:20</a>.<a name=261:15></a> He came right down to our own times.<a name=261:16></a> He "lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father" <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:1">John  17:1</a>.<a name=261:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=307:1></a> A word about life and its relation to unity may help us; so that the thought is not to take up the chapter prophetically, but in its present bearing.<a name=307:2></a> One thing that helps in the chapter is the place that prophecy has in relation to life and unity: while the life is developing the mind of God is brought in constantly.<a name=307:3></a> The divine element therefore enters into our beings in the form of life.<a name=307:4></a> At the outset, in Adam for instance, there was nothing of this kind, no idea of the mind of God being pressed in on Adam.<a name=307:5></a> He was formed, as you might say, immediately by an act of God, but the forming here is in relation to the mind of God forced in, in the power of gift and the prophetic word.<a name=307:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=307:9></a> Well, that is true.<a name=307:10></a> The suggestion, of course, is a wide one, and the question is which death do you mean.<a name=307:11></a> The life that God purposed is a life out of death.<a name=307:12></a> Even before sin came into the world God established that principle of life out of death.<a name=307:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=307:14></a> John peculiarly treats of life.<a name=307:15></a> Does he bring in the prophetic element in relation to the word to the seven churches as accompanying that?<a name=307:16></a> You referred to the mind of God accompanying His activities in life.<a name=307:17></a> John speaks of the breathing in chapter 20, and then throughout Revelation is the mind of God involved prophetically?<a name=307:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J T.<a name=307:19></a> Well, the presence of life in Revelation corresponds very much with Ezekiel, but we should have to go to John's gospel to get the direct teaching as to life, but whether it be here or in Revelation or in John's gospel, the principle of the mind of God being forced in in the power of gift and the power of the Spirit is apparent.<a name=307:20></a> So that what is brought into life is in that

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=308:4></a> Very good; I think that helps.<a name=308:5></a> That is the seed really, but the idea of prophecy is more than the word.<a name=308:6></a> It is the mind of God brought in forcefully, and the bearing of it is the scene around us, so that the development is immune from the influence of the scene around.<a name=308:7></a> It is not simply something done by a divine act apart from the mind of God, as for instance, "<i>He</i> spoke, and it was done; <i>he</i> commanded, and it stood fast", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#33:9">Psalm  33:9</a>.<a name=308:8></a> There is no idea of the mind being in the development subjectively forced into it, nor is there in Adam's case, but in view of the conditions with which we have to do as made to live, the idea of the prophetic element must come in, so that we have a life immune from the conditions around and in relation to a coming world.<a name=308:9></a> That is, it is a life in view of another world, and pertaining to another world, but capable of going through this world immune from its influences.<a name=308:10></a> "Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:9">1 John  3:9</a>.<a name=308:11></a> I cite that as supporting the thought.<a name=308:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=309:3></a> We have to consider the person who expresses it.<a name=309:4></a> Much place is given to Ezekiel in the book.<a name=309:5></a> What a man he was, so that he is qualified to serve in this way; he would himself have been formed so as to stand against the current evil of the world around him, and it is said here, "The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of a valley; and it was full of bones.<a name=309:6></a> And he caused me to pass by them round about; and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry".<a name=309:7></a> God is operating in relation to His servant; He is bringing him into what He is doing, so that he will be capable of understanding the result.<a name=309:8></a> Being with God, he goes round about and he is able to pass a judgment: "they were very dry".<a name=309:9></a> So that he is intelligent in what is being done, and then he is questioned, "Shall these bones live?<a name=309:10></a>".<a name=309:11></a> "And he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.<a name=309:12></a> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.<a name=309:13></a> And I will put sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.<a name=309:14></a> And I prophesied as I was commanded".<a name=309:15></a> So that the mind of God is brought in in power.<a name=309:16></a> The dry bones are addressed; we have to dismiss the literal and understand that it is a figure.<a name=309:17></a> The literal, of course, is involved, but it is a figure.<a name=309:18></a> Dry bones refer to persons with ears to hear, and the mind of God is brought in upon them.<a name=309:19></a>

		P.L.<a name=322:7></a> The thought of writing is emphasised.<a name=322:8></a> It says, "Take thee one stick, and write upon it", and then, "Take another stick, and write upon it", and then later, "The sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes".<a name=322:9></a> Would that answer a little to Christ writing in new covenant ministry?<a name=322:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=322:11></a> I think so.<a name=322:12></a> When the Lord laid His right hand on John He had already told him to write in a book and send to the seven assemblies, but after He laid His right hand upon him He says, "Write", but He does not say to whom, and He divides the book into sections and gives them the headings: "What thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these".<a name=322:13></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:19">Revelation  1:19</a>.<a name=322:14></a> He would write in life.<a name=322:15></a> There is a living touch in it, and so the Lord says to the overcomer in Philadelphia, "I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name".<a name=322:16></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:12">Revelation  3:12</a>.<a name=322:17></a> Well, all that would be in accord with what we are saying, that is, what is according to God is written upon the man, the "name of my God".<a name=322:18></a> That must all work out in a moral sense in relation to what is here.<a name=322:19></a>
