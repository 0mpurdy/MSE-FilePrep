	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> We started yesterday with the thought of the testimony, and it seems to be on the minds of many that it should be taken up today.<a name=1:2></a> This epistle presents itself as particularly setting it forth.<a name=1:3></a> I shall be glad of any thought you may have on the testimony as spoken of here: "Be not thou therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God".<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D'A.<a name=1:5></a>C.<a name=1:6></a> It is remarkable it should be called a testimony here, and that the encouragement should be given to Timothy.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:8></a> I suppose the prominence given by the apostle to his own position, in this epistle, would suggest that he had specially in his mind the unfolding of the truth; it would suggest, that the practical way in which the testimony is unfolded in his ministry, was in his mind.<a name=1:9></a> That is the full church position; and the light set there in connection with his ministry.<a name=1:10></a> He couples "the testimony of our Lord", with "and of me his prisoner".<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=1:12></a>A.<a name=1:13></a> And then he also connects it with the gospel, of which he was the special exponent.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:15></a> I think that being then a prisoner indicates the reception that the testimony received in the world.<a name=1:16></a> The apostolic position is a very important consideration in connection with the testimony.<a name=1:17></a> I think Paul represented the apostolic idea, and the opening up of the testimony, which was foreshadowed in Moses' ministry.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=1:19></a> Would you say Moses presents to us the apostolic idea?<a name=1:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:1></a> Yes.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:3></a> What do you mean by the apostolic idea?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:5></a> I think that the Lord had taken up Paul, and He would adhere to Paul; He would allow no conditions arising in the world to interfere with His choice: "that by me", the apostle says, "the preaching might be fully known".<a name=2:6></a> (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:17">2 Timothy  4:17</a>) That is, it must come out by the vessel divinely chosen.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=2:8></a> You mean the apostle being a prisoner does not affect the testimony?<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:10></a> Paul's imprisonment shows the kind of reception which the testimony received.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:12></a> Would it affect the testimony for the good of the testimony?<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:14></a> No doubt; but it shows the kind of reception the testimony had received.<a name=2:15></a> But then the Lord was not going to be affected by that.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=2:17></a>A.<a name=2:18></a> That shows the necessity of the power of God to make good the testimony.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:20></a> So that the two thoughts run through the epistle.<a name=2:21></a> The apostle, the one through whom the power is manifested, can say, "the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully known".<a name=2:22></a> (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:17">2 Timothy  4:17</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:23></a> Why do you make the apostolic position so prominent?<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:25></a> Because I think that it is well to see that God has never receded from the position He took up.<a name=2:26></a> He took up a certain position in Paul's ministry, and He has never receded from that; and that position stands.<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:28></a> Do you mean that if we are to have the testimony that position must be recognised in our souls?<a name=2:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:30></a> Yes.<a name=2:31></a> You have to make up your mind to that.<a name=2:32></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:1></a> I think it is the testimony connected with the Lord viewed in the official position, which involves His power.<a name=3:2></a> You are not to be ashamed of the testimony of <i>our Lord</i>, because we can reckon upon His power as support.<a name=3:3></a>

		T.M.<a name=3:4></a>G.<a name=3:5></a> That is why it is the testimony of our Lord.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:7></a> I think so.<a name=3:8></a> I think it is a great thing to make up your mind that God has taken up a certain position in the ministry of Paul which He proposes to maintain, and for that you require the strength of the Lord.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.M.<a name=3:10></a>G.<a name=3:11></a> And the Lord alone is equal to that; and He will have that testimony carried out.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:13></a> Does the testimony involve the whole church position?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> I think that is exactly what it does.<a name=3:16></a> God has taken up a position here in the unfolding of His mind, and He is not going to recede from it.<a name=3:17></a> Now, the question is whether we are <i>prepared</i> for that; there is to be no surrender of it.<a name=3:18></a> That is the great point in the epistle, I think.<a name=3:19></a> There it is; the testimony of our Lord has been unfolded.<a name=3:20></a> It is not in this epistle a question of revelation.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D'A.<a name=3:22></a>C.<a name=3:23></a> It is not simply that <i>the Lord</i> is the testimony; the Lord is presented as the One who supports the testimony, and carries it on.<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.M.<a name=3:25></a> It speaks of the testimony of the Christ being formed among the Corinthians.<a name=3:26></a> Is there any difference in the thought there?<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:28></a> The Christ has reference, I think, to the Man whom God has chosen.<a name=3:29></a> The thought of "the Christ" depends on what Christ is as <i>Man</i>.<a name=3:30></a> It is God, as it were, making His choice.<a name=3:31></a> He has taken up that Man, and in that Man He unfolds His mind.<a name=3:32></a> It is not a question of His power, but of His choice.<a name=3:33></a> The Christ is God's choice.<a name=3:34></a> God has anointed that Man.<a name=3:35></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:5></a> I think so.<a name=4:6></a> God's Man has come into evidence; now God has found <i>everything</i> in that Man personally.<a name=4:7></a> He is so infinitely agreeable to God that He has anointed Him.<a name=4:8></a> The thought in anointing is that the anointed one is God's choice.<a name=4:9></a> "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:27">John  6:27</a>).<a name=4:10></a> The Father has taken up that Man, and everything has now to be administered by Him; so that He is the anointed Vessel.<a name=4:11></a> I think it is in that way we have the "testimony of the Christ".<a name=4:12></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:6">1 Corinthians  1:6</a>)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=4:22></a>A.<a name=4:23></a> If I understand aright what you said about the testimony of the Christ, it has more reference to what He is as the anointed Man; but when it comes to the Lord it is more a question of power in carrying out all things.<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:25></a> I think that is it.<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:27></a> One can see the great necessity of it in Timothy; there had been a turning away, and power was needed to support the truth.<a name=4:28></a> In Corinthians it was really the testimony that the apostle presented to them to deliver them from man.<a name=4:29></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:11></a> I think it is quite right to have a judgment as to what is going on in the world, because the elements that are active are simply what God is holding in abeyance.<a name=7:12></a> The world is still the sphere of God's government.<a name=7:13></a> It is extremely interesting to see how God comes in from time to time to modify things for the sake of the assembly.<a name=7:14></a> One has often observed how the spirit of lawlessness has been restrained for the sake of the assembly; and our prayers should be in that connection.<a name=7:15></a> Whilst you have a judgment of things, and you see the development of the antichristian system, and that all is about to be manifested, yet you are thinking; of Christ, and you are living in a world that is centred in God's Anointed.<a name=7:16></a> It is very interesting to see in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>how the early saints recognised what God did.<a name=7:17></a> In the presence of the combined hostility against the Lord and against His Anointed they prayed to God;

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=27:10></a> The Spirit's comment on the passage in the New Testament helps us greatly; "By faith, Moses when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.<a name=27:11></a> By faith, Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season".<a name=27:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:23">Hebrews  11:23</a> - 25) That is, his decision when he came to years of understanding was in keeping with the faith of his parents.<a name=27:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=56:13></a> I was thinking only today, that if you take the most exalted personage in the land, there is one thing in which he is on a common platform with everybody, the lowest as well as the highest, and that one thing is life.<a name=56:14></a> In order that this should be sustained he has to eat, sleep, etc.<a name=56:15></a> But then, whilst he is compelled to do certain things in common with everybody else, his exalted rank, and all that goes with it, necessarily give character to every detail that he has in common with all others.<a name=56:16></a> Well now that is how I understand the manner in which we have what is common to every family that comes into the blessing of God.<a name=56:17></a> Whether in the present age or coming age, <i>all</i> have eternal life.<a name=56:18></a> This is undeniable.<a name=56:19></a> But <i>we</i> have something more excellent than they; we have a heavenly place in Christ, which is peculiar to ourselves, and that is what we boast in specially, and therefore this gives character in us to what we may have in common with all others.<a name=56:20></a> The dignity of the position, and the relationship that goes with the position, tend to give colour to what we enjoy in common with all other families.<a name=56:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=57:3></a> Quite so.<a name=57:4></a> You remember that when the Israelites passed over Jordan, twelve stones were taken out of Jordan and placed in Gilgal.<a name=57:5></a> Those twelve stones represented the twelve tribes, but in the subsequent development of things, the tribe of Levi was taken apart from the other twelve and given an inheritance.<a name=57:6></a> They had the Lord God of Israel, they were to dwell in cities, and they had the priesthood and the offerings as their inheritance.<a name=57:7></a> Typically they had a heavenly position in contrast to the others.<a name=57:8></a> But they were on common ground.<a name=57:9></a> There was something they had in common with all the other tribes at Gilgal; they were represented in the twelve stones.<a name=57:10></a> Now, I think that indicates our portion; that whilst abstractly you must place eternal life by itself, and think of it by itself, yet when you come to the entrance into it, it is enjoyed along with the relationships that are special to us, and these relationships, being greater, must give character to the lesser.<a name=57:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to show the connection between the ark and the high priest.<a name=84:1></a> I wish to dwell upon each separately, and in pointing out the contrast between them, to show also the connection that exists between them.<a name=84:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ark, as most of us here know, has reference to Christ, and the high priest in Israel represented Christ.<a name=84:3></a> It is in that way that they become of such interest; indeed, it is thus that the Old Testament becomes of such interest to those who love Christ, I doubt whether any one reads the Scriptures with heart interest until he loves Christ; you may dwell upon the type, but your heart is engaged with the antitype, and I desire, beloved friends, that that may mark our meeting now; that whilst I seek to engage you for the moment with the types, your hearts, by the Spirit, may be engaged with the antitype; that is, with Christ.<a name=84:4></a> No type can exceed in interest the ark of the testimony, and in one point it is very like that of the high priest, for it represents Christ with something in His heart; the law of God; whereas that which the priest had in his heart was the saints.<a name=84:5></a> I wish you to bear this in mind for we have to take account of the Lord here in this world in connection with the will of God, and then we have to take account of Him in connection with the saints.<a name=84:6></a> The high priest had the saints in his heart; I refer to the breastplate as you will understand.<a name=84:7></a> That was one great feature of the high priest, that he represented Christ as having the saints' in His affections.<a name=84:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when you come to the ark, you are struck immediately with the fact that there is nothing said about colour at all.<a name=85:4></a> The point in the ark is, that it was made of shittim wood and it was overlaid with gold, and it was to contain the tables of the covenant.<a name=85:5></a> Now that is what I want to dwell upon.<a name=85:6></a> By the Lord's help, I desire to show you, that the Lord has to be taken account of here in this world as appearing amongst men, and as the One capable of taking up the revealed will of God and carrying it into effect.<a name=85:7></a> I desire, that our hearts might ponder that.<a name=85:8></a> The great thing in view was that the divine glory might be sustained here, but evidently the shittim wood has to be taken account of.<a name=85:9></a> Primarily the great thing that God had in view was to have a Man here through whom He might carry out all His will.<a name=85:10></a> Adam had failed in that, but God would wait, and He did wait.<a name=85:11></a> He waited for that which the shittim wood represented.<a name=85:12></a> One loves to think of God waiting for that.<a name=85:13></a> I desire to enlist your sympathy in that respect as to God; He had His mind set upon man, but God could wait.<a name=85:14></a> One great attribute in God, one might say, is that He can wait.<a name=85:15></a> God will wait; He will wait for the suitable material for the

		As we look at Christ, it is important that we dwell upon what He was personally.<a name=87:5></a> I believe it is of the Spirit that the deity of the Lord should be put into evidence in every bit of ministry.<a name=87:6></a> The cherubim of glory over the mercy seat suggests to our hearts that there must be a guarding of that Person.<a name=87:7></a> He is what He was and what He ever will be as to His Person, but let us think of the wood; think of that Man here in this world where all was opposed, where there was such absence of sympathy, even from those akin to Him in the flesh.<a name=87:8></a> Mary says "thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing"; (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:48">Luke  2:48</a>) they had no idea who was there; but the Lord says, "wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business".<a name=87:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:49">Luke  2:49</a>) As Man here, He was personally equal to that which He was to sustain in testimony; He was to be covered with the gold.<a name=87:10></a> God was to set there the full weight of the divine glory, and that was to be displayed in that Man.<a name=87:11></a> What food there is for our souls in Christ viewed in that light here in this world; moving about in a scene that was contrary to Him, every movement of His heart had reference to God.<a name=87:12></a>

		I call attention to this scripture, beloved friends, desiring to give you my thoughts upon it, especially because it shows how the Christian economy shook itself clear of what one may call the legal trammels that held it within abnormal or restricted bounds at the outset.<a name=105:1></a> It is important to see that in the ordinary course of the development of the testimony there was a gradual cutting loose from earthly moorings, until it is seen enshrined in that which is living and abiding.<a name=105:2></a> The apostle, in writing to the Hebrews, refers to something similar in speaking of the purification of their consciences, that they might serve the living God; and the service of the living God necessarily implies a living order of things.<a name=105:3></a> Until it found itself, as it were, enshrined in that order, of things, there was movement.<a name=105:4></a> Movement always implies that the testimony had not found a resting place, so that there was gradual movement until the service of God, the living God, could find itself in connection with others who were sympathetic with it; and, as you can see, the assembly at Antioch was in sympathy with it.<a name=105:5></a> There the ministry of the Lord went on, as it says, they <i>ministered to the Lord</i>.<a name=105:6></a>

		Now, beloved brethren, it is my thought and desire to dwell upon that.<a name=105:7></a> I wish to impress upon each one in a simple way, that that is what each of us is called to.<a name=105:8></a> The great thought that God has in leaving us here, instead of taking us to heaven, is that there might be a continuance of His service.<a name=105:9></a> It is a wonderful thing for God to establish that in which His service is protected, while the world power remains untouched.<a name=105:10></a> Now I say, that that is the great end God has in view in calling us out of the world,

		You will recall how, in addressing Pharaoh, the Lord habitually, in each message, reminds him that the object He had in view in delivering His people was, that they might serve Him.<a name=106:2></a> In fact, going back earlier in their history, you will remember that Moses received his commission at mount Horeb, and the Lord told him that the token of their deliverance should be that His people should serve Him there.<a name=106:3></a> They should serve Him at mount Horeb.<a name=106:4></a> Now mount Horeb is not in Canaan, as you know; mount Horeb is in the wilderness.<a name=106:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=137:3></a> No; I was speaking about him as head as distinct from his kingly position.<a name=137:4></a> As king, he is there on behalf of God to enforce the divine will, but the idea of a head is that he acts from wisdom in himself, which, of course, is divinely given; only when you come to Christ, the Antitype, He <i>is</i> wisdom, so that when He speaks it is wisdom speaking.<a name=137:5></a>

		Elijah, however, did not anoint Hazael nor Jehu, but he did anoint Elisha, who was with the twelfth yoke of oxen when Elijah found him, and anointed him.<a name=155:17></a> Therefore Elisha's ministry comes in before that of Jehu or Hazael.<a name=155:18></a> In other words, God suspends judgment in order to make room for the reign of grace and I think that illustrates the present time.<a name=155:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=258:2></a> Yes.<a name=258:3></a> The appearing or coming of our Lord Jesus Christ raises the question as to the conditions here; that is, it is a question of God's governmental interference.<a name=258:4></a> Peter, for instance, takes up the question of the thread of God's government and traces it from the angelic period, as we may call it, right on to the end of time, and he shows that, wherever evil raises its head, and however long God may have borne with it, in time God dealt with it.<a name=258:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=258:9></a> Both; but the second is more especially in reference to the result in the end; in time the judgment of God finds out the sinner.<a name=258:10></a> It is inexorable.<a name=258:11></a> It is sure to reach the sinner, and so the present order of things will, when the man of sin appears, be shown to be utterly lawless and opposed to God.<a name=258:12></a> Then the Lord will appear.<a name=258:13></a> The coming of the Lord is in that way dependent on certain conditions in the world.<a name=258:14></a> For instance, God said to Abraham that the iniquity of the Amorite was not yet full; and so in Daniel, transgression had not yet come to the full; when it should come to the full, the opposer and oppressor of the people would appear, and then the Lord will stand up against him.<a name=258:15></a> That is to say, God acts in judgment when there is some overt act of evil against Him, and not till then.<a name=258:16></a> Now that was true in the case of Jerusalem.<a name=258:17></a> God bore in grace with the crucifixion of Christ but when the Spirit was despised and refused, then Jerusalem is overthrown; and so it will be when Christianity is openly set aside, God will intervene in judgment.<a name=258:18></a> Therefore the point that the apostle emphasises in his second letter to the Thessalonians is, that that day will not be till the apostasy, till the man of sin, appears, the wicked one, who sets

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now David is in rejection, and Abigail is presented to us.<a name=480:3></a> She is the wife of a man called Nabal.<a name=480:4></a> He was churlish, and the Spirit records other that she was "of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance".<a name=480:5></a> (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25:3">1 Samuel  25:3</a>) The chapter is most interesting, and it ends with "David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife".<a name=480:6></a> (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25:39">1 Samuel  25:39</a>) He has thus secured a companion in his royalty, equal, not as a matter of lineage, but as a matter of intelligence and beauty.<a name=480:7></a> She has a good understanding.<a name=480:8></a> That is one of the greatest things.<a name=480:9></a> What is said in the prophet is that God's people were destroyed for lack of knowledge.<a name=480:10></a> They were not acquainted with things.<a name=480:11></a> Think of all that is opened up to us now that Christ is in heaven; all that is opened up to us in the ministry of Paul!<a name=480:12></a> Paul as in the light of it and the blessedness of it, bows his knees in prayer.<a name=480:13></a> What does he pray about?<a name=480:14></a> First of all, that the saints might have "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him"; (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:17">Ephesians  1:17</a>) that is, of God.<a name=480:15></a> God wishes us to be intelligent.<a name=480:16></a> If we take up the truth of God and pray over it, the Lord will give us understanding.<a name=480:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will see in what I have been saying, that the divine thought is that the Man is not to be alone in any position, and therefore I connect all I have had to say with those verses in 1 Corinthians, "For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.<a name=481:6></a> Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.<a name=481:7></a> For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head, because of the angels.<a name=481:8></a> Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.<a name=481:9></a> For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God".<a name=481:10></a> So you see that in the mind of the Spirit, it is the man and the woman; and in the end, Christ and the assembly.<a name=481:11></a> The assembly appears as His companion, whose right it is to rule.<a name=481:12></a>
