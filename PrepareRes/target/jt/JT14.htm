		NOTES OF READINGS ON 2 SAMUEL
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> There is a spiritual movement in mind here, David giving the main lead in it.<a name=1:2></a> Other elements that may be operative are allowed to show themselves.<a name=1:3></a> These elements are led, on the one hand by Abner and on the other by Joab, each leader having himself in mind.<a name=1:4></a> It would seem as if from verse 8 of chapter 2 to the end of chapter 4 we have the working out of these adverse elements during a spiritual movement.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:6></a> Why is a character like Abner short-lived in contrast to Joab who continued through such a long period with the king?<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:8></a> I suppose one of the reasons for his continuance is to bring out the weakness in David.<a name=1:9></a> David acknowledges his weakness here, "I am this day weak".<a name=1:10></a> It is a poor thing to have to acknowledge that the position is beyond him, and this is in a condition where David is nominally supreme.<a name=1:11></a> Things are allowed to develop, even in chapter 5.<a name=1:12></a> If you link on the narrative with <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#11:6">1 Chronicles  11:6</a>, he opens a further door to Joab to become chief of captains, which was David's own office.<a name=1:13></a> A spiritual man in any given spiritual movement may yield to partisan influence and in that way open the door to a condition that is beyond him.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:15></a> Did Joab's actions warrant his removal here?<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:17></a> He was a murderer.<a name=1:18></a> It was wrong that a murderer should be allowed to continue.<a name=1:19></a> The assembly should never be in such a plight as this; the Lord has furnished us with means of dealing with the most serious matters.<a name=1:20></a> This whole book is stamped with this; it runs right through, and is a warning to us not to allow <i>partisan</i> feeling even in a small way.<a name=1:21></a>

		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:1></a> Was David's attitude towards Abner commendable?<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:3></a> It was so far.<a name=2:4></a> David had to clear himself of course.<a name=2:5></a> It would look as if there might have been collusion in this matter, but the Lord enabled him to clear himself, which is the main thing.<a name=2:6></a> "Neither be partaker of other men's sins", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:22">1 Timothy  5:22</a>.<a name=2:7></a> The Lord gave him special grace to clear himself; it was understood that David had nothing to do with it.<a name=2:8></a> "All Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death".<a name=2:9></a> Spiritual men are often obliged to clear themselves of partisan results; partisan results are attributed to spiritual men who have had nothing to do with them, because they are spiritually linked with those in the party.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=2:11></a> David became continually stronger in the main.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:13></a> He dealt with them in <i>principle</i> but was not able to do so in <i>fact</i>.<a name=2:14></a> Rem.<a name=2:15></a> There was in Acts what is similar to what we get here, the opposition of the Jews and the Gentiles to the ministry of the apostles.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:17></a> Quite so.<a name=2:18></a> I suppose that is how we should look at the first verse: "the war was long between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker".<a name=2:19></a> The war was long because of these partisan conditions.<a name=2:20></a> David became continually stronger -- it does not say, 'the house of David'.<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:22></a> Why is 'the house' left out here?<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:24></a> Well, it says later, his house was not right with God.<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:26></a> How do you regard David's reception of Abner?<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:28></a> He seems to be right so far.<a name=2:29></a> It was according to the mind of God that the kingdom should come to David.<a name=2:30></a> It says in verse 7 of chapter 2, "And now let

	<div class="paragraph">
		your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#2:7">2 Samuel  2:7</a>.<a name=3:1></a> This is clearly a gesture to the house of Israel to accept David as king; so that if Abner came, as he did, as a leader of the house of Israel it seems to be in order for David to receive him.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:3></a> What Abner did not accomplish, God was accomplishing behind the scenes.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:5></a> Obstacles stood in the way.<a name=3:6></a> Really it was Abner who was in the way.<a name=3:7></a> He could sway the house of Israel either way because he could always make the position weak.<a name=3:8></a> Ishbosheth himself was removed so that the way was made clear for David, although it was not at all to the credit of these two.<a name=3:9></a> Abner had just a selfish party feeling; he knew all the time that David was to be king; he is condemning himself in what he says to Ishbosheth in verse 9 of chapter 3, "Jehovah has sworn to David"; and to the elders in verse 18, "and now do it, for Jehovah has spoken of David .<a name=3:10></a>.<a name=3:11></a>.<a name=3:12></a>".<a name=3:13></a> So that he knew exactly the mind of God and he is fighting against it, he is condemning himself.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:15></a> Do you think his slaying was governmental?<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:17></a> I do.<a name=3:18></a> It is a warning to us.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:20></a> In each one of these men slain, the sword penetrates their lower affections.<a name=3:21></a> Was it the exposure of lack of love in the Spirit, a feature seen positively in the saints at Colosse (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:8">Colossians  1:8</a>)?<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:23></a> Judas' death is similar, he fell headlong and all his bowels gushed out.<a name=3:24></a> He was wanting in affection.<a name=3:25></a> These are remarkable chapters, I think, for the work of God to be seen in spiritual leadership.<a name=3:26></a> They show how partisan activities may work within the realm of spiritual leadership.<a name=3:27></a> David has to acknowledge he was not strong enough.<a name=3:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:29></a> Was the same thing going on at Corinth?<a name=3:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:31></a> Exactly, there were several parties there.<a name=3:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:1></a> There seems to be a turn in the testimony today and a remarkable spiritual movement: are we in danger of partisanship and rivalry as seen in Abner and Joab?<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:3></a> That is what the enemy would seek to bring about.<a name=4:4></a> The thing is that there should be <i>no leadership that is not spiritual</i>.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:6></a> Do these wives of David and the mother of these sons indicate weakness?<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> The king would multiply wives.<a name=4:9></a> In chapter 5 he continues on that line after he reaches Jerusalem.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:11></a> You see it in the stipulation he made with Abner about Saul's daughter, Michal.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> It indicates where his <i>mind</i> was, I think; see verse 14.<a name=4:14></a> Of course you might work out a type in it, an allusion to the assembly, but it is difficult to make it out.<a name=4:15></a> He was making self-gratification more than the kingdom, whereas the kingdom was the great thing with God.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:17></a> All the children born in Hebron were sons.<a name=4:18></a> Would this be for the testimony?<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:20></a> That would fit.<a name=4:21></a> I think you might say that.<a name=4:22></a> We get their mothers in verses 2 to 5.<a name=4:23></a> At Jerusalem you get further sons and daughters without their mothers' names (chapter 5:13 - 16).<a name=4:24></a> The continuance of the testimony is in mind, but on the other hand it is an allusion to a certain <i>vein of weakness in David</i>, because the king was enjoined not to multiply wives.<a name=4:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:26></a> What about David taking Ahinoam and Abigail to Hebron?<a name=4:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:28></a> This seemed to be legitimate and right.<a name=4:29></a> Certainly Abigail is a type of the assembly.<a name=4:30></a> You can understand that the maternal side must be in line in the kingdom, so that it seems to be in order.<a name=4:31></a> He had lost them at Ziklag and now he has them again.<a name=4:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:33></a> Some sons did not turn out very well.<a name=4:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:35></a> One is a type of the antichrist; chapter 3:3.<a name=4:36></a> But there is the continuance of the testimony, and

		the Psalms show what the children are and how they speak with the enemy in the gate.<a name=5:1></a> Generally speaking they are a blessing from God, but it is "thy wife", and not 'thy wives' in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#128">Psalm  128</a>.<a name=5:2></a> Deuteronomy expressly forbids the king to multiply wives.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:4></a> At this time if Abner and Joab were giving a wrong lead David should have given a right one.<a name=5:5></a> They were adverse parties.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:7></a> Saul was dead and David spoke well of him.<a name=5:8></a> He was anointed by the house of Judah, but then these two leaders are operating by themselves.<a name=5:9></a> In chapter 2 verse 14 they suggest that the young men should make sport before them.<a name=5:10></a> Where is David's power as king in all this?<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:12></a> There is an attempt by Ishbosheth to check what was evil; it is he who brings out what Abner is doing.<a name=5:13></a> Then Abner moves to transfer the kingdom to David.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:15></a> It looks as if one element after another brought about this change in Abner's mind with no reference to David.<a name=5:16></a> Yet David is not in this evil.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is outside it in spirit, but he has to acknowledge that he is weak in the thing.<a name=5:18></a> It is a remarkable warning to us that spiritual leadership is the only leadership.<a name=5:19></a> These two men were not thinking of the king, they were just two independent leaders.<a name=5:20></a> You can see how Joab would carry Israel with him on this line; this laid the basis for Absalom's revolt later.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The saving feature is that God gave David such attractiveness that all Israel loved him.<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:23></a> Did not David enunciate the principle of his kingdom in the first chapter in the song that he taught Judah?<a name=5:24></a> Does not the setting seem to be encouraging?<a name=5:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:26></a> Yes, certainly the first chapter is magnificent as to the spirit of David, and right up to the end of verse 7 of the second chapter; and then we have these two men operating and making sport and

	<div class="paragraph">
		sacrificing their followers for sport.<a name=6:1></a> Where is David in this?<a name=6:2></a> It is significant that David is not mentioned in chapter 3 after verse 7.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:4></a> What is your thought as to the length of time that is required for David to be brought into the kingdom?<a name=6:5></a> It is not till David has reigned seven and a half years in Hebron that all Israel is brought round to him.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:7></a> I think the position at Hebron is intended for that, a stopping point, as much as to say the spiritual condition does not warrant any more.<a name=6:8></a> David is held up there, it is a testing time.<a name=6:9></a> I think there is some correspondence between that position and what we get in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>.<a name=6:10></a> Great thoughts of God are opening up there; God says, so to speak, I want you to come up here, Moses, and Aaron and Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel.<a name=6:11></a> And then, Moses, you come up into the mountain and I will give you the book of the law, "for <i>their</i> instruction".<a name=6:12></a> All that would be with Moses above, the others were to stay below without Moses, they were to have Aaron and Hur if any matter arose and they would have to wait for Moses to come down forty days later.<a name=6:13></a> Well now, here we have an example set out in David in verse 1, of the kind of man suitable for the kingdom, an example to all Israel.<a name=6:14></a> He became stronger and stronger personally, and then we have Hebron.<a name=6:15></a> In view of all this these two men are brought to the front instead of David.<a name=6:16></a> So with Aaron and Hur, they are to look after the people while Moses is away.<a name=6:17></a> But the instruction is with Moses; the divine mind is with Moses.<a name=6:18></a> Why should David be hindered?<a name=6:19></a> Well, there is a <i>moral</i> condition in question and that moral condition is to be worked out before we can have the mind of God.<a name=6:20></a>

		Lord could have gone to heaven at once after He arose just as well as forty days later.<a name=7:1></a> It implies that there is a condition that is questionable, that is to he searched out.<a name=7:2></a> So in Colosse they were in danger of philosophy and vain deceit; that is to he worked out and judged.<a name=7:3></a> All these things are on one line.<a name=7:4></a> You have the mind of God opened up, but there is a moral condition of things to he dealt with before we can go on.<a name=7:5></a> These elements are at work in Israel here.<a name=7:6></a> David is not clear in this matter and these two men are active.<a name=7:7></a> In the government of God they come to their end.<a name=7:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:12></a> The point is, What is leadership?<a name=7:13></a> Is it Joab or Abner, or is it David?<a name=7:14></a> David is weak and the book brings out that he never really recovered the loss sustained here.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:18></a> You just feel that God's government took him out of the way.<a name=7:19></a> David's attitude seems right under the circumstances.<a name=7:20></a> Abner knew that David was the man all along and yet he was insubject, and so he was disqualified.<a name=7:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=114:1></a> We seem to have had the mind of the Spirit in considering chapters 9 and 10 as the kingdom of God marked by grace; grace toward Mephibosheth in chapter 9, and toward the king of Ammon, although he despised it, in chapter 10.<a name=114:2></a> Chapter 11 brings out the decline, for "at the time when kings go forth .<a name=114:3></a>.<a name=114:4></a>.<a name=114:5></a> David abode at Jerusalem", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#11:1">2 Samuel  11:1</a>.<a name=114:6></a> Then comes the great sin of David and the conviction of it, pointing to the history of Christendom since the breakdown.<a name=114:7></a> On the side of good we have in David a worshipper of God, and in Solomon a type of Christ viewed as Son coming into prominence, beloved of God; and on the side of evil we have Amnon and Absalom, the two evil features arising governmentally because of the failure of David.<a name=114:8></a> Chapter 14 begins with this state of affairs, the good and the bad moving together, as in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>the wheat and the tares grow together.<a name=114:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 14 brings out, in Joab, an element that has its correspondence today, a combination of evil seeking to conceal itself in an outline of right procedure and words but still culminating in Absalom being re-established in favour, although he was a murderer; so that the combination of evil is very strong as this chapter shows.<a name=114:10></a> David represents the responsible element in the system, the professing body; this chapter brings out the elements combined in Joab which have place today.<a name=114:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=115:7></a> I think these are the facts that govern the history of the assembly from the time of the breakdown.<a name=115:8></a> There has been a right element; the responsible element called the orthodox party has been with us from the earliest days, from the third century.<a name=115:9></a> In the main they were holding the truth but they inclined to the wrong man, he that is shown to be wrong, a murderer, although he ingratiated himself with the public leaders; he was historically a murderer and here is shown to be just a diplomat, a politician, currying favour with those in charge.<a name=115:10></a> Those in responsibility publicly are in the main right as to their principles, but secretly they have the wrong man.<a name=115:11></a> Joab had no love at all for Absalom, but David had, and Joab worked on David's misplaced affection because David's heart was toward Absalom.<a name=115:12></a> It was <i>toward</i> him, not toward judging him, for justice was not in exercise as seeking to get him back to deal with judicially; that was not his thought at all.<a name=115:13></a> David longed to go forth to Absalom, Joab worked on that; Joab is a combination of evil, well covered, but still there.<a name=115:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=116:4></a> I think the past history of the assembly affords us the anti-type of all this.<a name=116:5></a> The leaders who ruled in the Councils and did their best to encase the truth in the creeds were not governed by the Spirit of God in what they were doing, but still they were seeking to maintain the truth of Christianity in their way.<a name=116:6></a> But they afforded an opportunity for these elements to work.<a name=116:7></a> These elements are combined, for Joab is a combination: a murderer, a clever man, a military man, orthodox generally, but a known murderer.<a name=116:8></a> Now he is glossing that over and ingratiating himself with the king at the expense of the rights of Christ, the rights of the whole position; a murderer is to be brought back and reinstated in affection as heir, because the wise woman's speech would imply that everything would hinge on this man, Absalom; everything hinged in her own mind on this son who murdered the other son; "they will quench my coal that is left", she says.<a name=116:9></a> It is an allusion to Absalom as if everything is to depend on him.<a name=116:10></a> It was a clever move but all tending to one thing, that is antichrist; not to the antichrist personally, but to the characteristics of antichrist.<a name=116:11></a>

		What has come before us already will help, I think, to make clear what is in these scriptures; that is, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33">Exodus  33</a>presents a young man remaining within the tabernacle -- as it says, "his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from within the tent".<a name=302:1></a> It has been said that the evil of mixtures is met by adherence to the assembly.<a name=302:2></a> The assembly is the residence of holy thoughts, thoughts exclusive of what is unholy.<a name=302:3></a> The tabernacle represented the house -- the residence of what is of God, indeed God Himself, inclusive of the holiest, where God speaks conveying His mind.<a name=302:4></a> And it is for us to find our home there; as one desired, "that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire of him in his temple", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27:4">Psalm  27:4</a>.<a name=302:5></a> It is our privilege to have recourse to the house; not occasionally, but in principle to be there always, as Joshua was.<a name=302:6></a> So that we come under these thoughts of God; full thoughts, as I said, concrete in themselves and intrinsically exclusive of admixture.<a name=302:7></a> Our minds are thus kept pure.<a name=302:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the epistle to the Hebrews opens up to us what these books in the Pentateuch set out, and particularly the house: "whose house we are"; (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:6">Hebrews  3:6</a>) bringing it down in a very concrete way to the saints at any time -- if we continue -- not if we are casually hanging on, as it were, putting in appearances occasionally or at set times, but as of the thing, as <i>being</i> the thing; as Peter writes, "first from us", that is, the house of God -- the judgment begins from the house of God; (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:17">1 Peter  4:17</a>).<a name=303:3></a> Peter confirms what the writer of this epistle sets out, that the Hebrew Christians were themselves what the types had indicated; namely, the tabernacle -- the greater and more perfect tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man.<a name=303:4></a> The epistle to the Hebrews makes it very concrete in its application and, dear brethren, while one would not be critical, we are enjoined to "convict, rebuke, encourage, with all longsuffering and doctrine", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:2">2 Timothy  4:2</a>, that what we profess might not fall flat as we are together.<a name=303:5></a> It is the great thought in Christianity, in the concrete sense, that the saints are marked as together.<a name=303:6></a> The dispensation began with the thought that all that believed <i>were together</i>.<a name=303:7></a> It began with them all together in one place (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:1">Acts  2:1</a>), the Holy Spirit honouring the position; and those that were there, I may remark in passing, are called earlier "the crowd", chapter 1:15.<a name=303:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We began this meeting with the hymn, "Where the saints in glory thronging".<a name=303:9></a> The word 'thronging' gives a beautiful thought, because it contemplates the distinguishment of each person in the throng and the liberty that belongs to us as in heaven.<a name=303:10></a> There is no need for special, as one might say, religious

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The crowd and a throng are much alike, and it occurred to me that it was a beautiful suggestion of what there is for us in the way of enjoyment even as coming together, instead of tardily strolling in -- a most humbling thing!<a name=304:2></a> Where is the sense of liberty and joy and holiness in each other's company?<a name=304:3></a> "In glory thronging" -- that we are really the occasion of joy to each other; the meeting together is there, to be enjoyed now.<a name=304:4></a> It is the circle in which the Holy Spirit promotes the elements of eternal life.<a name=304:5></a> That is what is intended.<a name=304:6></a> How can we do without it -- deny ourselves of it, is beyond my understanding; that is, if we are spiritual, and hence this word, "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together".<a name=304:7></a> Why should a little rain, or a little frost, or a little something in the house, or the like, detain us from what the Spirit of God lays such stress upon?<a name=304:8></a> The word is, "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom is with some".<a name=304:9></a> How humbling to belong to this class -- those who forsake the assembling of themselves together.<a name=304:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the Psalm we get experiences, for in principle the Psalms are a counterpart of the Pentateuch.<a name=304:11></a> There are five books in the Pentateuch, and five in the Psalms; and the Psalmist here says, David himself (no surer witness or testimony in these matters than David), that he would not give sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids till he found a place for the Lord, a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.<a name=304:12></a> But the God of Jacob was not to be there alone; He was to be in the house with His people.<a name=304:13></a> And so David says, "One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as I said, Joshua did not depart from the tent; that is a characteristic thought for a young man.<a name=305:17></a> And so, "I rejoiced", the Psalmist says; and, let <i>us</i> be glad!<a name=305:18></a> Even in that we will be glad; before we leave our houses, and on the way, and when we sit down together, there is the holy sense of the Spirit pervading.<a name=305:19></a> It is the scene of eternal life, and we cannot afford to be without it.<a name=305:20></a> If we sow to the Spirit, we are told, we shall reap from the Spirit life everlasting, and that is peculiarly true in the assembly.<a name=305:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=403:1></a> It occurred to me, in connection with this reading, that it would be well for us to see that the idea of the family of God is presented in an objective way in Scripture, and particularly in this gospel; so that the message sent through Mary had in view what had been earlier presented to the disciples objectively.<a name=403:2></a> I was thinking of the passage in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>already dwelt upon; that the young men who accompanied Abraham and Isaac to the land of Moriah would have seen "<i>an only begotten with a father"</i>.<a name=403:3></a> Particularly after Isaac was offered up, and they went together to Beersheba.<a name=403:4></a> Then in Jacob's family the ten had the opportunity of seeing Joseph as loved of the father; and in Joseph, not only the true thought of the brother is seen, but he showed what a son should be to a father as well, in his relations and actions toward Jacob.<a name=403:5></a> They would see in him the divine idea of a brother and of a son with a father.<a name=403:6></a> It is in this gospel we have so often brought before us the relations of the Son with the Father.<a name=403:7></a> At the outset it is said, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>.<a name=403:8></a> They contemplated that, and throughout the gospel the Lord refers to His relations with the Father; particularly in His prayer, recorded in chapter 17.<a name=403:9></a> The disciples would have, as privileged to listen, an insight into what He was with the Father, and would see what a place they had in their relations with the Father and the Son; so that this message through Mary would bring them into the good of it.<a name=403:10></a> In chapter 1 we have the expression, "to them gave he the right to be children of God".<a name=403:11></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:12">John  1:12</a>) This message would accord to them the liberty, that doubtless they would now desire, to

		But, beloved friends, while the salvation of God is assured to the true believer, it is a <i>continuous</i> thing -- to be realised every day.<a name=441:4></a> The gospel of our salvation that is announced, is a gospel that takes account of us every moment of our lives in this world, until we are safely housed in heaven when the Lord Jesus Christ comes for us and takes us to be with Himself.<a name=441:5></a> The gospel of our salvation applies to every moment of our existence down here, and, therefore, we need assurance in it.<a name=441:6></a>

		If there are those here who have <i>not</i> returned, there is a word for them.<a name=441:7></a> The inquiry is "Watchman, what of the night?<a name=441:8></a> The watchman said.<a name=441:9></a> The morning cometh and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: <i>return</i>, come".<a name=441:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#21:11">Isaiah  21:11</a>,12) That is the point in the book in the light in which I am looking at it.<a name=441:11></a> If there is any enquiry in your heart tonight, the answer of the Spirit of God to you is, "Return, come".<a name=441:12></a>

		Possibly he lived in affluent circumstances -- the enemy would get into those circumstances, such circumstances are very vulnerable, and Luke knew it; the Spirit of God knew it, and He would fortify Theophilus, as in them, against the inroads of the devil.<a name=442:1></a> The enemy would come and say to him, "Theophilus, are you quite sure that the Lord Jesus is a divine Person?<a name=442:2></a> Are you quite sure that He is not an imposter or a myth?<a name=442:3></a> Did you ever see Him?<a name=442:4></a> Maybe you have believed falsehoods".<a name=442:5></a> How comforting Luke's letter would be to him.<a name=442:6></a> Every believer should read Luke with that in view, so that he may be constantly in the enjoyment of the things the gospel proposes, in the good and enjoyment of his salvation.<a name=442:7></a> There can be no doubt that Theophilus gained by it, for the second treatise indicates plainly enough that he was getting on, it shows that he had gained by the first: Luke does not call him "excellent" the second time, he is <i>nearer</i> to him; the servant of the Lord is nearer to him in his spirit and can address him more simply.<a name=442:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But then it is not only circumstances of affluence that expose us to the inroads of the devil, the most ordinary circumstances can do this as we see here in Rabshakeh's speeches.<a name=442:9></a> First he addresses Hezekiah -- there is a message to Hezekiah the king, he would shake <i>his</i> confidence: but then he says, "I am not here only to speak to Hezekiah, I am here to speak to 'the men that sit upon the wall'", the commonality of the people, and he uses their language, their very vernacular; for it is nothing to the devil whether he uses slang or the most refined language -- he can use both: his aim is to get at your soul and shake your confidence in God, and deprive you of the joy of your salvation, and consequently render you valueless in the testimony of God here.<a name=442:10></a>

		You believed a few weeks ago, or a few months ago, or a few years ago; you have been unconquerable through the testimony of the gospel held in your soul by faith, and you shake your head at the enemy, you laugh him to scorn; that is the great result of these chapters: a daughter of Zion is just one who is in the sense of the sovereign mercy of God.<a name=444:4></a> Scripture says, "According to his own mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:5">Titus  3:5</a>.<a name=444:5></a> The enemy says, "Look what you did yesterday; look what you thought"; but you reply, "I am no worse now than I was before God took me up".<a name=444:6></a> I am not putting a premium on the least little bit of sin in any Christian, but suppose it happens, and it does happen, we are told "we all often offend" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#3:2">James  3:2</a>), and Satan charges you with the happening, you overcome him by the testimony of the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=444:7></a> He will magnify the happening, he will make the happening greater than the death of Christ, greater than God.<a name=444:8></a> But we read "If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:20">1 John  3:20</a>.<a name=444:9></a> And so, if you are a daughter of Zion, you can say, "God is as great now as He was before I was converted; He is as gracious now as He was before I was converted; He is the same to me now, I acknowledge my sin".<a name=444:10></a> You say to the devil, "I own what you allege, but I am not going to allow you to make it any more than it is; nor will I allow you to make it so great that the blood of Christ cannot cleanse it".<a name=444:11></a>

		The words of Rabshakeh sound very effective, but what he finds is an <i>ordered</i> state of things.<a name=445:7></a> A characteristic Christian is well ordered; here we have one "over the household", we have a "scribe" and we have a "chronicler".<a name=445:8></a> To be disordered is to expose you all the more to the onslaughts of the devil.<a name=445:9></a> So these three men came out to meet Rabshakeh, and they act very wisely; it would not do to send the men on the wall to meet this great personage.<a name=445:10></a> Eliakim, the man over the house, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the chronicler, went.<a name=445:11></a> They represent the ordered way in which the true believer meets such an onslaught as this.<a name=445:12></a> Now, dear brethren, and young people especially, I would urge this -- that you have your inward affairs ordered.<a name=445:13></a> I mean that the believer is to have the departments, so to speak, of his moral being rightly controlled.<a name=445:14></a> These three men represent the three-fold responsibility of the institution -- if you will allow me to use that word.<a name=445:15></a> There was a great system at Jerusalem, there was the king, and all

		Then there is not only the general thought of Eliakim over the house, but there is Shebna the scribe; a scribe is an <i>accurate</i> man, he is not loose, he does not generalise, he takes item by item.<a name=447:1></a> We have here two words, one is the scribe, and the other is the chronicler.<a name=447:2></a> They both allude, as is obvious, to accuracy, to the noting down of things and recognising in an accurate sort of way, things for which we are responsible.<a name=447:3></a> They represent the fact, that not only daily, but hourly, and minutely, we must have relations with God.<a name=447:4></a> God has had it in view that His people should be in constant relation with Him, making constant reference to Him, and referring in detail, with accuracy to Him.<a name=447:5></a> Our very life is made up of that.<a name=447:6></a> It is the joy of God to have His people in holy relations with Himself according to these principles.<a name=447:7></a>

		If I speak of it negatively, it is rending the garments; what I have been yesterday, I must not be today, I must progress.<a name=448:3></a> You will understand, that I am not putting you under law, I am showing you how you are to be preserved in the joy of your salvation; for certainly it is as important that Christians should be preserved in their Christianity, as it is to get others who are not Christians into Christianity.<a name=448:4></a> It is obviously a great matter to keep those who are in it, while not ignoring those who are not.<a name=448:5></a> Who can tell how many have dropped out?<a name=448:6></a> Is there not a gospel to prevent turning away, to prevent retrogression, to prevent apostasy?<a name=448:7></a> Surely there is!<a name=448:8></a> and these chapters are to show us that there can be no return, no washing white in the fuller's field, save by the death of Christ; nor can there be any preservation in the salvation to which we have come, save by the same means.<a name=448:9></a> So we have in the book of Revelation, "Blessed are they that wash their robes" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:14">Revelation  22:14</a>), not that "<i>have</i> washed them"; we have that in the earlier part of the book; chapter 7:14.<a name=448:10></a> There are those who <i>have washed</i> their robes in the blood of the Lamb; there are those who "<i>wash</i> their robes".<a name=448:11></a> To omit the latter is to miss the joy of your salvation and to render yourself useless in the testimony of God.<a name=448:12></a> It is, therefore, a matter of the greatest importance that the gospel presented should make plain the provision made in the death and resurrection of Christ, that Christians should be preserved and go from strength to strength in Zion.<a name=448:13></a>

		Think of that, the few, who have no earthly place, who are not marked by this world's culture, they have a knowledge that exceeds all other intelligence -- they have the knowledge of love.<a name=460:9></a> The apostle does not say, "Hereby we <i>should</i> know it", for John presents characteristic Christianity; he says, "Hereby we <i>have known</i> love".<a name=460:10></a> And how?<a name=460:11></a> In that Christ laid down His life for us.<a name=460:12></a>

		I wish we could think of that, and what that circle is, and that each might have a part in it practically -- the circle which, as I said, the Lord looked round upon.<a name=460:13></a> He looked upon those who sat around Him.<a name=460:14></a> It was not a crowd standing in great curiosity round the Lord; they were <i>sitting</i>.<a name=460:15></a> This is suggestive of Christianity -- a circle drawn to Him sitting down to listen.<a name=460:16></a> Those who had natural claims

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I mention that because many who have natural links inside are content to stand outside with very little interest.<a name=461:3></a> There may be a certain natural interest but there is no spiritual link.<a name=461:4></a> His mother and His brethren, as you will observe, stood outside and sent a message.<a name=461:5></a> The Lord, as He receives the message, looks around on those that sat there and listened.<a name=461:6></a> How happy to be found thus sitting simply and humbly and yet with the intelligence, as I remarked, that exceeds every other in the world -- the <i>knowledge of love</i>.<a name=461:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say exactly the knowledge of the love of Christ, for that is not exactly the way John puts it.<a name=461:8></a> He says, "Hereby we have known love", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>.<a name=461:9></a> How happy to be in that attitude sitting humbly and simply and yet possessed with that wonderful knowledge of love, and to have the Lord.<a name=461:10></a> What marked the mutual ground was the fact that they sat about Christ, and He looked around on them.<a name=461:11></a> Can anything be so precious, dear brethren, as the fact that the Lord looks around on those who are drawn to Him, whose interest is in Him, who like Mary of Bethany are <i>listening</i> to what He is saying?<a name=461:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a difference between listening to things and hearing things.<a name=461:13></a> There are many things that we hear that we would prefer not to hear; but when it becomes a question of listening, then you want to hear.<a name=461:14></a> So Mary sat and listened to what He was saying.<a name=461:15></a> And so here, those in the circle of His brethren, the circle that He owns as in relationship with Him, are sitting about Him.<a name=461:16></a> They are not occupied with any leader or leaders, although the chapter indicates that some of the most renowned Christian leaders were there.<a name=461:17></a> Peter was there, as the chapter records; John and James were there,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Doubtless these were there, but those who sat around Him did not come to see or hear them -- they were sitting around <i>the Lord</i>.<a name=462:2></a> Hence, when the natural claim is asserted He puts forth His spiritual claim.<a name=462:3></a> But where did it lie?<a name=462:4></a> As I said, they sat about Him, but it was more than that, they "did the will of God"; that is Mark's feature of the brethren of Christ.<a name=462:5></a> Matthew has his own feature to present and so have Luke and John, but Mark brings forward the fact that the brethren of Christ are marked off by doing the will of God.<a name=462:6></a> They sat around Him and in that attitude are owned of Him as His mother and His brethren.<a name=462:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I am impressed with is this, that we belong to the circle that is in the possession of this wonderful knowledge of love.<a name=462:8></a> No other love has any place alongside of it; hence John says, "Hereby we have known love, because he [without mentioning the name] has laid down his life for us", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>.<a name=462:9></a> That is how John puts things.<a name=462:10></a> The thing is so great in his mind that he does not qualify it; it is simply <i>love</i>, and then he adds, "because he has laid down his life for us".<a name=462:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the thought of correspondence to Christ.<a name=462:12></a> He immediately adds, "and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>.<a name=462:13></a> I suppose it links on with Colossians, which epistle presents correspondence to Christ in the saints.<a name=462:14></a> I believe Colossians brings in that Christian circle in which Christ is known, as it says, "Christ in you"; that is to say, Christ in our affections, Christ among the Gentiles known in their hearts "the hope of glory"; and the point of the apostle is to bring in correspondence

		Peter says in the verse I began with, "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=471:13></a> One is thus perfectly sure in regard to himself.<a name=471:14></a> But then we want assurance in regard of others, and so I touch on the latter part of the chapter, because it helps us as to certainty in regard to the <i>whole scope of Scripture</i>.<a name=471:15></a> The enemy is endeavouring to shake the

		The little bit of ground on which I stand is not going to sink, but I am sure about the whole universe; it hangs together, you see.<a name=472:3></a> That is the principle of the latter part of this chapter.<a name=472:4></a> I not only know that I am on solid ground myself, but that every one who believes is also on solid ground, and the whole purpose of God stands; that, I apprehend, is what we get here.<a name=472:5></a> We have the word of prophecy made surer -- that is how it should read.<a name=472:6></a> It is not of private interpretation, it is of general bearing, one prophecy interlocks with another; it is all one thing; if you endeavour to undermine the one you undermine the whole superstructure; the law, and the prophets, and the psalms, as the Lord says, all hang together, and they are all for you, and they are all for me; I come to them and I get in them what I know is sure.<a name=472:7></a> The word of prophecy is made surer.<a name=472:8></a> You do well to take heed to it, it was uttered by holy men of God who were moved by the Holy Spirit, so that I am sure in regard of the great moral system that God has brought in in Christ -- I am as sure of it as I am of this great physical system that we are set in.<a name=472:9></a> Thank God for certainty!<a name=472:10></a> May we all know it.<a name=472:11></a>

		Mourning has an important place in Scripture.<a name=473:1></a> In many instances it expresses natural affection in bereavement, and the like; but it is also the outcome of feeling in persons concerned in the testimony of God.<a name=473:2></a> In this sense it marks the Spirit of Christ, especially in Jeremiah, who represents this feature of our Lord peculiarly.<a name=473:3></a> Abraham is the first mourner mentioned in Scripture, hence it is proper to those who have faith.<a name=473:4></a> "Devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:2">Acts  8:2</a>.<a name=473:5></a>

		The passage read is instructive because of the <i>variety</i> of persons mentioned as mourning, or lamenting, for one who had been conspicuous in the service of God.<a name=473:6></a> Ascending the throne at the tender age of eight, Josiah in his reign was marked by extraordinary devotedness to Jehovah and zeal for what was due to Him and His house.<a name=473:7></a> "He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#34:2">2 Chronicles  34:2</a>.<a name=473:8></a> Although the occasion of the king's death was not in keeping with his ministry, this did not prevent the people from lamenting it, as the verses read testify so touchingly.<a name=473:9></a>

		Firstly, <i>Judah:</i> "Judah .<a name=473:10></a>.<a name=473:11></a>.<a name=473:12></a> mourned for Josiah".<a name=473:13></a> We have here suggested the people as taken up <i>sovereignly</i> and <i>spared</i> -- for the ten tribes had already been captivated.<a name=473:14></a> Regarding ourselves in this light, we do well to mourn the loss of one whom God used for the protection and general help of His people.<a name=473:15></a>

		Secondly, <i>Jerusalem:</i> "Jerusalem mourned for Josiah".<a name=474:1></a> Responsible for the light and government of God within our own circle and in their general bearing, the saints should indeed recognise most feelingly the removal of one who served in these things with divine approval amongst them.<a name=474:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, <i>Jeremiah:</i> "Jeremiah lamented for Josiah".<a name=474:3></a> As already said, he "the weeping prophet", represents the Spirit of Christ seen in His sorrow, and so the mention of him here is specially worthy of note.<a name=474:4></a> We may well link it with the supremely touching scene at Bethany, when "Jesus wept", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:35">John  11:35</a>.<a name=474:5></a> Being a prophet, Jeremiah conveys the mind of God in this time of grief.<a name=474:6></a> We have in him thus the highest level on which mourning can be placed.<a name=474:7></a> The feelings of those conversant with the mind of God being moved by the death of a servant indicate that his ministry reached a definite spiritual elevation.<a name=474:8></a> The original word for lamented here suggests <i>control</i> in the expression of feeling; intelligence enters into it and so what is measured and suitable is conveyed.<a name=474:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, <i>singing men and singing women</i> mourn.<a name=474:10></a> These "spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day".<a name=474:11></a> The memory of the honoured servant is carried down in a manner to touch the affections of later generations.<a name=474:12></a> The speaking of singers in their lamentations would be musical.<a name=474:13></a> Their lamentations would be occasioned by later occurrences, but they would <i>include</i> Josiah: he and his services would thus be <i>continued</i> in freshness in the minds and hearts of generations following.<a name=474:14></a> "They made them an ordinance for Israel".<a name=474:15></a> This is a remarkable statement, as showing that honoured servants <i>should not</i> be forgotten, but held in affectionate remembrance by the people of God.<a name=474:16></a> We are enjoined, "Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:7">Hebrews  13:7</a>.<a name=474:17></a> "Israel"(the saints viewed spiritually) understand, and thus certain names are

		cherished among us.<a name=475:1></a> "An ordinance" implies what is imperative.<a name=475:2></a> "Behold, they are written in the lamentations".<a name=475:3></a> In this we have the assurance that the memory of the valued servant is permanently preserved -- not only in the minds of persons, but in <i>writing</i>.<a name=475:4></a> This is confirmed in what follows; Josiah's "good deeds" (the original conveying exceptional quality), "according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah", being written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.<a name=475:5></a>
