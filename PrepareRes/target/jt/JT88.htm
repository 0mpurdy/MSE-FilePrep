		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> It has been thought that by looking into this subject we shall see how the dispensation was introduced and maintained in prayer, in the power of prayer.<a name=1:3></a> As seeing the relation of prayer to the various turns the testimony took, we shall perhaps learn how to pray in the present time according to all the changing circumstances, and find relief, and learn perhaps how to pray more.<a name=1:4></a> We may learn <i>how</i> to pray, how to expect answers, and how to prepare ourselves for answers; for answers usually take the form of using those who pray.<a name=1:5></a>

		The first scripture is characteristic, and is the key to the whole position, for it shows the composition of the company at that time, believers, and what authority there was and ability, and how they abode together; also how women had to do with it, for it is said, "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren".<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second passage shows how the difficulty occasioned by the defection of Judas was repaired, how the damage was repaired so that there should be the full administrative principle.<a name=1:7></a> Then finally we see how, the Holy Spirit having come in, the assembly itself was inaugurated as we have it now, that is, at least in principle; how prayer was a part of the general features in which the assembly functioned, and how it qualified as the instrument or vessel to be used of the Lord.<a name=1:8></a> It is thought these scriptures will suffice for us for this reading.<a name=1:9></a>

		S.P.<a name=2:1></a> Would it be right to say this is the expansion of the Lord Jesus teaching the disciples to pray?<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:3></a> Just so; it is really the expansion of the gospel of Luke in which the Lord Jesus is seen praying so many times; and in chapter 11:1, one of His disciples seeing Him praying "in a certain place" -- pointing to a local position -- said, "Lord, teach us to pray"(<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:1">Luke  11:1</a>), which He did.<a name=2:4></a> So that we should begin with that thought: prayer began in the Acts with persons who knew how to pray.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=2:6></a>D.<a name=2:7></a> Do you think prayer always refers to something specific, or is it the attitude of heart Godward, the idea of prayer continuing?<a name=2:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:9></a> The suggestion in verse 14 is the key position.<a name=2:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The need of prayer is always very great, pressure is always great, and it says, "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer".<a name=2:11></a> Now in chapter 6 you will remember, in view of deacons being appointed, the twelve said it was not meet that they should leave the word of God and serve tables, and then they said they would give themselves up to prayer and the ministry of the word (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:4">Acts  6:4</a>).<a name=2:12></a> The ministry of the word is omitted here, it is just prayer: "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer".<a name=2:13></a> As yet there is no mention of the word of God, but prayer is always needed; whether we have persons of gift or not, prayer can always be exercised.<a name=2:14></a> So they "gave themselves", meaning a definite giving up to that service, or should I say, that exercise in view of pressure.<a name=2:15></a> When those of the remnant were restored in the return from Babylon in Zerubbabel's time, as written in the book of Ezra, they first of all set up the altar on its base; instead of beginning to build the temple, which requires the word of God, they just set up the altar on its base because of the enemies in those countries (<a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#3:3">Ezra  3:3</a>).<a name=2:16></a> I think that is the position here.<a name=2:17></a> The need is great, the position required

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=3:2></a> Is it because of the fact that on the one hand the Lord had ascended to glory, and on the other hand the Holy Spirit had not yet come?<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Their position was therefore all the more vulnerable.<a name=3:5></a> That is what is meant when it speaks of the entire giving of themselves up with one accord to prayer and does not say anything about any other feature of service.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=3:7></a> Do we have the beginning of assembly prayer here in verse 14?<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:9></a> It is the principle of it, but, of course, the assembly was not yet formed.<a name=3:10></a> It is in the second chapter that we have prayer as a formal element in the general assembly position.<a name=3:11></a> There, other things are mentioned as well as prayer; here it shows what consciousness of need there was before the Holy Spirit came.<a name=3:12></a>

		C.A.<a name=3:13></a>M.<a name=3:14></a> Connecting this in the Acts with the gospel of Luke, would it be right to say all God's operations are in answer to prayer?<a name=3:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:16></a> I do not know who prayed for the creation.<a name=3:17></a> What do you think about that?<a name=3:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:19></a>M.<a name=3:20></a> The matter of counsel was prior to everything else, but I mean God's present operations.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:22></a> Yes, and even as to eternal life and promise: the idea of promise includes eternal life which involved the expression of need, though very faintly suggested.<a name=3:23></a> But as to creation, you cannot say anybody prayed for that; it is a pure matter of sovereignty.<a name=3:24></a>

		A.N.<a name=3:25></a>W.<a name=3:26></a> Along with continual prayer, would it appear specific prayers flow from ministry such as Peter's?<a name=3:27></a> It opens the way for specific prayer.<a name=3:28></a>

		S.McC.<a name=5:7></a> Is it of note that in the first introduction of the idea of twelve in the scripture it seems to be in regard to prayer?<a name=5:8></a> God listened to Rachel and God hearkened to Leah, as if in the mixed relations in the mothers in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#30">Genesis  30</a>the beginnings of the twelve are seen.<a name=5:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:4></a> Romans is an elementary epistle, it does not speak of the formation of the assembly, although it leads to it.<a name=7:5></a> It is rather individual formation, so that we readily admit we do not know what we should pray for as we ought.<a name=7:6></a> It is suitable to bring that in.<a name=7:7></a> It is a good, wholesome thing for each of us just to accept that we are very defective in this matter of prayer.<a name=7:8></a> That chapter shows how the Spirit comes in and adds to us so that we should pray as we ought.<a name=7:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:13></a> I think all that preceded this, from Luke's point of view, entered into the upper room.<a name=7:14></a> It is a question of what was there on heaven's account, on the Lord's account, and how they acted on instinct; they did the right thing: "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren".<a name=7:15></a> These are by themselves, and this last element joined in adds its immense subjective instinct and power to the position.<a name=7:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=54:1></a> It was pointed out yesterday in relation to prayer in chapter 4 that the apostles were increasing in power; instead of their power diminishing, it was increasing.<a name=54:2></a> They had asked for this, and it says, "And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness" (verse 31).<a name=54:3></a> Then we are told, "With great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all" (verse 33).<a name=54:4></a> Following on this we have an allusion to apostolic administrative authority extending to many: "as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to each according as any one might have need" (verses 34, 35).<a name=54:5></a> This would be evidently a development by experience; it was better that there should be direct specific administrative authority for it than that it should be left open in the sense of having all things in common.<a name=54:6></a> Following on this we have Barnabas laying money at the apostles' feet, as one who had represented a great accession to the position; it is said that he "being possessed of land, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles" (verse 37)(<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:31">Acts  4:31</a>,37).<a name=54:7></a> He had been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, showing there was steady development and increase.<a name=54:8></a>

		Now in chapter 6 we have a breakdown.<a name=55:8></a> "But in those days, the disciples multiplying in number, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews because their widows were overlooked in the daily ministration" (verse 1).<a name=55:9></a> It would look as if the administration of money was failing, but in any case there was the spirit of complaint which is a bad sign; it is met by prayer and then by the appointment of the seven deacons.<a name=55:10></a> Following on this there is the provisional position in relation to the Jews, in relation to Jerusalem, gradually ebbing and ceasing as we shall see in the next section, chapters 9, 10 and 11.<a name=55:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=260:1></a> It was thought that we should continue with this epistle because it affords more instruction on our subject than any other epistle, that is, as to being born or begotten of God.<a name=260:2></a> This is a root idea and is an initial thought with the apostle John.<a name=260:3></a> The apostle makes an analysis really and the idea of being begotten of God enters much into this.<a name=260:4></a> It works out in our contact with sin, sin in ourselves, so that the subject becomes intensely practical and enables us to understand and to analyse our inner movements, how it can be said that one born of God "does not sin".<a name=260:5></a> It is connected in these passages with righteousness, dealing with sin in its root character, "He that practises sin is of the devil; for from the beginning the devil sins" (verse 8).<a name=260:6></a> This is over against one that is begotten of God who does not practise sin, as it says in verse 9, "Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.<a name=260:7></a> In this are manifest the children of God"; so that we have here root comparisons.<a name=260:8></a> In chapter 5 the fact of believing that Jesus is the Christ is a proof that one is begotten of God, and this gives victory over the world too: "For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith.<a name=260:9></a> Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=260:10></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=261:7></a> It helps us as to this matter of being born of God.<a name=261:8></a> First the apostle addresses us as 'children', meaning he has a father's place which brings the Fatherhood of God very near to us.<a name=261:9></a> The apostle represented the thing in measure so he says, "Children, let no man lead you astray; he that practises righteousness is righteous, even as <i>he</i> is righteous.<a name=261:10></a> He that practises sin is of the devil; for from the beginning the devil sins" (verses 7, 8).<a name=261:11></a> The comparison is based on root principles and hence is intensely abstract; it is only as we understand the abstract idea that we can understand these verses.<a name=261:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.Mc.<a name=262:6></a> Does Paul refer to this when he says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:25">Romans  7:25</a>, "So then <i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law"?<a name=262:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=276:1></a> What is in mind at this session is that we should see the connection of the Spirit with the children of God.<a name=276:2></a> Heretofore we have been stressing 'born of God', that children are born of God.<a name=276:3></a> Sons are not said to be born of God, except the Lord Jesus who is said to be a begotten Son; Jehovah says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:7">Psalm  2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; <i>I</i> this day have begotten thee".<a name=276:4></a> Thus sonship for us is that we are adopted, and in that connection the Spirit is immediately brought in, "Because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a>.<a name=276:5></a> Sonship properly belongs to heaven.<a name=276:6></a> The relationship of children views us as on the earth, but in this section of scripture we have the Spirit connected with children, the most important part of our subject, so that we might see a little more how the Spirit serves us.<a name=276:7></a> The Spirit is the great subject of chapter 8; chapter 7 in the latter part of it treats of our state and gives an analysis enabling us to determine the motives of our members, of our automatic members; the Spirit operates in them sometimes without affecting our minds.<a name=276:8></a> There is the principle of springing up attached to the Spirit in us, and we become intelligent as to His movements and as to the movements of our members, our automatic organs which the Spirit acts upon; we are enabled to determine what they are.<a name=276:9></a> Through the analysis the Spirit helps us so that we are told here that "the Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (verse 16).<a name=276:10></a> The chapter speaks of the Spirit in me, relations with Him involving that we are free through the analysis of chapter 7, where we arrive at a point where the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=331:1></a> This series of psalms which begins here points to the wealth that may be found in God's people, as in the circumstances the book indicates and of which we spoke this morning, people driven out and deprived of their ordinary privileges, yet marked by power to speak richly, first to Christ, and then of His things, as in this psalm.<a name=331:2></a> The following psalm speaks about the river of God: "There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the sanctuary of the habitations of the Most High", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#46:4">Psalm  46:4</a>.<a name=331:3></a> The next one speaks about God: "All ye peoples, clap your hands; shout unto God with the voice of triumph!<a name=331:4></a>", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#47:1">Psalm  47:1</a>.<a name=331:5></a> The next one speaks of God greatly to be praised: "Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the hill of his holiness.<a name=331:6></a> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#48:1">Psalm  48:1</a>,2.<a name=331:7></a> So our lesson should be on these lines.<a name=331:8></a> The other psalm which we looked at this morning points to the individual believer gaining in his soul, and speaks of his external appearance, so that he is a testimony personally.<a name=331:9></a> The health of his countenance has been stressed.<a name=331:10></a> It would look as if in the history of the assembly, this set of psalms would find an answer in the sense that, while the assembly itself and its services were largely lost sight of, there was yet a remarkable appreciation of God and of Christ and even of the Spirit, as instanced in the hymns that are still extant.<a name=331:11></a> The brethren perhaps may not have observed that in our hymn book there are a large number of hymns from authors that were not, as we

		say, strictly in fellowship.<a name=332:1></a> Were such authors to offer hymns now to the brethren walking in the light of the assembly, they would not be accepted, whatever their wording, because the fellowship now has a place which becomes a test as to spirituality and godliness.<a name=332:2></a> In the Middle Ages there were very many precious productions with which the service of God has been enriched now, but particularly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; we have a large number of hymns that are usable now by the Spirit.<a name=332:3></a> Since the assembly has had a place and the fellowship a place, all those in the systems or organisations of men have been tested, and the door has been opened to them to come into the service of God in a true sense; they have elected to stay out, so what is there has become greatly impoverished, and what is coming now in productions of richness for the service of God is from those in the fellowship.<a name=332:4></a> Those who elect to stay out of it, seeing it now exists in a spiritual way here, are discrediting themselves.<a name=332:5></a> I mention all this, because <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>is a wonderful production, it is attributed to an individual who says, "My heart is welling forth with a good matter; I say what I have composed touching the king".<a name=332:6></a> Then he goes on to tell us about the King.<a name=332:7></a>

		So what is to be observed in this first psalm read is that it records historically a great triumph for David, and that thought enters into the psalms we have immediately before us.<a name=376:14></a> It was a triumph for David, not when he was driven out as we had earlier, although that enters into these first verses too, but it is a triumph during his reign and territory is acquired, not for the sake of acquiring it, but because it was usable.<a name=376:15></a> There is not much in territory unless it can be used.<a name=376:16></a> It is only a name.<a name=376:17></a> So that we have here in verses 6 to 8, "God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.<a name=376:18></a> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of

		J.T.<a name=400:1></a> It seems fitting that we should close our session in the second book of Psalms with the sufferings of Christ as a subject by itself.<a name=400:2></a> We have had varied features of the truth as they are seen in the book, and now it seems we should give our minds to the sufferings of Christ.<a name=400:3></a> This 69th Psalm is one of the suffering psalms, especially the psalm of sorrow.<a name=400:4></a> There are four outstanding psalms which may be thus regarded, the 22nd, 40th, this one and the 102nd.<a name=400:5></a> This one is the longest and it will be noted how it stresses hatred of Christ, fixed hatred manifested against the Lord.<a name=400:6></a> Remember, the word "hate" is not used in this connection in any of the others; it is used in this special psalm once, standing over against lovers of Christ.<a name=400:7></a> In looking through the book, there is the thought of those who are lovers of Christ, especially in the circumstances which the book contemplates, those driven out from the privileges of their homes and local meetings and so on.<a name=400:8></a> Now it is a wholesome thing that we should consider together the hatred that there is; that is, whatever external appearance may exist, there is hatred of Christ working out in apostasy.<a name=400:9></a> The book contemplates that and, therefore, we have more imprecation than in any of the others, resentment, pointing to the apostate conditions that we have entered upon and which are about to increase.<a name=400:10></a> It is the finish and this psalm has in mind how heaven feels about it, how Christ is regarded, how He is hated.<a name=400:11></a>
