	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> The features of the truth presented in the epistle to the Colossians are well known to the brethren, at least it is assumed that they are well known, but it is hoped that certain features that have not been stressed may come before us at this time, and particularly the idea of hope; then the personal side is pronounced in the epistle.<a name=1:2></a> Paul's own feeling and thoughts, personal thoughts, are brought forward, he not having seen the saints at Colosse; a peculiar matter, which, of course, would apply at the present time to us.<a name=1:3></a> We cannot speak of any links with apostolic ministry, or even with such ministry as has an apostolic character; none of us can speak much of this.<a name=1:4></a> The occasion therefore has to be one amongst us who know each other, and specially the younger men, many of whom have been travelling under the government of God, and have come in touch with the brethren elsewhere.<a name=1:5></a> The knowledge we thus have of each other is, in this sense, considerably enlarged, as compared with earlier days.<a name=1:6></a> It is well to keep this in mind that we are not so far away from each other in the physical sense as we used to be.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the names mentioned by the apostle, such as Epaphras and others, are to be noted, especially some of them who are outstanding, one of them known to the Colossians as one of themselves.<a name=1:8></a> The personal side therefore is important, especially if it is spiritual.<a name=1:9></a> Spirituality enters into our personal acquaintance with each other, and the knowledge that many of us have acquired through the recent governmental circumstances of the wars.<a name=1:10></a> All this would be in mind, and especially with such a man as Epaphras who was one of them, and was marked by combat for the truth and for them.<a name=1:11></a>

		The apostle's opening word is characteristic, "Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus, by God's will, and Timotheus the brother, to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which are in Colosse", and then he says, "We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ continually when praying for you, having heard" (that is, what he has to say was based on testimony rendered to him by others) "having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, on account of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens; of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the glad tidings, which are come to you, as they are in all the world, and are bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the day ye heard them and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth: even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-bondman, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you, who has also manifested to us your love in the Spirit".<a name=2:1></a> I have just read this section to bring out the personal side, and how it was seen in Epaphras.<a name=2:2></a> He is mentioned later, showing how important a personality he was in the apostle's mind, and that there are such persons who are reliable and have influence and have care for the local position.<a name=2:3></a> It is a matter of the first importance that the local position should be properly cared for, and that brethren who have ability and gift should not forget that the local position in each place has to be maintained.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=2:5></a> Would this reference to Timotheus "the brother" bear on the character of the epistle definitely as opening up the features of the Christian circle?<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:7></a> Quite so; he is called <i>the</i> brother, as if the term brother applied peculiarly to him.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.Al.<a name=2:9></a> Was not Timotheus himself personally introduced in that way as one who was "well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium"?<a name=2:10></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:2">Acts  16:2</a>.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J. T.<a name=2:12></a> He is brought forward at first on those lines and is particularly noted as one of whom there was a

		good report locally.<a name=3:1></a> The idea of universal service, or servants, is in the Scriptures, but generally, even in Paul and Barnabas, the local position is maintained.<a name=3:2></a> After their first journey of service they returned to Antioch and remained a considerable time with the brethren, as if to establish the importance of the local principle and that it was not to be overshadowed even by gift.<a name=3:3></a> Each is to have his part in it, because Corinthians, which is the scripture that bears on that point, stresses the importance of the local position, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=3:4></a> We do not get it here or in Ephesus, so much; it is Corinth that is in mind.<a name=3:5></a> Just now it is a question of Colosse and the personnel mentioned, showing that one of themselves is marked by spiritual feelings and concern about the local position.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:7></a> Would you look for a sober recognition of the government of God as entering into our localities; placing us there with a view to filling out our part in it, and strengthening what is of God in the place?<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:9></a> Just so.<a name=3:10></a> The military circumstances that have preceded us are not to be overlooked, because the two wars were not simply accidental.<a name=3:11></a> They have to do with the government of God, and the bearing of the government of God on the saints, especially the young men, is to be noted.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.Bd.<a name=3:13></a> Would what is said as to Samuel help?<a name=3:14></a> It says, "his return was to Ramah; for there was his house, and there he judged Israel".<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:16></a> It would indeed.<a name=3:17></a> "There was his house".<a name=3:18></a> As we have it even again in Corinthians, "have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?<a name=3:19></a>".<a name=3:20></a> The bearing of the house on the assembly position is in mind and it is striking that it should appear as early as Samuel.<a name=3:21></a> He had a regular circuit and although some of his family did not turn out too well, yet he did not forget his house.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.A.<a name=3:23></a>W.<a name=3:24></a> Is the importance of "one of you" in the last chapter striking as linking on with the local thought?<a name=3:25></a>

		"Onesimus .<a name=4:1></a>.<a name=4:2></a>.<a name=4:3></a> who is one of you" and "Epaphras, who is one of you".<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:5></a> Just so; he was one of them.<a name=4:6></a> So that he represents what we are speaking of, the importance of the local position.<a name=4:7></a> The epistle to Philemon bears on all this.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:9></a> Would the mention of the elderhood in relation to Timothy's gift also bear this out and stress the importance of the local position?<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:11></a> His gift, of course, was connected with Paul too, but the elderhood is important and it bears on what we are saying, because the elders are never regarded as universal; they are properly local.<a name=4:12></a> They are first mentioned peculiarly in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14">Acts  14</a>, where the apostles Paul and Barnabas chose elders in each assembly, showing that in their minds the local position was to be properly cared for.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=4:14></a>S.<a name=4:15></a> Epaphras would seem to be one who had cared for the local position, and in consequence found himself linked with the apostle in his universal service.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:17></a> That is just what we were saying, that he was one of them that clearly cared for the local position, he combated for them.<a name=4:18></a> Evidently he or someone must have told Paul about the general position at Colosse, and it was to strengthen it that the epistle was written.<a name=4:19></a> The epistles to Corinth begin with the local position and continue on to the universal position.<a name=4:20></a> The apostle saying, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", refers to the universal position, which is to be marked by general unity and not independency.<a name=4:21></a> Therefore the customs are to be the same in every assembly, which is one of the most important things that can be mentioned; the idea of general unity in what we are saying and what we teach, and what we do, in our localities.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=4:23></a> Would the princes of the tribes in Numbers illustrate that unity, as each attached to a locality contributed to what is universal?<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J. T.<a name=5:1></a> They represent that very idea, for the princes would be influential and would influence all below them for good and for unity.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:3></a> Would Philemon show the link between the two sides when it says, "the assembly which is in thine house"?<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:5></a> Well, that is good.<a name=5:6></a> It says, "Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman, and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the assembly which is in thine house", that is to say, Philemon's house, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=5:7></a> So that the position is maintained there, and the nearness of Philemon's position to Colosse is in mind.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=5:9></a>H.<a name=5:10></a> Is the question of testimony important, Paul having had the report of what was going on in Colosse by way of accredited testimony?<a name=5:11></a> As we hear reports from one locality and another, are we to receive them as accredited testimony?<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:13></a> It is important to be sure that whatever becomes current in the way of information should be accredited; hence Corinthians stresses "in the mouth of two or three witnesses", and so does Matthew.<a name=5:14></a> Therefore whatever is circulated in the sense of information, either as to the work of God, or as to the personnel of the service, should be accredited before circulation.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=5:16></a> The apostle Paul says to the Corinthians, "It hath been declared unto me .<a name=5:17></a>.<a name=5:18></a>.<a name=5:19></a> by them which are of the house of Chloe".<a name=5:20></a> She evidently reported to the apostle and he speaks of that when writing to them.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:22></a> He uses the expression "reported commonly" later, but that common report would be accredited in his mind, I am certain, and so would that be from the house of Chloe.<a name=5:23></a> Chloe was evidently a woman and she was reliable, such as Phoebe.<a name=5:24></a> Sisters are specially in mind for reliability, that they should be reliable in what they may say.<a name=5:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=6:1></a> How do you account for the inaccuracy of the report that went out at the end of John's gospel?<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:3></a> Well, that is to be noted too, but the Spirit of God records what Jesus did not say.<a name=6:4></a> If <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>be an appendix, then it makes it all the more important that the truth should be fully accredited, and now that we have come to the end of the dispensation it is most important that nothing is given out that is not accurate.<a name=6:5></a> We often refer to the Bereans, and that one of them was in Paul's company, according to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, as if the apostle would have such a one as that to correct anything that is not according to Scripture.<a name=6:6></a> Sometimes notions or thoughts that are given out, it may be at local readings, are circulated and found to be inaccurate and, in fact, untrue, hence the importance of having a Berean or the spirit of the Bereans in our local meetings.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:8></a> It is said in Deuteronomy, that if certain things are reported, we are to make diligent search before we accept them.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A. M.<a name=6:10></a> Does the quality of faithfulness, so stressed by Paul, therefore apply not only to persons, but to words?<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:12></a> So that if a report is circulated, the words ought to be carefully analysed.<a name=6:13></a> We have already alluded to the expression in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>, "Jesus did not say".<a name=6:14></a> The Lord is dealing with a special minister that He had in mind, a nameless one so far, at least according to what He said.<a name=6:15></a> It was John, of course, "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=6:16></a> The Lord had in mind to keep him in reserve, to be used at any time, whether it be he actually or the spirit of what he represents.<a name=6:17></a> He was one to be used at any time to bring out some particular feature of the truth.<a name=6:18></a> The Lord would stress the need for accuracy in such matters.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:20></a> Reverting to the support of the testimony in the locality, there is a rather remarkable verse in 1 Samuel, which perhaps would bear upon it.<a name=6:21></a> It says,

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:4></a> Quite so.<a name=7:5></a> And then the young women, how they were able to tell Saul and his servant where the man of God was.<a name=7:6></a> They know, showing the importance of sisters knowing in these matters.<a name=7:7></a> As to Colossians, the matter of the brother which was brought forward, "Timotheus the brother", then "the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which are in Colosse", the idea of holiness attaching to the brethren, as well as faithfulness.<a name=7:8></a> I am only alluding to the actual wording of the introductory address of Paul, and then what he gives thanks for.<a name=7:9></a> His word runs on to the hope, in verse 5, "on account of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens".<a name=7:10></a> The word "heavens" is here viewed in the sense of what heaven really is, not the expanse, which would include other things.<a name=7:11></a> The word "heavens" here, as coming up in the New Testament, would allude to heaven itself, and what heaven is in regard to matters we are speaking of, but as to the expanse, we have to bear in mind that we have other things besides what is good in the expanse.<a name=7:12></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, "God called the expanse Heavens", but we have to bear in mind that it is more general.<a name=7:13></a> Here the hope is not in the expanse, it is in the heavens, laid up in the heavens for the Colossians.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>

		Ques.<a name=7:15></a> Had you in mind that the hope in this connection is limited definitely to the place the assembly has and not any other heavenly family?<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:17></a> I would think so.<a name=7:18></a> It says, "for you"; that is to say, we have to keep in mind who is spoken of and whether the Colossians are viewed simply as a local company or whether they really represent the gentiles, which they do.<a name=7:19></a> So what is said to be reserved in the heavens is for the gentiles, I would think.<a name=7:20></a> The Jews

		are contemplated as well as the gentiles in Ephesians, but Colossians shows that the gentiles are not at any disadvantage, because the hope is for them, and it is laid up in the heavens, meaning that it is where it is reserved and preserved for them, only they have to come to it.<a name=8:1></a> It is a question now of where they are and what God has wrought in them because the epistle depends on what is wrought in us, not only the objective side of things, but what is wrought in us, so that we have means in ourselves of affecting ourselves.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=8:3></a>N.<a name=8:4></a> Would you give us a little help in regard to the three fold way the hope is brought in: the reference here to "the hope .<a name=8:5></a>.<a name=8:6></a>.<a name=8:7></a> laid up .<a name=8:8></a>.<a name=8:9></a>.<a name=8:10></a> in the heavens", then "the hope of the glad tidings", and finally "Christ in you the hope of glory".<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:12></a> I am glad you bring that forward.<a name=8:13></a> The three-fold thought as brought in here in this epistle of <i>hope</i>, may be compared with the Thessalonians.<a name=8:14></a> It does not say that the Colossians had given it up.<a name=8:15></a> In the second epistle to the Thessalonians the idea of hope is dropped, whereas in the first epistle it is found, and here it is found three times.<a name=8:16></a> I think that it should be specially stressed that hope should mark us, because things are gradually getting worse in the world and the brethren need to be buoyed up by hope.<a name=8:17></a> There are going to be better things for us, but we have to wait for them.<a name=8:18></a> "What a man sees", that is the present situation, political, industrial, social or whatever it be, but it is not affording anything, especially for young men and young women.<a name=8:19></a> All this is intended, because really God would give the youth to understand that He is thinking of them, and they may count on God anyway to come in for them circumstantially in view of certain things, such as marriage and the like, but on the whole what is so specially needed for all of us, I believe, is the idea of hope.<a name=8:20></a> There is little or nothing to be expected here, and so the question is as to whether we are resting in hope.<a name=8:21></a>

		H.F.<a name=9:1></a>N.<a name=9:2></a> Would it be right to link the first reference to hope with the thought of sonship, and the second with the thought of the inheritance?<a name=9:3></a> Then would "Christ in you the hope of glory" be the distinctive feature of the Colossian side of the mystery?<a name=9:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:5></a> Quite so.<a name=9:6></a> God is not spreading things out for unconverted people or even merely religious people.<a name=9:7></a> It is a mystery.<a name=9:8></a> The hope that we are trusting to involves mystery.<a name=9:9></a> And so we are to be instructed in mystery, and hence the need specially of reading Matthew.<a name=9:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=9:27></a> Quite so, "where the Christ is".<a name=9:28></a> Hope, as in Romans, is a fundamental thought, and it does not make ashamed, because God recompenses us as to what we may speak of as our hope, by the fact that His love is in our hearts.<a name=9:29></a> It is not viewed as in heaven, it is in our hearts, "shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<a name=9:30></a>

		J.

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:17></a> Quite so.<a name=11:18></a> The <i>immediate</i> thought of what the Lord will do for us pending the full end of the dispensation is to be before us; that He is thinking of us in view, of what is <i>better</i>, is something that very many need to be encouraged with.<a name=11:19></a> That brings an element of joy too, but many of us, perhaps, are not very much accustomed to joy in our experience.<a name=11:20></a> This may be especially so if we are ministers or gifted men, for we are apt to rest in our gift and what we are doing, whereas the joy lies in what we are coming into, the better things.<a name=11:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:9></a> Well, it is a very good question.<a name=12:10></a> We speak more of faith, perhaps, than we speak of hope.<a name=12:11></a> While faith is fundamental as to the truth and as to the ministry, hope is intended to stimulate us before things become visible, as it says, "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory".<a name=12:12></a> That is to be in our hearts in view of possible dissolution.<a name=12:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=12:14></a> Have you in mind that faith is on the principle of light, while hope is really something arrived at in the way of enjoyment?<a name=12:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:16></a> Well, I think hope really involves promise.<a name=12:17></a> The promises are very tangible.<a name=12:18></a> The Lord says to Philadelphia, "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=12:19></a> That we are to be taken out of the great tribulation is a promise which I believe the brethren are coming to see.<a name=12:20></a> The fact that the Lord has made that promise, as well as other promises, is an element that affords satisfaction and joy.<a name=12:21></a> Then, what you say enters into Romans, as has already been remarked; that is to say, "Hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<a name=12:22></a> The thing is in our hearts, but it is based on promise, and, of course, on light too, as it says, "The things which are seen are temporal; but the things that

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=13:4></a> Love is the greater.<a name=13:5></a> It is not superlative, it is comparative.<a name=13:6></a> The comparison is between faith and hope, but love abides, for love is eternal.<a name=13:7></a> It is not based on anything in a sense; it is what God is, and what the Holy Spirit sheds abroad in our hearts.<a name=13:8></a>

		A.N.<a name=13:9></a>W.<a name=13:10></a> Is faith particularly connected with Abraham, whereas hope more with Sarah?<a name=13:11></a> It says she "hoped in God".<a name=13:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=13:13></a> Abraham "looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God".<a name=13:14></a> He looked for that and that was a hope.<a name=13:15></a> But now we have to come back to the question raised as to the difference between faith and hope.<a name=13:16></a> Faith is by report; that is the way it is put in Romans, "Faith then is by a report, but the report by God's word".<a name=13:17></a> Then we have what is said about hope also in Romans.<a name=13:18></a> Faith is a report which our souls rest in, but hope is clearly additional as something to affect us in a moral way.<a name=13:19></a> There is such a thing as what is unseen affording joy, and hope covers all that, for what is not seen is eternal.<a name=13:20></a> The soul thus learns to live in hope in that sense.<a name=13:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=14:6></a> That shows that faith and hope are intimately linked together.<a name=14:7></a> Faith, of course, is the great fundamental thought and gathers up everything, you might say, in itself, but then when we specialise, we have to come to love, and see that it is greater than the other two.<a name=14:8></a> That is to say, it is the great essential thing that emanates from God.<a name=14:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=14:12></a> That is intelligible, in view of Peter's writing to the saints of the dispersion.<a name=14:13></a> He was the apostle of the circumcision, but they were dispersed, which would mean that they were suffering, and he encourages them in that way.<a name=14:14></a> "Filled with the glory", as it goes on to say, would imply the Spirit, of course.<a name=14:15></a> So that the Jewish Christians in that day would be filled with the glory, but the glory as faith would lay hold of it through the gospel.<a name=14:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=20:1></a> I think it will be observed that this epistle is marked by immediate application of the truth to the local company.<a name=20:2></a> It therefore differs somewhat from Ephesians, which is marked by the truth itself being unfolded, although, in time, applied to the Ephesians.<a name=20:3></a> There is that in Ephesians which corresponds, but it is the value of the truth itself which is stressed there.<a name=20:4></a> At other times the need of application is stressed as here in Colossians and in connection with the application we have the thought of prayer.<a name=20:5></a> Hence, "For this reason we also, from the day we heard of your faith and love, do not cease praying and asking for you, to the end that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, so as to walk worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by the true knowledge of God, strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and long suffering with joy".<a name=20:6></a> That which is due to the Father, to God, is then added, leading up to the beautiful expression "the kingdom of the Son of his love": an expression which, I think, is only found here, the Son of the Father's love.<a name=20:7></a> The instruction therefore leads up to that.<a name=20:8></a> Other things are in mind, but generally as applying to the local company at Colosse, only that at the end the apostle is free to speak of himself and his ministry, the aim of which was to "present every man perfect in Christ".<a name=20:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=55:5></a> Well, going back to the idea of boundaries, and limitations, and companionships and associations, the idea of <i>not</i> (<i>not</i> on things below) is of great importance.<a name=55:6></a> Even in regard to the distance between a man's house or himself and the meeting which he should attend.<a name=55:7></a> These boundaries in themselves are not hallowed; it is only a question of what relates to the brethren, to ourselves, that things become hallowed, and so here "you" -- "your hearts"; that is, <i>yourselves</i> "being united together in love".<a name=55:8></a> Thus the sphere that belongs to us and in which we are to operate and to live is the circle of the brethren.<a name=55:9></a> Perhaps you will enlarge on what you had in mind as to headship, linking it on with what I have attempted to say as to ourselves, and our being united together in love.<a name=55:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=65:1></a> It is thought that the types in Joshua will help us in the understanding of these sections of Colossians and so the verses read have been suggested.<a name=65:2></a> There it is a question of Israel, not having exactly entered the land, but in the act of entering it and it thus links with what has been stressed this morning as to what God is doing.<a name=65:3></a> It is not what He has done or will do, but what He is doing now and hence the application of this passage to us as we are here on the earth.<a name=65:4></a> That is why we dwelt upon it at such length, and yet we hardly finished what should be said about it, especially the position of Christ in chapter 2 as compared with the passage in chapter 1.<a name=65:5></a> They correspond in measure as to the word "fulness".<a name=65:6></a> We have here in verse 9, "in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=65:7></a> The word <i>bodily</i> is added in order to bring out the idea of persons.<a name=65:8></a> It is not only what we may know, or be, in God's mind or in the minds of each other, but what we are in person, each one in his person.<a name=65:9></a> The assembly is composed of persons, and Christ is said to be Head of it.<a name=65:10></a> In chapter 1 of this book, it is formally stated that "<i>he</i> is the head of the body, the assembly".<a name=65:11></a> The word <i>body</i> carries with it the idea of persons, but in a substantial sense and in the aggregate.<a name=65:12></a> Among many other distinctions, Christ has the place of headship to the body; the word <i>assembly</i> being added.<a name=65:13></a> Then this passage alludes formally to the Person of Christ in a bodily sense.<a name=65:14></a> The question of our bodies must therefore come up if we are rightly to understand the passage and this must include our connections, relations or associations and what we are in appearance as well as what we are in our minds.<a name=65:15></a> Circumcision is introduced in Joshua, after they had crossed the Jordan.<a name=65:16></a> The enormous number of those who died in the wilderness,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=69:8></a> Yes.<a name=69:9></a> The link is strong as to substantiality and personality of which we have been speaking, and bears on the assembly, because later in the chapter it says, "the body is of Christ" (verse 17), and then "not holding fast the head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God".<a name=69:10></a> The body is thus in mind in all this and what God effects in it; hence the importance of what has been said about substantiality.<a name=69:11></a> The assembly is formed of persons of which Christ could be Head, or is Head.<a name=69:12></a> That is, there is in that sense a correspondence between the Head and the body, but all in the sense of substantiality as over against chapter 1 where the word <i>bodily</i> is not found.<a name=69:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=69:16></a> Well, just so.<a name=69:17></a> The very existence of the body depends on Christ where He is, dead and risen and glorified.<a name=69:18></a> The assembly is out of Him, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:23">Genesis  2:23</a>.<a name=69:19></a> It says, "the body is of Christ".<a name=69:20></a> It is a substantial thought, it is composed of persons such as ourselves.<a name=69:21></a> That raises the question as to how we regard each other and what we are as in that position.<a name=69:22></a> It is the position or sphere in which the divine operations are being carried on, and hence the thoughts of circumcision and baptism that follow and the faith of the operation of God or the working of God.<a name=69:23></a> That is to say, He is operating on the principle of faith.<a name=69:24></a> It is not what we shall be by-and-by, but what we are <i>now</i>, as we are now in faith.<a name=69:25></a> God is operating in us on the principle of faith, because we are

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=70:8></a> Just so.<a name=70:9></a> You could hardly have a shadow without a substance.<a name=70:10></a> That shows the value of the saints, which we have already touched on.<a name=70:11></a> Peter in the beginning of Acts, with John, says to the lame man who was to be healed, "Look on us", that is on John and Peter.<a name=70:12></a> There was something there in those two persons, and that is really what is in mind in all that is being said as to substantiality in persons.<a name=70:13></a> We are to learn to look on each other and regard each other accordingly, because there is little or no value in dealing with the body, save in the sense that we are the persons themselves, at least we are of them.<a name=70:14></a> We are real persons in whom God is working, so that we are objects of affection to one another.<a name=70:15></a> That is what is in mind, and that is what this passage has in mind too; it is to bring out the reality of Christianity.<a name=70:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=70:21></a> Quite so.<a name=70:22></a> According to the last verse of chapter 1 God was working in Paul but now He is working in us and it is on the principle of faith: "through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead".<a name=70:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=71:4></a> Well, it all bears on the same thing.<a name=71:5></a> The joints and bands are not in the head, they are in a general way in the body.<a name=71:6></a> Although it is enlarged on a little more in Ephesians than it is here, it brings out the full idea of a body, of the human body, and that Christ has a body, only that He is divine, He is God in it.<a name=71:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=84:1></a> It is clear that the part of the chapter read involves the conclusion, in the apostle's mind, of the doctrinal part of the epistle.<a name=84:2></a> It therefore reverts back to chapter 2 especially, again recalling what we have had before us as to the crucial side of the subject and the place death has in these chapters.<a name=84:3></a> In chapter 3 (including what is said of it in chapter 2) the allusion is to baptism.<a name=84:4></a> It is, as it were, what each one of us has had our hand in, for baptism enters into Christianity as a public sign as over against the Passover or circumcision in Israel.<a name=84:5></a> Death is spoken of in the second chapter as the state we were in by nature.<a name=84:6></a> We were dead, in that sense; not exactly judicially, but as to our state.<a name=84:7></a> Then we have burial added, which baptism conveys, and also the thought of resurrection.<a name=84:8></a> Romans does not carry the thought of baptism as far as resurrection, but Colossians does.<a name=84:9></a> Paul in Colossians is aiming at the saints moving on to heavenly things in view of the service of God, and so it adds the thought of resurrection to the idea of baptism, evidently in order to complete the thought in view of the service of God.<a name=84:10></a> We can take the ground of being risen, although resurrection is not final, nor is it basic exactly, but it is in view of ascension.<a name=84:11></a> We cannot have Christianity, either in a public or private way, except on the ground of ascension.<a name=84:12></a> This chapter leads on to it and, especially in view of the Lord's supper, we are entitled to take the place of being risen; that is in the sense of being wholly free of the world.<a name=84:13></a> The idea of burial is that we are out of sight, but being raised is added, according to the twelfth verse of chapter 2.<a name=84:14></a> Then in verse 20 we have a hypothetical thought, which is a previous one to the one we have in chapter 3.<a name=84:15></a> It says, "If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=88:3></a> Well, both these things are true if you take the whole dispensation into account.<a name=88:4></a> He came personally to them after He rose.<a name=88:5></a> We are told He came personally and we see it in the first chapter of Acts.<a name=88:6></a> But then, as we have said, we see it in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>.<a name=88:7></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>would contemplate more the spiritual side.<a name=88:8></a> When it says, "I am coming to you", it is left open, and I think it would cover the whole dispensation right down to the present moment.<a name=88:9></a> I doubt the wisdom of bringing forward the corporeal side, because there is hardly anything in Scripture to indicate that anyone experienced the Lord's coming in this sense, although Paul said that He appeared to him, and even later in his service, the Lord actually stood by him and said, "Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#23:11">Acts  23:11</a>.<a name=88:10></a> But then in saying that, why should we not accept the liberty the Lord takes, in that sense, at any time, if He is pleased to do so?<a name=88:11></a> To say that we have not experienced it, will not be enough; it is a question of what liberty the Lord may take, for He is a divine Person.<a name=88:12></a>

		Now, in view of the time at our disposal, we must proceed to what follows.<a name=95:22></a> In the first verse of chapter 3, we have the sequential idea: "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above", the word <i>heaven</i> is not used there, it is <i>above</i>, "where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God: have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth; for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God".<a name=95:23></a> So that it is a question now of moving on; not exactly in the service of God, although that may come into it, but moving on in our souls, hence the thought of the word <i>seek</i>: "Seek the things which are above".<a name=95:24></a> In Colossians the tendency is to lead upwards.<a name=95:25></a> It is not a millennial thought; it is more than

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=98:4></a> Well, I think that is right.<a name=98:5></a> The word 'above' is in keeping with what we have often spoken of: "Jerusalem above, .<a name=98:6></a>.<a name=98:7></a>.<a name=98:8></a> which is our mother".<a name=98:9></a> It is the moral elevation she is in.<a name=98:10></a> The word used in ordinary worldly affairs means that some people are high up and the like.<a name=98:11></a> In the things of God we have the same idea, only this involves our having the Spirit, and the position that Christ has literally.<a name=98:12></a> Christ has literally gone above, He is above all principality and power; He has gone beyond all the heavens.<a name=98:13></a> The thought of above is greatly intensified when we think of Christ personally.<a name=98:14></a> Well, then, the thing is for us to apply the idea of being above to ourselves, and then to the assembly's position, because her position is to be the nearest to Deity of all the families.<a name=98:15></a> Thus we get, for instance, "the Spirit and the bride say, Come", which shows how near the bride or the assembly is to divine Persons, or to the Deity; how near her place is.<a name=98:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=107:19></a> I thought of that, in mentioning this side of the subject.<a name=107:20></a> So we have the expression, "I Paul", and also the way he would inform them of himself, as he says, "Tychicus .<a name=107:21></a>.<a name=107:22></a>.<a name=107:23></a> will make known to you all that concerns me".<a name=107:24></a> The leading servants are of prime importance in heaven, and although what is going on there is not visible to us, it is to be understood through our communion.<a name=107:25></a> He speaks in Romans of certain things by "the love of the Spirit", which is a real thing and enters into what we are saying.<a name=107:26></a> It is not only the love of the Father and the Son, but the love of the Spirit, and that would bear on what we are saying as to Paul.<a name=107:27></a> He enlarges on the same thing in Romans, as taking up the basic position, but here in Colossians it is the thought of finishing and binding up things, so that they should not hang loosely or give place to the devil.<a name=107:28></a> For instance, if the relations of a wife with her husband were estranged, the devil would easily get a footing, and talk would be spread abroad to disintegrate the whole position.<a name=107:29></a> We must therefore not

		J.T.<a name=123:1></a> It is thought well to call attention to the verses relating to headship at the beginning of the chapter, with a view to speaking of the Lord's supper.<a name=123:2></a> The local position is specially in mind in the epistle, although the universal thought is in mind too in the verse "If any one think to be contentious, <i>we</i> have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God".<a name=123:3></a> It implies that contention is likely to occur and to hinder the understanding of the truth.<a name=123:4></a> So it opens with "the assembly of God which is in Corinth", and then certain things are spoken of in an abstract way.<a name=123:5></a> The abstract thought should be in mind, in view of the concrete truth set out, specially as to the Lord's supper.<a name=123:6></a> Clearly the local position is stressed, and then all that goes with the local position from the divine side in an abstract way, as if everything was there from the divine side, and then the hortatory part begins in verse 10.<a name=123:7></a> It is as if the apostle were specially concerned to deal with local conditions, with what might appear among them to cause obstruction to the truth.<a name=123:8></a> So that the abstract thought is in mind, beginning at verse 4, "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge, (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,) so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you to the end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=123:9></a> God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=123:10></a> We are reminded, at the outset, that everything is there from the divine side in view of what might cause obstruction that might cause darkness.<a name=123:11></a> So that everything should be clear in relation to the great subjects to be treated of, specially the Lord's supper.<a name=123:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=124:12></a> It was needful that if any directions were given in regard of this great subject of headship they should be observed and not be treated lightly.<a name=124:13></a> Paul makes a point of the fact that they kept his directions, and then he goes on as to headship, "But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God".<a name=124:14></a> Clearly, if this important matter is to be understood, we have to discard contention.<a name=124:15></a> The Scriptures and the truth generally, are not to be understood through contention, but through subjection.<a name=124:16></a>

		In regard to what springs up, we have the idea of <i>making</i>, as seen in Matthew.<a name=153:12></a> The disciples, specially John and Peter, but the twelve generally, were to make disciples of all nations and it is thought that this should be understood, so that the idea of making disciples should be apprehended by us.<a name=153:13></a> It is mentioned in Acts, too, in connection with Paul, for it says "having made many disciples", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:21">Acts  14:21</a>.<a name=153:14></a> Then in the passage read in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4">Matthew  4</a>, the Lord says to Peter, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men".<a name=153:15></a> I think it will be obvious that the thought of believers being <i>made</i>, in the sense of disciples and fishers, is practical and concrete.<a name=153:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=155:8></a> Well, it was just to call attention to that fact.<a name=155:9></a> Christianity, as seen in the Acts, connects with what comes out of heaven, what comes down, but Matthew speaks of what was here.<a name=155:10></a> Hence he does not record the ascension of Christ, but has in mind that He is still here with us during the whole period until the end of the age.<a name=155:11></a>

		Of restoring the leper and its bearing on the restoration of a man or woman to fellowship, after they have forfeited it by their conduct.<a name=170:1></a> Chapter 14 gives us an account of that, and it is remarkable to note these things that are mentioned; especially the priest and how the anointing oil is poured into his hand and then put on the he ad of the cleansed leper, so that he is anointed.<a name=170:2></a> He is set up; as Galatians would say, he is restored.<a name=170:3></a> The word <i>restore</i>, according to the note, means <i>mending</i> him; setting him up again to function among the saints; that is what is meant.<a name=170:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=200:11></a> Very good.<a name=200:12></a> I would say that, because Luke writes to an individual, Theophilus; he does not write to a company, but in coming to his last chapter he gives an account of the Lord's visit to Emmaus, showing that He was concerned about two of them, which would suggest the assembly and its members.<a name=200:13></a> Mark says that they were going to the country, and that is not a suggestion for the assembly, for the country does not promote much as to the assembly.<a name=200:14></a> Cities, as such, do not either, but still cities are more concentrated positions in which God is pleased to set His assembly locally.<a name=200:15></a> So the first mention of it in Corinthians is, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=200:16></a> It is thus a local matter, and, I believe, Luke bears out the local matter, for we have the reference by him to the breaking of bread, being in the house, a local position.<a name=200:17></a> It was not in the assembly then, although Corinthians would show that it should be in the assembly today, but it was never in the temple.<a name=200:18></a> Other things are recognised in what Luke records as in the temple.<a name=200:19></a> It is linked up with the work of God at the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=214:1></a> The first verse of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>is clearly to call attention to what was there in Antioch.<a name=214:2></a> It is said, in verse 26 of chapter 11, "And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch".<a name=214:3></a> Thus the first verse of this chapter clearly contemplates what was there, as if to stress the idea of the local position; that is what God had now in Antioch.<a name=214:4></a> We have before us what God had at the time at Antioch and what He could use in a wide field, the Gentile field.<a name=214:5></a> Then, in verse 2, we have "As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.<a name=214:6></a> Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go.<a name=214:7></a> They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed away to Cyprus".<a name=214:8></a> The local position at Antioch was thus evidently taken on by God as a means of enlarging the field.<a name=214:9></a> The work was carried on from a centre such as Antioch, in which the principles of the assembly were maintained.<a name=214:10></a> The stress would be on what was <i>there</i> in Antioch; the <i>assembly</i> was there.<a name=214:11></a> Clearly there was no obstruction at all, so that the Spirit had liberty to move; and so He said, "Separate me now .<a name=214:12></a>.<a name=214:13></a>.<a name=214:14></a> for the work to which I have called them".<a name=214:15></a> Then He is free to send them forth, and they go forth, with great results.<a name=214:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=215:8></a> That is just what I was thinking, in connection with what has been remarked on chapter 11.<a name=215:9></a> There is, of course, what had intervened as given in chapter 12; what the enemy was doing, among other things, and how God met that.<a name=215:10></a> The field is thus clear for the divine service.<a name=215:11></a> It says, "Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was there".<a name=215:12></a> The reference being to the actual position of the assembly which was <i>there</i>.<a name=215:13></a> Then to augment all that we have the prophets and teachers whose names are given, and then it says, "As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said .<a name=215:14></a>.<a name=215:15></a>.<a name=215:16></a>" Everything is ready, there, under the Lord, for the great work undertaken now; the wide field or scope of service which had in mind the ingathering of the Gentiles.<a name=215:17></a> The prophets and teachers would be ready, as there, to maintain the position that had been reached, which is a great matter.<a name=215:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=239:10></a> I think that is good.<a name=239:11></a> So if we use the term 'the Father of the age'; it says "The everlasting Father" in the Authorised Version, but literally it is 'the Father of the age', undoubtedly it is the age called the millennial age that is in mind.<a name=239:12></a> He is to be a Father, not in the sense of a father to his family, or to his son, but rather in the sense of care, which flows from wisdom and experience.<a name=239:13></a> Christ will exercise authority in that sense.<a name=239:14></a> It was well used in America many years ago; Washington was said to be <i>the father of his country</i>.<a name=239:15></a> God says, that Eliakim "shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#22:21">Isaiah  22:21</a>.<a name=239:16></a> The youth are to be brought up among us, and the brethren have great advantage in that they have this light from God as regards their children, starting from the very outset; the Holy Spirit being here in this particular age that we speak of as Christianity.<a name=239:17></a> The children of believing parents are even said to be holy, they have that advantage.<a name=239:18></a> All the instructions to the children of believing parents ought to be based on that light, taking advantage of what there is, what God is pleased to give us to use.<a name=239:19></a> What a word He gives us in saying, that our children are holy!<a name=239:20></a> The Lord Jesus was a Child.<a name=239:21></a> Speaking reverently, He was a Babe

		J.T.<a name=252:1></a> The thought of the children of God is in mind, especially as referred to in the gospel of John.<a name=252:2></a> The spirit of the gospel of John is the spirit of grace.<a name=252:3></a> The passages read are put together in order to bring out these two things; that is, the children of God and then grace.<a name=252:4></a> Grace is seen in the first chapter, and it says, "of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace.<a name=252:5></a> For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ".<a name=252:6></a> Then, in the last chapter, the principle of the gospel is worked out in grace in the persons who were going astray.<a name=252:7></a> Clearly they were persons who had the Lord in their hearts, for the work of God had already taken effect in them, yet, for the moment, they were like the two going to Emmaus, they were on the wrong way.<a name=252:8></a> The Lord does not deal with them on the principle of law, but on the principle of grace.<a name=252:9></a> He does not say one word in the way of reproof to the seven who had gone fishing.<a name=252:10></a> That is in keeping with the first chapter, where we not only have grace set up in Christ, but grace received too, "of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace".<a name=252:11></a> What has therefore been received, in that sense, ought to be intelligible to us.<a name=252:12></a> We ought to be able to speak of it freely as received.<a name=252:13></a> It follows the thought of the children of God formally, as the passage states, "He came to his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God".<a name=252:14></a> The brethren will be aware that the thought of the children of God is more peculiar to John than to any of the gospels.<a name=252:15></a> Paul deals with it too, but John never mentions sons, except in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>.<a name=252:16></a> John thus refers to us as in our place down here; we are

		J.T.<a name=255:8></a> What I was saying as to Galatians, I think, is helpful and should be kept in mind.<a name=255:9></a> Galatians treats the idea of sonship by itself, before the actual Spirit of sonship is viewed as in conjunction with it.<a name=255:10></a> Perhaps the brethren might do well to examine that a little more.<a name=255:11></a> The light is treated substantially, in order to bring out the truth, and that makes way for "a spirit of adoption [or sonship] whereby we cry, Abba, Father".<a name=255:12></a> But sonship is treated by itself.<a name=255:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=273:1></a> The thought of the mount of Olives in relation to the Lord's supper is in mind.<a name=273:2></a> The singing of the hymn after the Lord's supper is mentioned in Matthew and Mark, but it is not mentioned in Luke.<a name=273:3></a> It would appear that it is intended to affect us as to the Lord's supper and lift our minds out of any suggestion of its entering into the position of the remnant of Israel after the assembly's period is over.<a name=273:4></a> The link with Olivet would take the Lord's supper out of the realm of the millennium, especially as <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>also mentions Olivet.<a name=273:5></a> It is connected with the resurrection here, and also lifts the resurrection out of the Jewish settings, and places it in spiritual settings; that is the bearing of the mount of Olives.<a name=273:6></a> Added to that is the <i>upper room</i> which also takes both the Lord's supper and the Lord's resurrection out of Jewish settings in the book of Acts.<a name=273:7></a> In the gospel of Luke it is in a Jewish setting, for the Lord took them out only as far as to Bethany.<a name=273:8></a> It was not to Olivet.<a name=273:9></a> Bethany was the place of Mary and Martha, but it was still Jewish; it was the place of love, but in connection with Judaism, and the disciples are seen returning from there to the temple.<a name=273:10></a> It says in the end of Luke, "<i>they</i> .<a name=273:11></a>.<a name=273:12></a>.<a name=273:13></a> returned to Jerusalem .<a name=273:14></a>.<a name=273:15></a>.<a name=273:16></a> and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:52">Luke  24:52</a>, 53.<a name=273:17></a> But Acts would show that those who saw the ascension returned to Jerusalem from the mount of Olives.<a name=273:18></a> There are certain incidents, recorded in the synoptic gospels, in connection with the Lord's supper that might well be connected with what we are saying.<a name=273:19></a> In each of the synoptic gospels the Lord, as reaching the place for the institution of the Lord's supper, had the twelve with Him, and that fact is intimately related with what is in mind in these passages.<a name=273:20></a> The Lord suggests in having twelve that there would be full administrative ability as the

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=275:13></a> You will notice that there was a hymn, and the idea of a hymn is also connected with the Lord's own ministry, the Lord's own service to God, for in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a> we have the idea of hymning the Father.<a name=275:14></a> The instances in Matthew and Mark as to Olivet are to bring out the link with heaven, and also that it was not simply that the Lord sang the hymn, but in Matthew and Mark it was a matter for them all.<a name=275:15></a> The Lord would thus impart the thought of mutual feeling in that connection.<a name=275:16></a> If therefore we connect Olivet with the hymn, there is the idea of mutual feeling as well as the heavenly setting which is very important in regard of all that enters into the Lord's supper now.<a name=275:17></a>

		THE SUPREMACY OF GOD

		It is in mind, dear brethren, to speak about supremacy, and it need not be added that supremacy must be in God, whether He be viewed by Himself, or viewed as in Christ, or viewed as in the Spirit, in us.<a name=292:1></a> Supremacy must be in God.<a name=292:2></a> Hence I have chosen John for my address tonight because he, alone of the evangelists, presents us with God at the outset of his great work.<a name=292:3></a> Matthew has his own point of view, Mark has his, and Luke also, but John begins with God, as indeed does Moses, so that the writings of Moses and the writings of John are closely related.<a name=292:4></a> Moses, by the Spirit, speaks of God almost immediately, and it is not God as He might have been apprehended as having to say to the chaotic condition that had come about, but God as in the beginning, before the chaos.<a name=292:5></a> He presents Him in a word that is plural; that is, Elohim; that is his first reference to God.<a name=292:6></a> Now that is not a commonplace matter, it is an important matter as, no doubt, most of us know.<a name=292:7></a> The intent of Moses is to bring God to the mind immediately, in the narrative; "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=292:8></a> It was intended that God should be impressed on the mind immediately.<a name=292:9></a> He would undertake to offset the chaotic condition that had come in and to make a new world, and the Lord Jesus is pleased to call that the beginning.<a name=292:10></a> It is great enough to be a beginning.<a name=292:11></a> So the Lord speaks of certain things, such as marriage, and refers to <i>the beginning</i>.<a name=292:12></a> He says of men's doings, that "from the beginning it was not so".<a name=292:13></a> Many things are happening, dear brethren, that are not according to the beginning.<a name=292:14></a> Hence, as Christians, it is obvious that we all should be concerned about the beginning.<a name=292:15></a> God was in the beginning; and what was not at the beginning must be disregarded.<a name=292:16></a> God should thus have His place in our minds and in our hearts.<a name=292:17></a> Hence the place that God has, as I said, immediately,

		<a name=293>[Page 293]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for as Moses began to write, it was to call attention to God and that by the use of the plural name.<a name=293:1></a> He would impress us with the supremacy of what the plural name implies, so that our minds should be accustomed to the fact that God is supreme.<a name=293:2></a> Supremacy sometimes is now indeed handed down to kings, those that are in authority, but it belongs to God, <i>power belongs to God</i>.<a name=293:3></a> That is why, as I said, I have selected John's writings, because they bring in God.<a name=293:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first passage I read begins with this, "that if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart".<a name=293:5></a> Well, you might say, That is not very much to say.<a name=293:6></a> Nevertheless, God is concerned that each of us should know, that He is greater than our hearts and knows all things.<a name=293:7></a> There is so much to baffle us, dear brethren, and to distress us, that it is a great matter to be assured that God is greater than our hearts and knows all things, It is John that comes in and tells us that "In the beginning was the Word", but he does not stop there, he would bring in the thought of God in the beginning, and so he adds, "and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=293:8></a> It is John's God, so to speak, that I have in my mind, and how He would ingratiate Himself with us, so that our hearts should not overwhelm us.<a name=293:9></a> There is so much that is happening to deter the brethren, hence the importance of having God in our hearts and knowing that He is supreme.<a name=293:10></a> He is supreme in Himself, but then the point for each of us is to be assured that He is supreme in each of <i>us</i>, in our hearts, and that He is greater than these.<a name=293:11></a> I have ventured to say all that in a prefatory way, so that the dear brethren might have the thought of God before them.<a name=293:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to proceed, in the epistle of John we get instruction as to our Lord Jesus Christ, and especially as to eternal life, the thought of which runs parallel with what I have been saying, and when we come to comparisons, what life is of any value at all except eternal life?<a name=293:13></a> The Lord Jesus is "the true God and eternal life".<a name=293:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=294>[Page 294]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These words are remarkable and are intended to assure our hearts as to eternal life, that there is a life worth speaking about, a life worth preaching about, and we are to lay hold of it, for it is within our reach.<a name=294:1></a> We should have it in the sense of enjoyment and support, and understand the greatness of God as bringing it in.<a name=294:2></a> As I said, it is John's God I am thinking of.<a name=294:3></a> You will understand the form of my speaking, when I say John's God; there is only one God, but, at the same time, John has a way of presenting God that is unique.<a name=294:4></a> His presentation of the truth of God runs down to the end of this dispensation; he is concerned about <i>this</i> dispensation.<a name=294:5></a> He is reserved by the Lord for specific purposes, the Lord having in mind that his ministry and what he represents is to be available at any time.<a name=294:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I speak of John's God, because John traces the blessed and great and glorious subject of God as supreme, and he traces Him in Christ.<a name=294:7></a> He begins with the Lord Jesus, not exactly as in the Deity, though of course He is always God, He is never other than that personally, but He traces Him as the Word.<a name=294:8></a> John begins with that.<a name=294:9></a> "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=294:10></a> It is the <i>logos</i>, that is to say, One who can tell us about God, and He tells us that He is Himself God.<a name=294:11></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God .<a name=294:12></a>.<a name=294:13></a>.<a name=294:14></a> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made".<a name=294:15></a> The Lord Jesus is thus seen by John as a Man down here, under the title of <i>the Word</i>.<a name=294:16></a> He is One who can tell us all things; that is the scriptural thought.<a name=294:17></a> The woman of Samaria had it in her mind when she said, "when he is come, he will tell us all things".<a name=294:18></a> So it is that John would instruct us from the very roots of divine things, from the very basis of the knowledge of God.<a name=294:19></a> As reserved by the Lord, it is John's line of things, the work that He intended him to do in relation to the whole dispensation in which we are.<a name=294:20></a> I am speaking in a way to encourage young people to follow, and get instruction about God,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for the One who knows about Him is the Word; that is to say, Christ in incarnation is the Word.<a name=295:1></a> Therefore, if we want to know, we want to consult the Word, John tells us that the Son of God "has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=295:2></a> He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=295:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question now is understanding, and I have ventured to select John because he is peculiarly intended to present the spiritual side of things to us.<a name=295:4></a> He touches on physical things, of course, and especially <i>the expanse</i> in which God operates.<a name=295:5></a> The expanse is the place of divine operations, and also Satan's alas, for Satan has got into it, and he is not failing to do what he can.<a name=295:6></a> The sphere is wide, involving good and evil, but, at the same time, God is carrying on in spite of the evil and overcoming the evil, for He is supreme in regard of the evil.<a name=295:7></a> John would say to us therefore that there is nothing to fear; even as the Lord said to John, "Fear not".<a name=295:8></a> Such a word is needed in view of what is in the expanse, which God Himself calls Heavens.<a name=295:9></a> It has a wide significance, and a wide bearing, and touches us at every point, but God is supreme in it.<a name=295:10></a> Satan is not supreme in it.<a name=295:11></a> John's line of thought, and his way of thinking and speaking, has in view that both old and young should be assured as to the fact that God is supreme.<a name=295:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing is as regards our hearts.<a name=295:13></a> There is a considerable difference between the mind and the heart, and God addresses us first through the mind.<a name=295:14></a> It is a faculty that is given us for discernment, for distinguishing between things that differ.<a name=295:15></a> It is so that we should know Him, know Him objectively, if I may use a common word.<a name=295:16></a> It is a well used word, yet, at the same time, a word we can hardly do without, for we have to begin learning objectively.<a name=295:17></a> That is how I get on myself, if you will allow me to speak of myself.<a name=295:18></a> I always find relief in looking at things objectively.<a name=295:19></a> If things seem to discourage, and they are not wanting in discouragement,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for as you rise in the morning the enemy will not fail to bring forward something to discourage, but the way to meet him is with objective truth, and the greatest objective truth is God, that God <i>is</i>, not has been simply or will be, but <i>He is</i>.<a name=296:1></a> That is one of the greatest facts knowable, and a fact that every heart should be acquainted with, and acquainted with constantly, that <i>God is</i>.<a name=296:2></a> We have the thought in the Scriptures of God known historically, what He has been and then the prophetic thought of God, what He will be, but then there is God Himself, what He is in the present -- <i>Himself</i>.<a name=296:3></a> He surrounds Himself with Himself.<a name=296:4></a> I trust you will understand what I mean.<a name=296:5></a> He dwells in light unapproachable, but as made known, He is approachable.<a name=296:6></a> So that as you approach you gradually get nearer and nearer, and more at home, and more comfortable, more happy, and you are more assured that it is God.<a name=296:7></a> He would Himself come into the environment in which we are, so as to assure us and make us steadfast.<a name=296:8></a> Therefore, John says, "If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things".<a name=296:9></a> That is one of the most assuring things we can speak of, that not only is He greater than our hearts, but that He knows all things.<a name=296:10></a> Well, that would mean, that if the discouragement comes, God would introduce some further knowledge of Himself to encourage us.<a name=296:11></a> He surely has more pleasure in <i>en</i>couraging than <i>dis</i>couraging.<a name=296:12></a> <i>He</i> will not discourage; He will encourage.<a name=296:13></a> If there be discouragement, and it comes into our weak hearts, well, God would put Himself in there.<a name=296:14></a> He would put Himself in, so as to surround our hearts and give us encouragement and tell us, in the encouragement, that He is greater than our hearts, even if there be something to condemn in our hearts.<a name=296:15></a> It is not that God condemns us, but our heart condemns us, for it may do so, if there be something to condemn.<a name=296:16></a> If we are upright, and there is something wrong, the condemnation will come, but God would say, Well, let it be so, I know all about

		that.<a name=297:1></a> He knows all negative things as well as positive things.<a name=297:2></a> Whatever they be, if indeed they are to be condemned, well, God says, I know all about that, and He condescends to measure Himself with the condemnation that may be in our hearts, and to assure us that He is greater than the condemnation, whatever it be.<a name=297:3></a> It is the God we have known, beloved, the God who is known in Jesus, the God about whom the Word has told us.<a name=297:4></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God", notice that the Word was <i>with</i> God.<a name=297:5></a> There is companionship there between the divine Beings, that is to say, there is liberty and love between Them, there is a community of thought, happy, holy community of thought, so that the word <i>with</i> can be used, and it says "the Word was with God", before it says that "the Word was God".<a name=297:6></a> We learn thus that there is companionship between Them, and then the great and glorious fact that the Word Himself is God.<a name=297:7></a> The Word, whom we know, the Jesus whom we know, whom we know in redemption, whom we know in the forgiveness of our sins, the Jesus who died for us, is the very Same.<a name=297:8></a> He is the Word who knows all about God, and He is with God, and then, great and glorious fact, He is God Himself.<a name=297:9></a> This is all, dear brethren, beyond our power to elucidate.<a name=297:10></a> We may as well say, I do not know; but I <i>do</i> know that the Word is precious to my heart.<a name=297:11></a> He has told me things; He has instructed me; He has given me an understanding, and I know Him that is true, and I know who He is.<a name=297:12></a> Then John says further, "He is the true God and eternal life", that is to say, He has brought about the great fact of eternal life, a life we are to enjoy for ever and for ever.<a name=297:13></a> Well then, there is every reason to be encouraged.<a name=297:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So this third chapter brings out the thought of God in His supremacy, and then the Spirit in the same chapter, as John says, "Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us".<a name=297:15></a> This shows that the Spirit is here in a subjective way, for He is on our side as an Instructor, and He is supreme as come down

		here, as near us, as with us, and He is ready to assure us, and so John says, "Hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given to us".<a name=298:1></a> God has given us the Spirit; it is not simply that He is a divine Person here, but He is a gift: "the Spirit which he has given to us".<a name=298:2></a> This raises the question, dear brethren, as to the possession of the Spirit, and how it comes in and links on with what I am saying as to supremacy.<a name=298:3></a> The Spirit is supreme, and He is supreme in the position He has taken up, and, in that supremacy, He teaches us.<a name=298:4></a> We thus know things, and know we are in Him, that is, in Christ or in God.<a name=298:5></a> It is not in the ordinary sense of knowledge or science, but by the Spirit which He has given us.<a name=298:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to go on to chapter 4, we see how the Spirit is greater as in <i>us</i>, as it says in verse 4: "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world".<a name=298:7></a> That is to say He is greater <i>as in us</i>, not as in heaven.<a name=298:8></a> John is not speaking of a divine Person as in the Deity, but the Holy Spirit <i>as in us</i>; the Spirit as in us here below; that is, in us as we are here tonight.<a name=298:9></a> If it be we go out into the street, or we are in our businesses, or in our households, the Spirit is in us, and He is greater in us than he that is in the world.<a name=298:10></a> Now these are great facts; whether it be he that is in the world in the political sense, or in the industrial sense, or in the social sense, or in the religious sense, the Spirit is greater in the saints.<a name=298:11></a> He is greater in you and in me than he that is in the world, so that we are not to be overcome.<a name=298:12></a> God is saying to us in this that we are not overcomable.<a name=298:13></a> We do not need to be overcome because of who is in us.<a name=298:14></a> However you look at it, "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world", and He that is in us is the Holy Spirit.<a name=298:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as I was saying from chapter 3, the Holy Spirit tells us that we are in Christ.<a name=298:16></a> Sometimes in John's writings we can hardly discern whether he is speaking of Christ or of God, for his use of pronouns is unique.<a name=298:17></a> In presenting the truth, John makes so much

		of the divine Persons, without repeating their names formally, but using pronouns.<a name=299:1></a> To follow the thought in mind, if it be the Holy Spirit in the Christian, He is greater in the Christian that what is in the greatest man of the world, and there are great men, of course.<a name=299:2></a> Although there are few kings, few royal people, yet the greatness of man still remains, for man knows how to hold it.<a name=299:3></a> When men are set up as rulers, they know how to hold fast what they have in that sense; they know how to make the most of their supposed dignity; but alas, that only gives room to the devil, and the more they make of their greatness, the more they make of the enemy.<a name=299:4></a> But then the Christian is told that "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world".<a name=299:5></a> Be they who they may, the Spirit in the Christian, not simply the Spirit Himself, or in heaven, but in the Christian, is greater than he that is in the world.<a name=299:6></a> Well, these are very important facts.<a name=299:7></a> How we may lift up our heads and exult in the thought of what we are made in the presence of the Holy Spirit which is given to us!<a name=299:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying, in chapter 3, John is speaking of God, God Himself in His infinite supremacy, and how the knowledge of that affects us.<a name=299:9></a> God is making so much of our hearts, the Christian heart, and that He is greater than it, even if there is something to be condemned.<a name=299:10></a> Then He is greater, as I have been saying, in chapter 4; and now, in chapter 5, He is greater because He is the true God.<a name=299:11></a> The word <i>true</i> is added there.<a name=299:12></a> Paul says, "There are gods many, and lords many, yet to us there is one God, the Father", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:5">1 Corinthians  8:5</a>, 6.<a name=299:13></a> John says, "He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=299:14></a> In the Person who is the Word, we have One who instructs us as regards everything and assures us and gives us an understanding, and that is why I alluded to the mind of the Christian, because of the need of instruction.<a name=299:15></a> The Lord's supper is for the mind, as well as the heart.<a name=299:16></a> The first thought of it is in regard of the mind of the Christian.<a name=299:17></a> It is 'for the calling of me to mind', says the Lord

		I have in mind to speak about light, the first great element that God spoke of and brought forth in creation as we know it.<a name=304:1></a> According to what I read, the apostle Paul says, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=304:2></a> The idea of light is thus plainly before us in the scriptures read, and it is urgently hoped that each here may be concerned about it, and about what is said in Matthew in the verse read, "if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light", or, as we might say, luminous.<a name=304:3></a> This brings out the importance of the believer's body, and leads to the truth of the assembly, in which all believers have part, and, in order to have part in it, we must be luminous.<a name=304:4></a> Each one is to be luminous, each is to be light.<a name=304:5></a> Light is of very great importance, as its place in the order of the present creation shows.<a name=304:6></a> God commanded that light should shine out of darkness, and it did shine; that was on the first day, and besides that we have the further statement that the light was called Day.<a name=304:7></a> Later we have two lights set in the firmament of the heavens, or the expanse, and they were to govern, they were to rule; but this is not said on the first day.<a name=304:8></a> What is said of it on the first day is that "God called the light Day".<a name=304:9></a> God thus divided the light from the darkness; but on the fourth day we have the two luminaries set in the expanse, the greater and the lesser luminary, and they are said to <i>rule</i>.<a name=304:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I am saying this especially at the outset, because of what I have in mind to bring out.<a name=304:11></a> "God is light", but we are not luminous if our bodies are not light, and if we do not value the light that is available to us, then we shall not belong to <i>the ruling class</i>.<a name=304:12></a> The ruling class of

		Referring again to what I have already said, there is great importance in the matter of light, and that it should affect our bodies, not simply our heads; "thy whole body will be light".<a name=306:3></a> Now that bears on what has often been remarked, that the saints as the temple of God are viewed as growing.<a name=306:4></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>shows that it is not yet final, for we are, as it were, in the making.<a name=306:5></a> The epistle to the Colossians points out that very thing, for there it is a question, not of what <i>has</i> been done, but of what is being done.<a name=306:6></a> It is a question of the working of God, and of faith in it too, for what is currently done by God is on the principle of faith.<a name=306:7></a> If we are to come into the light that I have spoken of, and rule, then the thing is to be active in getting all that we can.<a name=306:8></a> Many have made long and expensive journeys to come to these meetings.<a name=306:9></a> They have braved the difficulties and they have come; carried safely, thank God, for we have heard of no losses in that sense, and we thank God for it.<a name=306:10></a> The enemy would cause losses, for he hates the brethren; those who are the brethren of Christ.<a name=306:11></a> "One is your Master", says the Lord Himself indeed, "and all <i>ye</i> are brethren", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:8">Matthew  23:8</a>.<a name=306:12></a> The devil hates Christ and he hates His brethren, and would damage them; but then, as I said, the work is proceeding.<a name=306:13></a> We are all here tonight, I suppose, certainly the one who is speaking, having in mind to give a little light or to freshen the minds of the brethren as to this matter of illumination, or radiancy, as seen in the heavenly lights.<a name=306:14></a> They are set in the expanse which God called Heavens.<a name=306:15></a> The expanse was something added by God in order to effect His thoughts at the present time, so that presently it will be said, "What has God wrought!<a name=306:16></a>".<a name=306:17></a> God would say to us, as it were, 'Well, you have been in what I have wrought'.<a name=306:18></a> Paul makes much of it; that he was in it there is no doubt; he says that he laboured more abundantly than all.<a name=306:19></a> He was in it in the greatest way as an individual.<a name=306:20></a>

		Now I come back again to what I have already said, that unless we take account of all this and go in for it, we shall not become the ruling class.<a name=307:1></a> It is not that we wish to be that now, but presently.<a name=307:2></a> Paul says that the building, which in the coming day will be a holy temple in the Lord, is growing, and when it is completed it will be seen above.<a name=307:3></a> The holy city Jerusalem will come down from God, from above; it is the assembly.<a name=307:4></a> Let us not forget that, and that it refers to ourselves.<a name=307:5></a> The Lord would impress upon us what we are, and that it is the time of growing and acquiring things, in view of being what we should be.<a name=307:6></a> It is the time of putting on everything needed, and putting off everything that should be put off, everything that would dim the light in us.<a name=307:7></a> Paul speaks of the saints as the temple of God, and stresses that it is holy.<a name=307:8></a> The word is, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God?<a name=307:9></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>.<a name=307:10></a> It was said to the Corinthians, "ye are the temple of God, and .<a name=307:11></a>.<a name=307:12></a>.<a name=307:13></a> the Spirit of God dwells in you".<a name=307:14></a> But then Ephesians, which is, you might say, the supreme epistle for the truth of Christianity, for it deals with the truth as the truth, tells us that the assembly increases to a holy temple in the Lord.<a name=307:15></a> It is not that yet exactly; in that sense it is not completed.<a name=307:16></a> Paul uses the word <i>complete</i>, and in writing to the Colossians says it was given to him "to complete the word of God".<a name=307:17></a> He has in mind here in Ephesians that we should understand that the assembly is not yet completed; it is being continually added to.<a name=307:18></a> The adding began at the first day of the Holy Spirit coming down.<a name=307:19></a> What a day it was!<a name=307:20></a> And what a day it is, because it remains in its effect.<a name=307:21></a> It says, "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved".<a name=307:22></a> There were three thousand of them on the first day, as if God would say to us, That is what I can do.<a name=307:23></a> But then how much more can He do?<a name=307:24></a> It remains for the future day to disclose all, when things are revealed or manifested; we shall then see the wonderful thing that is going on.<a name=307:25></a> The wonderful thing that began on that day, which we

		Now I did not intend to be prophetic simply, but only to try and bring out this great matter of light.<a name=310:2></a> We ought to be alive to it and understand that there is to be a governing class, and that that governing class is the assembly.<a name=310:3></a> Let men say what they may, or do what they may, or aspire to what they may, all is in the hands of God.<a name=310:4></a> It is only a moment and God can change everything, and bring in His thoughts and make them perfect, and that is what we are to be aiming at, dear brethren.<a name=310:5></a> These meetings are for that very purpose, and we have come here, and it has cost us money to come, and it has involved travel, and care, and so forth.<a name=310:6></a> The thing is to <i>get</i> something, because the greatest things are obtainable, because the Holy Spirit is here in everyone who is a Christian.<a name=310:7></a> It is for us to take advantage of the moment and get things, and what we need to get, particularly, is light.<a name=310:8></a> "If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light".<a name=310:9></a> What a great fact!<a name=310:10></a>

		The passages in 2 Corinthians and in Ephesians bring out how Paul was the example of all this.<a name=310:11></a> Like Moses, who had the pattern of things, Paul has, you might say, the pattern of things from the heavens, and things are made according to pattern.<a name=310:12></a> They are made with exactness, and hence, if we are to deal with them, or if we work at them, we must be exact.<a name=310:13></a> We must be like those who built the tabernacle; they were full of wisdom, God filled them with it, and God is filling us with wisdom.<a name=310:14></a> "The spirit of wisdom and revelation", as expressed in Ephesians, is a great thought.<a name=310:15></a> Why not be marked by "the spirit of wisdom and revelation"?<a name=310:16></a> because these things are obtainable and the Holy Spirit Himself is here to invest us with them.<a name=310:17></a> So Paul himself

	<div class="paragraph">
		So in the first passage read in 2 Corinthians, the first of Genesis is quoted by the apostle Paul.<a name=311:3></a> I read it on that account for it serves at this time to show what I am speaking of.<a name=311:4></a> It shows that a person like ourselves, a man of like passions as ourselves, was taken up by the Lord to effect what is said, the things that we have spoken of So he says of himself in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:5">2 Corinthians  4:5</a>, "We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.<a name=311:5></a> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=311:6></a> And then he adds a remark, which shows how human he was, not human in the ordinary sense of the word, but what he calls an earthen vessel; that could never be said of Christ, but it is said of Paul: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us".<a name=311:7></a> We thus see where we are, however feeble in our speech, or in our affections, or in our minds, whatever we are doing, we want the excellency of the power to be of God and not of us.<a name=311:8></a> Whatever we are doing, we are doing it as earthen vessels, we are nothing more, we must not assume to be anything more than that.<a name=311:9></a> I mean to say, we are not divine.<a name=311:10></a> I am speaking of Paul, even as of ourselves, in this sense, for he was just an earthen vessel as we are.<a name=311:11></a> Although converted and recipients of the Holy Spirit and indeed the Holy Spirit indwelling us, we are yet earthen vessels.<a name=311:12></a> God is pleased to use us in spite of the fact that we are but earthen vessels.<a name=311:13></a> It is a humiliating thing, in a certain way, but then it is God's way, and we must not assume to be anything more than that.<a name=311:14></a> We

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul is the pattern, and I speak of him in this light because it is very important to have a pattern.<a name=312:2></a> Moses had a pattern and Israel had it, and it is God's way of bringing out things.<a name=312:3></a> Really, in a way, we must say that Paul is not exactly the pattern, for Christ is the pattern; it is Himself.<a name=312:4></a> So Paul speaks about Christ here, "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=312:5></a> What a thought!<a name=312:6></a> He says, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost".<a name=312:7></a> What a terrible thing to be lost!<a name=312:8></a> I hope there is not one in this audience that is lost.<a name=312:9></a> I do not believe there is.<a name=312:10></a> We belong to the saved, we belong to the redeemed.<a name=312:11></a> So Paul says, "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost".<a name=312:12></a> What an awful thing that there is such a class as the lost!<a name=312:13></a> There is no hope of them, no hope of them eternally.<a name=312:14></a> It is well to keep that in mind, and to be sober about it.<a name=312:15></a> There is much that could be said about it, but I just touch on it, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost".<a name=312:16></a> It is because Satan, "the god of this world", has blinded their eyes.<a name=312:17></a> We have already been speaking of him and his machinations against God and against Christ, and we have been speaking of the expanse as the area of it and how Satan gets in.<a name=312:18></a> We have thus to be on the watch as to him.<a name=312:19></a> "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost".<a name=312:20></a> If there are such, it is because the god of this world has blinded their eyes so that the light should not shine for them.<a name=312:21></a> It shines, but it does not shine <i>for them</i>.<a name=312:22></a> The sun shines, and we may say it shines on everybody, and, in a way, it does, for the Christ comes in and shines on everybody.<a name=312:23></a> But then there is what Satan is doing, terrible thought, for he blinds the eyes of the unbelieving, "that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ .<a name=312:24></a>.<a name=312:25></a>.<a name=312:26></a> should not shine forth for them".<a name=312:27></a> There is no hope of them.<a name=312:28></a>

		Then the next thing is, as I remarked, "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=313:13></a> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us".<a name=313:14></a> No servant is thinking of himself; if he is, he is not fit to serve.<a name=313:15></a> It is a question of God, as Paul said, "that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us".<a name=313:16></a> Paul tells us that there was a messenger sent from Satan to buffet him, and he besought the Lord three times that it might be removed.<a name=313:17></a> It must have been a most excruciating experience to have such a thing; a thorn for the flesh, a messenger from Satan in order that Paul might not be exalted above measure, that is what <i>he</i> says.<a name=313:18></a> But then

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I read that passage in the epistle to the Ephesians just to bring out simply that the assembly, as a whole, is the great illuminating vessel.<a name=314:15></a> That is what it is going to be, but it is already, as the passage I have read says, "of which I am become minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me, according

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what I want us to have before our minds distinctly, to see that the assembly has this place.<a name=315:3></a> It has it today and will have it millennially and eternally.<a name=315:4></a> I mean to say, its distinctive place will remain and Paul is the minister of it.<a name=315:5></a> He is stressing that here, and I brought it in, so that we might all see that it is available to us.<a name=315:6></a> Paul being like ourselves, presents the light of the mystery, even his knowledge of it, so that the youngest of us may aspire to the understanding of it.<a name=315:7></a> Matthew says, "If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light".<a name=315:8></a> It is a question of the whole body of the believer; it is not simply your mind or your head, but the whole body.<a name=315:9></a> We have already spoken of the thought of the whole body, that it is a substantial thought, so that, not merely the mind, but the actual physical body of the believer is to be full of light; indeed, it is to be light, to be luminous.<a name=315:10></a>

		In closing, it is in mind just to show briefly that the fourth day in creation, as we have it, brings out the two luminaries that I spoke of, and that one is a governing body.<a name=315:11></a> Really, it is typically Christ in heaven.<a name=315:12></a> It is Christ, of course, in the sense in which we can speak of Him in relation to the testimony of God, for it is a question of the testimony of God.<a name=315:13></a> Although Christ is in heaven, He is there in relation to the testimony of God and He is active there.<a name=315:14></a> If He wishes to come down to earth, why not?<a name=315:15></a> He is a divine Person, and He can do

		No doubt most of us remember the other facts relative to Caleb and his daughter Achsah and how Othniel and she contribute to the thought of Christ and the assembly, is a subject which has become pronounced especially in recent times.<a name=318:7></a> According to <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#15">Joshua  15</a>, Achsah, Caleb's daughter, asked him for the upper and the nether springs.<a name=318:8></a> These springs must be linked up with what is called "the expanse" in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, for there the upper waters were separated from the lower waters.<a name=318:9></a> The Spirit of God would use these facts so as to link up with them what Achsah said to her father.<a name=318:10></a> She, in type, represents the assembly, and therefore she has a right thought in alluding to springs above and springs below.<a name=318:11></a> In alluding to her in this way I thus have in mind to enlarge on the thought of Caleb.<a name=318:12></a> He was a household man, such as the Lord speaks of: "every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:52">Matthew  13:52</a>.<a name=318:13></a> Caleb was a householder, and this fact enhances his history,

		and then he was kept alive in view of coming into God's promises.<a name=319:1></a> <i>We</i> are now, beloved, the children of promise, as Paul says in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:28">Galatians  4:28</a>.<a name=319:2></a> It is a matter of importance that we should think of the promises, and, above all now, of the Lord's promises to Philadelphia.<a name=319:3></a> He said, "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>.<a name=319:4></a> There is a terrible period coming to try those who are earth-dwellers.<a name=319:5></a> It is a matter of supreme importance, that we should <i>not</i> be earth-dwellers, but that in so far as we can, we may have part in heaven-dwelling, and what we have here today is the nearest approach to that; for we are dwelling together in nearness to heaven.<a name=319:6></a> The "expanse" clearly indicates the great sphere of divine operations.<a name=319:7></a> God is operating, and all is through Christ, the great Operator, and in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=319:8></a>

		Now, it is important that we should be alive, kept alive by God in accord with His promises, whatever they may be.<a name=319:9></a> So Caleb has come into one's mind as peculiarly fitting.<a name=319:10></a> Scripture is full of fitting things, if we have to deal with the things of God, and full of fitting persons too.<a name=319:11></a> Every person in the divine realm is fitted for it.<a name=319:12></a> Heaven will be full of persons who are fitted for it; they will be there, each filling his place; they are not too small nor too large to fill it.<a name=319:13></a> Here upon earth some are too small and some are too large to fill their place of responsibility, but, in the divine mind, everything fits, and now is the fitting time.<a name=319:14></a> I would say to the young people, Look out for the fitting time.<a name=319:15></a> See to it that you are in it, and that you are suitable to any particular time or age in which you may be.<a name=319:16></a> John would say to you, 'If you are a little child spiritually, then <i>be</i> a little child'.<a name=319:17></a> If you fill that position you will find that there is a word for you as in it.<a name=319:18></a> John writes to the little children with a special message for them.<a name=319:19></a> Then, he has something to say to the young men.<a name=319:20></a> John wrote to the young men, saying, "Because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you".<a name=319:21></a> The word

		You may wonder why I bring all that in, in relation to what I have intimated, but it is to point out the things that marked Caleb.<a name=320:8></a> Firstly, he was a leader amongst his brethren.<a name=320:9></a> There is a great dearth of leaders in the true sense, but Caleb was a leader amongst his brethren.<a name=320:10></a> When a crisis arrived, he appeared with his brethren and addressed Joshua, and the first thing he mentions is that he was sent to spy out the land; he was under orders.<a name=320:11></a> Now I want to say to the young men and the young women here, that I know of nothing more important than that they should be under orders, not their own orders, nor their own resolutions simply, but under orders from above, even if it be only as high up as your elder brother or your elder sister.<a name=320:12></a> There is some authority there that is greater than yours.<a name=320:13></a> So Caleb was under orders to spy out the land, and he says, "I brought him word again as it was in my heart".<a name=320:14></a> It was not in his <i>mind</i>, but in his <i>heart</i>, showing that he was a loyal person; he was a reliable brother.<a name=320:15></a> The spying out of the land of Canaan was a very important matter and Caleb was to be trusted.<a name=320:16></a> Not only was the land to be conquered, but the inhabitants were to be destroyed.<a name=320:17></a> In the ministry of Joshua we have the idea of the destruction of the inhabitants of the land.<a name=320:18></a> Under David it is the <i>subjugation</i> of the people, but under Joshua it is the <i>destruction</i> of the people, because the Canaanites were to be destroyed.<a name=320:19></a> This matter of spying out the land was therefore very important, from a military point of view,

		This is one of the greatest thoughts, I suppose, with those of us who would remain with the saints, and, of course, it is our privilege as it was Paul's to desire this.<a name=324:7></a> There can be no doubt that if we were really concerned about the needs of the brethren and that we should stay here instead of dying and departing to be with Christ, the Lord would hear our prayers, for a prayer of that kind is doubtless quite acceptable to the Lord.<a name=324:8></a> There is great need at the present time, and so there is an opportunity for many of us here to be on those lines.<a name=324:9></a> It is not done selfishly, it is not for our families, or our own interests, but for the sake of the saints.<a name=324:10></a> Paul did not have a family, but he had the saints; he called them his children, and he was a father to them; he says to the Corinthians that they had not many fathers, but he was one, and John was a father to the saints too.<a name=324:11></a> There is, perhaps, nothing the saints need more than fathers.<a name=324:12></a> A young man is not a father.<a name=324:13></a> A father is a person of age and experience, and he knows that the age and experience going with it qualify him to be of some service to the Lord's people.<a name=324:14></a> He thinks of the Lord's people, and prays to the Lord that he would like to stay with the brethren.<a name=324:15></a> I do not hesitate to say that; for I have an exercise about that very thing, to stay with the brethren, if it be the Lord's will.<a name=324:16></a> For that we must be kept alive, for if we are not alive morally we are of very little use to the brethren.<a name=324:17></a> We may have means, money and the like, to help young people, but there is very little in that.<a name=324:18></a> The real value of money is very small,

		Fruit-bearing for God is from the believer, from the Christian, and so we are to be set free from legalism.<a name=331:10></a> If we are tied up by it, and many are, we shall not bear fruit.<a name=331:11></a> We need to get delivered from the bondage, whatever it be that is binding the soul, in that sense, and the epistle to the Romans is just for that very purpose, that we might be free to bear fruit unto God; that we might do it not simply when we are met together as we are tonight, but always.<a name=331:12></a> The idea of fruit-bearing goes on in its season, "bearing fruit in its season", as the Psalm says.<a name=331:13></a> So the seasons govern our positions, the question of what a season may be, and that we do not forget we are in it, and use what is provided from God in order to augment the idea of fruit-bearing.<a name=331:14></a> And so we have our readings and our prayer meetings, and so on.<a name=331:15></a> Whatever it be that augments the position we are to avail ourselves of it, so as to render fruit in its season.<a name=331:16></a>

		Now I refer to the first Psalm because it gives the thought of fruit.<a name=333:13></a> The Psalms are really a sort of counterpart of the Pentateuch.<a name=333:14></a> The Pentateuch is God's disclosure of His mind in the early days of Moses.<a name=333:15></a> The thing was in purpose and the Pentateuch opens up the mind of God, it opens up the law.<a name=333:16></a> "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ".<a name=333:17></a> But still the law had its place and conveyed light in its time, but it brought forth the idea of the godly man and, dear brethren, I would appeal to those of us who are here as to godliness, and the first element would be righteousness.<a name=333:18></a> The second epistle to Timothy places righteousness as the first item in the list.<a name=333:19></a> We are to

		J.T.<a name=357:2></a> That is one thing that has been on my mind for several weeks as to how these sisters are going to prophesy.<a name=357:3></a> The great point is that they are to be covered.<a name=357:4></a> But how are they going to do it, how are they going to prophesy?<a name=357:5></a> Now what do you say about that?<a name=357:6></a> It has been in my mind for months.<a name=357:7></a> What is to be done on the tenth chapter of 1 Corinthians?<a name=357:8></a> Just read that (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:23">1 Corinthians  10:23</a> - 33, 11: 1 - 16 read).<a name=357:9></a> First of all I want to speak about the reference to women there, how negative it is.<a name=357:10></a> She is not told to prophesy, she is told to be covered.<a name=357:11></a> The point is not prophecy; we have to decide how prophecy can be carried on and prayer, but the point here is the covering.<a name=357:12></a> The tenth verse, "Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head on account of the angels".<a name=357:13></a> But when is she to prophesy?<a name=357:14></a> She is not to prophesy unless she is covered, that is the point, but then we have to decide eventually where she is to prophesy, whether it is in a hall or a meeting room.<a name=357:15></a> Now I would just like the brethren to say what they think about what I have been saying.<a name=357:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=357:17></a>Jr.<a name=357:18></a> The point you are stressing here in chapter 11 is the covering -- the authority that is to be on the woman.<a name=357:19></a> She could not do anything until that was there.<a name=357:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=357:21></a> So it is not so much the fact that she prophesies, but the covering.<a name=357:22></a> But the time will come when she must prophesy because it is implied that she must do it, and it is a question of whether they can prophesy in the assembly or how it is to be carried on.<a name=357:23></a> I would put it to the brethren as to what they think about this.<a name=357:24></a> We have all to come to this -- the true meaning of chapters 10 and 11 of 1 Corinthians.<a name=357:25></a>

		THE BEARING OF PETER'S EPISTLES ON THE PRESENT DAY (2)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=359:1></a> We have already alluded to the ability of Peter to set out the truth.<a name=359:2></a> It would be difficult to find a more striking evidence of ability than we have in this chapter -- ability to denounce error, for almost every word of this chapter denounces error.<a name=359:3></a> No doubt it is needful that this should come before us at the present time because there is great ability abroad in the way of language; as I was remarking, you could hardly find anything so strong and effective as this second chapter of Peter's second epistle, and undoubtedly the Lord would say something to us as to the error that is abroad in the world.<a name=359:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=359:5></a>Jr.<a name=359:6></a> You are specially thinking of the recent doctrine that has been promulgated?<a name=359:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=359:8></a> Yes; I was referring to the error of Rome as to Mary, the mother of our Lord, one of the most bare-faced statements of error that could be produced.<a name=359:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=359:10></a> In chapter one of this epistle the truth is presented positively, whereas here it is dealing with things in a negative way.<a name=359:11></a> Mr.<a name=359:12></a> Darby opens up the truth to the saints in his book <i>The Irrationalism of Infidelity</i>, would that be like this?<a name=359:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=359:14></a> Very much like it.<a name=359:15></a> We surely can thank God that He raised up such a man to lead.<a name=359:16></a> in the denouncing of error, inclusive of that held by the Romish church.<a name=359:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=359:18></a>M.<a name=359:19></a> It is remarkable that the terrible conditions of evil go back so far.<a name=359:20></a> God spared not the angels who sinned, but cast them down.<a name=359:21></a> Would you say that it is necessary for all this matter of evil through these many years to work itself out?<a name=359:22></a> Would it be God's way to allow the thing to develop?<a name=359:23></a> I was thinking of verses 4 and 5, "God spared not the angels who had sinned", and "spared not the old world".<a name=359:24></a> Has He allowed these things to go on, to show how impregnable the truth is all through history?<a name=359:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=360:1></a> Very good.<a name=360:2></a> You marvel that the truth really has been able to stand all these centuries; it has been able to stand, defended by such ability as God gave certain ones, Mr.<a name=360:3></a> Darby and others like him, perhaps no one like him in modern times.<a name=360:4></a> We can give thanks for this truly, especially the young ones who are growing up in the truth, because they learn to form a judgment about the evil that is so pronounced in the world, especially Rome.<a name=360:5></a> Although God has allowed Communism also to develop, in itself as erroneous as Rome is, only Rome has the field before it and great ability in men to set out evil.<a name=360:6></a> God had in Peter a man to denounce error, and we can hardly get anything so strong as this chapter affords us.<a name=360:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=360:8></a>S.<a name=360:9></a> Would the day dawning and the morning star arising in your hearts be the impregnability of the truth?<a name=360:10></a> I am linking it on with the Lord's word in Thyatira.<a name=360:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=360:12></a> Just so, the dawn refers to an incoming day, but the morning affords a certain freshness, peculiar freshness - the morning star.<a name=360:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.M.<a name=360:19></a>W.<a name=360:20></a> Peter refers quite often here to Noah and Lot.<a name=360:21></a> I was wondering if that would not connect with the truth because the Scriptures were stressed in the first chapter.<a name=360:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=360:23></a> And then the extension backwards as Peter alludes to it here, "for whom judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction slumbers not" (verse 3).<a name=360:24></a> How far back we cannot just say, but "not idle" is a negative word.<a name=360:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=362:3></a>W.<a name=362:4></a> In that light would John's second epistle to the elect lady bring out the principle in mind?<a name=362:5></a>

		J.W.<a name=362:9></a>W.<a name=362:10></a> She was not to receive into the house those who did not bring certain doctrine.<a name=362:11></a> So the way of the truth would stand connected with the profession of things.<a name=362:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=363:14></a> I suppose God laid out the necessity for the balance of the truth and that the lead should be with the brothers, masculine.<a name=363:15></a> The lead should be masculine, whereas the sisters should follow on according to the power and wisdom they may have and there is so much opportunity amongst them of conversing together in a practical way, supporting what the brothers lead in, because it is quite evident that it is not God's will to have sisters leading in things, but rather taking part in aiding and supporting what the brothers, the masculine side, would advocate, because God evidently has set the man first.<a name=363:16></a> "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>.<a name=363:17></a> The word "them" includes the feminine, but they have dominion, they have dominion together.<a name=363:18></a>

		Now the next thing to be noticed is, "If he will not listen to them", that is the two or three, "tell it to the assembly".<a name=380:24></a> The assembly is therefore an entity to be spoken to, and to be told, and to be complained to if it is a question of complaint.<a name=380:25></a> "Tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly .<a name=380:26></a>.<a name=380:27></a>.<a name=380:28></a>" -- now listen to this word -- "let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer".<a name=380:29></a> The word <i>tax-gatherer</i> is to be noted.<a name=380:30></a> Tax-gathering was an employment that was belittled.<a name=380:31></a> It was a degraded employment.<a name=380:32></a> Therefore, when it says, "Let him be to thee as a .<a name=380:33></a>.<a name=380:34></a>.<a name=380:35></a> tax-gatherer" it means that he is to be under reproach in your mind.<a name=380:36></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next thing is, "Again I say unto you, that if two of you .<a name=381:6></a>.<a name=381:7></a>.<a name=381:8></a>" Now notice that this is another injunction entirely.<a name=381:9></a> It is another matter, different from the one with which we have been dealing.<a name=381:10></a> "Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=381:11></a> Now notice that the matter comes from heaven.<a name=381:12></a> It is not from an angel; not simply from heaven, but from "my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=381:13></a> And it is not simply "from my Father" but "from my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=381:14></a> The Lord Jesus is speaking about two persons, but not simply two persons, but "two of you".<a name=381:15></a> I want you to notice that; the value of two such persons is in mind -- the relative value of two such persons.<a name=381:16></a> And I would point out that we have here an illustration of the word that "two are better than one .<a name=381:17></a>.<a name=381:18></a>.<a name=381:19></a> and a threefold cord is not quickly broken".<a name=381:20></a> This statement is related to what I am speaking about.<a name=381:21></a> Here it is two of you; "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter".<a name=381:22></a> It happens on earth but it relates to heaven.<a name=381:23></a> It is just "two of you", and they are mentioned as agreeing on earth as touching any matter.<a name=381:24></a> "Whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=381:25></a> This is what the Lord says, and I am urging it on the brethren because it relates to assembly relations.<a name=381:26></a> "It shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=381:27></a>

		Later it says, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name .<a name=382:1></a>.<a name=382:2></a>.<a name=382:3></a>" You will notice, now, that it is "two or three".<a name=382:4></a> But I have been speaking of two, and I will just limit myself to that for a moment: "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them".<a name=382:5></a> Now notice that it is "to them" -- not to others, or simply that it will come to pass, but it will come to them "from my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=382:6></a> That is what the Lord Jesus says in this wonderful passage.<a name=382:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a real satisfaction to be here, I may say, without any other motive than to be simple.<a name=382:8></a> I have been here many times during the past fifty years, and the brethren have become endeared to me, and I am thankful to be amongst them again, but I do not know of anything that I should more like to bring to the brethren here than this very passage in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=382:9></a> This passage is basic as to assembly relations.<a name=382:10></a> I repeat that word, that the Lord was bringing in something basic in assembly relations.<a name=382:11></a> That is so important!<a name=382:12></a> And then He says, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name .<a name=382:13></a>.<a name=382:14></a>.<a name=382:15></a>" Notice that it is <i>unto my name</i>, not simply gathered together, but "unto my name".<a name=382:16></a> And then, ".<a name=382:17></a>.<a name=382:18></a>.<a name=382:19></a> there am I in the midst of them".<a name=382:20></a> It is not only in the midst, but in the midst "of them".<a name=382:21></a> It is these particular persons -- two or three of them.<a name=382:22></a> It is the virtue that lies in the idea of two or three such persons.<a name=382:23></a> "Where two or three", and these are the words of Jesus, "are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=382:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I shall seek to analyse what I have in mind, for I want to enlarge on this phraseology which the Lord uses about two or three.<a name=382:25></a> "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=382:26></a> I have used the word virtue and it is a sort of principle entering into phraseology -- a principle that has power in it.<a name=382:27></a> There is power in the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=383>[Page 383]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		principle of being gathered together; but not only gathered, gathered <i>together</i>.<a name=383:1></a> There is virtue from the Lord's own lips in that phraseology.<a name=383:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it may be that there are some here that are not breaking bread, or not in fellowship, as we say, and I would aim especially at them.<a name=383:3></a> Or if there are some who have not been long in fellowship, one would desire that all such might get the principle of this passage into their souls -- especially the young people.<a name=383:4></a> But I would not confine the word to the young people, I would not limit it.<a name=383:5></a> Quoting from the facts we have about the Lord's own life I would say that the age of twelve should govern, largely, the principle of persons coming into fellowship, taking their places in the fellowship of God's Son.<a name=383:6></a> We have the Lord's own example, that He was found in the midst of the doctors at the age of twelve, hearing them and asking them questions, and His mother rebuked Him.<a name=383:7></a> Reference to the mother of the Lord brings to mind what is being said of her by certain nominal Christians, that she has been exalted even bodily into heaven, which is falsehood.<a name=383:8></a> The devil is using it, and it is quite right to speak of it and to denounce it with all our strength.<a name=383:9></a> It is a terrible thing that has come into the profession at this time.<a name=383:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I proceed to enlarge upon the phraseology in our scripture, and I want to say immediately that it has a great bearing on the present time amongst the brethren.<a name=383:11></a> Numbers are few, but the Lord brings them down to the very fewest number -- two or three.<a name=383:12></a> This phraseology bears on the whole position of the assembly at the present time.<a name=383:13></a> If you traversed the whole continent of America, the continent of Europe and the continent of Asia, this phraseology has to do with conditions everywhere in the assembly at the present time.<a name=383:14></a> But I am trying particularly to make much of the word 'together'.<a name=383:15></a> It is not simply gathered, but gathered <i>together</i>.<a name=383:16></a> And it bears on how we come into the assembly or place of meeting.<a name=383:17></a> I would say that we use the word
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=384>[Page 384]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>meeting</i> far too much.<a name=384:1></a> We should use the expression 'gathered together' more frequently, and I trust that this will result from what I am saying, that the phraseology 'gathered together' should be used far more frequently among us in preference to using the word <i>meeting</i>.<a name=384:2></a> The idea of meeting is that <i>we</i> do it.<a name=384:3></a> The brethren meet, of course, but think of the virtue that there is in the idea of gathering together!<a name=384:4></a> I would urge very strongly that we want to take this on and see how we reach the idea of coming into the assembly, the place of gathering, the place in which we gather, where the assembly <i>gathers</i>: "Where two or three are gathered together".<a name=384:5></a> In gathering we are really touching the idea of the assembly, whether composed of two or three or more in any given place or locality.<a name=384:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind that when we disperse, if the Lord pleases, we should go to our localities carrying back in our minds the idea of gathering together.<a name=384:7></a> It is a heavenly thought come down to earth and it has peculiar virtue in it.<a name=384:8></a> The word <i>meeting</i> does not have the same virtue.<a name=384:9></a> It is a word that can be used, and is used by the Holy Spirit, for the saints shall meet the Lord in the air and go to heaven together.<a name=384:10></a> But gathering together is another idea.<a name=384:11></a> The words have great virtue in them because there is a point in the power of gathering together.<a name=384:12></a> Some indefinable thing happens when the actual gathering together of the saints takes place.<a name=384:13></a> There is something virtuous in it that does not attach to merely coming to a meeting place.<a name=384:14></a> So that I would emphasize again the thought of gathering together so that we might take with us from this meeting the thought of gathering together.<a name=384:15></a> It is a divine thought, but I think we will prove, as we apply it, that this great thought is recognizable amongst the brethren now.<a name=384:16></a> Years ago it was more so than it is now but I am seeking to mention it as I have done several times of late.<a name=384:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I count upon God to help us as we separate after these meetings and go to our several localities, that we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=385>[Page 385]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		carry with us this great idea that "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=385:1></a> It is not simply in the midst, but in the midst of <i>them</i>.<a name=385:2></a> It is the persons who gather thus, for the virtue is in persons - such persons - that is where the power is.<a name=385:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will close now, but in doing so I would again stress what has been said about the Lord's phraseology so that we should have a fuller thought of virtue.<a name=385:4></a> The woman of <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>is spoken of as a virtuous woman.<a name=385:5></a> I use the word in that sense.<a name=385:6></a> There is virtue in what I am saying about the power of gathering together unto the Lord's name.<a name=385:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		I have in mind to speak of light.<a name=386:1></a> These two scriptures treat of this subject; there are many others that treat of it too; indeed, in some sense we might speak of the measure of the use of a subject in scripture as an index of its value or importance.<a name=386:2></a> Scripture speaks much of light; it is one of the first things that scripture speaks of, as if God were to say, I am entering on a new series of operations and what I am about to do must be done in the light.<a name=386:3></a> Later on He is more explicit in saying He is Himself in the light.<a name=386:4></a> "God is light; and in him is no darkness at all" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:5">1 John  1:5</a>), and, "If we walk in the light as <i>he</i> is in the light, we have fellowship one with another" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:7">1 John  1:7</a>).<a name=386:5></a> So that we can see how God had this matter in His mind; and Paul says, "God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine .<a name=386:6></a>.<a name=386:7></a>.<a name=386:8></a> has shone in our hearts", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>.<a name=386:9></a> The apostle brings the matter into his own heart and the hearts of the saints; God has shone in them, a very searching matter as to whether we are inwardly illuminated, and whether, as illuminated ourselves, luminous, our bodies full of light.<a name=386:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So I began with the Father of lights; that is what we have in our verse in James.<a name=386:11></a> "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning".<a name=386:12></a> Now we have come to the turn of the year, you know, when kings go forth to battle.<a name=386:13></a> And we need not remind the brethren that it is battle time, and if we are not going forth we are hardly with the kings.<a name=386:14></a> So being the turn of the year it is battle time, but then it is gift time; that is a matter of importance, at least in the minds of many, the time of expectancy, in that sense, and it is well to be in accord with what is going.<a name=386:15></a> God crowns the year with His goodness, and so it is well to be in line.<a name=386:16></a> There is a gradual diminution of food and other supplies, as if God were telling us that man's devastations are to be

		I am speaking about food and about giving, but James says, "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning".<a name=388:7></a> So that if things are short, the thing is to turn to the right place, the source of supply, and God is that; God is that in everything.<a name=388:8></a> He is "rich towards all that call upon him", whatever the thing may be, so that I want to begin in that way, dear brethren, to impress all with the liberalness of the times.<a name=388:9></a> There is no stint with God; there is no stint at all, and therefore if there is a sense of need, it is the giving time, as I said; it is a giving time, and the word here is, "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning"; the word is 'come'; it comes; therefore it is a continuous matter.<a name=388:10></a> But God would say to us that we have something to do with it.<a name=388:11></a> He turns the rivers; He causes them to take certain courses.<a name=388:12></a> God has means of diverting or directing all other things, as is needful and as to this matter of giving; you will understand, although I am speaking in a certain hortatory way -- I always like to bring that in, to exhort -- but I am not on that tonight; I want to encourage the brethren with the things being given, and as we need, they are being given, because the word is "comes down".<a name=388:13></a> God has got them but they are coming.<a name=388:14></a> "Every good gift and every perfect gift" -- the brethren will just have to enquire as to the difference between a good gift and a perfect one, because we will never

		Well, that happened then; that was, you might say, the great beginning of giving, which was extended some three years later; the heavens did not open at the day of Pentecost; they did not open there.<a name=391:5></a> There was a mighty breathing, we are told, on that day; the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, it was running its course.<a name=391:6></a> God selected that particular day to amplify the thought of giving and there was a mighty breathing, a powerful breathing; you say the word 'wind' is used there, but really it is breathing, meaning that it is the outcoming of God, His outcomings.<a name=391:7></a> And then His incomings, that He was going to come in Himself to be with His people.<a name=391:8></a> I want you, dear brethren, to let these things in because I am speaking of the greatest things; they have often been spoken of before but in the constant speaking you get more and more; this is a great matter of the mighty breathing of God at that time, and the sound was heard.<a name=391:9></a> And it says it filled all the house where they were sitting, just as we are here now -- think of it.<a name=391:10></a> Suppose it happened now; it never happened before, but it happened that day in that city -- a mighty breathing from heaven, a sound out of heaven.<a name=391:11></a> You say, It is all imaginary.<a name=391:12></a> It is not imaginary; I am speaking of realities.<a name=391:13></a> Think of the happening, and the sound filling the house, the sound out of heaven.<a name=391:14></a> Who can describe that sound?<a name=391:15></a> Nobody, except those who heard, but the sound was heard; it filled all the house where they were sitting, as if God said, Be restful.<a name=391:16></a> God is very, very generous, and He is very considerate too.<a name=391:17></a> How thoughtful He is, each of us can look back on our history and see the

		Well now, I have to stop there and just say a few words more on the second scripture read.<a name=394:1></a> That is the question of sons of light, because what I have been saying is leading up to that time.<a name=394:2></a> I take home to myself what has been given, because as I said before, it is a continuous word, it is continuous gifts -- gifts are coming, coming, coming, coming.<a name=394:3></a> Get into the line of them, and be sure to appreciate them, and have respect for them, make room for them.<a name=394:4></a> The assembly is in mind, and the greatest thought, you might say, next to divine Persons, is the assembly.<a name=394:5></a> And sons of light are the ones that will rightly value this matter of the assembly, persons who are illuminated themselves, so much so that they are regarded as sons of light, grown up as the word is, developed in the thought, fully developed in it.<a name=394:6></a> So you look for the assembly.<a name=394:7></a> They did not in the middle ages; the Roman Catholic church prospered in the darkness -- that is where it prospers, where there is cold and darkness and damp.<a name=394:8></a> And so when Paul was on the ship, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27">Acts  27</a>, it says neither sun nor stars appeared for many days -- not a word about the moon.<a name=394:9></a> It was as if nobody knew what the moon meant.<a name=394:10></a> There would be no use in talking in the middle ages about the assembly; it would not be understood.<a name=394:11></a> It awaited a certain given time, down the line, when God began to work again and the thought of the assembly became understandable.<a name=394:12></a> Now we must have three ideas of light.<a name=394:13></a> In the middle ages there were just two; they were the sun and the stars; they are alluded to, but in those many days there were neither sun nor stars, but there is no word about the moon, as if the people on the ship did not know about the moon.<a name=394:14></a> It was no subject of their knowledge, but the sun they understood: Christ in heaven, there was some light about that, and some light too in godly men, gifted men; they are the stars.<a name=394:15></a> Thank God for the Wesleys, so to speak, and the Whitfields, and hundreds of others down the line who are stars.<a name=394:16></a> He made the stars also; He does not make much of that although He

		What has been said in our hearing may well be made to culminate in these verses; that is why one has ventured to read them.<a name=398:1></a> We began with the abiding place of our Lord Jesus in our hymn, allusion being made to John's gospel, chapter 1, verse 18 -- "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father".<a name=398:2></a> That is, it is the place He has as Man; it is not who <i>was</i> in the bosom of the Father, but who <i>is</i>.<a name=398:3></a> And this passage in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>contemplates where the apostles abide, contemplates the rendezvous, as one might call it, of those who were loyal to Christ.<a name=398:4></a> As we are loyal to Christ in gathering up what is presented to us in ministry, we shall feel the necessity of the right company, for persons are needed for the conservation of the truth, and this book brings in persons; not exactly as in John, where it is a question of family status, but persons qualified to act in an official way; that is, in the sense of appointment, as we have been hearing, of being trusted with the charge, and hence the instinct in those who were loyal in regard of that.<a name=398:5></a> They were loyal to Christ in regard of what is presented in ministry, presented to us in an objective sense; the instinct leads us, too, to those who are loyal and who are under the charge, who have accepted obligation as to what belongs to Christ.<a name=398:6></a> In the end of Luke it will be recalled how two heard much from His lips, a most wonderful exposition of truth; the Lord Himself, as risen from among the dead, began at Moses and all the prophets, and expounded to those two persons the things concerning Himself.<a name=398:7></a> The exposition did not lead them back to Jerusalem but it entered into their journey back, and what governed them in going back, what led them to go back, was the appearing, or the making Himself known to them, of the Lord Jesus; they returned
