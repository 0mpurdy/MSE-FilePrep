		FIVE ASPECTS OF THE GLAD TIDINGS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:4">Acts  8:4</a>, 5, 12, 25, 35
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is in mind in this address is that the various features of the gospel presented in this chapter should come before us, and that in considering these five features of it everyone present may in some way be helped, those who have believed and are established christians, those who are young in the faith, and those who are not in the faith at all.<a name=1:1></a> The last are the ones that are particularly in mind, with the desire that this remarkable chapter, affording so much instruction as to the gospel, should yield much for them.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall first speak of the gospel mentioned in its general bearing in verses 25 and 40.<a name=1:3></a> Following on that in the spiritual order is verse 12, which speaks of the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God.<a name=1:4></a> In verse 5 we have another side of the great testimony that God is presenting, the preaching of the Christ, a Man who can do things for God and for men.<a name=1:5></a> Then we have in verse 4 the term "the glad tidings of the word", meaning the word of God.<a name=1:6></a> And finally in verse 35, the most attractive term of all, "the glad tidings of Jesus".<a name=1:7></a> Under these five designations of the gospel I propose by the Lord's help to speak to you.<a name=1:8></a> There are other designations of the gospel in the Scripture that are not in this chapter, but this is one of the richest that I know of in such designations.<a name=1:9></a> There are thirteen or more in the New Testament, and each one of them has a distinct import which is to be learnt and profited from by believers.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first is the general thought, beloved friends, covering the whole dispensation in which we are, and reflecting the great, divine thought, the simple word "the gospel".<a name=1:11></a> It is a word that is taken up in human language and human thought, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		rarely in this sense conveys what Scripture conveys as to it.<a name=2:1></a> The Lord Jesus Himself, indeed, sometimes personifies it, it had such a place with Him, and it has still such a place with Him, and in the mind of God, as meeting human ills, as meeting man and relieving him from the effects of sin and fitting him for the presence of God.<a name=2:2></a> "The gospel" is a word having a great place in the divine vocabulary in that way and the apostle Paul, reflecting this, almost always speaks of it in a personal sense, exhorting Timothy to be a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel.<a name=2:3></a> So that the preparation of God in view of the gospel must have been very great, resulting in what is so carefully devised and featured in so many ways, so that no human being should be unable to understand it.<a name=2:4></a> Whilst the thought of it is not generally seized among men, yet the very use of the word is a testimony, and the Lord intended that it should be, a testimony that there is such a great thing as the gospel, and that testimony is in full force today, notwithstanding the disregard of it that is so prevalent.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no change at all in the attitude of God expressed in it.<a name=2:6></a> It remains as fresh and as wide as it was when Christ became Man and ascended up into heaven and the Holy Spirit came down.<a name=2:7></a> It retains its power and freshness in the divine mind, and the Holy Spirit being down here, it is still presented in freshness to those who will hear, however small and however few.<a name=2:8></a> That is one great thought one has in mind, that it should be presented in the freshness of the Spirit at this time, so that no one here should be afraid of the great general term of the gospel.<a name=2:9></a> There are those here doubtless who have never yet appropriated it.<a name=2:10></a> Millions have and many round you are appropriating the salvation and blessing available through the gospel, but you have not appropriated it yet.<a name=2:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Paul was the outstanding preacher and the most effective of all preachers, save the Lord Himself.<a name=3:1></a> He says to a number of converts of his in the city of Corinth, "the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:1">1 Corinthians  15:1</a>.<a name=3:2></a> He had been there eighteen months in this wonderful service, and he tells us that during that period he had preached to them, making a careful selection of the features of the truth which he should present.<a name=3:3></a> And he says, 'you received what I preached unto you'.<a name=3:4></a> Now what is important in regard to what we are here for this afternoon is whether we have received the gospel, and as having received it, what effect it has had on us.<a name=3:5></a> He says, "which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:1">1 Corinthians  15:1</a>), and then he adds a very sorrowful word, "Unless ye have believed in vain".<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Believed in vain!<a name=3:7></a> Let that touch anyone here who thought he believed the gospel years ago, and it has not been effective in him.<a name=3:8></a> We cannot say that anyone is really saved, either potentially or actually, in whom the gospel has not become effective.<a name=3:9></a> The apostle mournfully has to add that word, "Unless ye have believed in vain".<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some of you may never have heard such words as that, but the apostle Paul used them in writing to these professed believers at Corinth.<a name=3:11></a> It may be there are those here who have thought that they believed to their salvation, and yet there is no effect of the gospel, no change of outlook, no change of life, no change of associations, no thought whatever of coming out of the world.<a name=3:12></a> The fact that you say, I was converted at such-and-such a date, by such-and-such a preacher, is not enough.<a name=3:13></a> The apostle raises a serious doubt with these christians: "Unless ye have believed in vain".<a name=3:14></a> He goes on then to state the terms that he had presented.<a name=3:15></a> He says, "How that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

		and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve [that is the twelve apostles]: after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once .<a name=4:1></a>.<a name=4:2></a>.<a name=4:3></a> .<a name=4:4></a>.<a name=4:5></a> After that he was seen of James; then of all the apostles" (changing the word from "twelve" to "apostles" ).<a name=4:6></a> "And last of all he was seen of me also", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:4">1 Corinthians  15:4</a> - 8.<a name=4:7></a> You received what I presented to you, and he adds significantly and sorrowfully, "unless ye have believed in vain".<a name=4:8></a> These terms, if received in full in the soul of a believer, man, woman, or child, will save him.<a name=4:9></a> "That Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures".<a name=4:10></a> There is no doubt that the idea of the gospel had been foretold or foreseen of old.<a name=4:11></a> The prophets witnessed to it.<a name=4:12></a> They searched "what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:11">1 Peter  1:11</a>), and Peter goes on to say that this testimony, the gospel, was preached unto them "by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven".<a name=4:13></a> Think of the wonderful provision God has made, first in the gift of His beloved Son, in the death of that holy Person, who died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and was buried and rose again the third day according to the Scriptures and appeared to all these people.<a name=4:14></a> Think of the pains that God has gone to, in order that men should have a clear testimony to what He has provided; that they should be saved, for He is not willing that any should perish.<a name=4:15></a> He has gone to infinite pains that the testimony should come to you of the wonderful provisions that God has made that you should be saved.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.<a name=4:17></a> There is no question about it.<a name=4:18></a> The Scriptures have foretold it and it has become a fact, that He died for our sins.<a name=4:19></a> Why should you or I

		die for them?<a name=5:1></a> Thank God I shall not, for the Lord Jesus says, "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:26">John  11:26</a>.<a name=5:2></a> You say, 'That is denied every day'.<a name=5:3></a> It is not denied, it is the truth, for the Christian does not taste death.<a name=5:4></a> He falls asleep in Jesus, only awaiting the resurrection shout to take him out of the grave, for that is the resurrection part of the gospel: "He rose again the third day according to the scriptures".<a name=5:5></a> He was raised first; "Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming".<a name=5:6></a> The saints will be raised by the same power that raised Christ.<a name=5:7></a> The present time is the time of the soul's salvation; presently we shall have body salvation; so that a saint falling asleep and buried like others is not subservient to death, it is only a little moment and he comes into body salvation, he is only awaiting redemption, the redemption of our bodies.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great thing is that He died for our sins according to the Scriptures.<a name=5:9></a> If there is anybody here troubled about his sins, I say it is well to be troubled about them and to confess them, but the gospel is that you might be relieved from all pressures as regards sins.<a name=5:10></a> There is forgiveness with God in order that your heart may be relieved from your sins, for Christ died for your sins according to the Scriptures; and secondly He was buried.<a name=5:11></a> You say, 'What has that to do with redemption?<a name=5:12></a>' A great deal.<a name=5:13></a> It would be utterly derogatory to Christ our Saviour to say that He was in the grave in any other sense than vicariously.<a name=5:14></a> He must be there vicariously; burying was necessary.<a name=5:15></a> It is a very solemn thing that God said to man, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:19">Genesis  3:19</a>.<a name=5:16></a> One of the most terrible things to the unregenerate mind is the grave and God intended it to be so.<a name=5:17></a> There is no discharge in that war.<a name=5:18></a> What can you do?<a name=5:19></a> You are utterly powerless as dying in your sins and buried in your sins.<a name=5:20></a> You

		are held in the grip of death, and it is the judgment of God that man should lie in the grave and return to the dust.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not that that is the end of man.<a name=6:2></a> It is utterly false to assume that that is the end.<a name=6:3></a> Not at all, for we are told that the dead in Christ will rise more than a thousand years before those who die in their sins.<a name=6:4></a> Then, after the thousand years, there will be the judgment of God, for we are told that death and hell were cast into the lake of fire which is the second death; that is a most terrible thing.<a name=6:5></a> The grave is as nothing compared with what will come after the grave!<a name=6:6></a> If the grave were the end of everything then I could understand how men would think nothing of it; but it is not the end, it is only a means to an end, as we have in the awful picture of the rich man who died and was buried, and who in hell lifted up his eyes being in torment.<a name=6:7></a> Do not tell me that is only a figure; it is a fact.<a name=6:8></a> It is from the lips of Jesus who is the truth and the fulness of it!<a name=6:9></a> Death is not final.<a name=6:10></a> It is not Gehenna.<a name=6:11></a> It is the grave -- Hades.<a name=6:12></a> Gehenna is the full thought "where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:44">Mark  9:44</a>.<a name=6:13></a> You say you are preaching judgment.<a name=6:14></a> Why should I not?<a name=6:15></a> It is only to warn you.<a name=6:16></a> The apostle Paul says, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:18">Romans  1:18</a>.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So you can see how Jesus was buried vicariously so that, as He came out of death, so shall we.<a name=6:18></a> Christ is viewed as taken out of the grave.<a name=6:19></a> "Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming".<a name=6:20></a> That is in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, a very long chapter.<a name=6:21></a> These long chapters suggest that the truth is so important, so vital to every believer, that God spreads it out for us, and I would urge everyone to read that chapter and ponder it prayerfully.<a name=6:22></a> It finishes up with "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory".<a name=6:23></a> It is a triumphant chapter and it begins with the verses that I quoted, relating to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		terms of the gospel "by which also ye are saved .<a name=7:1></a>.<a name=7:2></a>.<a name=7:3></a> unless ye have believed in vain".<a name=7:4></a> We are saved as receiving these wonderful terms on the principle of faith, first "that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures"; and secondly, "that he was buried", and thirdly "that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures".<a name=7:5></a> Paul himself says elsewhere, He "was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:25">Romans  4:25</a>.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of the Spirit of God writing all this down through the apostle, as though the death of Christ was for nothing else than for our offences.<a name=7:7></a> How God would impress upon us that He was thinking of the load of sins that sinners would bear, and that He delivered Christ for those offences in order that there should be a perfect clearance.<a name=7:8></a> He "was raised again for our justification", mark you, as if there was nothing else but our sins to be removed and our justification.<a name=7:9></a> Of course, there is much more in these things, but the Spirit of God in preaching the gospel would impress upon every man, woman and child that God was thinking of him in the death of Christ.<a name=7:10></a> "Delivered for our offences and .<a name=7:11></a>.<a name=7:12></a>.<a name=7:13></a> raised again for our justification".<a name=7:14></a> And then there is in that wonderful verse, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a>, a triumphant "therefore": "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand".<a name=7:15></a> Is there anyone here a non-participator in these things?<a name=7:16></a> Our hearts would yearn for you.<a name=7:17></a> There is such folly in turning a deaf ear to, or treating lightly, these wonderful things that God has provided in the death of Christ and formulated into what is so commonly called the gospel.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there are these witnesses -- Cephas, the great apostle Peter, and twelve chosen men, and then five hundred brethren, every one a witness by his own eyes of the resurrection of Christ.<a name=7:19></a> These five hundred

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		brethren were there all at one time.<a name=8:1></a> Can anyone be so foolish as to deny such adequate and overwhelming testimony of the resurrection of Christ?<a name=8:2></a> He was seen by over five hundred brethren at one time, and by others, too, James, and the twelve apostles and then Paul himself, the greatest witness of all coming in last but seeing the most.<a name=8:3></a> He comes to tell all that he saw, and he saw more than the others, for he saw a glorified Christ, a Christ who appeared to him out of heaven.<a name=8:4></a> Such is the gospel, beloved friends.<a name=8:5></a> Can you wonder that those of us who seek fully to preach Christ are full of triumph as we do it?<a name=8:6></a> It is the most triumphant thing that has ever been devised for man.<a name=8:7></a> There is the gospel, the mystery of it, the terms under which it is presented, such as the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, the glad tidings, the unsearchable riches of Christ.<a name=8:8></a> Think of all these terms intended to fill the minds of believers and make them triumphant!<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now I have dwelt upon this first point in verses 25 and 40, the gospel mentioned separately.<a name=8:10></a> The next word I present is "the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ" (verse 12).<a name=8:11></a> After a person believes, according to what I have been saying, he needs <i>protection</i>, and not only that, but he needs <i>subjection</i>.<a name=8:12></a> Protection and subjection are the words I should use in connection with the kingdom.<a name=8:13></a> There is enjoyment in the kingdom, but the idea of the kingdom is that when men and women as believers in Christ come into the good of forgiveness, and know that they are clear, that they are justified, the next thing they need is the Spirit of God, and we are carefully told "that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:9">Romans  10:9</a>.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not only believing, but confessing, and what that implies is the gift of the Holy Spirit; and so we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are told in this book of the Acts that all who are subject to Christ get the Spirit.<a name=9:1></a> There may be delay, for God reserves His own liberty in regard to the gift of the Spirit.<a name=9:2></a> It is a gift, and can never be automatic, but in a general way we are told that those who obey Christ get the Spirit.<a name=9:3></a> No one ever gets the Spirit otherwise.<a name=9:4></a> It would be utterly incongruous to think of God giving His Spirit to a disobedient person.<a name=9:5></a> He gives the Spirit to those who obey Christ, and so Christ is said to have been made both Lord and Christ as ascended into heaven.<a name=9:6></a> He was always that personally, the testimony of the angel was that "unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:11">Luke  2:11</a>.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Personally He was that, Christ the Lord, but in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, Peter tells us "God hath made that same Jesus .<a name=9:8></a>.<a name=9:9></a>.<a name=9:10></a> both Lord and Christ"; that is to say, He is established in heaven as the Man who does everything for God, and as the Man who rules; and what He is doing now is ruling persons.<a name=9:11></a> He will rule the universe presently, in the meantime He is ruling persons; one of the most important things is for a believer to come under the direct rule of Christ, and as coming under it to take up that attitude and say "Lord".<a name=9:12></a> "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:9">Romans  10:9</a>.<a name=9:13></a> Now that implies that you get the Spirit.<a name=9:14></a> There can be no salvation today without the Spirit.<a name=9:15></a> Some may have a meagre thought of salvation; it is not merely a ticket to get through and escape judgment to come.<a name=9:16></a> It is a <i>present</i> thing; hence we are told that Jesus gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present world, and to give us the Spirit.<a name=9:17></a> He gives us a good conscience and forgiveness, and then He gives us the Spirit, and so Peter says, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit is here from a glorified Christ and a constituted Lord in heaven, and He is here to bring all into subjection to Christ; and let me assure you, whatever you are told the gospel is, that aside from subjection to Christ and the presence of the Spirit, there is no present salvation.<a name=10:2></a> It is soul salvation.<a name=10:3></a> You will get body salvation by and by.<a name=10:4></a> The Lord Jesus will raise you from the dead and quicken you, but in the meantime you want soul salvation, and there is no soul salvation apart from the ground of subjection to Christ and the Spirit received, and confessing with the mouth the Lord Jesus and believing in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead.<a name=10:5></a> That is what I understand by Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God.<a name=10:6></a> One would love to have heard what Philip said.<a name=10:7></a> It is a divine subject to contemplate; he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God.<a name=10:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, thirdly, in verse 5, we have the preaching of the Christ which, as I understand and have already intimated, alludes to Christ as the One whom God has anointed to do everything for Himself and everything for us.<a name=10:9></a> Think of having a Man in heaven who will do everything spiritually needed!<a name=10:10></a> He is our High Priest up there, and we are told, "He ever liveth to make intercession for us", as if He were not doing anything else.<a name=10:11></a> I would like you to get that thought, beloved friends, that there is a Man living night and day to make intercession for you, and so it says, "He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:25">Hebrews  7:25</a>.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a salvation, beloved friends, and what a Saviour!<a name=10:13></a> That is Christ.<a name=10:14></a> Then the next thought is "the glad tidings of the word".<a name=10:15></a> In the New Translation you will see that verse 4 says they "went through the countries announcing the glad tidings of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glad tidings of the word would be that the mind of God in the gospel should enter into our hearts.<a name=11:19></a> What can be greater as a matter of understanding, as a matter of study and contemplation, than to see what God has in His mind for us?<a name=11:20></a> And that is what these scattered saints in those early days were concerned about, the glad tidings of the word.<a name=11:21></a> It would deliver us from all novel-reading.<a name=11:22></a> Young Christians are damaged beyond words in devouring lies.<a name=11:23></a> There is unmitigated judgment meted out on persons who believe and make lies.<a name=11:24></a> The novel-reader and writer are classed together.<a name=11:25></a> God hates it; but even young

		J.T.<a name=17:1></a> I thought we might look at the glory in the gospel of John.<a name=17:2></a> What is in mind is to dwell on these three verses speaking of the glory of Christ.<a name=17:3></a> It is significant that the idea of glory is so prominent in this gospel.<a name=17:4></a> Its setting and place generally in the Scriptures are intended to attract and to draw us out of the world, whatever form of it may be holding us.<a name=17:5></a> We find Stephen saying, "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:2">Acts  7:2</a>.<a name=17:6></a> So, throughout, the introduction of glory and the thought of it seem to have movement in mind.<a name=17:7></a> Those who were moved by it, we are told, "had had opportunity to have returned; but now they seek a better, that is, a heavenly" country -- the home of glory.<a name=17:8></a> So that "God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:15">Hebrews  11:15</a>, 16.<a name=17:9></a> We know that the city of God is the residence of His glory.<a name=17:10></a> It is said that it descends from heaven, from God, having the glory of God.<a name=17:11></a> It is significant that John speaks much of it, more than the other evangelists do; linking Revelation with the gospel we shall find that there is a very frequent use of the idea of glory.<a name=17:12></a> Exodus in the Old Testament is peculiarly marked by it; it is the book which treats of the outgoing of God's people from the world and the building up of a system of things in which His glory resides, or was to reside His glory filled the tabernacle.<a name=17:13></a> John has in mind the people of God being delivered out of religious settings in this world, and he stresses the thought of glory, particularly as centred in the Person of Christ.<a name=17:14></a> Indeed nothing can be more attractive than what he says: "we have

		J.T.<a name=18:8></a> That is what is in mind manifestly.<a name=18:9></a> So that the Lord Himself pursues the thought in this gospel, even back to the glory that He came from, the glory of Deity; that is, the full range of glory is brought before us from this verse to the end of the gospel.<a name=18:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=22:31></a> Well, we get that thought more accurately in chapter 11, I think.<a name=22:32></a> Here it is the poverty of the family.<a name=22:33></a> In chapter 4 we learn that although this occurred in Cana, a family there was invaded by sickness, which is an additional thought.<a name=22:34></a> Here it is

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C-S.<a name=35:3></a> Would you be free to give us an outline of the last meeting?<a name=35:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=35:5></a> We read from chapter 1, dwelling on verse 14, which speaks of the glory of an only-begotten with a father, which John and his fellow-apostles contemplated.<a name=35:6></a> It was thought that it conveyed the radiation of affection between the Father and the Son as introductory to the great family thought that runs through the gospel of John.<a name=35:7></a> And then in chapter 2, the verse read spoke of the manifestation of Christ's glory in the signs which He wrought.<a name=35:8></a> "This beginning of signs", in chapter 2, alluded more to public testimony, particularly towards His disciples.<a name=35:9></a> It says they "believed on him".<a name=35:10></a> And then chapter 7: 39 speaks of His glory as received, His exaltation into heaven, in consequence of which the Spirit is here and flowing out from the believer in testimony, the testimony therefore coming out immediately, that is, through the saints towards the world, as rivers of living water.<a name=35:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought that these three passages open up the dispensation in which we are, the dispensation of grace, which has been called the day of the Spirit, the Spirit's day in the sense of testimony in grace, not in the sense spoken of in chapter 1.<a name=35:12></a> Later the Spirit is seen as a divine Person here under the title of Comforter or Paraclete, leading to the inner features of the truth, standing indeed in connection with what is before us now, that is, these features of the glory of Christ bearing on the assembly.<a name=35:13></a> The first is chapter 11; the verse read says, "This sickness", that is the sickness of Lazarus, "is not unto death,

	<div class="paragraph">
		but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it", so that it is the Son of God, not in the sense of chapter 1: 14, but evidently in power.<a name=36:1></a> In chapter 1 it is the affection between the Father and the Son, the Son viewed as the Only-begotten.<a name=36:2></a> Here it is Son of God, a title which has a great place in Scripture, even in the Old Testament.<a name=36:3></a> The epistle to the Romans (laying the foundation of the gospel) says He is "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead".<a name=36:4></a> That is what is here before us now as the first phase of our subject.<a name=36:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=36:6></a>H.<a name=36:7></a> Are you viewing this sickness as indicating conditions that exist among the saints as taken up by God, and in which God is going to be glorified?<a name=36:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=36:9></a> I think that is good.<a name=36:10></a> It is a question now of the family.<a name=36:11></a> We are told at the beginning of the chapter that there was a certain man sick, Lazarus, in the village of Mary and Martha, his sisters.<a name=36:12></a> It was "that Mary" who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother was sick, and the sisters send to Jesus.<a name=36:13></a> Then we are told, "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus" (verse 5).<a name=36:14></a> That is, they were a family in the sense of brother and sisters, not in the sense of a household with parents, but it is a selected circumstance as we had yesterday.<a name=36:15></a> It was a family circumstance in the sense of a marriage in chapter 2; in chapter 4 it is a family circumstance in the sense of a child ill in the house; here again it is an illness, in a brother of two sisters.<a name=36:16></a> In chapter 4 it is a parent concerned about a child; indeed the idea in chapter 4 is the son; the Lord says, "thy son liveth".<a name=36:17></a> The Spirit says at the outset, introducing the subject, "there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick", and the man calls the son a <i>child</i>; but the Lord says, "Go, thy son lives"; the thought of sonship is there in a family.<a name=36:18></a> Here it is the brother,

		and it would be in this chapter an allusion to a condition arising amongst us, the condition serving as an occasion for the glory of God; that the Son of God should be glorified.<a name=37:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C-S.<a name=37:2></a> So that the disabilities or disqualifications that might exist amongst members of the family become an occasion for the exhibition of divine power.<a name=37:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=37:4></a> Well, that is what is seen in these instances.<a name=37:5></a> The Lord goes beyond the actual meeting of the conditions; there is excess here; there is glory, the glory of God and the glory of the Son of God, here.<a name=37:6></a> A condition therefore of this kind involves an increase of spiritual wealth.<a name=37:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=37:8></a> Have you in mind that this is something beyond physical sickness?<a name=37:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=37:10></a> Well, it has just been suggested that it is an allusion to a condition that may arise in the family.<a name=37:11></a> In chapter 2 purification is stressed because of the conditions that arose, the wine failing, running out; here it is not that side.<a name=37:12></a> The Lord states that this sickness was for a specific purpose, namely, for the glory of God and that the Son of God should be glorified by it.<a name=37:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C-S.<a name=37:14></a> I think you have already remarked that John seems to select circumstances and puts them into settings that will bring them under tribute to glory in that way.<a name=37:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=37:16></a> That is what I think is seen throughout this gospel.<a name=37:17></a> Here there is no blame implied.<a name=37:18></a> It is what is common, that is, sickness and death; but in this instance it was in the family, sickness and death were invading the family, those whom Jesus loved, and the question arises how He may be reckoned on to come in in an emergency.<a name=37:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.C.<a name=37:20></a> Does that suggest that the glory of God is connected in resurrection wholly with the Spirit's sphere?<a name=37:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=38>[Page 38]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=38:1></a> Well, it shows that the glory of God is connected with it.<a name=38:2></a> To say all is connected with it is a little more than should be said, perhaps, for resurrection is not finality, you know.<a name=38:3></a> The culmination of this incident is in chapter 12, seen here on earth, not going as far as the heavenly calling of the saints.<a name=38:4></a> It is on the way to the full thought of God.<a name=38:5></a> Paul spoke about it, desiring to attain to the resurrection of the dead, to arrive at it; but then he proceeds to speak of the "calling on high of God in Christ Jesus".<a name=38:6></a> The latter goes further; it implies heavenly glory, that is the accomplishment of divine counsel and God shining out in that connection.<a name=38:7></a> There is glory attached to His power, His love entering into it, but there is glory attached to His counsels.<a name=38:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C-S.<a name=38:9></a> I quite follow you.<a name=38:10></a> Speaking of the Lord coming in in connection with some circumstances as found in the family, do you suggest that is the outcome of concern which exists on the part of members of the family inviting Him to come in to deal with the situation?<a name=38:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=38:12></a> Hence it says, "The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick"; that is, they put the matter on the ground of His love.<a name=38:13></a> It is not the one whom we love, or our brother, it is "whom thou lovest", an understanding of the place that the sick person had in the affections of Christ, a very important matter in these things, and what the person is who is affected, what he is in the affections of Christ.<a name=38:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.S.<a name=38:15></a> Is it significant that the sisters send?<a name=38:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=38:17></a> Well, quite so.<a name=38:18></a> They were all loved.<a name=38:19></a> Martha is mentioned first, for love, I think, as seen here is to equalise conditions amongst the brethren.<a name=38:20></a> Mary had a place; she is mentioned first as the one who anointed the Lord -- "that Mary" -- showing that her action in chapter 12 is in mind and there is to be a great result from this -- worship really is to be the outcome,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=39>[Page 39]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a very great result.<a name=39:1></a> But still the equalisation of things amongst us is important, so that we may not rest unduly on distinguished persons amongst us.<a name=39:2></a> I think that thread runs through the chapter.<a name=39:3></a> So Martha is mentioned first.<a name=39:4></a> It says, "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus".<a name=39:5></a> When we come to chapter 12, we have Lazarus mentioned first as in the town, and then Martha, then Lazarus has his place at the table, and then Mary is mentioned.<a name=39:6></a> I think there is a thread running through, the instruction of equalisation.<a name=39:7></a> No one in the circle of fellowship should be lost sight of, nor obscured unduly.<a name=39:8></a> So that when the Lord arrives at Bethany, Martha meets Him first and He stays there where Martha met Him, until Mary arrives.<a name=39:9></a> He does not go to where Mary is; Mary has to come to where Martha met Christ.<a name=39:10></a> I think the glory of the Son of God would mean that the most is to be made of every saint.<a name=39:11></a> Although some may exceed in measure, the most is to be made of every saint, no one is to be lost sight of.<a name=39:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=39:13></a> So that we have in Philemon, "Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus" (verse 6).<a name=39:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=39:15></a> That is right -- "every good thing".<a name=39:16></a> However minute a good thing may be, it must be made the most of: "If there be any virtue, and if there be any praise".<a name=39:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=40:7></a> Quite so -- the brother.<a name=40:8></a> The glory of the Son of God would bring out and make the most of the gold, what is in that land, but then there is the operative side.<a name=40:9></a> When we come to service, to operations, a man or a brother is what he is; the glory of the Son of God will maintain fully what the brother is, even if he be discounted by the brethren; the Lord will see to it that his full value will be recognised in time.<a name=40:10></a> So in chapter 12 where we come to operations Lazarus does nothing, he represents dignity, he sits at the table with the Lord; Martha serves and Mary worships.<a name=40:11></a> That is, the quality comes into evidence when they make Him a supper; when something is to be done for Christ, measures will soon come into evidence, and that is what is so important in local assemblies, to make room for life.<a name=40:12></a> Eldership and government are only in the sense of keeping and dressing a garden, and certainly not to dwarf any growth in the garden; that would be contrary to the divine appointment, it is rather to make room for growth so that there should be the fullest development.<a name=40:13></a> And if room is made for the working out of life then we have each one's measure -- and we can see it if we go into the garden; if there is no one interfering with the growth of any tree, or plant, or flower.<a name=40:14></a>

		These scriptures speak of vessels; the idea is prevalent in the Scriptures, as most of you will be aware, and indeed has often been presented in ministry amongst us by one and another, and profitably but not exhaustively.<a name=56:1></a> No spiritual subject can be presented exhaustively.<a name=56:2></a> Spiritual subjects are in such settings as to preclude exhaustiveness; we never reach the limits or depths.<a name=56:3></a> The Spirit of God has indited the Scriptures and presented the subjects in their own proper settings, and they belong to what we may call the depths of God.<a name=56:4></a> There are the breadth and the length and the height and the depth, so that we can only speak of them in part at any time, and that is what I would aim at in speaking of this subject, to bring forth what may be applicable to us in a prophetic way if the Lord gives force to the words; what may be remarked at the outset is that the idea of vessels is that of persons, for in the spiritual realm that is how matters will stand; instrumentalities will be persons, and so it is now.<a name=56:5></a> Another remark important to be made is that we are living in remnant times, mourning times, in which some have been recovered from Babylon, from the religious world.<a name=56:6></a> We should not have been there, but some have been recovered and the idea is that each is to be usable.<a name=56:7></a> He is not only recovered for his own enjoyment, his own benefit, but to be usable, available too, for use; and so we find that in the recovery in the Old Testament a great deal is made of vessels; and the deliverer of God's people at that time, Cyrus, who not only released them but directed their way, and delivered them, a great monarch who had

		The verse indicates to us what is in mind in the use of the word in Scripture, how one begins as a believer to regard himself, that is, viewed as possessing organs and faculties and qualities and affections; that all these are wonderfully blended by the Creator and intended to be usable to the person, for enjoyment depends on these faculties and qualities that God has so wonderfully combined in the human being.<a name=57:5></a> They are for his use.<a name=57:6></a> They may seem to function automatically, as indeed they do in a babe and a child, but presently the person wakes to consciousness and understanding, and begins to see that he is master of the institution, as it were, and as a believer he is enjoined here in regard of this.<a name=57:7></a> As born of the flesh, one finds these functions, qualities and capabilities are almost certain to be used for the natural will, working out in uncleanness and viciousness, but, as born anew, the person begins to discern, to be conscious of instincts of another kind, for he is not only born of the Spirit, he is born of water.<a name=57:8></a> He is born of the Spirit and there is spiritual substance involved in that, but there is accompanying it the idea of purification.<a name=57:9></a> One of the greatest essentials, initial at least to the believer, is the idea of purification, and following on that, the idea of holiness, and following on that, the idea of honour.<a name=57:10></a> God has in mind that this

		I want to show later from Romans how he is a vessel of mercy fitted for glory, which is another great thought, another final thought indeed, but young people here will do well to pay attention to what has been said as to this idea of sanctification and honour in regard to the vessel that he possesses.<a name=58:2></a> So with this in mind we see that the epistle to the Romans, on the doctrinal side of it, works out how a believer begins to reckon as baptised, and how his members are, through the gospel, through the light and the power of the Spirit, to become released from the domination of sin, that his members are not henceforth to be yielded as instruments of unrighteousness -- they have been, but are not to be henceforth -- and so the apostle proceeds as he does in such an orderly way in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, 7 and 8 to deal with what is inside of us.<a name=58:3></a> In chapter 6 he deals more with what is outside of us, what would affect us externally, and sin as a principle, but in chapter 7 he deals with what is inside of us.<a name=58:4></a> One of the most crucial lessons to be learned by the young believer is in that chapter, and the more he goes on with God, the more he discovers it, how utterly mean he is, viewed in this way.<a name=58:5></a> The analysis brings out what he never thought existed, the further he goes on with God, the more he walks with God, the more he discovers it, what is utterly mean, and how it comes up with abhorrence at times when it should be far away, this unutterable meanness that belongs to us in a variety of ways, operating even without our wills, operating automatically through our organs.<a name=58:6></a> It is a great lesson often alluded to, perhaps not so much as it used to be, and young people do well to look into this matter, because the enemy is working, and working

		So the next verses I read, those in 2 Timothy, bring before us the idea of a vessel for God, and the passage contemplates what I have been saying.<a name=61:8></a> It is not here the question of the doctrine of Romans, it is a question of having to do with religious associations, and how we are to become vessels unto honour in the service of God, "sanctified, and meet", as it says, "for the master's use".<a name=61:9></a> The master -- that is not yourself, it is another.<a name=61:10></a> He has use for you -- He has need of you; He has need of His own.<a name=61:11></a> Indeed, of the colt the word was "the Lord has need of it",

	<div class="paragraph">
		These scriptures furnish a wide platform from which to announce the gospel; that is why they have been read this evening, the thought being, too, to link on certain remarks, certain evangelical testimony with Abraham.<a name=68:1></a> It is convenient to link the passages in Galatians with <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19">Luke  19</a>in this respect; it opens a door to speak a little on Luke, who is peculiarly the evangelist; he makes more of Abraham than any of the other so-called evangelists, and yet his object is to reach the whole of our race.<a name=68:2></a> Hence he alone records for us what the multitude of the heavenly host were saying in regard to Jesus as He was born.<a name=68:3></a> They said, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:14">Luke  2:14</a>.<a name=68:4></a> Following on that, Simeon took Jesus in his arms as a Babe -- for Luke loves to dwell on the babehood of Christ -- and blesses God in regard of Him, saying, "mine eyes have seen thy salvation"; and then, putting the gentiles first, he says, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles".<a name=68:5></a> So that Luke has a wide outlook; he presents Christ in relation to mankind; and yet he brings Abraham in; and so does Paul, enlarging on the subject in his doctrinal way, showing that the blessing of Abraham had the gentiles in mind.<a name=68:6></a> The promise to him was that he should be heir of the world -- a very wide thought -- not as circumcised, but uncircumcised.<a name=68:7></a>

		And so there is with Abraham intercession for the nations, and indeed a sort of military establishment, not to provoke war, but to rescue needy ones out of the world.<a name=70:5></a> Such was Abraham; he was confederate, too, with certain ones, not surely to be a mere worldly man, but in view of what I am speaking of; in view of the great war at that time, he was watching, considering for God, and as the opportunity arose, he rescued his brother, at great hazard, at great cost and fatigue; and not only that, but he asked God about Sodom, the wickedest city of the day.<a name=70:6></a> We are living in a day of great cities; it is a city period and there are wicked cities, too.<a name=70:7></a> We as christians are not against cities, against cities in which we reside; we do not close our eyes to the wickedness that is going on, but still, like Abraham, we are concerned about them.<a name=70:8></a> Abraham says to God, "Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?<a name=70:9></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:24">Genesis  18:24</a>.<a name=70:10></a> He does not ask God to deliver the fifty righteous out of the city; why did he not do that?<a name=70:11></a> He was thinking of saving Sodom.<a name=70:12></a> And God says, 'I will do it', "I will spare

		The next chapter continues with Jehovah Elohim coming into the garden as if He would come in to share the glory assumed to be there, because it was becoming a scene of glory, not that the word is used yet.<a name=85:2></a> I think God reserved the word for a people called out, which we do not get in these chapters -- the principle of separation.<a name=85:3></a> It was the God of glory that appeared to Abraham.<a name=85:4></a> We are not told it was the God of glory that made the heavens and the earth, but still the garden and the whole realm of creation radiated with glory, with the glory of creation; the second chapter of Genesis particularly presents the divine workmanship and development from material, suited material, already there.<a name=85:5></a> The breakdown came when God found Adam in a very different setting, alas!<a name=85:6></a> But still He kept on, and clothed Adam.<a name=85:7></a> He clothed Adam, as naming his wife Eve.<a name=85:8></a> This he did without being asked to name her; he named her rightly.<a name=85:9></a> It was an evidence of faith.<a name=85:10></a> Although there is no place for him in the list in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>, we cannot doubt that the naming of his wife and the new name that he gave her indicated that he understood something of God coming in to meet the disaster and to resume His workmanship, leading up to the accomplishment of His counsels.<a name=85:11></a> He named her Eve, meaning the mother of all living, not the mother of all dying.<a name=85:12></a> God can make nothing of those who are dead; He is the God of the living, not the God of the dead.<a name=85:13></a>

		Well now, having said so much on that point, I proceed to my direct subject, but I do hope the brethren can follow what I have said, because it implies two things, that if we are to be material for God's workings He has to be pleased with us (at least in principle, if not in detail) for He does not

		propose to operate with us to His displeasure.<a name=86:1></a> There is therefore the idea of righteousness, and being accounted righteous.<a name=86:2></a> Now these two thoughts are worked out, dear brethren, in Romans, and I touch on that epistle for a moment, so as to make clear what I have in mind in the two scriptures read.<a name=86:3></a> Romans contemplates men and women coming in under God's eye suitably attired; He attires them Himself.<a name=86:4></a> "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood .<a name=86:5></a>.<a name=86:6></a>.<a name=86:7></a> so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:24">Romans  3:24</a> - 26.<a name=86:8></a> That is, He removes all encumbrances from us and looks upon us as clothed, robed in His righteousness through faith -- "having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God"; Christ being delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification, we have been justified by faith and have access into this favour in which we stand -- that is, God is pleased with us.<a name=86:9></a> That is a matter of faith, not yet of works, but of faith.<a name=86:10></a> And then the next thing is that those so regarded are more or less satisfied with their position.<a name=86:11></a> It is a poor thing if people talk about being justified, if they are not more or less satisfied as to their position, for God accompanies this wonderful position in the way of clothing, that is, righteousness, with a certain means of satisfaction, and so He sheds abroad His love in our hearts by the Spirit.<a name=86:12></a> The writer of the epistle says that not only have we access into the favour, sensibly pleasing to God, but we glory in tribulations, a remarkable thing!<a name=86:13></a> And the reason is given that tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, for the love of God is to be in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given to us.<a name=86:14></a> Therefore, you see, dear brethren, that God accompanies this wonderful clothing which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=87>[Page 87]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		pleases Him with the means of satisfaction.<a name=87:1></a> I hope every christian here is satisfied with the new position.<a name=87:2></a> I am leading up now to the idea, not of our blessing, but of material that God can use.<a name=87:3></a> And then the Spirit goes on to say that we have received the reconciliation -- we have received it -- that is, we are moving inwardly, and appropriating what there is, and grace is reigning through righteousness unto eternal life; the whole problem raised by sin is settled on the divine side.<a name=87:4></a> So we may well be satisfied.<a name=87:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then in chapter 6 the Spirit of God through the apostle brings up the question of baptism so as to bring out this matter of material, for the epistle to the Romans is to bring out material for God's use, and one great thought in it is that we are to recognise the rights of God, presenting our bodies a living sacrifice, which is our reasonable and intelligent service, that we "may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:2">Romans  12:2</a>.<a name=87:6></a> Now God would say, 'You are material that I can use.<a name=87:7></a> I have a great many things in My mind, but I am waiting on you.<a name=87:8></a> I am ready to use you, but I have My own mind about material, it must be according to My mind (at least in the principle of it) and I am waiting for it'.<a name=87:9></a> That is the epistle to the Romans which contains many other things, of course, thank God.<a name=87:10></a> I am only touching on two points -- the clothing and the satisfaction, and then thirdly, I should say, the acknowledgment of the rights of God.<a name=87:11></a> Chapter 6 shows how a believer takes account of himself as baptised, as God's property; he yields his members as instruments of righteousness unto God.<a name=87:12></a> He has his own fruit, of course.<a name=87:13></a> All through these chapters the believer is taken account of, for God would have us to understand He is not thinking of Himself only, He is thinking of us, and the believer is always provided for, so it says, "ye have your fruit unto holiness", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:22">Romans  6:22</a>.<a name=87:14></a> Ye have your fruit, and the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, this raises a very important question, dear brethren, as to how we stand in regard to the rights of God.<a name=88:2></a> Romans develops this great principle, and, as accepting it, we prove "what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God".<a name=88:3></a> Based on it, we are said to be "one body", not yet the body of Christ; Romans does not say that, but one body in Christ; that is, we are lifted out of all other bodies into a status described in this remarkable phrase -- one body in Christ; and the intent is to clear us, as a ship clears her berth when in port so that she might proceed on her voyage and God would clear us of everything that holds us here, so that He might have us for His great purpose; "we, being many, are one body in Christ", and that negates every other body; whatever name it may hold or bear, we are clear of it.<a name=88:4></a> Not simply that we should be one body, but we are.<a name=88:5></a> God has given us such a status that there is clearance from every body here, from every organisation here that would claim us.<a name=88:6></a> This matter is urgent, for God has His great purpose, dear brethren, to work out, and He is looking for material, and He is prescribing what the material is to be, that is, we are presenting our bodies a living sacrifice -- living, you notice -- "that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God".<a name=88:7></a> A wonderful path opens up to the christian, suffering, of course, but, as I said, suffering or tribulation worketh patience; it becomes one of the workers for our blessing.<a name=88:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, the second letter to the Corinthians brings in this question of writing, and speaks of it as an accomplished thing in regard to the Corinthians; it shows that the christian has a heart different from the unbeliever's; he has a heart different from the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the Corinthians are regarded as having hearts of flesh.<a name=89:9></a> Of course, you say, naturally that is so.<a name=89:10></a> We have to understand words in their context in Scripture, and the fleshy tables of the heart here manifestly allude, not to the natural heart of man, but to the heart softened by the work of God.<a name=89:11></a> The Old Testament spoke much of this, God saying that He would give His people a heart of flesh.<a name=89:12></a> He said He would take away 'the heart of stone', and He has before Him, beloved brethren, to take away all the stone hearts presently, so that His laws shall be written on every heart -- "The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#11:9">Isaiah  11:9</a>); what a prospect!<a name=89:13></a> He has begun to do it, and I believe the Corinthians were intended to be an epistle of Christ to remind men that He is doing this sort of thing.<a name=89:14></a> An epistle is an important thought -- being "manifestly declared", says the apostle, "to be the epistle of Christ".<a name=89:15></a>

		That is the Corinthians, but, before I enlarge on that, I want to speak about those who minister, what kind of hearts they should have -- surely not less softened than the hearts of those ministered to; and hence the apostle refers to some of them who were saying he needed a letter of commendation.<a name=90:1></a> Just think of the hardness of the brethren, so-called, in that city!<a name=90:2></a> That they should turn in their minds against the very man whom God had used to convert them, to bring the light to them, and classify him with the most unknown person in their midst, and say that he needed a letter of commendation!<a name=90:3></a> He says, "<i>Ye</i> are our letter".<a name=90:4></a> Oh, you say, would they have to come to Corinth to read Paul's letter of commendation?<a name=90:5></a> No, they did not.<a name=90:6></a> He moved about.<a name=90:7></a> He moved about very much, and he says, "<i>Ye</i> are our letter, written in our hearts".<a name=90:8></a> What a word for those who seek to serve the Lord's people!<a name=90:9></a> What a challenge to the place the Lord's people have in our hearts!<a name=90:10></a> The more you serve them really, the more you love them.<a name=90:11></a> You would never call them rebels, nor would you speak ill of them.<a name=90:12></a> If you have to speak the truth about them, that is another matter; Paul did that, but it was not characteristic ill-speaking, no, never.<a name=90:13></a> He says, wherever I go, I bring you up, you are written in my heart; I cannot help it, as it were, and you are known and read of all men.<a name=90:14></a> Not only do I speak about you, but the people I speak about you to, see you are in my heart.<a name=90:15></a> If I heard Paul speak about the Corinthians I should say what a love he had for them, what a love he had for those saints!<a name=90:16></a> He had been eighteen months with them.<a name=90:17></a> I know well enough the difficulty in getting to know the brethren personally, for the reason that one has so little time to be with them.<a name=90:18></a> Eighteen months certainly gives you an opportunity to see the varied beauties of the work of God coming out in the saints.<a name=90:19></a> The more you see that, the more you love

		them, and that is exactly how it was with the apostle Paul.<a name=91:1></a> He loved them and he says, "<i>Ye</i> are our letter".<a name=91:2></a> Who could question that he was an apostle, that he was fit for fellowship, a man that could speak of the saints as he could, and did, and show that he loved them, for you could read in his countenance what his heart was in regard to those saints!<a name=91:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, what a delight that is to heaven in regard to the ministers!<a name=91:4></a> And then he says,"Ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart:" The last clause brings me to what I have in mind for old and young here about these fleshy tables, and about this clearance from earthly associations that I have been speaking of, about this status that God gives us collectively in this world, "one body in Christ".<a name=91:5></a> Is it to be marred?<a name=91:6></a> Are we not to retain softness of affection for Christ and for one another?<a name=91:7></a> If we leave the thought of this holy status, this holy elevation the Lord gives us, we merge into the world and the hardening process begins.<a name=91:8></a> It is as sure as anything can be, that if I slip back in any measure into the world, the hardening process begins.<a name=91:9></a> "Harden not your hearts", says the Spirit of God.<a name=91:10></a> But the world has that effect upon us in spite of ourselves, hence the need of keeping clear and of maintaining the status we have, the initial status we have collectively, according to Romans.<a name=91:11></a> That is, we are one body in Christ; we are in association; christians are an association in that sense, but not a partisan one; they have a status outside the world -- one body in Christ.<a name=91:12></a>

		Well, now, in the second scripture I read in the book of Revelation, we have this remarkable writing that the Lord speaks of.<a name=93:5></a> It is a writing that applies to remnant times, and it is an exalted kind of writing.<a name=93:6></a> I do not know of any other writing so exalted as is contemplated here, save that which is on Christ Himself.<a name=93:7></a> In chapter 19 of this book we are told that the Lord Jesus is coming out of heaven, in a military sense, with the armies of heaven following Him to do battle with the rebellious nations of the earth.<a name=93:8></a> When He comes out He has a name written; it does not say who wrote it, but it is written, and no one knows that name but Himself.<a name=93:9></a> That is to say, we are in the presence of the inscrutable.<a name=93:10></a> That must be the most exalted thought in writing, and then again, we are told, He has a name on His garment and on His thigh -- "King of kings, and Lord of lords".<a name=93:11></a> It does not say who wrote it.<a name=93:12></a> It is there, it is indelibly there.<a name=93:13></a> Writing from God's point of view is to remain; it is indelible, and no one can question that great 'General-in-chief' and the great "King of kings" in that day.<a name=93:14></a> Christians look with great encouragement to that great war, that can only end one way, when the beast and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire and their armies consumed

		The statement in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>is a great general principle which has marked the dealings and ways of God since sin came into the world.<a name=115:4></a> The necessity for the taking away of the first was evident from the very outset, and in effect was there when Adam was driven out of the garden with no possibility of return, as of "the first"; and what is to be observed is the failure of the men of faith, the most distinguished of them, to observe this principle.<a name=115:5></a>

		I shall touch on a few of these instances in Genesis again to bring out the positive side, but I wish to show how this failure I have alluded to is particularly exemplified in Jehoshaphat.<a name=116:2></a> We may take him to be representative of conditions in most of our meetings at the present time, and indeed of the history of the assembly as more or less recognising the rights of Christ and recognising the Spirit, for Jehoshaphat was a good king.<a name=116:3></a> He loved the Lord.<a name=116:4></a> There can be no church status at all aside from this, for it is out of love to God and to Christ that we show our loyalty, keeping His commandments and practising righteousness.<a name=116:5></a> Aside therefore from love to God there is nothing.<a name=116:6></a> If we have not got love, it says, we are nothing.<a name=116:7></a> In however little a measure it may exist in a company or a person God owns that company and that person.<a name=116:8></a> He has them always in His mind and they have first place with Him at all times.<a name=116:9></a> Lovers of God, according to Scripture, exist at all times.<a name=116:10></a> You will remember how He spoke of them at Sinai, when demanding love as He had a right to do; in asking that, He spoke of the thousands who love Him and He has them in His mind; they are the positive side to God's operations.<a name=116:11></a> They afford Him constant pleasure; they are the drink-offering all the time to God and He puts up with much because of them; but then He never conceals any discrepancies from those who are responsible.<a name=116:12></a> Love will not fail to bring forward discrepancies, because it is not love at all to pass them over.<a name=116:13></a> God is slow to anger, we are told, but still He never forgets anything in this sense.<a name=116:14></a> He requires what is past, and the Holy Spirit

		Now the positive side comes out in the book of Genesis, where we see how the second is maintained and the first set aside.<a name=122:8></a> We get the best illustrations of Scripture to show how the thing is effected.<a name=122:9></a> So I would allude first to Sarah, the mother, when Isaac was born.<a name=122:10></a> Ishmael had been born some thirteen or fourteen years before, he was the first and had been in the house all those years.<a name=122:11></a> Abraham had prayed for him, 'Jehovah, will you not take on this firstborn of mine?<a name=122:12></a> Let him live before Thee'.<a name=122:13></a> That was Abraham's mind.<a name=122:14></a> He was going on with the first, but as soon as Isaac comes in -- that is Christ in a spiritual sense -- Ishmael's character comes to light.<a name=122:15></a> I am saying what may apply to that which is spiritual in any one of us, in a family or in a meeting.<a name=122:16></a> He that is born after the flesh will persecute him that is born after the Spirit.<a name=122:17></a> It goes on in a meeting according to Galatians and it goes on in a family as with Joseph.<a name=122:18></a> What is to be learned here is the mother element; that is the spiritual maternal feeling that is proper to a company of saints walking professedly in the light of the assembly.<a name=122:19></a> Jerusalem above is said to be our mother, not Jerusalem in heaven; the thought is elevation, as Abram, which means 'high father'.<a name=122:20></a> Sarah took on the thought; she refers to the spiritual instincts, the motherly instincts that are proper to a gathering of saints professedly walking in recognition of Christ as Head and of the Spirit and of one another.<a name=122:21></a> We do not want the first; we do not make special friendships with brothers or sisters because they are likable to us in a natural way or because they are of the same spiritual status.<a name=122:22></a> The disallowance of the first means that I renounce all

		A SINNER CUT OFF AND A SINNER CONVERTED

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will see, dear friends, that I have read about two kings: one of them, Ahab, who is spoken of in the first scripture, was an inveterate sinner.<a name=127:1></a> He is said to have been the worst of all Israel's kings; having added to his wickedness an alliance with Jezebel who was a murderess.<a name=127:2></a> The other monarch, David, well known, was not an inveterate sinner, but a great saint, a prophet, too, and a psalmist, but also a sinner.<a name=127:3></a> He had after his conversion committed two great sins, one of which is mentioned in the passage I read.<a name=127:4></a> I will come to him finally, but the similarity in these two passages is striking: the one king, Ahab, guilty in the passage mentioned of failure in trust, a common thing amongst men; indeed, it has marked men from the beginning; the other, David, guilty of covetousness; he had been enjoined not to covet his neighbour's wife, and he did, and his covetousness led to murder.<a name=127:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ahab's sin particularly in view here is failure in a trust, as I said; such is very common; it began indeed with Adam and Eve, and has marked perhaps every man and woman ever since to some extent.<a name=127:6></a> Adam, as you will know, was entrusted with dominion, and with the care of the garden; he was to dress it and guard it.<a name=127:7></a> And we are told later that he transgressed in this respect; he was put under covenant in regard to the garden, and he transgressed.<a name=127:8></a> He was covetous, too, and he failed in trust, and that is the particular sin spoken of in this passage I read in regard of Ahab.<a name=127:9></a> It is for each of us to see whether it applies to us, as unconverted, if indeed there be such here.<a name=127:10></a> I hope there is not.<a name=127:11></a> You may say to me, 'Well, we would expect that you would be glad if
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there were those unconverted here'; but I cannot but be glad if they are all converted.<a name=128:1></a> If every single person in this room is converted the more thankful I am, and it will not in the least interfere with what I am saying.<a name=128:2></a> If there are any unconverted it is for you to challenge your own heart as to why you have failed under this heading.<a name=128:3></a> There are many counts against you, but God is often pleased to take up one particular count; in these scriptures it is one sin, in each case.<a name=128:4></a> David's was a dual sin, but it was really one, covetousness begetting murder.<a name=128:5></a> It is God's way indeed to convict under one heading.<a name=128:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The number of sins of which Ahab was guilty would be beyond count as far as we are concerned.<a name=128:7></a> The Spirit of God stresses that he was an exceedingly wicked man, but He confines Himself here to this one count, that he was untrustworthy in a trust committed to his hands.<a name=128:8></a> He had had wonderful consideration from God and if there is one unconverted person here tonight I can say the same to you, that you have had up to the present time wonderful consideration from God.<a name=128:9></a> You may have never thanked Him once; the air you breathe, the food you eat, the sun, the clothes you wear and thousands of other things are evidence of God's consideration for you; and so it was with Ahab.<a name=128:10></a> It is indeed striking that God spoke so often to him, and that kindly, giving him support in two instances, so that he was able in war to overcome vastly superior armies to his own.<a name=128:11></a> And in many other instances God showed consideration for him in spite of his wickedness.<a name=128:12></a> And so it is that God is showing consideration for the Ahabs at the present time, particularly those in responsibility.<a name=128:13></a> In a sense Ahab represents the whole christian profession, he represents the responsibility in the profession, while Jezebel, his wife, represents the corrupting element in the profession.<a name=128:14></a> He is responsible for her.<a name=128:15></a> He, Ahab, is particularly responsible,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=129>[Page 129]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and God is constantly showing him kindness and consideration, supporting him against his enemies.<a name=129:1></a> And so today God is working in christendom, for the preaching is in christendom; this is not a partisan meeting, it is not sectarian.<a name=129:2></a> The gospel preached here tonight is in relation to the whole testimony of God and every meeting like this has the same character.<a name=129:3></a> They carry with them the evidence of God's consideration for christendom.<a name=129:4></a> In such meetings as this there is a clear sounding out of the testimony of God in the gospel and that testimony is for the Pope, for the Archbishop, for every dignitary in christendom, as well as for every poor man and beggar, for God is no respecter of persons, and the testimony today is for the whole profession.<a name=129:5></a> God is carrying on in spite of adverse conditions and apathy on the part of those whom He would serve, and so in this particular instance God is focusing his testimony on Ahab under the count that he is responsible for a charge.<a name=129:6></a> And so this prophet suffers in order that the testimony that God intended should come to him.<a name=129:7></a> No one is rightly affected if not in some sense characterised by suffering.<a name=129:8></a> Paul said he endured all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<a name=129:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So this prophet says to a man, "Smite me".<a name=129:10></a> Normally it would be 'Do not smite me'.<a name=129:11></a> But here he is a witness for God ready to suffer.<a name=129:12></a> He would present to the leading man in the profession the divine thought.<a name=129:13></a> In order that there should be salvation for men, and a gospel testimony, there must be suffering.<a name=129:14></a> There are those who advocate a bloodless christianity, who would either deny the atoning sacrifice of Jesus or becloud it, but God is insisting that the only ground on which man can be saved is through the atoning sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=129:15></a> And how can we present it more effectively than by suffering ourselves?<a name=129:16></a>

		Those who present the testimony are to have some sense of this characteristic.<a name=130:1></a> So this man says to his fellow, "Smite me".<a name=130:2></a> The man says, 'No, I will not do that'.<a name=130:3></a> Possibly he was a unitarian, one who would say, 'Why should a loving God cause anyone to suffer?<a name=130:4></a>' But then, beloved friends, if we are to be exempt from suffering someone must suffer; that is the gospel, that someone has suffered, "that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:3">1 Corinthians  15:3</a>, 4.<a name=130:5></a> He "himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:24">1 Peter  2:24</a>); the Lord Jesus Christ entered into death and not only death but crucifixion.<a name=130:6></a> He suffered.<a name=130:7></a> So this servant of God asked a man to smite him.<a name=130:8></a> 'No', he said, 'I will not do that'.<a name=130:9></a> He did not believe in an atonement through suffering, that is the spiritual meaning of the passage.<a name=130:10></a> He was in accord with the king, who let the king of Syria, the enemy of God, off without penalty, and this is what we are doing if we are not converted up to the present time, we are letting the culprit off without suffering and talking of the world as if it were not under penalty.<a name=130:11></a> God is calling to account about it.<a name=130:12></a> He would say, as here, 'You have let a man go whom I have appointed to destruction; you are giving him full rein -- as far as you are concerned'.<a name=130:13></a> This man says, 'No, I will not smite you, christianity does not demand that'.<a name=130:14></a> 'Well', the prophet says, 'If you do not smite me, you will be smitten'.<a name=130:15></a> If you refuse the atoning sacrifice of Christ, that it meant suffering from the hand of God, that a just God must punish sin; if you refuse that you will suffer and you will die in your sins without hope.<a name=130:16></a> You will be raised in them, and consigned to eternal punishment in them.<a name=130:17></a> It is a terrible thing to deny the atoning sufferings of Jesus; there are those who do it.<a name=130:18></a> Well, presently a lion came and slew the man according to the word of the Lord, and then the prophet said to another, "Smite

		me", and he smote him violently.<a name=131:1></a> That man believes that the Lord Jesus was smitten violently; he believes that the Lord Jesus endured unmitigated judgment as the Sin-bearer, that He endured the cross, that He endured the forsaking of God.<a name=131:2></a> That man smote the prophet violently and wounded him; he is now in correspondence with Christ; he conceals himself and waits for the king.<a name=131:3></a> You may be just like that, in that God has had an ambush here waiting on you.<a name=131:4></a> The prophet knew the king would pass there; that man was unfaithful to God, and this testimony of God was waiting by the wayside.<a name=131:5></a> You may have been invited to come here tonight, and the testimony is waiting for you; this meeting here tonight is in order that there may be a word for you.<a name=131:6></a> So here is this man, he is thinking of the sinner who has failed in his trust, who is unfaithful in his covenant, and he says to the king, 'A man brought me a man, and he told me to keep him, and that I should pay a talent of silver if I did not keep him; I was busy, and the man is gone'.<a name=131:7></a> He is excusing himself.<a name=131:8></a> What is he doing that for?<a name=131:9></a> He is putting the thoughts of the king into words which immediately came into his mind.<a name=131:10></a> God, as it were, would apprise you of the thoughts that arise as the testimony is brought to you, as you are convicted and as the light strikes you.<a name=131:11></a> If you wish to resist it you will excuse yourself, you are 'busy', but you cannot get off like that, you know; God will not let you off.<a name=131:12></a> In this gospel period God is aiming at man's conscience; you may trifle, you may excuse yourself, but He will not let you off; He has a way of keeping the thing on your conscience that you may confess.<a name=131:13></a> If you do not confess as time after time God has brought it to your conscience you may be like Ahab, suddenly cut off, and that without remedy.<a name=131:14></a> Ahab says, 'Well, you condemn yourself', but the prophet says, 'It is you'.<a name=131:15></a> It may be there is somebody here that will criticise

		others in order to screen himself, but the testimony of God is that you are the person.<a name=132:1></a> And Ahab went to his house sullen and displeased; there was no self-judgment with him, there was no heart humbling with him.<a name=132:2></a> He had allowed the king of Syria his liberty although he was the enemy of God and the enemy of God's people.<a name=132:3></a> Is that a small thing?<a name=132:4></a> No, God says that is a great thing and Ahab's life hung upon it, and he was cut off without remedy.<a name=132:5></a> How solemn that is!<a name=132:6></a> He had another opportunity, it is true.<a name=132:7></a> He was covetous, and his wife relieved him by killing Naboth, and God again convicted him and Ahab humbled himself, but it meant very little, as the next chapter tells us that he was cut off without remedy.<a name=132:8></a> He is a striking example of hardness of heart in men who even know something about humbling themselves, and yet pursue their wicked way and are cut off without remedy.<a name=132:9></a> May I appeal to anyone like that here tonight.<a name=132:10></a> You are particularly guilty, in that you have transgressed in this way, if you are not a believer in Christ.<a name=132:11></a> God is calling upon you to judge yourself.<a name=132:12></a> Do not be like Ahab and return to your house sullen and displeased.<a name=132:13></a> Humble yourself before God for it is a question of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=132:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go on to David and here the case is very different.<a name=132:15></a> David, although guilty of great sin, knew how to judge himself.<a name=132:16></a> What is so remarkable about David is that he is said to have had a seer, his name was Gad; he had him almost all his life.<a name=132:17></a> We read of him in the cave of Adullam, and we read of him late in David's life when he sinned in numbering the people.<a name=132:18></a> Why bring that in, you say, what has Gad got to do with this?<a name=132:19></a> It means that David always allowed something near him to prick his conscience, he would never have a seared conscience.<a name=132:20></a> The real difficulty with many christians who sin, and they do sin and need to be converted when they sin, is that

		they do not keep the conscience right.<a name=133:1></a> David never dismissed Gad.<a name=133:2></a> So when he committed the great sin of numbering the people Gad was there, and God used him.<a name=133:3></a> So it is when anything happens to any of us, if I have a conscience, if I maintain my conscience, if I do not disallow my conscience, then I am safe, for God can get at me.<a name=133:4></a> If I harden my heart, if I steel my conscience, as they did in the wilderness, then there is no hope.<a name=133:5></a> We must keep on our Gads.<a name=133:6></a> Gad was said to be a seer.<a name=133:7></a> He was a prophet, of course, but he was a seer, and the idea of a conscience is that it discerns when we are unfaithful to God.<a name=133:8></a> We may be untrue secretly or publicly, we may dismiss our Gads, and go and do as we please and the course may be long and the end sorrowful, but if we retain our Gads as accusers we are all right.<a name=133:9></a> We read indeed of consciences that excuse, but they are not divinely given consciences.<a name=133:10></a> David kept his Gad with him, he was a man that would accuse David when a sin was committed.<a name=133:11></a> Here you have Nathan.<a name=133:12></a> David never complained about Gad or Nathan, he was always ready to listen to them.<a name=133:13></a> He had committed a great sin; he had coveted, and he had committed murder to cover his covetousness.<a name=133:14></a> He had not judged it; he was guilty of it and God held him to it, for He requires what is past even in a christian.<a name=133:15></a> Nathan is available to God and he comes in fearlessly to the king, and speaks his parable.<a name=133:16></a> How gracious of God to get round us in that way!<a name=133:17></a> "There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.<a name=133:18></a> The rich had very many flocks and herds; but the poor man had nothing at all but one little ewe lamb".<a name=133:19></a> How affecting!<a name=133:20></a> It was such a parable as would appeal to a man like David.<a name=133:21></a> God knows how to speak to us as sin occurs; He knows just what will reach your conscience and He prepared His servant Nathan to speak this beautiful parable to the sinner.<a name=133:22></a> How gracious!<a name=133:23></a> David deserved to be smitten; it was a

		So Nathan goes over the ground touchingly, and David said, 'That man deserves to die!<a name=134:5></a>' So he did, but he did not die; God was gracious to him.<a name=134:6></a> You may have confessed Christ in earlier days but now something has happened.<a name=134:7></a> God is peculiarly concerned about those in whom He has wrought.<a name=134:8></a> The woman in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#13">Luke  13</a>was bound for eighteen years.<a name=134:9></a> So here the devil tempted David to do this great sin, and it has not been settled.<a name=134:10></a> God is now approaching the sinner that the sin might be judged and forgiven.<a name=134:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		THE ELEMENTS THAT MILITATE AGAINST THE FAMILY OF GOD

		I wish to speak of the family of God as presented in this gospel and of the elements that militate against it; more particularly of the elements that militate against the ministry intended for its instruction and guidance and refreshment.<a name=137:1></a> In view of speaking of the latter I shall have to refer to other scriptures besides these three, but I thought of confining myself to these three as on the positive side of the subject and to refer to others as the address may require.<a name=137:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall find what intrudes in chapters 2 and 7.<a name=137:3></a> These negative features may be divided into natural relationships and religion as currently accepted in the world, and will be spoken of under those heads.<a name=137:4></a> The enemy is inveterately active to becloud and spoil the family of God.<a name=137:5></a> John has it in mind throughout; he was a suitable vessel unto the Lord for this purpose, one who valued affection, valued love.<a name=137:6></a> John pours contempt upon any system or person devoid of love.<a name=137:7></a> Judas is outstanding in this and John never fails to cite the Lord as knowing Judas.<a name=137:8></a> The Lord was never in the least degree unaware of Judas, who he was and what he was.<a name=137:9></a> No love is negative, but hatred is sure to be there along with such a condition.<a name=137:10></a> Before John proceeds very far in his gospel, he reaches the main point, namely the family.<a name=137:11></a> He speaks of the Lord in these early verses as no other scriptural writer speaks, establishing incontestably His deity and speaking of Him not simply as a phase of the Deity, but as a Person in it, One who is designated as God.<a name=137:12></a> The Word was God.<a name=137:13></a> And he pursues the thought as to the Lord here in flesh, saying, "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew

		him not".<a name=138:1></a> The Person here in flesh was the Maker of the world.<a name=138:2></a> It did not know its Maker.<a name=138:3></a> What it must have been in the Lord's mind in this relation is to be meditated upon, how He felt in regard to His own work.<a name=138:4></a> He was in the world, and it knew Him not; He made it, but it knew Him not.<a name=138:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, He came unto His own.<a name=138:6></a> There were those that were His own, involving the whole testimony rendered in regard to Israel.<a name=138:7></a> All the beautiful expressions and pleadings under the title Jehovah in the Old Testament come into this.<a name=138:8></a> He came unto His <i>own</i> and His <i>own</i> received Him not.<a name=138:9></a> That is how the matter stood.<a name=138:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then the divine family, the family of God is introduced; they are marked off as receiving Christ.<a name=138:11></a> It may be there are some here who have not received Christ.<a name=138:12></a> "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God".<a name=138:13></a> It is presented in this way: they received Him.<a name=138:14></a> It marks the family of God; it marks the members, that they receive Christ.<a name=138:15></a> And they are accorded the right, as it says, to be children of God.<a name=138:16></a> A right is something that is to be taken up and if God accords us a right He loves us to take it up.<a name=138:17></a> He has accorded those who have received Christ the right to be His children, and lest it might be in any way disparaged, for we are apt to belittle our greatest privileges, John says, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:1">1 John  3:1</a>.<a name=138:18></a> All the dignities of heaven would bow to that, would recognise our rank.<a name=138:19></a> We are <i>called</i>; that is our rank here; we have the right to take the place.<a name=138:20></a> And then John shows that we believe on His name and that we have been born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<a name=138:21></a> That is our lineage, it is indisputable.<a name=138:22></a> Lineage, birth, is greater than creation; we are the creatures of God, too, but birth is greater: we are born, as it says, of God.<a name=138:23></a> Our

		position therefore is indisputable.<a name=139:1></a> It is not adoption; children are not adopted, sons are adopted.<a name=139:2></a> The only son not adopted is Jesus; He is born.<a name=139:3></a> "Thou art my Son; I this day have begotten thee", says Jehovah (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:7">Psalm  2:7</a>).<a name=139:4></a> He is unique in that as in many other ways.<a name=139:5></a> We have received the adoption, the sonship, but we are born children, and hence the peculiar kind of dignity attached to the family viewed in this way.<a name=139:6></a> Nature goes with it; the divine nature goes with it, that is, the family feeling and instinct and nature.<a name=139:7></a> So that you say that person has not only the right to be a child, he is called that, and he is that.<a name=139:8></a> The word 'called' does not mean that I am called into it, but I am addressed in that way and I am that.<a name=139:9></a> "Now are we children of God", it says (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:2">1 John  3:2</a>).<a name=139:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now I want to make this work out in the local setting, because that is how christianity becomes more tangible and concrete to us, especially if we are not travellers.<a name=139:11></a> It is what you see worked out in a company of believers in a locality.<a name=139:12></a> John works it out in chapters 9 to 12 and later in its general bearing, culminating in chapter 20.<a name=139:13></a> They were not called children there, but the brethren of Christ, the family thought.<a name=139:14></a> That thought runs through into eternity, dear brethren.<a name=139:15></a> "Go to my brethren", says the Lord to Mary, "and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=139:16></a> Those very words may be used, and will be used in the eternal state of things.<a name=139:17></a> Think of those words being used in eternity -- "My Father and your Father", "My God and your God", "My brethren".<a name=139:18></a> He will be the Firstborn amongst us, anointed with the oil of gladness above us as He is now, but still that is the setting, My Father, your Father, My God, your God.<a name=139:19></a> All that enters into John's gospel, and I want to show how it works out locally; so chapter 9 takes up a man who is an outcast.<a name=139:20></a>

		act but by the act of that religion.<a name=140:1></a> The family cannot be developed in the accepted religions of this world.<a name=140:2></a> You may take that as an absolute truth; not that you may not get light, for there is light in religions professing Christian ground.<a name=140:3></a> Wherever doctrines of Christianity are held in any sense, even in a creed, there is light and God works in relation to that.<a name=140:4></a> Most of us, perhaps, would not be here tonight as we are, were it not that God operates in relation to those systems, but now we have nothing to do with them because they are not according to Scripture.<a name=140:5></a> But God is greater than all, greater than our unbelieving hearts, and He rises above all these incongruities and iniquities that exist in Christendom and operates in spite of them, as we see for instance in Moses and Aaron, who were at one time typical of lawlessness.<a name=140:6></a> Moses called the people of God rebels and he smote the rock contrary to divine command, and yet water flowed in spite of that.<a name=140:7></a> And so today in spite of man's lawlessness, God is operating, and the water flows and the light shines and the Spirit operates and men are born again.<a name=140:8></a> That is going on all the time; but notwithstanding all that, you may accept as absolutely true that the family of God cannot be developed in a humanly organised worldly religion.<a name=140:9></a> Given all credit possible, it is absolutely true that there are no conditions for the development of the family of God in a humanly organised and humanly recognised religion.<a name=140:10></a> Hence this man was still among the Jews in Jerusalem in chapter 9.<a name=140:11></a> The Lord opened his eyes in Jerusalem.<a name=140:12></a> Many of us have had our eyes opened in these circumstances, but his faithful confession of Christ as a Man who had opened his eyes, led to his being cast out.<a name=140:13></a> And that is another absolute truth, that if, in any of these organised religions of the world, a believer is faithful to his light, he will be cast out.<a name=140:14></a> If he stayed there it must be a compromise between

		Now, the Lord heard it.<a name=141:2></a> These are great incidents in heaven, great items of news up there.<a name=141:3></a> When a man is cast out of a humanly organised religion for his defence of Christ, it is a signal matter in heaven.<a name=141:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is put that way, that Jesus heard it.<a name=141:5></a> Heaven has got ears as well as eyes.<a name=141:6></a> Of course God is all-knowing, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and the Holy Spirit is here having first-hand knowledge of every transaction, small and great, and yet it is put that way, that Jesus heard it, and He moved according to what He heard and found that man.<a name=141:7></a> He is looking for such men; such men are of the greatest interest to heaven and as soon as the Lord hears of any He finds them.<a name=141:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He found this man as an outcast.<a name=141:9></a> Now the Lord says in effect, This is the kind of man that I can use in the family, he belongs to it.<a name=141:10></a> This is the beginning of a section that culminates in chapter 12 where the Lord comes deliberately to the town of Bethany six days before the passover; coming in relation to Lazarus and others of the family there.<a name=141:11></a> The subject begins here.<a name=141:12></a> That is, the Lord is seen as over the house.<a name=141:13></a> He had said in chapter 8 that the Son is over the house and that if the Son sets you free ye shall be really free.<a name=141:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this man is cast out, and the Lord says, 'This is the man I want'.<a name=141:15></a> If there is one here tonight moved in any way by what I am saying, I would tell you the Lord is interested in you and He will move towards you and give you to understand there is a place in the family for you.<a name=141:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing here is, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=141:17></a>" The Lord does not say, 'Do you believe on Me?<a name=141:18></a>' Volumes of truth are wrapped up in that question.<a name=141:19></a> The Son of God is to be believed on, and as you take that ground as the man did here,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then chapter 11 brings before us that the members of this family are loved personally.<a name=142:2></a> They are loved as a family, but they are loved severally, a very precious thought.<a name=142:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First of all the sisters send to the Lord saying, "He whom thou lovest is sick", and He loved that message.<a name=142:4></a> I am sure it was a delightful message that somebody knew that He loved somebody.<a name=142:5></a> How precious it is to know that you are loved personally by Jesus and others know that you are, and they tell Jesus that He loves you.<a name=142:6></a> "He whom thou lovest is sick".<a name=142:7></a> And then we are told that "Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus", so that there is no mistake about it.<a name=142:8></a> The sisters were right.<a name=142:9></a> They did not say to the Lord, 'You love us three', but, 'You love somebody and that somebody is sick'.<a name=142:10></a> But the Spirit of God does not leave it at that but goes on to record that Jesus loved each member of the family.<a name=142:11></a> Table talk amongst us is very often unedifying, degrading indeed; this young sister or that is engaged, that is very interesting, and so on.<a name=142:12></a> But do you ever hear it said that the Lord loves that young sister?<a name=142:13></a> It is a beautiful word, that the Lord loves that person, and then again that she loves Him.<a name=142:14></a> That kind of a conversation is listened to in heaven; heaven can join in that.<a name=142:15></a> As it says, "They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a>), it does not say what they said, but it does say the Lord hearkened and heard.<a name=142:16></a> He was pleased with what they said.<a name=142:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We might multiply suggestions of that kind so that the brethren might be more elevated in their table and supper talks, because the holy things ministered to us in these meetings are very often annulled by these talks and laughs and jokes.<a name=142:18></a> In order that it might be understood that these sisters were right, the

		Spirit of God says that the Lord not only loved Lazarus but the two sisters as well.<a name=143:1></a> That is the family; that is the family at least in the sense of its members in a locality.<a name=143:2></a> That is what is in view in this section.<a name=143:3></a> Something was to happen in this locality that should glorify the Son of God, that should glorify God, and this shining out of glory should be in relation to love already known and there, Christ's love to these three.<a name=143:4></a> Love is the shining out of the divine glory.<a name=143:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord remained away for two days deliberately and then He went to that town, and one of those sisters that was loved, heard that He was there and she went out to see Him.<a name=143:6></a> It was a great matter to her.<a name=143:7></a> She is the one that we should regard as the least spiritual of the three.<a name=143:8></a> The Spirit of God mentions her as the first of the three.<a name=143:9></a> Luke mentions her and leaves her grumbling with a rebuke from the Lord.<a name=143:10></a> But the rebuke was not for nothing, for John mentions her as a good sister, a lovable sister that the Lord Jesus could love.<a name=143:11></a> The Lord has a keen sense of lovableness.<a name=143:12></a> If Martha was loved in this way it was because she was lovable.<a name=143:13></a> His rebuke had been effective; she was a different woman now from what she was when the Lord entered her house first.<a name=143:14></a> This time she came to meet Him outside, but undoubtedly she was the least spiritual of the three, all facts considered.<a name=143:15></a> I am saying that because we are prone in our localities to attach undue importance to certain ones, and perhaps no importance at all to others; almost intimating that we would be just as well without them, a very sorrowful feeling to have.<a name=143:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Martha meets the Lord and she says certain things to Him and a conversation ensued of great importance, and it culminated in this, that Martha says, "Yea, Lord; I believe".<a name=143:17></a> Like the man in chapter 9 who said, "Lord, I believe", and worshipped Him, Martha says, "I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of

	<div class="paragraph">
		God, who should come into the world".<a name=144:1></a> The Lord said certain things to her and added, "Believest thou this?<a name=144:2></a>" and she says, "I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world", and she left with that confession; it does not say she worshipped Him.<a name=144:3></a> She went and told her sister about the Lord.<a name=144:4></a> She says, 'Mary, the Lord asks for you'.<a name=144:5></a> She does not pretend that the Lord was satisfied with meeting her, she says the Lord "calls thee".<a name=144:6></a> There was not a bit of rivalry in Martha's mind.<a name=144:7></a> But the Lord did not come to Mary.<a name=144:8></a> She was still sitting in the house.<a name=144:9></a> It looks as if she was the spiritual one in her own mind and she sat there.<a name=144:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not to rest too much on reputation; the sense of reputation is dangerous.<a name=144:11></a> I am not casting aspersions at this beautiful sister, for the Spirit of God exalts her, but she did not go to the Lord until He sent for her.<a name=144:12></a> It does not say the Lord told Martha to call her; it is as if the Spirit of God would say, 'Martha is not an envious sister now at all'.<a name=144:13></a> She gives her sister to understand that she has a great place with Jesus and that He is calling for her.<a name=144:14></a> All that makes for beautiful local conditions.<a name=144:15></a> It is the members of the family making as much as possible of each other.<a name=144:16></a> But the Lord says, 'I am not going to Mary', and He remains in the place where Martha met Him, as much as to say Martha has established the great general principle of the locality and Mary has got to come here.<a name=144:17></a> If you follow what I am saying, it works out locally in brethren making as much as possible of each other, as members of one family, having the same status, all called children of God.<a name=144:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not go further into this well-known chapter, only to point out that in the next chapter the Lord comes again.<a name=144:19></a> He comes now into the locality in view of Lazarus; particularly in view of Lazarus, but not, of course, ignoring the family.<a name=144:20></a> It was a

		question of the family, and "there therefore they made him a supper".<a name=145:1></a> You will observe the adverb of sequence, "therefore", indicating that everything is working as it should work.<a name=145:2></a> Affections are free, light is governing the position and there is no rivalry in the family.<a name=145:3></a> You say, I have been in such a place and really it was delightful; everything was as it should be, one thing leading up to another and conditions such that divine principles and instincts operated perfectly, with the great and glorious result of the Lord Jesus being worshipped, worshipped in a higher way than the blind man worshipped Him.<a name=145:4></a> He is worshipped by a person in the family who sees that an opportunity has arrived, and seizes it, and in seizing it, acts in a most seemly way, having got what is just suitable for that particular opportunity.<a name=145:5></a> For the house of God is a place of opportunity; it is a living state of things, and a living state of things occasions opportunities, and if we are in accordance with the position we shall seize the opportunities and act rightly and in a seemly way, as Mary did here.<a name=145:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we are told about Lazarus and then Martha and then about Mary, what she did.<a name=145:7></a> And in order to bring out more clearly that she is the one who did this, it says (chapter 11: 2), "It was that Mary, .<a name=145:8></a>.<a name=145:9></a>.<a name=145:10></a>" and she is in mind in the whole narrative.<a name=145:11></a> Jesus is everything to her.<a name=145:12></a> She apprehends that He is going to die, and anoints Him in view of that and the house is filled with the odour of the ointment.<a name=145:13></a> Everyone there got the benefit of her action, that is the idea.<a name=145:14></a> The thought of the family is worked out in one member filling the whole house at a given point.<a name=145:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is how it works out in a locality.<a name=145:16></a> Opportunities will offer and someone is ready.<a name=145:17></a> Watertight compartments are not suitable to the assembly of God.<a name=145:18></a> It is a living state of things and if I am ready to seize an opportunity I will fill the house, and this is the line on which things proceed.<a name=145:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I come back to the two points I made negatively.<a name=146:8></a> The first is the natural link.<a name=146:9></a> One is thankful as one moves about for the family links amongst the brethren.<a name=146:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get them in every town where the saints are, and if we are to marry within our tribe it must be so.<a name=146:11></a> Such links are ordained of God, right in themselves, but at the same time they may become an intrusion.<a name=146:12></a> They may become material in the hands of the enemy to spoil the family of God, to rob us of our privileges as of that favoured family, and here in chapter 2 the mother of our Lord, the most honoured of women, is seen acting in this way.<a name=146:13></a> It was a marriage, a time which always calls forth these natural feelings, and they have to be watched against.<a name=146:14></a> She says, "They have no wine".<a name=146:15></a> Now you might say that was seemly enough, but the Lord did not think so and I prefer to take His mind rather than listen to any other.<a name=146:16></a> He was very displeased about it.<a name=146:17></a> Some mother telling her son, who has a gift, to do this or that -- the Lord does not like that.<a name=146:18></a> Some sister, some wife whose husband is supposed to be a leading man, urges him to assert himself -- the Lord does not like that; and so one might multiply suggestions of this kind.<a name=146:19></a> If the Lord did not like it in His mother, He will not like it in your mother, wife, child or sister.<a name=146:20></a> And we do not want to displease the Lord.<a name=146:21></a> The Lord says to her, "Woman".<a name=146:22></a> Some people would say that was

	<div class="paragraph">
		And Mary came to that at once.<a name=147:3></a> "Whatever he may say to you, do".<a name=147:4></a> She was adjustable.<a name=147:5></a> He had said, "What have I to do with thee, woman?<a name=147:6></a>" What a remarkable word that was in the mouth of the Son of God to His own mother after the flesh.<a name=147:7></a> We have to be spiritual to understand the force of that, and if the Lord felt in that way towards His own mother, you may depend He will feel exactly the same way towards you, or any mother who influences her son, or wife her husband, in relation to the things of God.<a name=147:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next intrusion on the natural family line is in chapter 7, where we have the word "brethren", the brethren of Christ.<a name=147:9></a> These relatives were unbelievers, for it says (verse 15), "neither did his brethren believe on him".<a name=147:10></a> I have been speaking of one, a mother or sister or wife, in fellowship, but now we are dealing with relatives who are unbelievers, and their advice, of course, was worldly.<a name=147:11></a> They would say to a man of ability, 'Why do you not go and make a show of yourself?<a name=147:12></a> Get to be known in town as a preacher'.<a name=147:13></a>

		These scriptures, as you will observe, dear brethren, speak about the divine right hand; whether it be the right hand of Christ or the right hand of God; and in the last scripture it is the right hand of men in all grades of society, that is, small and great, rich and poor, free and bondmen: "that they should give them a mark upon their right hand or upon their forehead".<a name=235:1></a> That is the mark of the beast.<a name=235:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak of these scriptures almost entirely from the standpoint of the divine right hand as it is seen in this book of Revelation, a book which has a peculiar application to our times.<a name=235:3></a> The things contained therein are about to be fulfilled, and consequently there is need of knowing what the right hand of God or of Christ implies.<a name=235:4></a> It is God's best in the way of strength in service to us; that is what the right hand manifestly conveys, and it is very touching that it is so prominent in this book.<a name=235:5></a> It is indeed a mark of the whole dispensation in which we are, for it is the period of Christ's session at the right hand of God; meaning that He is in the place of divine strength: that is, all the power that wrought in Christ when God raised Him from the dead, "the surpassing greatness of his power" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a>), is available here on earth, and not only that, but is working, as it is said, "the power which works in us",

		The book, I may suggest, at the outset, dear brethren, involves a certain distance.<a name=236:9></a> It is not a book of nearness, such as the epistles to the Ephesians, the Colossians and the Thessalonians.<a name=236:10></a> These epistles suggest nearness, the nearness of the saints to God, and indeed union with Christ; union is not only nearness, but organic oneness with Christ.<a name=236:11></a> That is what the epistle to the Ephesians contemplates.<a name=236:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This book, however, is a book of graded distance; that is, God gave the revelation to Christ, and Christ signified it by His angel to His bondman John, who testified the word of God.<a name=236:13></a> So it is God, Christ, Christ's angel and John, and then the book is written to the seven assemblies, meaning the whole professing body.<a name=236:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=249:1></a> What is in mind is to show that in any new movement of the Spirit of God those used will link on with what preceded; for the testimony is one whole, whether as regards its current rendering or its entirety.<a name=249:2></a> The book of 2 Chronicles is selected rather than that of 1 Kings in regard to Solomon, because Chronicles stresses the link with what has been before.<a name=249:3></a> What is to be observed in David's regime is that he had two officers, a chronicler and a scribe.<a name=249:4></a> A chronicler would involve the linking on with all that is past in any given testimony, linking on all that is entered into with what preceded it.<a name=249:5></a> So Chronicles, it may be observed, begins with Adam and links the testimony on down to Ezra, and speaks of the twenty-four courses of the priests which David inaugurated and which reappear in the gospel by Luke.<a name=249:6></a> Luke carries on the testimony to Paul in Rome.<a name=249:7></a> So that if we look at this part of chapter 1 of the second book and link it on a little with the latter chapters of the first book we see how one generation, as passing away, being spiritual, links on with the one that is taking its place; and in time the one taking the place of the passing generation is concerned to make much of what there was, and that is what appears in this chapter.<a name=249:8></a> As will be observed, "Solomon spake unto all Israel", then we read, "Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.<a name=249:9></a> But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it".<a name=249:10></a>

		So we have Moses and David linked on here by the incoming generation that is represented by Solomon.<a name=250:1></a> In 1 Kings, which, of course, also treats of Solomon's reign, we shall find much less made of what preceded than we find in Chronicles.<a name=250:2></a> That is to say, the Spirit of God would stress in 1 Kings more what was actually existent in Solomon without special reference to what preceded him.<a name=250:3></a> It was the great wisdom that he had, and the great beneficence, the readiness, through the wisdom that God gave him, to solve difficulties; for any new movement of God will necessarily involve difficulties, and the wisdom which God gives enables us to meet these difficulties.<a name=250:4></a> In order that the link may be clear in 1 Chronicles, it is seen in chapter 23 that David associates Solomon with himself on the throne, showing that the elder ones as passing away or still continuing are ready to work with the younger and in no sense minimise their ability, but rather make the most of it.<a name=250:5></a> So much so that in this chapter we find that David reduced the levitical age from twenty-five to twenty, showing that he had full confidence in youth.<a name=250:6></a> He would make the most of it.<a name=250:7></a> He would not disparage youth.<a name=250:8></a> There would be a great many more young Levites on account of the reduction than had the age been left at twenty-five.<a name=250:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=266:1></a> John's gospel treats of such things as the house of God or the assembly informally, but nevertheless they are treated of, and I thought that these scriptures would help us as to the house of God in certain features; the first scripture contemplates the public side in which there are things most objectionable, and in order that they should be dealt with the most drastic measures have to be resorted to in a spiritual sense.<a name=266:2></a> Then in chapter 8 the house is contemplated in its privilege of liberty, the Son abiding there for ever, over against the bondman, the servant, who has no abiding place there, that is the bondman in the sense of being a slave to sin, whatever the sin may be.<a name=266:3></a> Finally in chapter 14 we have the Father's house in heaven.<a name=266:4></a> It is noticeable that the Lord uses the same expression here as in the first scripture, "My Father's house".<a name=266:5></a> Chapter 2 contemplates what is public; it is the place of the Father's house, but the word used refers to the public buildings of the temple, to which ordinary people had access.<a name=266:6></a> The passage also alludes to the inner part, the shrine, as it is called.<a name=266:7></a> The public buildings are alluded to as having taken so many years to build.<a name=266:8></a> The Jews computed the historical time, but they knew nothing of the inner thought, whereas the disciples, I suppose, are viewed here characteristically.<a name=266:9></a> They understood the Lord's words, as against the Jews who did not.<a name=266:10></a> The disciples understood that the Psalm (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:9">Psalm  69:9</a>) covered what the Lord was doing, and they understood the Scriptures.<a name=266:11></a> They knew how to apply the prophetic scriptures, but the Jews did not; they were occupied with mere history.<a name=266:12></a> The disciples also understood, after the Lord was risen, the bearing of

		Under both headings the idea is not that of a male as we speak of it, or even a husband, but it is the matter of growth including man and woman, both are included under the same head; and secondly, that in the use of the word man in Christ, it is simply that order of being inclusive of male and female, only that spiritually the female is dropped, for in Christ there is neither male nor female.<a name=285:9></a> The idea of sex is dropped,

		The whole of the first chapter of John, which is the great chapter relative to the Lord's Person, is a beautiful combination of light and divine life all centring in that Person, and the first mention of sonship is as "an only-begotten with a father".<a name=290:1></a> He is seen by men.<a name=290:2></a> "We contemplated his glory", we are told; that is, the apostles did, His disciples did, "as of an only-begotten with a father", not 'the' Father, but "a" father.<a name=290:3></a> It is descriptive.<a name=290:4></a> They saw a beautiful halo of glory, the glory as of an only-begotten with a father, it was seen by men.<a name=290:5></a> That is the first mention we get of it.<a name=290:6></a> Those who put it in earlier do so at their own risk, and will have to say to God about that; they presume to know better than the Spirit of God.<a name=290:7></a> And then we are told, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>.<a name=290:8></a> It is who "is in" not 'was in' the bosom of the Father, that is, it is the present place of Christ as Man that is alluded to.<a name=290:9></a> He is in the place of love.<a name=290:10></a> He came "into" it according to the preposition used, not that He was not delightful personally, but He came into that position.<a name=290:11></a> Heaven owned Him in that position as the object of supreme love, the love of the Father.<a name=290:12></a> He is in the bosom of the Father -- it is a well-known idea.<a name=290:13></a> "In that day", says the Lord, "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:20">John  14:20</a>.<a name=290:14></a> It is the place we have in the Lord's affections and the place He has in the Father's affections.<a name=290:15></a> It is that One who declared God, dear brethren.<a name=290:16></a> I only refer to that casually in relation to manhood, how that the Lord growing up came into that.<a name=290:17></a> He was in it abstractly of course in an inscrutable sense always, but it is a question of God's ways, God's dealings, and the testimony and how it works out, so He is not declared openly from heaven to be the Son, until He reaches the full age of manhood.<a name=290:18></a> He "was beginning

		Well, now I say all that, dear brethren, to enlarge on what I am speaking of in 1 Corinthians, that the want of development and growth in the sense Scripture speaks of it in this epistle, the absence of that deprives us of the most precious things -- things we really cannot afford to be deprived of.<a name=291:4></a> The apostle could not speak to them as unto spiritual but as unto babes in Christ.<a name=291:5></a> He could and did speak to them as babes in Christ.<a name=291:6></a> I quite admit they were young christians from the point of view of their conversion -- they were not more than two years old -- for he had been there eighteen months.<a name=291:7></a> He had not long left them when he wrote the epistle, but at the same time they had not grown like the Thessalonians the latter had grown much faster, and the apostle is able to speak more affectionately and less reproachfully to those young christians at Thessalonica.<a name=291:8></a> Here he says, in effect, 'You are depriving yourselves of most precious things by not growing.<a name=291:9></a> You are only babes, whereas you should be full-grown men', and the evidence he gives of this is very clear; and evidence ought to be furnished where accusation is implied.<a name=291:10></a> He says, "For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?<a name=291:11></a> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?<a name=291:12></a> Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?<a name=291:13></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:3">1 Corinthians  3:3</a> - 5.<a name=291:14></a> This is the evidence that he furnishes.<a name=291:15></a> The epistles

		are full of evidence as proving certain allegations that he implies or charges directly, and here the evidence he brings forward of their unspirituality, of their babyhood instead of manhood, is that they were divided.<a name=292:1></a> There was emulation and there was strife among them, and they were following selected leaders as against other leaders.<a name=292:2></a> That is a common thing abroad.<a name=292:3></a> Christendom is full of it and therefore full of unmistakable evidence of this condition, and the fact is that our brethren in these denominations are simply excluding themselves from the most precious things.<a name=292:4></a> The Spirit of God is here charged with these things, freighted with them, and christians in these circumstances are excluding themselves from the benefits.<a name=292:5></a>

		Well, now to go on to chapter 14 to show another restriction that lack of growth of this kind, babyhood, implies.<a name=292:6></a> The chapter, as you know, treats of ministry amongst the saints.<a name=292:7></a> The thought of it is very current, thank God, amongst certain of our brethren throughout the world, and refers to what we call ministry meetings.<a name=292:8></a> The term, of course, covers a meeting like this.<a name=292:9></a> It covers also a meeting of brethren to read the Scriptures in recognition of the temple of God, and particularly it covers a meeting of the whole assembly, as it says in this chapter, "come together in one place", where two or three speak in a prophetic way.<a name=292:10></a> The chapter particularly stresses that kind of meeting and in the instruction relative to this kind of service, prophetic ministry, we have verse 20 introduced to show that the apostle had in his mind throughout the whole letter that there was a condition in Corinth that was hindering.<a name=292:11></a> It was not only evil but depriving the saints of the very best things God had for them; so he says in this verse in giving us the instruction I speak of, "Brethren, be not children in understanding": but then he adds, "howbeit, in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men".<a name=292:12></a> The word

		My object in reading these scriptures is to speak about what, for want of a better word, I might call the present divine economy.<a name=298:1></a> I wish to speak of it from John's point of view and I would say first of all it is an economy of love.<a name=298:2></a> Whatever else marks it, and much marks it as I hope to show, it is the outcome of love; all other attributes, qualities in the Deity or in Christ viewed mediatorially are subservient to and attendant upon love; so we have it formally stated in this verse of chapter 3, "the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand".<a name=298:3></a> This brief verse sets out the economy, as I call it, and I would suggest that in the selection of Him who was to administer and make all the divine thoughts effective, it is stated that this Person is the Object of the Father's love: "the Father loveth the Son".<a name=298:4></a> It is spoken within the period of christianity, within the period of Christ's exaltation to heaven, His present session there and it alludes to the present time, the period of this dispensation.<a name=298:5></a> This gospel reiterates this very thought in other connections besides that of administration.<a name=298:6></a>

		In chapter 5 the Lord says, "the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth", and again in chapter 10 He says, "I lay down my life for the sheep", and again, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again".<a name=298:7></a> There is a motive given for love in the action of Christ, and again He says, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world", linking these remarks with the Deity in its absoluteness -- before the foundation of the world this love existed.<a name=298:8></a> It is perhaps the most tangible link, as

		I might say, that we have with the Absolute, with what existed then, before we read of any creature, that is before the foundation of the world.<a name=299:1></a> So that the Lord had much in mind, as here on earth, this thought of His Father's love for Him, and the Spirit of God takes the thought up and uses one who knew love to express it -- that is John, who, as we are told, was in the bosom of Jesus at a certain time.<a name=299:2></a> He was used above all others to speak of this, and in view of the peculiar applicableness of John's ministry, especially his gospel, to our times, the matter takes on a peculiar importance for us, for it implies that God has brought His people, at least some of them, back to the thought of love, not as men have it ordinarily but as originating in God.<a name=299:3></a> In truth love was not really known until the incarnation nor could we know it save through the death and resurrection and ascension of Christ and the coming of the Spirit, for John says, "Hereby we have known love, because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us", so the application of the love of the Father for the Son to the administrative economy is to be well noted, first as regards its exercise in the Lord Himself and then as He exercises it, very largely mediately now through others down here, for in truth He intends to draw every one who believes on Him into it.<a name=299:4></a> He would have every one of His in this economy, not merely as receiving the benefits of it, but as passing them on for, as I hope to show, the living water which is given in chapter 4 for one's own satisfaction is flowing out in chapter 7 for the satisfaction of others.<a name=299:5></a> That is, as we receive benefit we become administrators of the benefit -- that is what I have in mind.<a name=299:6></a>

		Chapter 4 is in principle the working out of the administration, that is, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand".<a name=299:7></a> The first move is for relief in man or woman, relief in the way of satisfaction.<a name=299:8></a> This is what I hope to speak of,

		satisfaction in man, and -- I may add reverently -- satisfaction in God, for there must be that thought.<a name=300:1></a> Chapter 4 has these two thoughts in mind, that what is given into the hand of Christ by the Father who loves the Son works out immediately in this sense a state of satisfaction, holy satisfaction in man, and as the result of that, satisfaction in God, for God is seen as seeking in this chapter, and the desire of the Father is to be satisfied.<a name=300:2></a> That enters into the economy, and before proceeding, as to chapter 4, I may remark on the several gospels as to the introduction of this thought of the Son, how the idea of the Father's love came into view, for it is presented as coming into view rather than as barely asserted.<a name=300:3></a> There are two things in God's declaration in this sense -- what is asserted authoritatively on His part, and what is shown.<a name=300:4></a> These two things are seen frequently.<a name=300:5></a> We have, for instance, what the Spirit of God says in Hebrews quoting Jeremiah, not what <i>he</i> said but what the Spirit says, bringing Jeremiah down to the present time, what he says as to the new covenant.<a name=300:6></a> The Holy Spirit, we are told, is a Witness to us, a present Witness as to that, and then we have also in that same epistle what the Spirit shows: "the Holy Spirit chewing this, that the way of the holy of holies has not yet been made manifest", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:8">Hebrews  9:8</a>.<a name=300:7></a> He chewed it by what happened on the day of atonement, and so as regards this matter of the relations of divine Persons in the economy into which They have come, for that is what I am speaking of, the Holy Spirit presents it; He shows it in the early chapters of the four gospels.<a name=300:8></a> There are those who assume that God coming into this economy simply means that a veil is drawn aside and we are told that the economy was always there, which is a fallacy.<a name=300:9></a> The word 'revelation' is only used in regard of what divine Persons disclose to persons.<a name=300:10></a> What is used as to the economy, as to the declaration of God, is the

		"No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>) -- not He 'was' but He "is" -- it is the present time.<a name=301:2></a> And One in the place of love has accomplished that great service to bring God out, to declare Him here generally, not specially to anyone, it is the great general thought of the declaration of God; that is how John presents the truth.<a name=301:3></a> In Matthew it is confirmed.<a name=301:4></a> Matthew tells us what happened on the banks of the Jordan, each of the other three evangelists gives us a certain view of the event.<a name=301:5></a> It was a wonderful day at the Jordan; there was no day like that in all the eventful days of John's ministry at the Jordan.<a name=301:6></a> Matthew tells us that the heavens were opened, that Jesus saw them, and a voice said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>.<a name=301:7></a> He is owned as the beloved Son.<a name=301:8></a> And so Mark and Luke.<a name=301:9></a> Luke presents Him to us as praying when this happened.<a name=301:10></a> "Jesus having been baptised and praying .<a name=301:11></a>.<a name=301:12></a>.<a name=301:13></a> the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him; and a voice came out of heaven, <i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:21">Luke  3:21</a>, 22.<a name=301:14></a> Simultaneously with that the Spirit is seen descending like a dove upon Jesus.<a name=301:15></a> The economy in the Persons is thus brought into view, that is the Father's voice is heard although the Father's name is not mentioned, the voice is enough, here is distinct articulation too "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" -- and the Spirit coming down and abiding upon Him, as John states, in the form of a dove.<a name=301:16></a>

		So that the records, as I may say, show the facts, show the great economy that had come into view, and then John the baptist in his own way says that he had been apprised of this matter beforehand.<a name=302:1></a> The others say nothing about what John the baptist saw.<a name=302:2></a> John's gospel has in mind an idea of a witness as if to show how the great officials of Christendom have failed in this.<a name=302:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to bring forward at the outset an ideal witness, the baptist; distinct honour is paid to him, and certain facts are adduced that are not mentioned elsewhere.<a name=302:4></a> John the evangelist says of Christ as having become flesh -- "we have contemplated his glory" -- that is the 'we' of authority, and John makes much of his own testimony later.<a name=302:5></a> "We know", he says elsewhere, "that his witness is true" (chapter 21: 24), but here it is not his own individual witness but "we" meaning the authority that entered into the collective testimony of those included in that "we"; and immediately he says, "John bears witness of him, and he has cried saying"; he brings in John the baptist immediately as witnessing about Jesus and saying, "He was before me".<a name=302:6></a> What a model for us as saints in serving in any way, the readiness to recognise superiority in another!<a name=302:7></a> John was ready to do that.<a name=302:8></a> He cried the thing as if he was urgent that nobody should assume that he was on an equality with Jesus.<a name=302:9></a> No one is on an equality with Jesus.<a name=302:10></a> John says, "A man .<a name=302:11></a>.<a name=302:12></a>.<a name=302:13></a> who takes a place before me, because he was before me".<a name=302:14></a> And He was, for a good reason.<a name=302:15></a> Personally He is God and antedates John the baptist eternally.<a name=302:16></a> A good reason why He was preferred before him, because He was before him.<a name=302:17></a> And then he says much more than I can dwell on now, but among other things he said, "He who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the

		Holy Spirit".<a name=303:1></a> That enters into the administration that I am seeking to bring before you, that is to say, John the baptist is apprised beforehand of the coming of Jesus.<a name=303:2></a> He was worthy of it; as unborn he is moved by the voice of Mary the mother of Jesus.<a name=303:3></a> He is an outstanding man as a witness.<a name=303:4></a> How worthy he is of this honour, to be apprised beforehand that among all the repentant Jews that were baptised, when he saw One coming and the Spirit descending as a dove and remaining upon Him he was to understand that He was the baptiser, not with water, but with the Spirit -- a great thought.<a name=303:5></a> Therefore when John sees Him coming he says, 'There He is'.<a name=303:6></a> It says, "he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".<a name=303:7></a> How initiated he was, how intelligent as to the position; and then he tells us how he had been apprised divinely of Jesus, and then he adds, "I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God".<a name=303:8></a> He failed in no way according to this gospel, and disappears in the third chapter, as recognising Jesus as having come from heaven, and that He must increase -- that He must increase and even the great John himself must decrease.<a name=303:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is how the truth of the economy is set before us in the gospel of John, and then following on that we have what I have already remarked, that the apostle John, the writer, says, "We have contemplated his glory", that is, what I want you to notice is how the thing came into view and that they gave an account of what they saw.<a name=303:10></a> Would that we were all so alert as to receiving an impression by our spiritual eyes and our spiritual ears, and that on receiving such an impression we would be able to name it!<a name=303:11></a> That is one of the most important things in spiritual education, receiving an impression and putting a name on it, and that is what is done here.<a name=303:12></a> John says, "We have contemplated his glory, a

		glory as of an only-begotten with a father" -- that is a simile, it is not 'the Father', it is "a father" -- it is a description of what they saw, and brings out the importance of God coming in, taking the name of Father, and Christ taking the name of Son; it is a relation already understood among men.<a name=304:1></a> It was not a new relation.<a name=304:2></a> It was new that the Deity should come into it, but it was already known, and those who contemplated what was there before them were able to name it and describe it as in this figure -- it is a simile -- "an only one", "an only-begotten with a father".<a name=304:3></a> From the earliest days of humanity the idea of an only-begotten existed.<a name=304:4></a> There was Cain; he was a murderer, alas!<a name=304:5></a> but he had that place.<a name=304:6></a> The 'first' had to be taken away to make room for the 'second'.<a name=304:7></a> Then we have Isaac, a most apt illustration; "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest".<a name=304:8></a> That was understood, and the apostles alluded to such a thing as that and they said, describing what they saw in Jesus become incarnate, that His glory was like the glory of an only-begotten with a father.<a name=304:9></a> That is what they saw; of course we translate it now and say what they saw was a fact, that Christ is God's Son and known to be that, and the radiation of glory between them is understood, for that is the idea.<a name=304:10></a> What a thought it is!<a name=304:11></a> The Father, the Lord said expressly, is seen by no one.<a name=304:12></a> He remains in the Deity which the Lord describes here in chapter 4.<a name=304:13></a> God is a spirit; He remains in that way in the Deity in absoluteness, as regards that, as regards the substance, the essence as we may rightly say, but His voice is heard from heaven several times in this gospel, and in the other gospels, too.<a name=304:14></a> As I said before, the voice is to be taken for the Person; the voice is, as it were, a tangible thing, that is it affects the ear with its beautiful words: "This is my beloved Son".<a name=304:15></a> "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=304:16></a>

		Perhaps no one who was expecting anything ever looked more.<a name=305:7></a> We should learn to look for promised things, John looked for this event -- no event could be compared with it -- the dove coming down, the Holy Spirit descending in that form.<a name=305:8></a> It was a whole thought, a substantial thought, not that the Holy Spirit is a dove -- far otherwise -- but it is a symbol well understood to the spiritual from Noah's time.<a name=305:9></a> There it was, and John saw it, but God saw the descent as it came down and there it rested on that Man.<a name=305:10></a> It was God -- it was no less, beloved friends.<a name=305:11></a> The Spirit was not given by measure to Him.<a name=305:12></a> The Spirit came in totally, as I may say, as the Lord says later, "He abides with you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:17">John  14:17</a>.<a name=305:13></a> He was there, the fulness of the Spirit had come in and was there in that Man.<a name=305:14></a> Not now in the temple as of old, the shekinah had come and found a permanent resting place in a Man here upon earth.<a name=305:15></a> What a Man What antecedents!<a name=305:16></a> It requires this wonderful gospel to impress us with who was there, as the Lord says to the woman, "Who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink".<a name=305:17></a> He is there of whom it is written, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God .<a name=305:18></a>.<a name=305:19></a>.<a name=305:20></a> .<a name=305:21></a> All things received

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it may be there are here those who are impossible.<a name=312:5></a> That is a terrible thought, but a scriptural one, as I shall show, such persons as Lot's sons-in-law for example -- impossible to save.<a name=312:6></a> Some of you may assume that this is calling in question the power of God, but there are things that God cannot do, not because He is not omnipotent but because of what He is morally.<a name=312:7></a> He cannot lie, nor can He on the same principle save the devil and his angels.<a name=312:8></a> So it is a solemn consideration that there may be those here tonight who are impossible.<a name=312:9></a> I say it may be, though I hope not, but the Scriptures furnish us with many examples of 'impossibles'.<a name=312:10></a> Luke particularly in his wonderful evangelical book gives us many pairs of persons, one of whom was saved and the other lost.<a name=312:11></a> Two women grinding at the mill, he says, "one taken and the other left", the one taken for judgment.<a name=312:12></a> Simon the Pharisee and the woman that was a sinner in the city, the one proving himself impossible, retaining his self-righteous attitude, and the other receiving from the lips of Jesus the precious words, "Thy faith has saved thee", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:60">Luke  7:60</a>.<a name=312:13></a> There is no salvation without faith, and Simon did not have any, but the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that was what was in view in Lot's case, and that is why I have read about him, for our position is that we are in danger of being judged with the world, as difficult to save.<a name=315:6></a> The setting of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#19">Genesis  19</a>is a great intercessory system.<a name=315:7></a> The divine economy stands in all its glory and blessedness and power inclusive of intercession, so it is said of Jesus that He ever lives to make intercession for us, and moreover that He saves to the uttermost, that is, He is a Saviour to us from the time we believe until our exit from the world, not only our death and burial, but our resurrection and ascension into heaven.<a name=315:8></a> All this is part of the great salvation that He has acquired for us.<a name=315:9></a> So that He is able to save to the uttermost those that come unto God by Him, and that is going on every moment of this wonderful period, day and night, week in and week out, year in and year out, in all these centuries, this wonderful work of Jesus, this wonderful salvation that He has achieved for us, as being wrought out.<a name=315:10></a> "He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him", and as I said, this involves intercession (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:25">Hebrews  7:25</a>).<a name=315:11></a> And I would appeal to christian worldlings here, our young people brought up in christian families who

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these prayers have been made efficacious by our great Intercessor on high -- our great High Priest.<a name=316:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These prayers have included the households, that is the children, they have included the persons invited to this meeting, so that I may say everyone here has been the subject of intercession this very day, early in the last week, too.<a name=316:8></a> That is the position, beloved friends, particularly in this epistle of Peter corresponding with the chapters in Genesis.<a name=316:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter, in treating of the government of God, introduces this great thought that God raised Christ up from the dead and gave Him glory that our faith and hope might be in God (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:21">1 Peter  1:21</a>), meaning that Christ came into Manhood and took His place on our side as the Son of man, and that He as Man gave Himself a ransom for all, the Mediator between God and men.<a name=316:10></a> As Man He represents us, not only christians, but the whole race of mankind; it is a wonderful thought, that being a Man He is Head of every man in the world, and on high He is doing His utmost for every man.<a name=316:11></a> The effectuation of the gospel, and its promulgation all these centuries is the proof of it.<a name=316:12></a> He gave Himself on our behalf and God shows us that He has accepted Him by raising Him

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These passages, as you will observe, speak of counsel.<a name=325:1></a> They speak of Christ as counselling; they speak of Him -- indeed God speaks of Him in the psalm as receiving counsel, and as a pattern for us.<a name=325:2></a> Then Nehemiah speaks of taking counsel with himself, and Proverbs speaks of safety "in the multitude of counsellors".<a name=325:3></a> I propose to say a little on each of these points and those of us who love the Lord Jesus -- and I trust we all do -- are stirred in our affections by the reference to Him as "Counsellor" in the prophet Isaiah; the son given, the child born is said to be called "Counsellor", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a>.<a name=325:4></a> That was His name, one of the features of His name; He is viewed on our side as bearing all these titles.<a name=325:5></a> The prophetic spirit says, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given".<a name=325:6></a> Believers are slow to appropriate what is thus recorded as theirs, and hence remain often in spiritual poverty, whereas such verses as I referred to -- and particularly the epistle to the Hebrews -- are calculated to enrich us even objectively, as I have been saying.<a name=325:7></a> The Corinthians were regarded as furnished in every way, coming behind in no gift; that was in an objective sense.<a name=325:8></a> Further, it is said in that same epistle that christians are of God, "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>.<a name=325:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We wonder at times that the Lord Jesus should deign to address such an assembly at all, and especially that He should counsel it.<a name=326:8></a> It is full of grace, beloved brethren, that the Lord does so, and indeed He embodies, in a most striking way, the grace of the dispensation, the grace with which it began.<a name=326:9></a> It began with the announcement that "the Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon".<a name=326:10></a> That was grace to one who had shamefully denied the Lord.<a name=326:11></a>

		And then, "eye-salve, that thou mayest see".<a name=330:9></a> It is very humbling to me, and I doubt not to many here, to see that, when difficulties arise amongst us, very few see the real issue, and how ready we are to bring up side issues, to becloud the real ones.<a name=330:10></a> The Lord always gives an issue in difficulties in something that stands out for the eye that can see, and He supplies "eye-salve, that thou mayest see".<a name=330:11></a> So you can see, dear brethren, what a moment it is in christendom, and this applies to all christians; how the Lord is maintaining in this wonderful way the character of the dispensation, as He says, "I .<a name=330:12></a>.<a name=330:13></a>.<a name=330:14></a> am set down with my Father in his throne", and He would have us to be affected and to be softened, so that we should not be "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked", but set up in the wealth that He has to dispose of.<a name=330:15></a>

		Well now, I go on to the psalm, so that you may see, in the Lord's own case on earth as a Man, how His humanity is involved.<a name=330:16></a> No scripture perhaps gives us such a view of His humanity as this, how real His humanity was, even to the extent of receiving counsel, as He says here, "I will bless Jehovah, who giveth me counsel"; whilst I refer to Jesus our Lord in this wonderful psalm, my object is to show

		how the brethren, how christians, may be counselled.<a name=331:1></a> It is not a question of grace here; it is a question of the Father's affection for Jesus.<a name=331:2></a> What a time the Father had from the time of the incarnation, from the incoming of Christ here!<a name=331:3></a> It was one continual history of pleasure for the Father's eye.<a name=331:4></a> In a way nothing affects one more than the satisfaction the Father had in the incarnation, what was involved even from the Lord's birth; He was cast upon Jehovah from His birth.<a name=331:5></a> He had satisfaction, too, in what the saints were to Him, and how the Lord Himself, too, had enjoyment in every bit of the path, a path of suffering, of course, beyond our apprehension, but still a path of satisfaction.<a name=331:6></a> There never was a moment in that history save when He was on the cross (if I may make that exception) that the Lord Jesus as Man was not satisfied.<a name=331:7></a> It was a life of holy satisfaction, not only in what He found in His Father, but what He found among the saints, as the psalmist shows, and how He speaks of "the lines" that "are fallen to me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage" (verse 6).<a name=331:8></a> How contrary, how different from the complainings that we so much hear of!<a name=331:9></a> And yet the epistle to the Romans would bring us to this very thing, so that the most adverse things are working in our favour.<a name=331:10></a> But here, how beautiful from the lips of Jesus, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage".<a name=331:11></a> He did not make a selection; it was all a line, it is all sovereign, marked out for Him, alluding to the inheritance given in Joshua; and then how He blesses Jehovah, who gave Him counsel!<a name=331:12></a>

		Well, dear brethren, I am only speaking thus to draw the saints into this psalm.<a name=331:13></a> The Lord would draw us into it.<a name=331:14></a> If there is anything that would affect me, if I were here when the Lord Jesus was here, it would be to be drawn into the current of His mind at any time and not missing anything.<a name=331:15></a> There was a

		Then another thing comes out here in this same connection -- and that is the reins.<a name=332:8></a> It says, "My reins also instruct me in the night seasons".<a name=332:9></a> The reins refer to the inner workings in a believer, as it were to the inner automatic organs, and the epistle to the Romans by a process of spiritual analysis enables me to be introspective in a sense that I understand what is taking place there.<a name=332:10></a> The Spirit of God having come in in the christian takes possession and He comes in in the night seasons.<a name=332:11></a> Many of us elder brethren lie awake for hours and perhaps the young ones do so, too; we have wakeful nights and the Lord would bring us into this.<a name=332:12></a> What a time you can have in the night season, when by such an experience you can emerge happier, brighter, fresher than you were when you went to bed.<a name=332:13></a> It is a wonderful organism, it is a wonderful inward condition that the Spirit lays hold of and acts upon, even if my mind is not in it.<a name=332:14></a> "My reins instruct me", says the Lord.<a name=332:15></a>

		That leads me to Nehemiah, a man well worthy of note in our time, he is a remnant man, a man who had a public position and who, while fulfilling, like Daniel, his responsibilities in it, had a constant eye for divine interests.<a name=333:9></a> Let no one say, 'There are other matters'.<a name=333:10></a> I have heard of a man who is in a profession and when a care meeting was arranged in which the divine interests were to be discussed or considered, a meeting which heaven was intent on, he said, 'I have sold my time for weeks to come'.<a name=333:11></a> Where is he alongside the disciples of Christ, alongside of Nehemiah and Daniel?<a name=333:12></a> See the amount of business Daniel had to do, the amount of business Nehemiah had to do; he was governor.<a name=333:13></a> He has got an eye constantly for the people of God, <i>they</i> are his chief interest.<a name=333:14></a> We read of usurers here, men who love money, and who have no conscience about wresting interest and the like from others.<a name=333:15></a> We are all exposed to this.<a name=333:16></a> Those who are in business -- one speaks feelingly -- are all exposed to this temptation and it is well to challenge ourselves.<a name=333:17></a> The very Jews were money-lenders, and they were reducing the people of

		For the benefit of some here who may not be so conversant with this gospel as are others of us, it may be remarked that it presents Christ from the levitical point of view, that is from the point of view of public service, and it begins abruptly with the statement, "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God", with no formal explanation of why He is styled Son of God; it is assumed that this is already known and needs not to be proved nor specially asserted.<a name=338:1></a> So that the public service, the public levitical service, not priestly but levitical, takes character from this fact that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=338:2></a> Luke gives us more the priestly side, and Matthew the royal, involving the authority of the Lord (all these features are essential to christianity) and John adds the great and glorious truth of His Person, not simply what He was officially as Man here, but what He was before becoming Man, that is that He was God -- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=338:3></a> These features are to be understood by christians, or we shall fail in our knowledge of christianity and our enjoyment of it and the blessings involved, and more particularly in understanding the manner of the ministry, that it is not by man-made ministers but by God-made ministers and that they are in the knowledge and enjoyment of their relationship with God as sons, not in the sense of Christ as Son, not indeed as He is, for He is a divine Person.<a name=338:4></a> Still it is sonship and we are brought into sonship, and thus we are set free as the apostle Paul tells us, "Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:1">Galatians  5:1</a>); He has set us free in a state of things described

		And so Mark tells us that the Lord went through the cornfields on the Sabbath day (chapter 2: 23) which, from the standpoint of judaism, was illegal, but the Son of God had come in, and it is what <i>He</i> does, not what the hierarchy of christendom tells us, but what He tells us that is to be our guide.<a name=339:3></a> As the Lord did this His disciples did the same, meaning that they followed Him; they were not concerned about the criticism of the official ministers (the priests), but they were doing what Jesus did.<a name=339:4></a> He had initiated a certain liberty and they entered upon it and went on in it, that is plucking the ears of corn.<a name=339:5></a> "And it came to pass, that he went through the cornfields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.<a name=339:6></a> And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?<a name=339:7></a>" That was <i>their</i> view; they complained about what the disciples did, not about what the Lord did, although what the Lord did was what led them to do what they did.<a name=339:8></a> And so it is today, the complaints made against the saints who follow Jesus are really against Jesus.<a name=339:9></a> Persons are not prepared to go so far as to complain against Christ, but it is complaining against Him indirectly.<a name=339:10></a> What I am saying is very common, and the Lord defends what the disciples did, and He does the same today for those who love Him, who walk according to His example in the liberty into which He has brought us.<a name=339:11></a> We may be persecuted, but the Lord undertakes to defend us and His defence is unanswerable, as it is here; He says to the Pharisees, "Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with

		Well now, the final thought is found in the verses in chapter 3 to which I referred; these link on with what I am saying.<a name=350:5></a> The Lord's own mother is seen here representing the natural side, His mother and His brethren after the flesh: "And his brethren and his mother come, and standing without sent to him calling him".<a name=350:6></a> That is as though they have the right to call Jesus, that is what is conveyed; it is the arrogance of the flesh, because of natural relationship.<a name=350:7></a> Whereas the position is that He calls us; if there is to be any calling, that is the position.<a name=350:8></a> So here they carried the message to Him, "Behold, thy mother and thy brethren seek thee without.<a name=350:9></a> And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?<a name=350:10></a>" Then He looked round, that is what I have in mind; any of us here might be conversant with this passage, but it is the peculiar application at the present time -- He looked round about on those that were sitting around Him; and there are such today.<a name=350:11></a> It is a beautiful circle (maybe some here know nothing about this); there are those who have given up all this outward religion I have spoken of and just sit around Christ; that is the principle of our meetings, just sitting around Christ.<a name=350:12></a> Of course, you understand I am not saying He is there in a literal sense, but that is the principle of our position; He is in the centre of all and He

		of and participation in the kingdom is because of our avoidance of tribulation.<a name=373:1></a> It is through much tribulation that we enter into it.<a name=373:2></a> The Lord thus in these chapters graciously fortifies the disciples for what was coming, in view of His death and absence from this world and His going into heaven.<a name=373:3></a> In chapter 16 He speaks much of the Holy Spirit, speaks of His bringing into this world demonstration of sin and righteousness and judgment.<a name=373:4></a> It is a very important matter in warfare that the issue should be clear.<a name=373:5></a> When the issues are confused there are many unnecessary casualties; it is when the issues are clear, dear brethren, that the casualties are few.<a name=373:6></a> In some instances in the Old Testament, there was not a single casualty in the greatest conflicts, the issue being so clear; while in another conflict when the leader David in his weakness was affected by natural feeling, and swayed by his undue affection for Absalom, the issue was beclouded and many people were destroyed in the forest, not by the sword, but by an ill-chosen battlefield.<a name=373:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the Lord in His remarks in chapter 16 promises the disciples that in the conflict the issue would be made perfectly clear; the Spirit of God, the Comforter, would bring in demonstration, showing perfectly and clearly what sin is, what righteousness is and what judgment is.<a name=373:8></a> After saying all this and much more in that chapter to the comfort of the brethren, the Lord prayed to His Father in the well-known chapter 17, that unique chapter of this unique gospel, in which the Lord Jesus looks up to heaven after saying all this and speaks to His Father mainly about His own; this fresh movement then follows.<a name=373:9></a> It would not appear that He actually moved at the end of chapter 14, but the thought of movement is there, "Rise up, let us go hence", meaning that He was leaving that position for a public one; so we have the three succeeding

		Now 2 Samuel makes the point clear by furnishing typically what we may say transpires here; David is rejected, his son Absalom having revolted, and when the news comes to him he passes over to the same position (it is called Kidron there); and in order to make the position clear, as I said, we have Ittai the Gittite, that is the stranger, the Philistine from Gath, who followed David, bringing out the great attractiveness of David even in Gath.<a name=374:6></a> This man followed him and now David challenges his heart.<a name=374:7></a> He says to Ittai, 'You are a stranger, you have just come, why should you partake of my sufferings?<a name=374:8></a>' Do not think that it was because David did not value the affections of this stranger.<a name=374:9></a> No, beloved brethren, he valued Ittai the Gittite and trusted him with an army later, but he challenges his heart as the Lord would challenge our hearts at this moment as to whether we are ready for the acceptance of the position of suffering.<a name=374:10></a> And so Ittai

		And then the passage goes on to say, "Wherefore let us, receiving a kingdom not to be shaken, have grace".<a name=386:11></a> Many christians have received a kingdom, and the word here requires some explanation, for it is no question of a preliminary or provisional kingdom, but a kingdom that abides; and I may say, dear brethren, that the idea of kingdom is eternal, not in the sense of a provisional kingdom for a thousand years, as will be seen presently in the millennium, but in the sense of a system or order of things held together divinely, in which there necessarily is law and rule.<a name=386:12></a> For in the eternal state of things the idea remains, "the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all".<a name=386:13></a> The Son Himself, who is our Lord Jesus Christ, in a mediatorial sense takes the place of subjection, and all under Him is

		And then in addition to, or following on the created universe, there is the international or governmental system of things -- governmental, I should call it, for it began with Noah.<a name=387:13></a> Magisterial government began with Noah and extended to imperial government in Nimrod.<a name=387:14></a> And God has owned it, taking up the thought in Israel, setting up a kingdom, a system of government and royalty and peace under Solomon, and prosperity such as had not been known hitherto.<a name=387:15></a> It had divine sanction.<a name=387:16></a> This epistle undoubtedly alludes to that particularly, for the Jewish believers were lapsing back into what represented it.<a name=387:17></a> It had antiquity behind it; it had divine authority ostensibly, but it was crumbling to pieces, and in a moment it was to be obliterated by the Roman armies, and it remains so at the present moment.<a name=387:18></a> Such is the way in which Scripture and historic fact illustrate what I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These four great monarchies are presented in Scripture as one idea, one great thought, in the great image seen in the vision, a monster.<a name=388:5></a> Let no christian pride himself in having part in these empires!<a name=388:6></a> Jesus suffered under them; the apostles suffered, the saints ever since have suffered under them, yet they are set up by God (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:1">Romans  13:1</a>).<a name=388:7></a> In order to understand that, we must understand the book of Daniel and kindred scriptures.<a name=388:8></a> Those monarchies stood and fell one after another, until the great Roman system came into existence.<a name=388:9></a> It came and it fell.<a name=388:10></a> We have all heard of the decline and fall of that great system, and yet it has not fallen; it is a mysterious thing.<a name=388:11></a> None of the other great empires has such a history; the thing continues in mystery and will be revived presently.<a name=388:12></a> But it can be shaken at any time, as a leaf on a tree, as God is minded to do it.<a name=388:13></a> And so, as I said, this great empire which God has ordained is just about to be shaken.<a name=388:14></a> It is a continuation of it, and we pray rightly for the authorities, but we have to bear in mind the flimsiness on which things stand, and how all is just held together on account of the testimony, and is of the greatest importance in that sense, but let no one take comfort as resting in it in any spiritual way.<a name=388:15></a> It may be shattered in a moment.<a name=388:16></a> I am not speaking, dear brethren, in order to interest you in politics, in international affairs, but that we may see

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I am saying, what this epistle teaches, is of the very greatest importance to us as christians.<a name=389:9></a> We are addressed as "holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:1">Hebrews  3:1</a>.<a name=389:10></a> It is that side of things that we are introduced into, that we are received into in profession, and that is unshakable.<a name=389:11></a> There is what is shakable, and we get what God means, that it is not only a question of shaking, but of removing (that is the next thing), in order that what is unshakable may remain.<a name=389:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I go on to add something as to "our God".<a name=389:13></a> It is a very beautiful phrase, "our God", the christian's God, but it is a very remarkable thing that He is said to be "a consuming fire" here.<a name=389:14></a> You say, 'The terms are incompatible, that is not the God of christianity'.<a name=389:15></a> But it is the God of christianity.<a name=389:16></a> What is more cleansing, more purifying, more drastic in dealing with evil than fire?<a name=389:17></a> If there is anything to be afraid of, beloved brethren, it is that "God is a consuming fire".<a name=389:18></a> If I think of the world as it is, lying in the wicked one, seething in wickedness, what a comfort it is that God has power at any moment to burn all up.<a name=389:19></a> The most drastic means of purification is fire, but it is "our God" who is a consuming fire.<a name=389:20></a>

		Well, now, the passage in the Acts leads me to speak of what is smaller, as I may say -- detail.<a name=390:11></a> Whilst God in His infinite greatness can call this great universe into existence, we read of the finger of God.<a name=390:12></a> Though He deals with infinite things, He deals with small ones, too, and here it is a question of that feature which would interfere with the testimony itself and with His service.<a name=390:13></a> I have no doubt this jail at Philippi represented the power of Rome.<a name=390:14></a> Philippi was a colony, and the Roman colonies were an integral part of the city of Rome, of the very city itself, so that the jail, or the prison, represented the power of the empire.<a name=390:15></a> It was a detail, of course, but it was a detail sufficiently powerful to take those two great servants, Paul and Silas, in the height of their service, and confine them with scourging, cruelly confining them.<a name=390:16></a>

		Now this sort of thing is constant, not in the same degree, of course, but the enemy is working peculiarly in detail.<a name=390:17></a> He is unable to divide brethren in any general way, but he is working in detail, and these details are becoming numerous and are apt to endanger the whole position.<a name=390:18></a> So what comes out here is this detail, so to speak.<a name=390:19></a> It was a very important matter, it had to do with the introduction of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=401:9></a> Yes, Chronicles is typically headship, because divine wisdom enters into the service, the order of the service; but 1 Corinthians does not go as far as that; really you might say it is confined to lordship, to authority.<a name=401:10></a> So that we begin rightly with that; then the question is raised as to how we come together in assembly, whether there is that which attracts the Lord; how we leave our houses, how we are in our houses, how we move on to the meeting-room and seat ourselves, how we regard each other, whether the anointing is there, whether it is attractive to Christ; all that enters into His coming to us.<a name=401:11></a>
