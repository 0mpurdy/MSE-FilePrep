		PETER'S FIRST EPISTLE AS BEARING ON THE PRESENT MOMENT (1)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:5></a> The first epistle by Peter is selected at this time because it is believed that this epistle enters peculiarly into the present moment.<a name=1:6></a> Perhaps we may also look a little into the second epistle if time permits.<a name=1:7></a> The present time involves the government of God, not His direct government but His indirect government.<a name=1:8></a> Although His direct government is much alluded to in these epistles it is not the general thought in them.<a name=1:9></a> It is a question of the position of the believers at the beginning, that is to say, those who are of the circumcision, and as of it and having had a place with God earlier they are viewed as scattered, as sojourners; that is to say, they are not in their own land.<a name=1:10></a> There may be a comparison drawn between their position and ours, for in our case there has been a change, a revival after departure.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The general position of the assembly is, you might say, altered because it has become a mere profession, as judaism had become.<a name=1:12></a> Christianity has now become this in a public sense and we have to accept this and to see how we are to move in relation to the assembly in a spiritual sense; not simply viewed publicly but, in a spiritual sense, because the assembly still exists, as indeed Judaism existed when the epistle of James was written and even when Peter's epistle was written.<a name=1:13></a> James says, "to the twelve tribes which are in the dispersion, greeting" <a href="../bible/James.htm#1:1">James  1:1</a>.<a name=1:14></a> That is to say, the position was there, but it was only true spiritually because they were scattered.<a name=1:15></a> Peter's thought is to link them up with

		the assembly although he hardly ever mentions the assembly.<a name=2:1></a> That is another thing that might be noted.<a name=2:2></a> At the same time the Lord calls them in, according to Matthew, because of Peter's confession; not his profession, but his confession.<a name=2:3></a> He had listened to what was said as to the Son of man, who He was; and the question is now, dear brethren, as to the titles that the Lord Jesus has, whatever they may be, that whether it is 'Son of man' or 'Son of God' we should be intelligent about them.<a name=2:4></a> Peter hardly ever mentions the Son of God, only once indeed, and that in his second epistle.<a name=2:5></a> I am referring to these facts because it is important that the brethren should have them in their minds.<a name=2:6></a> So when the Lord raised the question as to who the Son of man was Peter said, "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:16">Matthew  16:16</a>.<a name=2:7></a> That is what he said, one of the greatest confessions one could make then or now.<a name=2:8></a> The Lord says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:17">Matthew  16:17</a>.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we are on spiritual lines.<a name=2:10></a> I mean as regards the epistle of Peter we are on spiritual lines; but at the same time we are on governmental lines.<a name=2:11></a> Matters have grown into governmental positions and brethren have to understand that this refers to them in their working relations, in their household relations, and in their business relations, so that we know where we are and know how to speak of our circumstances.<a name=2:12></a> The Lord says to Peter, "<i>Thou</i> art Peter", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:17">Matthew  16:17</a>, a word we should all take to heart as to what we are spiritually.<a name=2:13></a> The word 'Peter' covers the reality of christianity; it is a question of what the believer <i>is</i> as a christian and because he is a christian.<a name=2:14></a> So the Lord says, "Thou art Peter", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:17">Matthew  16:17</a>, and the next thing is "I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:19">Matthew  16:19</a>.<a name=2:15></a>

		One refers to this so that the brethren might understand what we are, each of us, spiritually, and what our relations with God are.<a name=3:1></a> Peter's relations with God were not simply connected with the assembly but with governmental matters; it is a question of the government of things.<a name=3:2></a> So the Lord says, "<i>Thou</i> art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:17">Matthew  16:17</a>.<a name=3:3></a> That is to say, the assembly belongs to Christ, a very important matter to keep before us.<a name=3:4></a> The assembly belongs to Christ and to Christ only; it still has that status, so that we know where we are in that sense.<a name=3:5></a> But then there is the government that Peter was brought into as the book of Acts shows.<a name=3:6></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>indicates that the gentiles were brought into the assembly publicly.<a name=3:7></a> Therefore it is a question of the dear brethren having all these things in their minds so that in dealing with matters they know what is meant; because if we are to understand and gather help in our souls in these meetings we have to learn to name things.<a name=3:8></a> God begins with the idea of naming things, Adam was constituted with intelligence by which to name things.<a name=3:9></a> He named the creatures, and it was he who named the woman, not God.<a name=3:10></a> He says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:23">Genesis  2:23</a>.<a name=3:11></a> So that as rightly understood it is a question of Christ in that sense, the assembly is bone of His bones and flesh of His flesh.<a name=3:12></a> So if the dear brethren will be free to say what they have in mind, as to whether what I say is the truth or not, I shall be thankful, for it is a time of speaking the truth and being of the truth.<a name=3:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=3:14></a> Would the thought of "sanctification of the Spirit" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a> strengthen what you have been referring to as to what is spiritual, in contrast to fleshly sanctification in judaism?<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:16></a> That is a point to keep in mind, that we are not simply christians by name or profession, but by sanctification.<a name=3:17></a> The position is that we are sanctified;

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> Just so, it is evidently so.<a name=4:8></a> It was not simply a question of professing christians but they were evidently sanctified; that is in our case that the Spirit of God possesses us; we are governed by Him.<a name=4:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> Quite so, but that meant his apostleship; in the main that was his apostleship.<a name=4:14></a>

		A.R.<a name=4:15></a> Do you think that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>the Lord Jesus is seen as the last Adam?<a name=4:16></a> He calls Peter 'Cephas', "thou shalt be called Cephas"; so he is called 'Peter' in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=4:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>Adam named the animals, but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>Peter is named Cephas.<a name=4:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:19></a> Very good, "thou shalt be called".<a name=4:20></a> The Lord is speaking as the last Adam; He said, "Thou shalt be called Cephas" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:17">Matthew  16:17</a>, and the meaning is that Peter is a stone.<a name=4:21></a>

		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> I think it is that Peter would deal with christianity in a true sense.<a name=5:2></a> We shall see that the government of God comes in our relations down here, but Peter is really dealing with christianity.<a name=5:3></a> That is what is in mind; although he is dealing with the circumcision, he is dealing with christianity.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=5:5></a>W.<a name=5:6></a> Is that why he brings the Trinity in?<a name=5:7></a> "The foreknowledge of God the Father", the "sanctification of the Spirit", and "the blood of Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>.<a name=5:8></a> He brings in the whole Trinity right from the outset.<a name=5:9></a> I wondered if that confirmed what you said, that he has the whole of christianity before him.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:11></a> I am glad you bring that up because it is one of the most important questions that could be asked.<a name=5:12></a> Peter has a great place in Matthew.<a name=5:13></a> It is said, "first … Peter" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:2">Matthew  10:2</a> there -- he is the leading apostle according to Matthew.<a name=5:14></a> Matthew tells us about the baptismal formula, that it is "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>; that is, one name but three Persons.<a name=5:15></a> It is the Godhead that is in mind, but one name covering it.<a name=5:16></a> Hence it is a question of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is covered in that name; if it is mentioned, the Holy Spirit is covered in it.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:18></a> Is that what you had in mind in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, that immediately the relation of the Father and the Son is mentioned you have the Lord speaking to Peter of "my assembly"?<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:6></a> I think it is to show how the blessed Spirit takes a lowly place.<a name=6:7></a> He is here as the sent One but He is still nevertheless one of the Trinity, of the Godhead, and if He takes a lowly place we are not to despise Him on that account.<a name=6:8></a> We are to have a clear apprehension of Him in His infiniteness as part of the Godhead.<a name=6:9></a> If God is mentioned as such, then the Spirit is included.<a name=6:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:13></a> Quite so, and not only that, but the Spirit is a divine Person, and if He is spoken to as indicated in the Old Testament Scriptures, the authority of the Old Testament remains unbroken.<a name=6:14></a> The Lord Himself says the Scripture cannot be broken.<a name=6:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:20></a> I think it is to bring out the greatness of Christ really.<a name=6:21></a> It was at the time of the Lord's baptism.<a name=6:22></a> The one who was sent to baptise was told that he should see the Spirit descending upon Him; "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending … he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:33">John  1:33</a>.<a name=6:23></a> There it is 'descending', not 'sent'.<a name=6:24></a> Of course that is a question of a divine Person, a Person who has power to descend as well as to ascend.<a name=6:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:3></a> Would you say something more as to the authority of the Old Testament Scriptures as bearing on this matter of the Spirit?<a name=7:4></a> Generally it is thought that in regard to doctrine we should rely more on the New Testament.<a name=7:5></a> Would you say more about the authority of the Old?<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:7></a> "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable", it says <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=7:8></a> So that Scripture has its own authority whether in the Old Testament or the New.<a name=7:9></a> That is, it has authority.<a name=7:10></a> It is divinely inspired and whatever it says has to be bowed to; only if it is a question of Paul's missions and offices, it is only spiritual and intelligent that we should refer to him.<a name=7:11></a> If it is a matter under his office, such as the mystery, it is only intelligent that we should refer to him first, but not altogether, because the fact that a scripture belongs to the Old Testament does not weaken its authority.<a name=7:12></a> It would be entirely wrong to say that it did.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:14></a> What you have now said is very helpful indeed.<a name=7:15></a> Do you mean that the matter of the Holy Spirit as you have been referring to Him does not necessarily lie within the scope of Paul's commission, although involved in it?<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:17></a> Yes, not necessarily.<a name=7:18></a> The types speak of Him in a very full way, especially <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>; it speaks of the Holy Spirit in type and that type has the same force as if it were in the New Testament.<a name=7:19></a>

		PETER'S FIRST EPISTLE AS BEARING ON THE PRESENT MOMENT (3)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:1">1 Peter  3:1</a> - 22
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=39:1></a> I think the brethren will observe that this epistle is marked by certain salient subjects, some of lesser importance but the leading ones have been in mind throughout these readings.<a name=39:2></a> It is thought that we should continue on that principle.<a name=39:3></a> One thing that has not been observed in our remarks is the use of the article.<a name=39:4></a> It is not much employed, so that the things are characteristic rather than specific.<a name=39:5></a> As regards the present chapter it may be remarked that the subject at the outset is the family, or rather the household, although Peter does not enlarge on the word 'household' as to a man's house; but he speaks of the personnel of a household, those who occupy the house or serve in it under God.<a name=39:6></a> The wife is first mentioned: "Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:1">1 Peter  3:1</a>.<a name=39:7></a> No doubt the word "own" is not put in without a reason, so as to preclude any special influence of other husbands.<a name=39:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=39:9></a>H.<a name=39:10></a> Have you in mind what the Lord Jesus said to the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:18">John  4:18</a>, "he whom now thou hast is not thy husband"?<a name=39:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=39:12></a> Quite so, he was not her own; and that helps greatly as to the subjects that John selects in connection with which the truth is made to stand.<a name=39:13></a> Here the household is brought in, involving the wife, lest she should become influenced by other husbands or in any way be diverted.<a name=39:14></a> She is to be attached to her own husband and be subject to him.<a name=39:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=39:16></a> You have said in connection with that chapter (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>) that moral matters must be settled first before you get the Spirit.<a name=39:17></a> She said to the Lord, "Give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.<a name=39:18></a> Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here" <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:15">John  4:15</a>,16.<a name=39:19></a>

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=40:1></a> Yes, "Go, call thy husband, and come here"; that is to be noticed.<a name=40:2></a> The Lord opened the subject with her involving the moral side of it by calling attention to the one whom she then had, who was not her husband.<a name=40:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=40:4></a> Is that what is in mind in this chapter, that moral matters must be settled in the household?<a name=40:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=40:6></a> That is the point at the beginning of the chapter, but the husbands, of course, are also mentioned.<a name=40:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=40:8></a> Would the reference to unconverted husbands apply also to unconverted wives?<a name=40:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=40:10></a> I think whichever they may be, husbands or wives, they are in mind here; but of course these verses might be conveniently and instructively read in connection with the same truth as treated by Paul in the epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=40:11></a> He enlarges on the subject more than Peter does.<a name=40:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=40:13></a> Would you say that, looking at the subject in a general way in regard to the dispensation, the feminine side has been largely lost sight of in the assembly because of other husbands which may have come up in the public setting of things?<a name=40:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=40:15></a> Very good, a very searching remark.<a name=40:16></a> Of course another thing that has to be borne in mind is that in the larger part of the human race polygamy has a place; whereas in the realm of Japheth, that is to say in the western part of the world centering in the main in Rome, one man and one wife present the idea of marriage.<a name=40:17></a> Polygamy is not allowed in the West generally; but then there is, alas, much that is morally wrong that may be found even amongst the saints.<a name=40:18></a> That is the undue influence of husbands over other wives than their own.<a name=40:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=40:20></a> Is it noteworthy that in Luke's gospel before Peter is chosen the Lord had touch with him in his household and in his business?<a name=40:21></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=41:1></a> Yes; his wife's mother was sick of a fever, which would mean that he was tested in the house, because the fever would tend to irritability.<a name=41:2></a> Then he was tested in his business too, and happily the truth is stated that he left all, a very fine statement as to persons in regard to their businesses, that one is ready to leave all, whatever it may be, and follow Jesus.<a name=41:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=41:4></a> Was polygamy in principle working at Corinth?<a name=41:5></a> Paul says, "Each of you says <i>I</i> am of Paul, and <i>I</i> of Apollos, and <i>I</i> of Cephas, and <i>I</i> of Christ" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:12">1 Corinthians  1:12</a>.<a name=41:6></a> Men, other than Christ were engaging them at Corinth.<a name=41:7></a> Paul says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:2">2 Corinthians  11:2</a>.<a name=41:8></a> He transfers the affection all to Christ in the second epistle.<a name=41:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=41:10></a> He does indeed: they were espoused spiritually, not literally in the ordinary sense; they were espoused spiritually to one Man, that is, to Christ, as a chaste virgin.<a name=41:11></a> But I do not just see why you bring in the many.<a name=41:12></a> The point was that he had espoused them to one Man and that, of course, would include not only the wives but the husbands too; that is to say the whole of the saints at Corinth were espoused spiritually to one Man, that is to Christ.<a name=41:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=41:14></a> Is this Peter's way of doing what Paul was doing in 1 Corinthians, setting household matters right in view of assembly service?<a name=41:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=41:16></a> I think that is the important point to begin with in this chapter, setting the household matters right; we have so much trouble among the saints because of these matters that are not adjusted.<a name=41:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=41:18></a>L.<a name=41:19></a> Would it be right to suggest that this great principle goes back to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>where the lack of headship and lordship came to light in Eve?<a name=41:20></a> Eve failed in not referring to her husband when the test came.<a name=41:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=42:15></a> That is a great source of weakness.<a name=42:16></a> Of course it is common in the world; many wives take up employment.<a name=42:17></a> But it is a great weakness amongst the saints and if the wives do not need to work it really amounts to sin.<a name=42:18></a> If you have enough to support your family and you allow your wife to take on employment it amounts to sin, because it is exposing the woman to the devil.<a name=42:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=81:1></a> It may be of advantage to be reminded that elderhood, or eldership, is in mind here, Peter himself saying that he was a fellow-elder, and besides that, a "witness of the sufferings of the Christ" and a "partaker of the glory" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:1">1 Peter  5:1</a>.<a name=81:2></a> Today the idea of eldership is seen largely in what are called care meetings, that is to say, meetings in the various localities where there are assemblies, in which matters are discussed frankly as the brethren are together, but with no assumption to be definite or final in the decisions reached.<a name=81:3></a> All matters for judgment or discipline are to be left for the assembly.<a name=81:4></a> It is noticed that in some parts of the world these care meetings have been used for decisions for final action; not intentionally, but perhaps through want of understanding as to the truth of the real position at the present time.<a name=81:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=81:6></a> Do you mean that if a case comes up for deliberation in the care meeting, and it is felt at the time that it necessitates administrative action in the assembly, we must not accept that as conclusive but wait for the assembly meeting?<a name=81:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=82:7></a> It is just to avoid the negative side, that a meeting of the Lord's people in which the breaking of bread takes place and all that is attendant upon it is not a negative idea; it is a positive idea.<a name=82:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=82:11></a> That is illustrated in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:20">1 Corinthians  11:20</a> where the apostle says, "When ye come therefore together into one place"; he does not speak of a subdivision though there was evidently more than one gathering in Corinth.<a name=82:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		The thought now is to take up the history of Jacob as such.<a name=102:2></a> We have begun at chapter 28 -- the point at which Jacob had deceived his father.<a name=102:3></a> This and other things that follow show that God has not taken up a man of great perfection to set out His thoughts.<a name=102:4></a> He has taken up Jacob, a man marked by great uncertainty in his early life, and as we said, deceiving his father in a most shameful way, his mother being in it too.<a name=102:5></a> His father is seen here as being concerned about his family connections, his marital connections, which is a matter that all young people should take account of.<a name=102:6></a> So Isaac is concerned about a wife for Jacob, as Abraham had been for Isaac.<a name=102:7></a> The marital side has an immense place in the Scriptures and Isaac is outstanding as to it.<a name=102:8></a> His father had caused the eldest servant of his house to swear that he would not take a wife for him of the daughters of the land, but that he would go to his own people, which the servant did.<a name=102:9></a> The history is given in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>in which we have the idea of the Spirit of God taken up in a peculiar way, in a way in which the light is shed, I believe, on the whole truth of the Spirit at the present time.<a name=102:10></a> It is a question in one's mind as to how we may approach this subject, not saying too much on one point of it, but seeing what a place it has in the divine thoughts and how it is to work out eternally; because it is to work out eternally in what the assembly is to Christ: Christ and the assembly.<a name=102:11></a>

		S.McC.<a name=134:4></a> The passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:36">Romans  11:36</a> would necessarily involve the Spirit in the way you are speaking of Him, would it not?<a name=134:5></a> "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever".<a name=134:6></a>

		THE PRESENT DISPENSATION AS SET FORTH IN JACOB AND JOSEPH (3)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=139:1></a> The selections in the book of Genesis to be read at these meetings have in mind the service of God; also the various vicissitudes that God permitted to occur to bring out the peculiar kind of man that Jacob was, at the same time bringing out the basic facts as to him, that he fitted God's purpose of setting forth what is in His mind in the present dispensation.<a name=139:2></a> This necessitates peculiarly this chapter.<a name=139:3></a> As the brethren will notice, there is in the chapter a certain repetition of what preceded it, but at the same time there is increase in the quality of Jacob himself, spiritual quality, which will be seen in certain facts that we shall note as we proceed.<a name=139:4></a> Then the thought is particularly to point out the administrative side which was provided for in his family.<a name=139:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Early in this chapter, as we shall see more fully later, the administrative side is provided for, but there is besides that the idea of the generations of Jacob.<a name=139:6></a> Generation is one thing, and spiritual administration is another.<a name=139:7></a> The administration in spiritual development that gave rise to the idea of generations in Jacob will be seen later, in chapter 37, in which particular chapter it appears that his generations are confined to Joseph; but then it is in mind that the subject should be resumed in Jacob, and it is resumed in chapter 46.<a name=139:8></a> I mention all this so that we should keep the items in our minds and see how administration is provided for in the service of God, also the idea of generation.<a name=139:9></a> And then later, so as to fill out the thoughts, we have Joseph's history implementing the history of Jacob in a peculiar

		Then the idea of occupation, what our occupation may be in the service of God and how selections may be made from the whole number in view of occupation and in view of previous experience.<a name=140:6></a> Then Jacob himself comes to the fore eventually in view of his age, as an old man, having acquired great experience which is working out in the thought of service, the service of God, especially in worship.<a name=140:7></a> The worship of God is most prominent in the end and it is linked up with the age of Jacob, so that we are to keep in our minds that the service of God in the sense of worship depends on experience, and conscious experience, even although there may be defects mentally or physically.<a name=140:8></a> Yet the experience is there that serves the purpose of God in His service, as we shall see in the last chapter.<a name=140:9></a> I venture to outline what is in mind so that the brethren will have it in their minds and that we all might get help together.<a name=140:10></a> Therefore in chapter 35 we are in the

		J.T.<a name=172:9></a> That is a question of very great importance.<a name=172:10></a> I would think the apostle is taking into account the state of things at Corinth, and the question of persons making much of themselves.<a name=172:11></a> "Yet to us", he says, "there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and <i>we</i> for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and <i>we</i> by him" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>.<a name=172:12></a> I think the apostle just leaves the thing here, but he is referring to certain persons who thought they knew.<a name=172:13></a> Will you please read the passage?<a name=172:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=173:2></a> That is what I was thinking, that the apostle decided he would just leave it with the Father and the Son as to this question of knowledge; he just confines himself to that, leaving the Spirit out formally, we might say; not that he would not bring Him in in due time, but he just leaves the Spirit out for the point in question.<a name=173:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=173:12></a> Quite so; in that chapter it says, "the Lord is the Spirit"; it is a very remarkable thing, you hardly get it elsewhere.<a name=173:13></a> It should be made much of, I am sure, that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.<a name=173:14></a> We might say the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of the Father too, but it emphasises that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty, that is to say, He makes way for things.<a name=173:15></a> He makes way for things in that He knows everything at first hand here below, because He is here all the time.<a name=173:16></a>

		As we have been saying together in prayer, it is a time of blessing.<a name=182:1></a> It is perhaps wise to call attention to the fact that God is, as it were, more liberal than we are apt to think about persons who have been misled and have strayed from the path, so that if we find there is a real basic work in them we may have be sure that God will not leave it unfinished.<a name=182:2></a> We should be very gracious with our brethren in this respect.<a name=182:3></a>

		But now as to chapter 48, it is perhaps necessary to say that whilst it deals with Jacob and Joseph, for Joseph has a great place in it, yet it is not exactly a question of the father and the son in the typical sense.<a name=182:4></a> Joseph is the son, of course, but his remarks are not right in regard to Ephraim and Manasseh; whereas Jacob is right and is able to correct his son.<a name=182:5></a> So that here Joseph is really the type more of persons; not of the Son of God in this chapter, but of one of ourselves, one of the brethren.<a name=182:6></a> Yet we cannot ignore the fact that he has a great place with that Jacob and a great place with Pharaoh and in the whole chapter.<a name=182:7></a> At the same time we may say he is just a believer, and therefore we may take courage as to believers in general, though at the same time we have to watch, especially if we are young, not to assume too much because of our earlier history, but to go by facts; as Job said, "how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is" <a href="../bible/Job.htm#26:3">Job  26:3</a>.<a name=182:8></a> Let us have it as it is, at the same time taking into account the grace of God and His readiness to restore and to correct what may be wrong.<a name=182:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=269:1></a> Our subject is the brethren of Christ.<a name=269:2></a> It is thought that we should first bring out the significance of the word 'brethren' by itself, and then go on to the brethren of Christ.<a name=269:3></a> The subject is one that is constantly in our minds and therefore it is thought that we should take a wide view of it, noting how the relationship in which we stand to divine Persons is seen in the scriptures read.<a name=269:4></a> It is thought we should have a wide outlook, and I should say a contextual outlook, as to the scriptures read - Thus <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>contemplates the ordinary sense in which brethren are regarded.<a name=269:5></a> The brethren have come together in a certain place, what we may call a rendezvous, and it says, "in those days Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:15">Acts  1:15</a> -- that is, there were not only brothers, the apostles, but sisters also.<a name=269:6></a> Mary the Lord's mother and others were there and they were called brethren and we are told how many there were; and then as Peter stands up to address them he uses the word "Brethren".<a name=269:7></a> So we can see how the term 'brethren' may be regarded as prominent in its application to us; and when we come together in assembly with a view to assembly service this is how we regard each other.<a name=269:8></a>

		One word has been with me in view of this meeting and that is <i>permanency</i> -- I may say, permanency of abode which opens up a wide scope for our consideration.<a name=290:5></a> A basic feature of what I have to say begins with Sarah.<a name=290:6></a> It is always happier and freer to begin with persons rather than events or things.<a name=290:7></a> And so Sarah comes to mind in view of death and burial, and resurrection, too; the whereabouts of the believer's eventual and permanent abode.<a name=290:8></a> There can be no more important thought than this and Sarah is the first one who is spoken of as buried.<a name=290:9></a> She is the loved one, carried down with great distinction into the New Testament for it is said of her that she is our mother, she is a type of Jerusalem above which is our mother.<a name=290:10></a> She was the wife of the great patriarch Abraham who, when she died, made great preparation for her burial.<a name=290:11></a> Her resurrection and ascension and part in heavenly places are not within the range of the preparation of man, but of God.<a name=290:12></a> We rest in this, for as regards the heavenly part, we must think of God and God bringing with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.<a name=290:13></a> There will be much brought to earth, but those who sleep through Jesus will be brought as already well known, but brought here to be seen alive and Sarah will be amongst them.<a name=290:14></a> Sarah will be amongst those who sleep through Jesus, indeed, all the sleeping saints will be there.<a name=290:15></a>

		Scripture carries her through as one who spoke scripture.<a name=291:1></a> There are few who are regarded as speakers of scripture and Sarah is amongst them.<a name=291:2></a> Hearken unto Sarah thy wife, Jehovah said to Abraham.<a name=291:3></a> It was not to hearken to what she wrote but to what she spoke.<a name=291:4></a> It was a vivid word: "Cast out this bond-woman and her son" <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:30">Galatians  4:30</a>, and the divine word to Abraham was, Hearken unto Sarah thy wife.<a name=291:5></a> And so she comes out as a speaker of scripture: "What says the scripture?<a name=291:6></a>" <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:30">Galatians  4:30</a> is one of the actual phrases in the epistle to the Galatians.<a name=291:7></a> It was Sarah's statement but it is regarded as scripture.<a name=291:8></a> Well, you may wonder why I am stressing Sarah but it is only to bring out the main thought that is in mind and that is how the sleeping saints are retained, and I might say, contained.<a name=291:9></a> Sarah is in the cave of Machpelah.<a name=291:10></a> She is there awaiting the assembling shout.<a name=291:11></a> She is representative of those who are contained by God, retained where they should be according to divine purpose in the provisional sense as sleeping saints.<a name=291:12></a> Sarah has been there for thousands of years.<a name=291:13></a> She is there and known to be there and others are with her, too.<a name=291:14></a> In fact, we may take Machpelah to be the suggestion of the place of the sleeping saints.<a name=291:15></a>

		And so Joseph, a worthy son of Sarah, as I may say, lived to be a hundred and ten years old and died in Egypt, but he was not buried there.<a name=291:16></a> He was put into a coffin.<a name=291:17></a> The word 'coffin' should be 'ark', meaning a suitable vessel for the contents it bore, Joseph's bones.<a name=291:18></a> Well, I only mention him in connection with Sarah to show how permanency may be applied to the sleeping saints, but only in a provisional way, but to remind us that they are not simply thrown into the earth as cattle might be.<a name=291:19></a> The purchase of the field and the cave of Machpelah is an evidence and an assurance that the saints are not treated thus when they die, nor indeed is man as such treated thus, but especially not those who

		It is said of the saints that they have part in <i>that</i> world and the resurrection; not <i>this</i> world with its graveyards and mausoleums but <i>that</i> world, to be spoken of objectively.<a name=292:13></a> We can well afford to speak objectively when the Custodian of the persons who have part in it is God Himself.<a name=292:14></a> And so Joseph's bones were cared for in Egypt but buried in the land; that is to say, whence all of us are to be taken, for we belong to the promised land, dear brethren.<a name=292:15></a> I am speaking of this now to bring out that the thought of care must be attached to all matters relative to the saints, whether living or dead.<a name=292:16></a> We are objects of supreme care and we treasure this.<a name=292:17></a> So Abraham said, "… that I may bury my dead" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#23:4">Genesis  23:4</a>.<a name=292:18></a> It was not Sarah, simply, but <i>my</i> dead -- his property, no less than that -- but his property to he held under certain suitable circumstances again to be brought out into eternal circumstances.<a name=292:19></a> Wonderful!<a name=292:20></a>

		And now I pass on to the well-known passage in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>.<a name=293:1></a> But I might say in passing that Thessalonica was reserved of God for an assembly, and the assembly there has a peculiar title.<a name=293:2></a> It is called the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father.<a name=293:3></a> I want the dear brethren to treasure these things that I am saying, particularly the things said about the Thessalonians in the opening passages of both epistles.<a name=293:4></a> We read: "Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:1">1 Thessalonians  1:1</a>.<a name=293:5></a> The exact translation from the original gives us the word 'assembly' rather than 'church'.<a name=293:6></a> The word 'church' usually refers to a building made of stones or brick and mortar, whereas the word 'assembly' refers to persons and persons only.<a name=293:7></a> So that there is good reason for stressing the word 'assembly', and thus it is the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father.<a name=293:8></a> No other assembly is addressed in just this way and we can see that Thessalonica was reserved in the mind of God for something special and hence the reference to the sleeping saints and the resurrection and ascension.<a name=293:9></a> I use the word 'ascension' for we are to ascend, dear brethren.<a name=293:10></a> And so, in chapter 4, we have the Lord referred to as coming out of heaven with an assembling shout.<a name=293:11></a> The apostle says: "For if we believe that Jesus has died and has risen again, so also God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:14">1 Thessalonians  4:14</a>.<a name=293:12></a> And then there is a parenthesis: "For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that <i>we</i>, the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord, are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep; for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:15">1 Thessalonians  4:15</a>,16.<a name=293:13></a> I have not read it all but it is one of the most striking passages in the Scriptures and it refers to an act of the Lord

		But I now speak of what the Lord Himself does in regard to the sleeping saints and how, in a certain sense, the idea of permanency applies initially; maybe for four hundred years, maybe for four thousand years, during which time divine care is exercised until the final act takes place which is what I now wish to speak about.<a name=295:16></a> Our passage brings in what God will do and what the Lord Himself will do.<a name=295:17></a> What preparation, we might say!<a name=295:18></a> The Father and the Son and the Spirit undoubtedly will have part in it all.<a name=295:19></a> The Father is said to raise the dead, and the Son is said to raise the dead and quicken them, and the Spirit is said to quicken, but the One specially mentioned as raising us is the Son, the Son of God.<a name=295:20></a> It is, in a way, regarded as His province, not that it is so absolutely, hut in a general sense.<a name=295:21></a>

		So it is said here that the Lord Jesus descends from heaven with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God.<a name=296:1></a> It is His matter.<a name=296:2></a> It is as if the Lord considers it as a matter that is special to Him.<a name=296:3></a> Not that He would exclude the Father and the Spirit, because He does not, but at the same time I think that the Lord regards it as His special matter to say to the sleeping saints over whom He watches.<a name=296:4></a> We here are not yet asleep; we are among those who are alive and remain and the Lord is watching over us here tonight.<a name=296:5></a> He regards us as of the assembly in its present provisional condition here on earth where the service of God and the gospel are carried on.<a name=296:6></a> Those who have fallen asleep have passed out of this for the moment but we are all to be united presently at the moment of the assembling shout.<a name=296:7></a> And so the word here is "the word of the Lord" and it is that "the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord,, are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:15">1 Thessalonians  4:15</a>.<a name=296:8></a> It is the word of the Lord, a special word of His.<a name=296:9></a>

		According to <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>we have an additional thought, that of our house in heaven.<a name=297:8></a> It says, "If our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:1">2 Corinthians  5:1</a>.<a name=297:9></a> I want you to note that that is in the second epistle -- not in the first.<a name=297:10></a> We are carried into what is heavenly in finality in the service of God, and the second epistle treats of the heavenly side of the service of God and the permanency of our position in eternity.<a name=297:11></a> I am using strong words and sentences which I wish to be received deeply into our hearts.<a name=297:12></a> I am dealing now with the sleeping saints and how they are raised and come into a building not made with hands but eternal in the heavens.<a name=297:13></a> That is how the saints come into permanency as having fallen asleep through Jesus, we come into this heavenly matter, a building of God eternal in the heavens.<a name=297:14></a>

		These scriptures are obviously bound together in their import, as you will have noticed.<a name=300:1></a> Reference is made in them to the Holy Spirit who is seen early in the divine record.<a name=300:2></a> They record the early features of the Holy Spirit in the Bible which I hope to link up with the reference in John's gospel.<a name=300:3></a> That passage will enable me to speak of the Holy Spirit as He appeared in relation to the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=300:4></a> We can well understand that in speaking of this subject it is quite to be expected that the Lord Jesus should be brought into it, to see how He used the Holy Spirit and how the Holy Spirit used Him.<a name=300:5></a> These two things go together.<a name=300:6></a> The Spirit is to be used in the service and He is to use the servant, too; so that we are right in selecting this passage in John's gospel, for it shows that the Lord Jesus used the Spirit and that the Spirit used Him.<a name=300:7></a> In fact we could cite many passages to confirm this.<a name=300:8></a> There is one in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:18">Luke  4:18</a>, for instance, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach".<a name=300:9></a> We can thus see how early the thought appeared in the New Testament.<a name=300:10></a> But I want to touch on each of the passages read from Genesis and to point out how the Holy Spirit is introduced.<a name=300:11></a> In the very first chapter He is seen acting of Himself and by Himself: "The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:2">Genesis  1:2</a>.<a name=300:12></a> He was not serving anyone, nor was anyone using Him as on later occasions.<a name=300:13></a> He was acting of Himself.<a name=300:14></a> It does not say that God was using Him, He was acting of Himself -- hovering over the face of the waters.<a name=300:15></a> We can see, therefore, dear brethren, how majestic the passage is, standing out uniquely as to the Holy Spirit Himself.<a name=300:16></a> It is the first time He is mentioned in Scripture.<a name=300:17></a> Later we are told that God

		I have the consciousness that the dear brethren are very sympathetic with what I am seeking to say, and I value this for it is most important to see that the Spirit of God has put Himself in the very forefront of the divine record to show that He is available to <i>do</i> things.<a name=301:12></a> He is hovering over the face of the waters but He is doing enough to show that He has power to do things, and He is preparing to do <i>great</i> things.<a name=301:13></a> The very page from which we have read was written by Him.<a name=301:14></a> Every Scripture, mark you, every Scripture, is inspired of God and the inspiration is by the Spirit, and every Scripture is profitable.<a name=301:15></a> And this one is profitable.<a name=301:16></a> Indeed, you could hardly get a passage that is more profitable than this one, right in the forefront of the holy page.<a name=301:17></a>

		Well, we will now look at the passage in chapter six.<a name=301:18></a> You will notice that it reads: "My Spirit shall not always plead with Man; for he indeed is flesh; but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:3">Genesis  6:3</a>.<a name=301:19></a> Now these are historical but authoritative facts.<a name=301:20></a> And after the first chapter this is the first mention of the Spirit.<a name=301:21></a> The first mention is that He is acting of

		Well, in chapter 41 we have the Holy Spirit acting in a man.<a name=303:4></a> Few persons in Scripture are more attractive than Joseph.<a name=303:5></a> The story of Joseph interests the young people.<a name=303:6></a> Indeed, it has been attractive and usable to almost every true christian, I suppose.<a name=303:7></a> There is hardly a true christian who has not read something about Joseph and has not been impressed by it; and now Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is saying something about Joseph: "Pharaoh said to his bondmen, Shall we find one as this, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?<a name=303:8></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:38">Genesis  41:38</a>.<a name=303:9></a> He is the first one of whom we read that the Spirit of God was in him.<a name=303:10></a> It is a wonderful fact that there was such a man then; and it is a wonderful fact that there are many such now!<a name=303:11></a> But Pharaoh has learned about Joseph and is impressed with the fact that there is a man in his realm that has the Spirit of God.<a name=303:12></a> The great king of Egypt deigns to refer to Joseph in this way.<a name=303:13></a> He says, in principle, We cannot find another man like him!<a name=303:14></a> He values the fact that Joseph has the Spirit of God.<a name=303:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this is important, but I want to show briefly how the Holy Spirit is seen so early in the Bible and what a place He has.<a name=303:16></a> It is not a very great place to begin with, but still He is seen first as acting of Himself, then acting for Jehovah as being used by Him, and now as being in Joseph and the king of Egypt calling attention to this great fact.<a name=303:17></a> Surely all this is worthy of notice!<a name=303:18></a> And as I speak in this way it is appropriate to enquire if there are persons here who have not received the Spirit of God.<a name=303:19></a> He is available and if you have not received Him ask for Him.<a name=303:20></a> "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=303:21></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:13">Luke  11:13</a>.<a name=303:22></a> Have you ever asked God for the Spirit?<a name=303:23></a>

		And you have not received Him?<a name=304:1></a> It is a serious matter if you have not received Him.<a name=304:2></a> So that it is a matter to be enquired into as to whether persons have the Spirit, and if so, are they using Him and is He using them.<a name=304:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#31:3">Exodus  31:3</a>,5 we find a man that was used by the Holy Spirit; it says that Jehovah had "filled him with the spirit of God … to devise artistic work … to work in all manner of work".<a name=304:4></a> What a man Bezaleel was!<a name=304:5></a> And here Joseph is usable in the mind of Pharaoh because the Spirit of God was in him.<a name=304:6></a> I appeal again to every one here as to whether you have the Spirit, and if you have not, I would urge you to ask God for Him and He will give Him to you.<a name=304:7></a> I am certain that He will.<a name=304:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will go on to the New Testament.<a name=304:9></a> The matter is more fully developed there.<a name=304:10></a> We have read from the first chapter of John's gospel, one of the most important chapters in the Bible; but what is particularly before us now is the great fact that the Spirit came upon the Lord Jesus.<a name=304:11></a> How suitable is the thought that He should thus receive the Holy Spirit!<a name=304:12></a> The word as to it is that "John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:32">John  1:32</a>.<a name=304:13></a> Think of such a sight!<a name=304:14></a> Does it say that angels saw it?<a name=304:15></a> Did men see it?<a name=304:16></a> No; John alone saw it and bore witness and said, "I beheld the Spirit descending".<a name=304:17></a> Think how honoured he was!<a name=304:18></a> This was John the baptist, as we all are aware, of whom the Lord said that of all the men born of women there was not another like him.<a name=304:19></a> Remarkable tribute!<a name=304:20></a> What a man he was!<a name=304:21></a> He is highly spoken of in Luke's gospel, but now he is seen as bearing witness.<a name=304:22></a> He says of the Lord that he knew Him not, and yet he was the Lord's cousin, I would say.<a name=304:23></a> He was related, after the flesh, to the Lord of glory.<a name=304:24></a> Wonderful thing!<a name=304:25></a> What pains heaven had taken to introduce christianity!<a name=304:26></a> Think of heaven's selection of John to bear witness!<a name=304:27></a>

		It will be observed that we have the idea of "thy brother", not simply a brother, but thy brother.<a name=320:8></a> I am endeavouring to use words carefully and the brethren, I know, will be very sympathetic on these lines.<a name=320:9></a> So I refer to the expression "thy brother", and that, in effect, should affect every heart here, for it is not simply the word 'brother', but a christian that is in mind.<a name=320:10></a> Therefore it might be a sister that would sin against another sister.<a name=320:11></a> The Lord selects His words in infinite wisdom.<a name=320:12></a> So the word is, "If thy brother sin against thee …" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:15">Matthew  18:15</a>.<a name=320:13></a> It is not sinning against God, but "sin against thee".<a name=320:14></a> There again is a careful selection of words, for the word 'brother' is prominent and the word 'sin' is prominent and the word 'thee' is prominent.<a name=320:15></a> Each of these words is brief but each is distinctive.<a name=320:16></a> The passage says, "Go reprove him" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:15">Matthew  18:15</a>.<a name=320:17></a> It does not say to write to him; it does not even say to speak to him, but to <i>reprove</i> him.<a name=320:18></a> Do not hesitate.<a name=320:19></a> When reproof is needed we are not to hesitate to extend it.<a name=320:20></a> But it is to be alone, "between thee and him alone" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:15">Matthew  18:15</a>.<a name=320:21></a>

		The next thing I would stress is, "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:15">Matthew  18:15</a>.<a name=321:1></a> It is a great matter to gain a brother!<a name=321:2></a> "He that brings back a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death" <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:20">James  5:20</a>.<a name=321:3></a> Not simply a man, but a soul: "… shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins" <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:20">James  5:20</a>.<a name=321:4></a> These are very important remarks in regard to assembly relations and services.<a name=321:5></a> I am keeping to the word 'assembly'.<a name=321:6></a> I am using it now objectively.<a name=321:7></a> It is a matter of assembly relations and the question is whether I can gain my brother in these relations.<a name=321:8></a> "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.<a name=321:9></a> But if he do not hear thee, take with thee one or two besides" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:15">Matthew  18:15</a>,16.<a name=321:10></a> Notice that it is "one or two", not several -- one or two besides.<a name=321:11></a> These are to be most carefully chosen; this is phraseology which is most carefully selected by none less than the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=321:12></a> It is in view of gaining a brother.<a name=321:13></a> It is the negative side.<a name=321:14></a> "If he do not hear thee" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:16">Matthew  18:16</a>.<a name=321:15></a> And then, "… take with thee one or two besides" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:16">Matthew  18:16</a>.<a name=321:16></a> Personality is in mind in all this, for it is "that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:16">Matthew  18:16</a>.<a name=321:17></a> Now notice a further word that is to be stressed, and that is 'matter'.<a name=321:18></a> It is "every matter".<a name=321:19></a> So that it is not this particular matter only, but a general idea that is being propounded -- that <i>every</i> matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three.<a name=321:20></a>

		Now the next thing is, "Again I say unto you, that if two of you …" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>.<a name=322:8></a> Now notice that this is another injunction entirely.<a name=322:9></a> It is another matter, different from the one with which we have been dealing.<a name=322:10></a> "Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>.<a name=322:11></a> Now notice that the matter comes from heaven.<a name=322:12></a> It is not from an angel; not simply from heaven, but from "my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=322:13></a> And it is not simply "from my Father" but "from my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=322:14></a> The Lord Jesus is speaking about two persons, but not simply two persons, but "two of you".<a name=322:15></a> I want you to notice that; the value of two <i>such</i> persons is in mind -- the relative value of two such persons.<a name=322:16></a> And I would point out that we have here an illustration of the word that "two are better than one and a threefold cord is not quickly broken" <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#4:12">Ecclesiastes  4:12</a>.<a name=322:17></a> This statement is related to what I am speaking about.<a name=322:18></a> Here it is two of <i>you</i>: "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>.<a name=322:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I shall seek to analyse what I have in mind, for I want to enlarge on this phraseology which the Lord used about two or three.<a name=324:3></a> "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>.<a name=324:4></a> I have used the word 'virtue' and it is a sort of principle entering into phraseology -- a principle that has power in it.<a name=324:5></a> There is power in the principle of being gathered together, but not only gathered, gathered <i>together</i>.<a name=324:6></a> There is virtue from the Lord's own lips in that phraseology.<a name=324:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it may be that there are some here that are not breaking bread, or not in fellowship, as we say, and I would aim especially at them.<a name=324:8></a> Or if there are some that have not been long in fellowship, one would desire that all such might get the principle of this passage into their souls -- especially the young people.<a name=324:9></a> But I would not confine the word to the young people; I would not limit it.<a name=324:10></a> Quoting from the facts we have about the Lord's own life I would say that the age of twelve should govern, largely, the principle of persons coming into fellowship, taking their places in the fellowship of God's Son.<a name=324:11></a> We have the Lord's own example that He was found in the midst of the doctors at the age of twelve, hearing them and asking them questions, and His mother rebuked Him.<a name=324:12></a> Reference to the mother of the Lord brings to mind what is being said of her by certain nominal christians, that she has been exalted even bodily into heaven, which is falsehood.<a name=324:13></a> The devil is using it, and it is quite right to speak of it and to denounce it with all our strength It is a terrible thing that has come into the profession at this time.<a name=324:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I proceed to enlarge upon the phraseology in our Scripture, and I want to say immediately that it
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=325>[Page 325]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		has a great hearing on the present time amongst the brethren.<a name=325:1></a> Numbers are few, but the Lord brings them down to the very fewest number -- two or three.<a name=325:2></a> This phraseology bears on the whole position of the assembly at the present time.<a name=325:3></a> If you traversed the whole continent of America, the continent of Europe, and the continent of Asia, this phraseology has to do with conditions everywhere in the assembly at the present time.<a name=325:4></a> But I am trying particularly to make much of the word 'together'.<a name=325:5></a> It is not simply gathered, but gathered <i>together</i>.<a name=325:6></a> And it bears on how we come into the assembly or place of meeting.<a name=325:7></a> I would say that we use the word 'meeting' far too much.<a name=325:8></a> We should use the expression 'gathered together' more frequently, and I trust that this will result from what I am saying, that the phraseology 'gathered together' should be used far more frequently among us in preference to using the word 'meeting'.<a name=325:9></a> The idea of meeting is that <i>we</i> do it.<a name=325:10></a> The brethren meet, of course, but think of the virtue that there is in the idea of gathering together!<a name=325:11></a> I would urge very strongly that we want to take this on and see how we reach the idea of coming into the assembly, the place of gathering, the place in which we gather, where the assembly <i>gathers</i>: "Where two or three are gathered together" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>.<a name=325:12></a> In gathering we are really touching the idea of the assembly, whether composed of two or three or more in any given place or locality.<a name=325:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind that when we disperse, if the Lord pleases, we should go to our localities carrying back in our minds the idea of gathering together.<a name=325:14></a> It is a heavenly thought come down to earth and it has peculiar virtue in it.<a name=325:15></a> The word 'meeting' does not have the same virtue.<a name=325:16></a> It is a word that can be used, and is used by the Holy Spirit, for the saints shall meet the Lord in the air and go to heaven together.<a name=325:17></a> But gathering together is another idea.<a name=325:18></a> The words

		have great virtue in them because there is a point in the power of gathering together.<a name=326:1></a> Some indefinable thing happens when the actual gathering of the saints takes place.<a name=326:2></a> There is something virtuous in it that does not attach to merely coming to a meeting place.<a name=326:3></a> So I would emphasize again the thought of gathering together so that we might take with us from this meeting the thought of gathering together.<a name=326:4></a> It is a divine thought but I think we will prove, as we apply it, that this great thought is recognizable amongst the brethren now.<a name=326:5></a> Years ago it was more so than it is now but I am seeking to mention it as I have done several times of late.<a name=326:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I count upon God to help us as we separate after these meetings and go to our several localities, that we carry with us this great idea that "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>.<a name=326:7></a> It is not simply in the midst, but in the midst of <i>them</i>.<a name=326:8></a> It is the persons who gather thus, for the virtue is in persons -- such persons -- that is where the power is.<a name=326:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will close now, but in doing so I would again stress what has been said about the Lord's phraseology so that we should have a fuller thought of virtue.<a name=326:10></a> The woman of <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>is spoken of as a virtuous woman.<a name=326:11></a> I use the word in that sense.<a name=326:12></a> There is virtue in what I am saying about the power of gathering together unto the Lord's name.<a name=326:13></a>

		I wish at this time, beloved brethren, to speak about men, that is, men as belonging to others; such as, the men whom the Father gave to Christ -- the Father's men; Solomon's men; David's men; Joab's men; and the men of Hezekiah.<a name=327:1></a> The kind of being expressed under the term "man" is, of course, in mind, one with sympathetic feeling with God, for He says, as recorded in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness".<a name=327:2></a> What was in the divine mind then has been unfolded; one of the main lines of divine instruction relates to that order of being, extending back to what is spoken of as the period "before the foundation of the world" and extending onwards and onwards and onwards without limit of time, entering into eternity.<a name=327:3></a> The gospel of Luke brings heaven in in an exultant way as Jesus was born, taking on that order of being -- for that is what the incarnation means -- a multitude of the heavenly host appeared to the shepherds saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:14">Luke  2:14</a>.<a name=327:4></a> Notice it is "men" there.<a name=327:5></a> When heaven itself, in the Father's voice, announced its feelings, it was to a <i>Man</i> -- "In thee I have found my delight" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:11">Mark  1:11</a> -- but not exclusive of others, for room was made for the plural thought; it is not '<i>all</i> my delight' there, as we sometimes say, it is "my delight".<a name=327:6></a> There would be an expansion of that inclusive of the men of purpose, all of whom are to be like that Man, and each relatively and all together pleasing to God.<a name=327:7></a> So that we shall be included in the divine expressions of satisfaction in that order of being, Christ being the Firstborn among <i>many</i> brethren.<a name=327:8></a> Anticipative of all this, wisdom, in Proverbs, speaking as personified, says that it rejoiced in the "habitable part" of God's earth.<a name=327:9></a>

		There are other parts -- having their purpose, for nothing was brought into being without a purpose; the uninhabited parts have their service to render -- but wisdom was thinking of the habitable parts, and it says that it rejoiced in them.<a name=328:1></a> God indeed made the earth not in vain, or waste or empty.<a name=328:2></a> He made it to be inhabited, the word 'inhabited' having man in mind, and it is the habitable earth that is taken into account in Scripture, for the whole of the earth was for man; it was made to be inhabited, So that wisdom proceeds to say that her "delights were with the sons of men" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:31">Proverbs  8:31</a>; whether the allusion to sons is prophetic or not, it is there, and would suggest that sonship is the most delightful relationship in which men are to appear, a relationship indeed in which God intends them to appear; and the longer we delay in getting into that relationship consciously and intelligently, the more we are depriving heaven of its rights and its pleasure.<a name=328:3></a> It is in that relationship that God intends to have men, hence the incarnation brought in sonship in the highest and most supreme way, for it is no less than a divine Person in that relationship, nevertheless a Man.<a name=328:4></a> So that God has Man in Christ.<a name=328:5></a> That was what He had always before Him, for Adam was but a figure of Him that was to come.<a name=328:6></a> I make this latter remark, dear brethren, because it is of importance that we should see that it is in this relation that God intends to have our race, that is, manhood as in Christ.<a name=328:7></a> That is how things are to stand ultimately, and the more delayed they are now in us through negligence or carelessness, the more we deprive heaven of its rights in us.<a name=328:8></a>

		Then finally, I would say a brief word as to the men of Hezekiah.<a name=340:1></a> "These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:1">Proverbs  25:1</a>.<a name=340:2></a> You may wonder what that has to do with this matter.<a name=340:3></a> A great deal -- the statement honours Hezekiah, that his reign was a reign in which there was regard for the things of God.<a name=340:4></a> The more influence I have, the more I spread it so that there might be increase of regard for the things of God.<a name=340:5></a> There are those who say we have too much ministry, too much printed ministry; well, the men of Hezekiah did not think so in their day.<a name=340:6></a> These proverbs evidently had lain unread, and these men of Hezekiah copied them out.<a name=340:7></a> You all know how many proverbs Solomon spoke -- three thousand.<a name=340:8></a> We have about a tenth of them, including these.<a name=340:9></a> But it would seem that these particular ones, including this chapter and up to chapter 29 had been lying unread, unused, and these men of Hezekiah saw that they were worth copying.<a name=340:10></a> It is a word for those who take notes and transcribe them -- and I have a great regard for them, for they are workers together with all those who work for God.<a name=340:11></a> It is an honour to Hezekiah that he had such men; they were not selfish men, they were not murderous, like Joab's men; they were men of feeling, and they saw that these proverbs were needed and they copied them out.<a name=340:12></a> And so it is that men of this kind today, dear brethren, are set for the dissemination of the truth, for the spread of it.<a name=340:13></a> The Lord said, "Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:46">Matthew  24:46</a>, that is, ministering a portion of meat to the household.<a name=340:14></a> Every one who is set to spread the truth abroad so that there is food for the house, may be classified as one of the men of Hezekiah.<a name=340:15></a> I commit the word to the Lord, and to you, for His blessing.<a name=340:16></a>
