		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> In every dispensation there has been Prophetic ministry.<a name=1:3></a> You get it in the first world in connection with Enoch.<a name=1:4></a> He was a prophet, and Abraham was a prophet.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=1:6></a>S.<a name=1:7></a> Jude indicates that as to Enoch.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:9></a> It comes out more clearly in each dispensation when things have declined; when departure from that which God had established in each dispensation took place the prophetic ministry was more in evidence.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=1:11></a>S.<a name=1:12></a> I suppose it would come in for the purpose of recovery after departure had taken place.<a name=1:13></a> When you speak of dispensation, do you include christianity?<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:15></a> Certainly.<a name=1:16></a> It was in that connection I had the liberty to suggest the thought as bearing on ourselves.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=1:18></a> I suppose you would say the conditions obtain now that call for the application of prophetic ministry.<a name=1:19></a> You were remarking that prophetic ministry comes in in the Scriptures when there is a breakdown of that which God may have established.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:21></a> I think it is more apparent then.<a name=1:22></a> So in our dispensation the book of Revelation takes that character.<a name=1:23></a> It is consequent on the decline which set in in the assembly.<a name=1:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=1:25></a>N.<a name=1:26></a> Has it only for its object the idea of recovery?<a name=1:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:28></a> In the main, I think; but not <i>only</i> recovery; it has the character of an address to the whole responsible body of any given era.<a name=1:29></a> It places the whole body under responsibility, although they may not understand; it may not be intelligible to them,

		and this may be judicial; but while it places the whole body under responsibility, it encourages the remnant.<a name=2:1></a> It establishes the remnant by bringing in God's mind in regard to a future dispensation.<a name=2:2></a> Each remnant is allowed to look forward to another dispensation in which their hopes and desires should be established; so that prophecy includes, therefore, the announcement of future things.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=2:4></a> The Lord's ministry in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>has a judicial character, because the very scripture we have read is quoted there.<a name=2:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:6></a> And also <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>.<a name=2:7></a>

		R.S.<a name=2:8></a>S.<a name=2:9></a> What do you allude to in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>?<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:11></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>is quoted first in verse 38: "who hath believed our report?<a name=2:12></a>" and then the Lord says, "Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart" (verse 40).<a name=2:13></a> But you get in the prophetic ministry encouragement for the remnant as to what is future.<a name=2:14></a> For instance, Enoch said he saw the Lord coming with ten thousands of His saints.<a name=2:15></a> He was evidently alone, but it would be an immense thought that there should be myriads of God's saints, and the Lord should come with them.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=2:17></a>S.<a name=2:18></a> Why do you say he was alone?<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:20></a> The Spirit does not mention any other.<a name=2:21></a> It says, "Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:24">Genesis  5:24</a>.<a name=2:22></a> He had the testimony that he pleased God.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=2:24></a> Each mention of Enoch seems to present him as alone.<a name=2:25></a> There is no expression of any others being in association with him, whether he is walking with God or whether in connection with what the Spirit takes up through Jude.<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=2:27></a>S.<a name=2:28></a> Does the ministry that is given to the remnant in that way, or in connection with what is future, necessarily affect the remnant themselves, or is it for others or both?<a name=2:29></a> I mean that God gives a ministry to the remnant when failure comes in, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		this has usually what God has before Him in regard to a future dispensation; is that in connection with the remnant themselves, or is it in connection with others?<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:2></a> I think, as I said, it places the whole public body under responsibility, for God had sent the prophets to the nation.<a name=3:3></a> You will find that each prophet as a rule records the date of his prophecy, and it is a very remarkable thing that the last prophet addresses <i>Israel</i> -- the whole nation.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=3:5></a>S.<a name=3:6></a> As in contrast with Judah or Ephraim.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:8></a> You get Elijah and Elisha ministering in the midst of the ten tribes; whereas Isaiah, Jeremiah and Hosea, and others whose histories are not recorded, ministered in Jerusalem.<a name=3:9></a> But it is a very remarkable thing that the burden of the very last prophet, who evidently ministered to the recovered remnant from Babylon, is to Israel.<a name=3:10></a> I mean Malachi.<a name=3:11></a> Isaiah prophesied in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, and his word had reference to Judah and Jerusalem.<a name=3:12></a> Evidently he had in view a remnant in relation to God's city.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=3:14></a>S.<a name=3:15></a> That is very interesting.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:17></a> I suppose you would say the prophetic ministry becomes effective in the remnant while it does not in the people at large.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:19></a> It places the body at large under responsibility, God having made a fresh overture to them; but it establishes the remnant in the knowledge of God's interests, and the announcement of a future order of things in which all their hopes should find their realisation.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=3:21></a>S.<a name=3:22></a> 'In which their hopes should find realisation' -- that answers my question.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:24></a> So you find at the end of this section in Isaiah that their hopes are all realised.<a name=3:25></a> They engage in a song of triumph to Jehovah in connection with the realisation of all their hopes.<a name=3:26></a> Chapter 12.<a name=3:27></a>

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=4:1></a> In every prophetic ministry, would there not be a distinct word of the Lord for the nation?<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:3></a> That is exactly the point, so that the Spirit gives us the date of the ministries of the prophets.<a name=4:4></a> Therefore, in order to understand the conditions over which the different kings reigned, you have to examine the prophets that ministered in each reign.<a name=4:5></a> For instance, we might take Josiah's reign as a remarkable one, which it was, and yet the prophet Zephaniah ministered in Josiah's reign, and if you read Zephaniah there is no encouragement as regards the body at large; God was coming in in judgment to remove them.<a name=4:6></a> So that you get the internal state of the body at large in the prophet, whereas the record of the king's reign may be very bright and encouraging.<a name=4:7></a> In the latter the Spirit is simply putting forward the personality of the king and his faithfulness, whereas the prophet deals with the people.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=4:9></a>S.<a name=4:10></a> That is very helpful indeed.<a name=4:11></a> So that in reading the Scriptures it would be well to read both the historical part of the books of Kings and Chronicles and the prophets together.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> It is essential to do that if you wish to understand the conditions that prevailed in each reign.<a name=4:14></a> You may take any era of the history of the church; God might give a powerful ministry through some servant, and the Spirit might present that ministry to you and encourage you with it, but that servant being removed, the condition of the body at large comes into evidence, and things are not so bright as you might have thought they were.<a name=4:15></a> God is acquainted with the state of the people, and you must examine the character of the ministry to determine the state of the people.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=4:17></a> That state is always laid bare by the prophet.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=4:19></a>S.<a name=4:20></a> Did the state of the people not depend also on the kind of a king they had?<a name=4:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:22></a> No doubt the kings had a good deal to do

		with the forming of the people, but at the same time the low underlying condition of the people in the days of Hezekiah and Josiah is marked in spite of the faithfulness of the king.<a name=5:1></a> In this prophecy of Isaiah you see the terrible condition that existed in the people.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=5:3></a>N.<a name=5:4></a> And that in the reign of godly kings.<a name=5:5></a> Speaking of Josiah, the manner of his death was long a mystery to me.<a name=5:6></a> It is helpful to see that the state of the people was beneath it.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.T.<a name=5:8></a>F.<a name=5:9></a> A godly king affected the people outwardly.<a name=5:10></a> Their inward state came out in another way.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:12></a> The state of the people came out in the wilderness; they were idolatrous.<a name=5:13></a> God said, "I will carry you away beyond Babylon", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:43">Acts  7:43</a>.<a name=5:14></a> That was before ever they went into Canaan.<a name=5:15></a> God acted in love towards them, but the state of the people was marked by unbelief from start to finish.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.A.<a name=5:17></a>T.<a name=5:18></a> While the state of the people in general was one of unbelief, did you not say the word in the prophets is more directly to the remnant as a word of encouragement?<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:20></a> It was that, but it was a word to the people at large as well, as we have been saying.<a name=5:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=5:22></a>N.<a name=5:23></a> And so the thought of judgment is found largely in the prophecies.<a name=5:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:25></a> No doubt, in every prophet.<a name=5:26></a>

		W.J.<a name=5:27></a>N.<a name=5:28></a> And there is the same thought in the New Testament prophecies.<a name=5:29></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:30></a> There must be of necessity, because they are introduced on account of declension; where departure sets in God must intimate judgment.<a name=5:31></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:35></a> You get it in the next chapters.<a name=5:36></a> For instance, Isaiah had a son called Shear-jashub, and he was to go to the king with that child, the meaning of the name of the child being

		<i>a remnant shall return</i>.<a name=6:1></a> There you see how God meets the people.<a name=6:2></a> This chapter is preliminary to what follows, because the prophet himself needed light.<a name=6:3></a> What enlightens us in regard to the prevailing conditions is the sight of the King, the King seen in His true light; thus everything is seen in its true light; "mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts".<a name=6:4></a> Isaiah discovers his own state and the state of the people.<a name=6:5></a>

		J.L.<a name=6:9></a>J.<a name=6:10></a> You would say we need to see the King in the same light today.<a name=6:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:12></a> As Isaiah saw Him.<a name=6:13></a> The throne had been disgraced by the line of kings.<a name=6:14></a> Uzziah was a peculiar character.<a name=6:15></a> He became a leper.<a name=6:16></a> He had attempted to enter into the temple to minister as a priest, and he became a leper, and we are told he dwelt in a separate house till the day of his death.<a name=6:17></a> It was in the year that he died that Isaiah saw the King.<a name=6:18></a> Jotham was his son.<a name=6:19></a> Jotham was not the ruling king now.<a name=6:20></a> The ruling king was Jehovah, and he says, "I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne".<a name=6:21></a> The throne had been vacated; Uzziah had died, and what the prophet sees is God upon His throne; that is the sight you want to see if the responsible element fails; "his train filled the temple".<a name=6:22></a> He was on the throne, and He was supreme in the temple also, so things were secure.<a name=6:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=6:24></a>S.<a name=6:25></a> What would you say King Uzziah set forth?<a name=6:26></a> Was it presumption?<a name=6:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:28></a> It was presumption for one not a priest to take up priestly service.<a name=6:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=6:30></a>S.<a name=6:31></a> So it set aside in that way the holiness of God.<a name=6:32></a> None, even the king, could approach Him save a priest.<a name=6:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:34></a> It was a denial of the character of the house.<a name=6:35></a> Both the throne and the house had been affected, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=7:2></a>S.<a name=7:3></a> Uzziah really defiled both.<a name=7:4></a>

		J.P.<a name=7:5></a> And it is what marks the moment that gives it such wonderful force; it is in the year that King Uzziah died.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:7></a> That is what I was thinking of.<a name=7:8></a> Isaiah is to be the vessel for the conveyance of God's mind to the people, and he is furnished at the start with this wonderful vision.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=7:10></a> Is there not always some revelation of God to a prophet at the start?<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:12></a> Always something that indicates the state of things in which his ministry is to be carried out.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=7:14></a> It is the character of God.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:16></a> It is like a man's gift.<a name=7:17></a> He gets some particular view of Christ.<a name=7:18></a> For instance, Elisha saw Christ, typically, going up, and he saw the chariots and the horsemen; that is, the grace of Christ ascending would fill his soul, and his ministry would be accompanied by the power of God to carry that grace into effect.<a name=7:19></a> So here, the throne and the temple were the two features that every right-minded Israelite would have before him, and Isaiah begins with this wonderful vision.<a name=7:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=7:21></a>N.<a name=7:22></a> Why are the seraphim here?<a name=7:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:24></a> Because it is a question of God's nature.<a name=7:25></a> It is a question of the ministry of grace, but in connection with God's holy nature.<a name=7:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=8:5></a> They are connected with God's nature, I think, and in this instance they guard His nature.<a name=8:6></a> "Holy, holy, holy".<a name=8:7></a> It is a question of guarding the divine nature; but then there is activity in connection with that, and it takes the form of relief; He relieves the prophet.<a name=8:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=8:9></a>S.<a name=8:10></a> When you speak of guarding God's nature, would that include love as well as holiness?<a name=8:11></a>

		J.B.<a name=8:15></a> Is He not taking into account the earth here and also man in this connection, "the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory"?<a name=8:16></a> The question was asked as to the love as well as the holiness, and here God is regarding the Man in whom the love of God is expressed.<a name=8:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:18></a> But I think the point is, everything is secured divinely in the presence of the state of the people.<a name=8:19></a> The throne and the temple and the nature of God, guarded morally by the seraphim -- all this in the presence of the state of the people.<a name=8:20></a> The people were unclean.<a name=8:21></a>

		The passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>was especially pressed on my mind in connection with the need for keeping lowly in this world, and that the testimony of God is connected with those that are lowly.<a name=96:1></a> You will find in the Scriptures that those who are thus lowly, and so qualified to be the custodians of God's testimony, receive elevation.<a name=96:2></a> Now it is just with the thought that we might close with that, that I venture to say a word.<a name=96:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe it is a thought that is carried through Scripture from the beginning; that God in the sovereignty of His ways reserves a <i>special</i> place of blessing.<a name=96:4></a> You will find it in the garden of Eden.<a name=96:5></a> Eden was a wonderful place, but the garden was eastward in Eden, specially prepared of God as the abode of man.<a name=96:6></a> Then you will find in the ark, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>, an allusion to relative elevation.<a name=96:7></a> The ark was prepared according to divine appointment, and so was to be made with lower, second and third storeys; that is, God was indicating that in the order of things which should obtain before Him there should be degrees of elevation.<a name=96:8></a> And so in the tabernacle; there was the holiest of all, the holy place and the court.<a name=96:9></a> There you have, whatever way you view it, degrees of moral elevation, for in one sense the holiest of all refers to heaven.<a name=96:10></a> You get the same order in the temple, and in addition to that you have three tiers of chambers; the third more elevated than the second, and the second more elevated than the first.<a name=96:11></a> So in that way, I think, God indicates to us in the Scriptures that in the order of things that is to obtain before Him there are to be degrees of elevation.<a name=96:12></a>

		Now what I wish should remain with us in a special way is that in God's sovereign ways we come in for that which is highest.<a name=97:1></a> We cannot say why it is so.<a name=97:2></a> The parable in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>contemplates, in a sense, the whole universe.<a name=97:3></a> God is supreme in it.<a name=97:4></a> It is His house.<a name=97:5></a> There are high rooms and low rooms.<a name=97:6></a> What I would like to convey is, that God produces in this present dispensation an order of people that are morally qualified for the highest place; that is to say, they come into the house in the most lowly character.<a name=97:7></a> How do they come into the house?<a name=97:8></a> They come in by invitation.<a name=97:9></a> We have all come in by invitation.<a name=97:10></a> If you will observe one who has really received the invitation from God, so as to come to Him through Christ, he comes in in a lowly character.<a name=97:11></a> Christ was the lowliest of all who ever trod the earth, and the message takes character from the vessel.<a name=97:12></a> A man that has been really affected by the gospel has a distinctive character as he comes in; he is lowly; he takes the lowest room.<a name=97:13></a> That is a sure mark of one who has rightly received the gospel.<a name=97:14></a>

		The gospel is God's means of inviting; the house is large; it has many rooms, and the man who has rightly received it proves his reception of the gospel by the way he behaves himself directly he enters the house.<a name=97:15></a> So the moral of the parable is: "whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted".<a name=97:16></a> Now I think that in the house today the great effort is self-exaltation.<a name=97:17></a> Naturally everybody is set for that.<a name=97:18></a> If we cannot attain it in the world, very often it happens that the church becomes the field for our ambition.<a name=97:19></a> It is so in the history of the church.<a name=97:20></a> There is no doubt about it.<a name=97:21></a> The fact is this, that the conditions at the present time in Christendom afford a wide field for human ambition; from the See of Rome down to the smallest parish a wide field is

		J.T.<a name=109:10></a> Chapter 12 refers to the affection found in the remnant of Israel, Mary and Martha and Lazarus forming a sort of picture of the remnant at Bethany; there was affection for Christ and if there is affection for Him you will signalise it in some way; there is something done for Him, so there they made Him a supper; and then the Spirit tells us that Lazarus was one of those that sat at the table with Him.<a name=109:11></a> It is an allusion to the last days, when the Holy Spirit will have formed affection for Christ in the earthly remnant, and they will signalise it.<a name=109:12></a> The Song of Songs are a great help in that direction, showing the relations between Christ and His earthly bride; the presence of Lazarus points to the fact that they would be in relation to Christ on the ground of resurrection.<a name=109:13></a> But in chapter 20 they are gathered as having the testimony of Mary Magdalene.<a name=109:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to say a word, beloved friends, in regard to eldership, and so I have turned to these scriptures.<a name=127:1></a> I take eldership to be the result of <i>experience acquired in identification with the testimony of God</i>.<a name=127:2></a> Hence it is that which lies at the end of christian experience.<a name=127:3></a> What I have to say therefore will take the form of the consideration of experience through which God passes His people.<a name=127:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When God gives an expression of any feature of His testimony, you will find that a course of experience follows, so that the divine thought should be worked out in man.<a name=127:5></a> God never forgets His testimony; it stands out as the standard with which the experience consequent upon it has to agree.<a name=127:6></a> The Lord Jesus Christ was the Son as man here upon earth, and every feature of God's testimony was expressed in the Son <i>becoming man</i>.<a name=127:7></a> God took occasion to call attention to Him as "my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>.<a name=127:8></a> There was the proclamation from heaven in regard to His Son, and every testimony of God found expression in Him.<a name=127:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord has left the earth, but ere leaving it He set up the divine standard, and the history of the assembly under divine teaching and culture is to bring out in result, in the experience of God's people, that which agrees with what was set forth in Christ.<a name=127:10></a> Hence the great importance of experience; as the apostle Paul says, "I have <i>learned</i>", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:11">Philippians  4:11</a>.<a name=127:11></a> We have to come to that; we have to <i>learn</i>.<a name=127:12></a>

		were glimmerings of light in regard to Christ as the Son, and some trait of His character was in measure set forth in every man of faith from Abel downward.<a name=129:1></a> Abel is an example.<a name=129:2></a> To say nothing of his offering, <i>he</i> was a keeper of sheep.<a name=129:3></a> That was the foreshadowing of a trait of Christ, for the Lord Jesus Christ, beloved friends, is the true Shepherd.<a name=129:4></a> Thus some trait of Christ is seen with every man of faith.<a name=129:5></a> They were, so to speak, <i>elders;</i> by faith "the elders obtained a good report", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:2">Hebrews  11:2</a>.<a name=129:6></a> The character of Christ was being built up into their experience; this is what marks an elder.<a name=129:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if God gives expression to any feature of His testimony, He is never diverted from it until He brings it to pass in the experience of man here upon earth.<a name=129:8></a> I wish especially to speak of government; for the elders here, as you will observe, are connected with the throne.<a name=129:9></a> God gave expression to His thought in regard to government in Noah.<a name=129:10></a> God deposited in that man a testimony; he was to rule over the new world.<a name=129:11></a> We know how he failed, and how he was unable to rule <i>himself;</i> he was devoid of the experience of a ruler.<a name=129:12></a> He had affection for his house, and he prepared an ark for the saving of his house, but he was devoid of the ruler's character, for he was unable to rule himself.<a name=129:13></a> But the testimony of God must be maintained, and hence the next man of faith, Abraham, <i>has</i> the spirit of the ruler; he has it in his conception of government; as if God had said, It fell to the ground in Noah, but it shall be maintained in Abraham.<a name=129:14></a> He took Abraham into His confidence on the ground of the fact, among others, that he would "<i>command his children and his household</i> after him", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:19">Genesis  18:19</a>.<a name=129:15></a> There you get God reverting to His testimony committed to Noah.<a name=129:16></a> He had not forgotten it.<a name=129:17></a> He knew Abraham, He knew that He had put something into that man;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I want to show is that even in David you find the same principle; that there must be experience and exercise.<a name=131:3></a> After he was anointed he had to spend a long period of time going through the most terrible experiences; so that, as thus disciplined and taught of God, he should become a qualified vessel to maintain divine rule.<a name=131:4></a> David is the typical king, and hence the Spirit of God takes him up to convey to us in inspired words what a king should be.<a name=131:5></a> "He that ruleth over men", says David in his last words, "must be just", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:3">2 Samuel  23:3</a>.<a name=131:6></a> That was in his <i>heart;</i> it had been wrought out in his experience, so that he could tell what a king should be: "ruling in the fear of God, and he shall be as the light of .<a name=131:7></a>.<a name=131:8></a>.<a name=131:9></a> a morning without clouds", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:3">2 Samuel  23:3</a>,4.<a name=131:10></a> But David could not come up fully or answer morally, to the divine idea.<a name=131:11></a> A "morning without clouds" could only find an answer in Christ, but it is very beautiful that in the last words of David we get that perfect expression of what a king should be, <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23">2 Samuel  23</a>.<a name=131:12></a>

		I desire, beloved friends, to say a word to you in regard to citizenship.<a name=144:1></a> Citizenship of necessity has its centre in a city, although it is not confined to a city.<a name=144:2></a> The idea of a city arose very early in the history of humanity.<a name=144:3></a> It did not arise from any divine conception, so far as we know.<a name=144:4></a> The first city that Scripture speaks of was that built by Cain, and it is a well-known fact that, while Cain built the city, he did not call it after his own name; he called it after the name of his son.<a name=144:5></a> I connect that in my mind with the position of the Jew as having murdered Christ, for Cain was the type of the Jew guilty of the murder of Christ, and Barabbas is properly the production of judaism.<a name=144:6></a> The name Barabbas, as you know, signifies the son of the father; that is, he bears the characteristics of his father.<a name=144:7></a> It was a dreadful thing that the people whom God had taken out of Egypt, before whom all His wonderful signs had been set forth, to whom the oracles of God had been committed, that they should be possessed of a murderous heart.<a name=144:8></a> When His beloved Son appeared in their midst Barabbas was the product, as we may say, of that system of things.<a name=144:9></a> Now Cain's city was called after the name of his son; that is, the son of the murderer, and that son was in type Barabbas, who, beloved friends, was the choice; <i>man's</i> choice in preference to Christ!<a name=144:10></a> Now in that you have one feature of the world-city: it bears the name of the son of the murderer, who was according to his father, because he was the son of the father.<a name=144:11></a> I speak of that because it conveys to us some idea of the character of the world city.<a name=144:12></a>

		I wish to say a word in regard to christian unity.<a name=167:1></a> It is a subject of all importance, for it is bound up with, and is properly the outcome of, the gospel.<a name=167:2></a> The gospel involves the revelation of God, and when God is revealed we come to see that unity is in the Godhead; that is what has come to light in the Son become Man.<a name=167:3></a> Thus the Persons in the Godhead come into view, and we see the wonderful spectacle of divine unity; so that in the proclamation of the glad tidings the unity of the Godhead is brought into evidence.<a name=167:4></a> God is One, and all unity upon earth flows from that.<a name=167:5></a> God will not tolerate any other unity upon earth than that which is the result of His testimony.<a name=167:6></a>

		Now, beloved friends, I desire as briefly as I can to convey to you some idea of the character of christian unity.<a name=167:7></a> You will have observed in the chapter which I read in Genesis that the descendants of Noah had unity before them; they would band themselves together in defiance of God, their object being their own exaltation; that was the end in view in the structure which they proposed to build; a structure which has many counterparts today.<a name=167:8></a> The object in view was to build a city and a tower to reach to heaven, so that man should have a name.<a name=167:9></a> You have there the germ of all human workings; you have indicated the object in view in all human activity away from God from that day until this.<a name=167:10></a>

		Then you will find that whilst awaiting His promise, the gift of the Spirit, they recognised the authority of the Scriptures in the choice of an apostle to fill Judas's place; the Scriptures being the only authority left upon earth, seeing that Jesus had gone into heaven.<a name=175:5></a> To these men the Holy Spirit came, and as endued with power from on high, they carried on their ministry.<a name=175:6></a> The Holy Spirit coming down from heaven, we are told, sat upon each of them; there were others there as we know, but I speak for the moment of the apostles.<a name=175:7></a> The Holy Spirit came into the company, and His sound filled the house where they were sitting, and He sat upon each of them.<a name=175:8></a> Peter in the power of that Spirit stood up and testified for Christ.<a name=175:9></a> Now that is the apostolic position; it was characterised by affection for Christ, by submission to the authority of the Scriptures, and energised by the Holy Spirit come down from heaven.<a name=175:10></a> That continued through the Acts, I might say, up to chapter 15.<a name=175:11></a> They were in complete identification with Christ, representing His authority here upon earth.<a name=175:12></a>

		What I wish to show is that side by side with that there appeared a spontaneous element, which is represented in Barnabas.<a name=175:13></a> I am not overlooking the fact that Barnabas was called an apostle; he was an apostle in virtue rather of what he was morally than by official appointment; that is, he was

		sympathetic with what was going on.<a name=176:1></a> Barnabas first appears in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>.<a name=176:2></a> We are told that he had lands and he sold them.<a name=176:3></a> Now we might have thought he sold them because he cared no longer for them; that, in the light of what was heavenly, brought in by the Spirit, he who had title to the earthly possessions surrendered them; but <i>that</i> is not the way in which the Spirit of God presents the matter to us.<a name=176:4></a> Barnabas had a true estimate of his property, I have no doubt, and did not undervalue it; we are told by the Spirit that he <i>sold</i> his lands.<a name=176:5></a> Why did he do that?<a name=176:6></a> Clearly because he saw that he could use the price for the furtherance of the testimony.<a name=176:7></a> He was taken up with the testimony, and he brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.<a name=176:8></a> That is to say, he recognised the authority of the Lord in His apostles.<a name=176:9></a> They were there with power to administer, and he brought to them what he had; he had land, he sold it, and devoted the money to the service of the testimony.<a name=176:10></a> It was not exactly Levitical service, although he was a Levite; his gift was not spiritual for the moment.<a name=176:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will recall how in Israel the Levites were divided into two classes: there were those who carried the holy things upon their shoulders, and there were those who had waggons.<a name=176:12></a> I take Barnabas' gift in a sense to be a waggon; he recognised the necessities connected with the testimony, and he brought what he had got for his lands and laid it at the apostles' feet.<a name=176:13></a> What came to light in connection with his action indicates the Lord's appreciation of what he did.<a name=176:14></a> He was sympathetic with the testimony, and the apostles named him, his name had been Joseph, but they called him Barnabas -- "Son of consolation", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:36">Acts  4:36</a>.<a name=176:15></a> Now that is what I understand to be an evidence of his sympathy with the testimony.<a name=176:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Barnabas, who was a "good man and full of the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:24">Acts  11:24</a>, recognised this work; he recognised the movement of the testimony and he was in complete sympathy with it.<a name=177:8></a> What did he do?<a name=177:9></a> He went down to Tarsus to seek out Saul.<a name=177:10></a> He was instinctively in the mind of God, and recognised what God had done, and how the testimony had moved.<a name=177:11></a> He sees that Saul is the man for the occasion; he goes to Tarsus to seek him out, and he takes him, not to <i>Jerusalem</i>, but to <i>Antioch</i>.<a name=177:12></a> Thus the testimony moved on, and correlatively the authority of Christ in the apostles, until we come to chapter 15.<a name=177:13></a> That is to say, the service of God was set up among the gentiles, and you will find in tracing these chapters that the Spirit of God pursues it until it is enshrined at Ephesus.<a name=177:14></a>

		I make another remark in regard to Ephesus: the economy of the house of God is in connection with Ephesus.<a name=177:15></a> Timothy was at Ephesus when Paul wrote his first epistle to him, and it is this epistle above all others which should govern us in relation to the house of God.<a name=177:16></a> The house of God, beloved friends, is a heavenly institution.<a name=177:17></a> The

		In this eighth chapter of Luke's gospel we have what in a measure corresponds with all that I have been saying; that is, we have the apostles; they are <i>with</i> the Lord; and then there are those also who represent the subjective state; the sympathy that would sustain the testimony.<a name=178:6></a> These had been benefited by Christ, and the names of some of them are given to us.<a name=178:7></a> It is said of them that they ministered to Him of their substance; they were in complete sympathy with His position in connection with the testimony.<a name=178:8></a>

		I just refer for a moment to what follows in this chapter, and that is, the authority of the word.<a name=178:9></a> One might speak of it in another way, in connection with <i>sowing</i>, but I refer now to its <i>authority</i>.<a name=178:10></a> The fruit of the word is spoken of as a hundredfold; those who "in an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it".<a name=178:11></a> There is a peculiar touch here, which is confined to Luke's gospel.<a name=178:12></a> It is only in Luke that the <i>hundredfold</i> is spoken of.<a name=178:13></a> In the gospel of Matthew the result of the seed sown in the good ground is said to be an hundred, sixty, and

		thirty.<a name=179:1></a> Matthew contemplates things <i>set up</i> in perfection and a perfect result -- an "hundredfold", but there is decline from a hundred to sixty, and from sixty to thirty; whereas in the gospel of Mark it is presented in the reverse order; that is, there is fruit, thirty, sixty, and an hundredfold.<a name=179:2></a> Mark presents increase of energy.<a name=179:3></a> Mark had at first failed as a servant (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:38">Acts  15:38</a>), but having been restored he was stronger at the end than he was at the beginning.<a name=179:4></a> Now Luke gives the full and perfect result of the testimony of God in the soul of man; it is not a question of our responsibility in that respect, or of the history of the church.<a name=179:5></a> What he is presenting is the ministry of grace; the effect of the Lord's ministry.<a name=179:6></a> In other words, he is presenting the full testimony by Paul; the <i>word of God</i>.<a name=179:7></a> When Paul went out from Antioch, it was to preach "the word of God", and Luke shows us that the word of God produces a perfect result.<a name=179:8></a>

		I now pass on to where the Lord's relations are referred to.<a name=180:3></a> It is good to have the light in our souls of our relation with the Lord as the result of His death and resurrection.<a name=180:4></a> One cherishes the thought that we are the "brethren" of Christ, not only of Christ as risen from the dead, but we are the brethren of the One who could say, "I ascend" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>), which in a certain sense is the most wonderful light that can possibly enter into the soul of a man.<a name=180:5></a> He who says, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father", also says, "My brethren".<a name=180:6></a> It is a divine Person speaking in the liberty of sonship.<a name=180:7></a> The Son has the full liberty of the house, and He can say, "I ascend"; and at the same time He associates us with Him as His brethren.<a name=180:8></a> I repeat, that no greater light can enter into the soul of man.<a name=180:9></a> But here in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:21">Luke  8:21</a>, we have the other side.<a name=180:10></a> The Lord says, "My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it".<a name=180:11></a> I am not introducing <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>into this passage; I referred to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>as showing the full light of our place.<a name=180:12></a> One can see in the Acts that the Lord in the course of the testimony indicates, that the earthly relations were abandoned, and that the new circle took form at Antioch and Ephesus, where divine relationships were established, which were connected, not with an earthly system, as Jerusalem was, but with heaven.<a name=180:13></a> The enemy saw it, and he essayed, by introducing legality, to capture the glad tidings of that wonderful liberty of sonship in the presence of God which was enjoyed at Antioch; but the saints were mercifully preserved, so that we see the full light of it in Ephesus.<a name=180:14></a>

		I propose to take up the book of Esther, and especially to make clear the manner in which the Spirit of Christ is set forth in that book.<a name=182:4></a> There could be nothing so interesting as tracing the Spirit of Christ in the Scriptures; the Spirit of God delights to enlarge upon it.<a name=182:5></a> You will find it presented in a variety of ways, for in truth no other spirit shall obtain in God's world.<a name=182:6></a> It began with Abel.<a name=182:7></a> We are told that he was a keeper of sheep; that was the Spirit of Christ, for Christ is the great Shepherd; He keeps His sheep.<a name=182:8></a> When I speak of the Spirit of Christ you can easily perceive it is not a question of the Holy Spirit as we know Him at present; it is the Spirit of God expressed in a man.<a name=182:9></a> Now that involves a great deal.<a name=182:10></a> It is the nature and character of God finding its expression here upon earth, in a man; it is a wonderful thought.<a name=182:11></a> God by His Spirit garnished the heavens (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#26:13">Job  26:13</a>); but His Spirit was to take form in a man, and it was indicated from the outset that the man that should obtain in the presence of God should be controlled by that Spirit.<a name=182:12></a> Any other spirit is obnoxious to God, so that we are told that, "If any one has not the

		Spirit of Christ he is not of him", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:9">Romans  8:9</a>.<a name=183:1></a> It is a very solemn thing to consider that if devoid of the Spirit of Christ we are absolutely outside the pale of christianity viewed essentially, be our profession what it may, but the Spirit of Christ possessing us renders us acceptable to God and to man.<a name=183:2></a> That was seen in Jesus; He found favour with God and also with man.<a name=183:3></a> I do not say with the natural man, but with man according to God.<a name=183:4></a> Men who have divine instincts appreciate the Spirit of Christ.<a name=183:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show how that Spirit is traced in the book of Esther; I shall dwell more particularly on Esther as the object, as it were, of the Spirit of Christ.<a name=183:6></a> I speak of Mordecai as also expressive of the Spirit of Christ, but he is more than that; we may all express the Spirit of Christ, but in Mordecai we have also a type of Christ.<a name=183:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point I would call attention to is a very important principle which is established in chapter 1.<a name=183:8></a> Mordecai does not appear there; it is a gentile scene, but there is a principle established which I may say governs God's world; namely, that a man should bear rule in his own house, and that he should speak in his own tongue; in other words, that his rule should be perfectly intelligible in house.<a name=183:9></a> That was the decree issued by the king; see verse 22, and it was universal.<a name=183:10></a> In order to seize the import of the book, we have to gather up the instruction in the preface, and that is what we find there: a man should rule his own house.<a name=183:11></a> We may apply this principle to the Lord Jesus; it is evident that He rules His own house, and speaks in His own language; that is, His articulations are perfectly intelligible to His house.<a name=183:12></a> No one can make himself understood as the Lord does, and He rules His own house.<a name=183:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Following upon that we may see how Christ is in type set forth in Mordecai.<a name=183:14></a> In the first place,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=184>[Page 184]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we are told that he sat in the king's gate, and that there he defended the throne.<a name=184:1></a> You may think that these are strange thoughts to put into a book in which the name of God is absent, but the book describes certain conditions under which the people of God were found; they were driven out from their inheritance and from Jerusalem; they were far away from the land of promise, and were scattered throughout the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of the Medes and Persians.<a name=184:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now those conditions enable the Spirit of God to present that which is for our comfort; that is, that on the one hand God is ruling in favour of His people providentially, and on the other hand the Spirit of Christ is active in their behalf, although not acting among them <i>officially</i>.<a name=184:3></a> There was neither priest nor Levite, tabernacle of witness, nor ark of the covenant; all were absent, but the Spirit of Christ was there, and the people of God can never be deprived of that; it shone in Mordecai; he sat in the king's gate, and as there he protected the throne.<a name=184:4></a> You will find in the end of the chapter, verse 21, that there were those who conspired against the king, and Mordecai had the matter exposed and the offenders brought to justice.<a name=184:5></a> One could enlarge on how that spirit shone in Christ: how every right of God's throne was defended by Him, how He went into death in order to overthrow the enemies of the throne, and how completely He has overthrown them!<a name=184:6></a> But I must pass on.<a name=184:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing we find in Mordecai is his absolute refusal to recognise Haman the Agagite.<a name=184:8></a> That also is the Spirit of Christ.<a name=184:9></a> It shone in Him personally; He refused the Agagite at every point.<a name=184:10></a> We are all more or less acquainted with Agag the Amalekite, of whom Haman was the representative.<a name=184:11></a> Haman had gained great ascendancy in the empire, and that is a marked illustration of our own day.<a name=184:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=185>[Page 185]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see that order of man in the place of rule today, and he has attained a wonderful position of ascendancy.<a name=185:1></a> Now what I would especially point out is the refusal on the part of Mordecai to bow to him.<a name=185:2></a> He sat in the gate; he defended the king; but never would he recognise the Amalekite.<a name=185:3></a> Haman represents a principle or element that dominates the christianised world.<a name=185:4></a> I want to make it as practical as I can for we all have to do with him.<a name=185:5></a> His boast was the multitude of his children, chapter 5:11; it was one of the leading features of his greatness, and there are ten of them specially mentioned by the Spirit.<a name=185:6></a> I need not enlarge on that.<a name=185:7></a> Now here is an exile Jew under reproach, yet sitting in the gate without any outward support, and he refuses to bow to Haman.<a name=185:8></a> Die he might, but recognise Haman?<a name=185:9></a> Never!<a name=185:10></a> That is the Spirit of Christ.<a name=185:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show you how that Spirit acted towards the people of God, for you may rely upon it that that which defends the throne, that which refuses satanic power, will take care of what is of God.<a name=185:12></a> These two things go together, and we find that what illustrates the character of Mordecai more than anything is his attitude towards Esther.<a name=185:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In my apprehension of the book, Esther refers to the remnant of the people of God as they then were.<a name=185:14></a> Her father and mother were dead.<a name=185:15></a> We have to do with conditions that are exceedingly like this.<a name=185:16></a> God will not own the public body today; He hides His face from it.<a name=185:17></a> One can easily see that from the addresses to the assemblies in the book of Revelation; but I only just state here that the public body is no longer owned of God.<a name=185:18></a> It has become a huge Babylonish system dominated by the spirit of Haman, whose children and the multitude of whose sons are distinguished therein.<a name=185:19></a> But has God abandoned His people?<a name=185:20></a> Never!<a name=185:21></a> God is unchangeable.<a name=185:22></a> He is ordering things in our favour, and you may depend

		As I have already remarked, Esther may be taken to represent the remnant of God's people.<a name=186:9></a> She is deprived of her parents, and is in a state of orphanage, and what we find is that Mordecai comes forward.<a name=186:10></a> Now the light of God entering the soul is intended to produce movement.<a name=186:11></a> If the light is received there must be movement, and directly you are moved by the light, you have to abandon certain things that you have leaned upon for protection.<a name=186:12></a> You are deprived, speaking morally, of your parents, of all that which supported you naturally.<a name=186:13></a> Well, Mordecai comes forward, and he takes Esther, and he not only provides for her in his house, but he takes her to be his daughter; there is affection.<a name=186:14></a> He may have had a sense of obligation to look after her, but it was affection that led him to take her to be his daughter.<a name=186:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a touching thing that you find affection springing up in the heart of Christ which is ready to express itself on your behalf so that you suffer no loss for what you have lost naturally.<a name=186:16></a> But further, he not only takes her to be his daughter, he would promote her.<a name=186:17></a> The Lord Jesus Christ is set for your

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Mordecai had light.<a name=187:7></a> It is a great thing to have light, a great thing to know what to do.<a name=187:8></a> Many christians are hampered because they do not know just what to do.<a name=187:9></a> Mordecai understood the situation and recognised the elements that were available, and what would be for the advantage of Esther.<a name=187:10></a> There was Hegai, the keeper of the women, a notable man; one who was acquainted with all that was in the house of the women.<a name=187:11></a> Without making things too literal, I am free, in using them as types, to say that the Holy Spirit is acquainted with all the resources of the house, and with all that there is for our advantage, and I think that the Holy Spirit is set forth typically in Hegai as taking account of Esther.<a name=187:12></a> She <i>found favour with him</i>, and as she progressed in her experience in the palace she was wise enough to recognise him; she declined to take anything save that which he prescribed.<a name=187:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I use these things as illustrations.<a name=187:14></a> The Holy Spirit is acquainted with all that is in the house, and He endows you with that which makes you presentable, so that coming forth as clothed, and adorned, and perfumed by Him, you are presentable; and as you are presentable you are promotable; you must be presentable in order to

	<div class="paragraph">
		be promotable.<a name=188:1></a> Esther was fair to look upon by nature, I dare say, but she became more desirable by the attentive service of the keeper of the house of the women; and finally she is <i>presented</i> to the king.<a name=188:2></a> I do not enlarge upon that, although a good deal might be put into it; but the result is that she is not only presented to the king, but she obtains the place of honour; she is the queen!<a name=188:3></a> Now that was a wonderful feat to accomplish.<a name=188:4></a> Mordecai was a wonderful man, as we shall see further on, but here it was a wonderful feat, to place a lonely orphan, as queen upon the throne of the Persians!<a name=188:5></a> But what the Lord Jesus Christ accomplishes with every believer is greater.<a name=188:6></a> We may think lightly of it, but it is a wonderful thing to be placed presentable before the king, and it was all the fruit of the affection and wisdom of Mordecai.<a name=188:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the last chapter, because, after all, whilst the Spirit delights to set forth the effect of Christ's work, His great aim is to bring in the glory of Christ.<a name=188:8></a> You can never reach the divine end unless you apprehend the glory of Christ, and Christ reaches the pinnacle of glory whatever be the road He travels.<a name=188:9></a> In every path which the Lord takes up He reaches that end, and what we find here in type is that He reaches it by His prowess.<a name=188:10></a> That is to say, it is not presented in an official way.<a name=188:11></a> What we have set forth here in Mordecai is Christ in the exercise of His care for His people, and His wisdom in carrying it out.<a name=188:12></a> Ultimately Mordecai comes into recognition in the empire, and Esther greatly aided him in that.<a name=188:13></a> You may say, that in applying the types to Christ, it detracts from the glory of Christ to imply that we might aid Him in reaching this wonderful position; but what I mean is, that as we are adorned by the adornment of Christ we <i>commend</i> Him.<a name=188:14></a>

		but it was Mordecai who had put Esther in her place of honour, so there can be no question as to who was the greater of the two.<a name=189:1></a> And if the Lord Jesus Christ has adorned you with His graces, what is the effect?<a name=189:2></a> He is made known in public.<a name=189:3></a> By whom?<a name=189:4></a> By you and by me.<a name=189:5></a> One great point in the holy city in Revelation is that she is "the Lamb's wife", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:9">Revelation  21:9</a>.<a name=189:6></a> But it was He who <i>formed</i> her.<a name=189:7></a> The heavenly city is the product of Christ, the product of His quickening power, and she is the Lamb's wife.<a name=189:8></a> The Lamb is the sufferer; it implies the Lord Jesus Christ in rejection.<a name=189:9></a> God honours Him, and His wife comes down from heaven adorned with His graces.<a name=189:10></a> She, too, honours Him, and what He has made her promotes His glory.<a name=189:11></a> As it is said of the wise woman in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31:23">Proverbs  31:23</a>, "Her husband is known in the gates".<a name=189:12></a> And so I may say here as to the type, Esther becomes the means of Mordecai's exaltation, and eventually Mordecai appears as next unto the king.<a name=189:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God has exalted Christ to His right hand.<a name=189:14></a> Before ever the assembly existed historically the Lord was placed in the highest pinnacle of glory, in the right of His own Person, in the virtue of His own work, apart from the assembly, apart from the saints.<a name=189:15></a> But it is a wonderful thing, to my mind, to see how that His own formative work here upon earth sets forth His glory in another way.<a name=189:16></a> The product of His quickening power brings into the universe that which is the living expression of Himself.<a name=189:17></a> But personally He is rejected, He is the sufferer, and so she descends out of heaven as the bride, the <i>Lamb's</i> wife.<a name=189:18></a> I think if there is anything that I shall cherish in that day it is, that as the result of His own quickening power, I add something to His glory.<a name=189:19></a> He is praised in His own works; they promote His glory.<a name=189:20></a> We find later in the book that Esther made known to the king that Mordecai was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hoping that I have made clear what is in my mind as regards the Spirit of Christ as set forth here, I want just to dwell upon what marked Mordecai at the end.<a name=190:2></a> He is said to be "next to king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews".<a name=190:3></a> He had not previously been great among them evidently, but he had <i>acquired</i> a greatness among them.<a name=190:4></a> That has a peculiar application to our day.<a name=190:5></a> The term Jew, I take it, has reference to the people as coming under reproach.<a name=190:6></a> It was not a term known in Solomon's day, it came in later.<a name=190:7></a> From the use of the word in the addresses to the assemblies it seems to refer in our day to what is genuine.<a name=190:8></a> There are those "who say that they are Jews, and are not", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:9">Revelation  2:9</a>.<a name=190:9></a> We want to find the <i>Jews</i>, beloved friends, the genuine ones; and what we find is that Christ is great among them.<a name=190:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure it is to our advantage to recognise that the Lord has a great place among us.<a name=190:11></a> He ought to have a great place among us.<a name=190:12></a> I am not speaking of His death, of all that He has accomplished for the assembly and for the universe, but of what He has accomplished for <i>ourselves</i>.<a name=190:13></a> What has He not achieved for us!<a name=190:14></a> Hence He has obtained a supreme place amongst us.<a name=190:15></a> If you have come into contact with Him in your soul, He acquires a <i>great</i> place with you.<a name=190:16></a> It is said of Mordecai that he was "great among the Jews".<a name=190:17></a> I trust that the Lord Jesus Christ is <i>great among us</i>.<a name=190:18></a> We cannot add to His greatness.<a name=190:19></a> He is far above all principalities and powers in the heavens, but He also becomes great to us, through His care for us and His interest in us.<a name=190:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we read that He is "seeking the welfare of his people"; their deliverance was complete.<a name=191:3></a> We can thank God for every deliverance.<a name=191:4></a> Every deliverance is the result of the Lord's interest, but besides that He 'seeks our wealth'.<a name=191:5></a> You may be delivered and yet be poor.<a name=191:6></a> Many nations have obtained deliverance and have become poor through it.<a name=191:7></a> These Jews, who were scattered throughout the empire were <i>delivered</i>.<a name=191:8></a> Mordecai had effected complete deliverance for them, but they needed to be made wealthy.<a name=191:9></a> Now Mordecai is said to be seeking the <i>wealth</i> of his people.<a name=191:10></a> I do not think that we should be poor.<a name=191:11></a> It is true that the Spirit of God in Zephaniah refers to the remnant as "an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#3:12">Zephaniah  3:12</a>); but the Lord is seeking to promote our wealth in His own riches.<a name=191:12></a> He who was rich for our sakes became poor, that we through His poverty might be enriched.<a name=191:13></a> The Lord has never given up that; it is not His thought to leave us poor; He is seeking the wealth of His people.<a name=191:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To proceed a little on that line; if the Lord brings you into wealth spiritually, what is the result?<a name=191:15></a> I am speaking in a very practical way.<a name=191:16></a> You can afford to bring a bullock if you are wealthy; that is to say, the wealth that He endows us with reverts back to God.<a name=191:17></a> I do not know anything in the book of Ruth, for instance, more interesting than that the result of her union with Boaz was a <i>worshipper;</i> Obed was a worshipper.<a name=191:18></a> You may depend upon it that Obed was a wealthy man, for his father was wealthy, and the wealth of the father, we may be sure, descended to the son.<a name=191:19></a> Your worship will be

	<div class="paragraph">
		greatly limited unless you are spiritually wealthy.<a name=192:1></a> I repeat, that the Lord seeks the wealth of His people, and, if <i>you</i> are wealthy spiritually you have something to bring to God when you come to Him.<a name=192:2></a> You come with a bullock.<a name=192:3></a> A bullock was a very large offering, and could only be offered by one who owned one.<a name=192:4></a> You could not offer a borrowed one; the bullock must belong to you; and so, when you are wealthy, you draw near to God with a bullock, and God gets His portion, and the saints get theirs.<a name=192:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally we read of Mordecai, that he was "speaking peace to all his seed".<a name=192:6></a> I suppose we may be regarded as "his seed" in that light, for the saints are viewed in different ways.<a name=192:7></a> We are Jews as genuine; we are Christ's brethren; and we are His seed.<a name=192:8></a> The Lord regards us in all these lights, and the Spirit of God closes with this presentation of Mordecai -- he was "speaking peace to all his seed".<a name=192:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Lord continue to speak peace to us!<a name=192:10></a> The seed of the righteous will never beg bread, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#37:25">Psalm  37:25</a>; will never suffer loss, but it is a wonderful thing that the Lord speaks peace to us.<a name=192:11></a> If you hear the voice of trouble, you may depend upon it that it is not the <i>Lord's</i> voice.<a name=192:12></a> The voice of trouble is very prevalent, muttering discontent; but it is not the voice of the Spirit of Christ.<a name=192:13></a> The Lord speaks peace to us, and wherever His Spirit prevails it is the Spirit of peace.<a name=192:14></a> We are told that the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of those that make peace.<a name=192:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will see from what I have said that this book sets forth in some way the conditions in which we find ourselves; the resources that are available for us in Christ; and how intensely active the Lord is, as I have been showing, not officially, but as <i>speaking peace</i>.<a name=192:16></a> It seems to me it is continuous; there is the speaking of peace to all His seed, and that will continue to the end.<a name=192:17></a>

		I hope to be brief in conveying a thought before me.<a name=194:1></a> I wish to show how the Spirit of God views God's people in this book in relation to the inheritance.<a name=194:2></a> You will recall the two numberings of the people.<a name=194:3></a> All the males of twenty years old and upwards; those who were able to go forth to war, were numbered twice.<a name=194:4></a> At first they were numbered as having reached manhood, and as having been placed in relation to the testimony in the wilderness; see chapter 2:1.<a name=194:5></a> In chapter 26, you get the second numbering, when the people are taken account of, not only to support the testimony, but to enter on the inheritance.<a name=194:6></a> The type of the brazen serpent and springing well intervened between these numberings.<a name=194:7></a> That indicates that the people are to be taken account of as possessing the Spirit and being according to purpose.<a name=194:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The distinction between the two numberings is important, but I do not dwell on that.<a name=194:9></a> In the second numbering they are taken account of according to purpose, and not according to responsibility.<a name=194:10></a> The old man having, in type, been crucified, and the Spirit given, they are suitable for the land of promise.<a name=194:11></a> The people as from twenty years old and upwards are viewed in the light of manhood, and the male side being viewed gives the idea of the saints as formed in intelligence, and thus the inheritance is taken up in this way; it is to be entered into intelligently.<a name=194:12></a> "Twenty years old and upward" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#26:2">Numbers  26:2</a>) refers to believers as having the Spirit, that is, as <i>matured</i>.<a name=194:13></a> I do not refer to the <i>work</i> of the Spirit, but God takes account of every believer who possesses the Spirit as having reached manhood; and thus

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As you will be aware, the first mention of the house of God in Scripture is in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>, and there you have indicated a very important feature of it.<a name=216:6></a> The house of God is connected with the earth, and is introduced primarily in connection with Jacob.<a name=216:7></a> There are two features which appear in the introduction of it, which are carried all through; indeed, in every subject introduced in the Scriptures you will find the salient features at the outset.<a name=216:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what appears in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>in connection with the house is divine interest in man upon earth; that is, Jacob was an object of interest to God.<a name=216:9></a> The heavens were opened upon him as he lay a lonely wanderer upon the earth with a stone for his pillow; he was the object of the interest of heaven; and then, his appreciation of the house consisted in God being in it, and hence it was none other to him than the house of God and the gate of heaven.<a name=216:10></a> That is to say, although it was a terrible place to

		him, because of his state, nevertheless he recognised that it was God's dwelling, and that it was in close proximity to heaven; indeed, it was the "gate of heaven", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:17">Genesis  28:17</a>.<a name=217:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Genesis in that way presents to us the house; although not actually formed as a structure, nevertheless it is presented to us abstractly.<a name=217:2></a> God had, as it were, indicated His mind in regard to Jacob, and you will find that when God introduces light, those to whom the light is given have to go through a course of exercise until they are formed according to it.<a name=217:3></a> Jacob came back to Bethel, but the <i>full</i> course of exercise only ended with David.<a name=217:4></a> At Ephratah (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>) David had received light in regard to the house, and he connects the light that he received with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>; he would build the house; he would give no sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he found out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.<a name=217:5></a> The light that David received at Ephratah was connected with the light that came to Jacob as he fled from his brother Esau.<a name=217:6></a> David referred to that.<a name=217:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to dwell for a moment on two features that come out in connection with David and the house.<a name=217:8></a> The first is, that the foundation of the house was connected with sacrifice, and the fact that at that place Jehovah's sword was sheathed.<a name=217:9></a> You will recall that when David numbered the people (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#21">1 Chronicles  21</a>) he brought down the wrath of Jehovah.<a name=217:10></a> But God in grace directed him to rear an altar to Him on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.<a name=217:11></a> There David offered sacrifices, and there Jehovah accepted him; hence David instinctively recognised that that spot was the only proper location for God's house.<a name=217:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you will look at <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#21">1 Chronicles  21</a>and the beginning of chapter 22 you will observe that David decided

		<a name=218>[Page 218]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		that that spot was to be the site of the house.<a name=218:1></a> In other words, the foundation of the house is in the place where sacrifice is accepted.<a name=218:2></a> It is laid in the death of Christ; the judgment of God is there exhausted.<a name=218:3></a> I am not saying that judgment may not be connected with the house, judgment <i>begins</i> there (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#4:17">2 Peter  4:17</a>), but God's house is properly immune from judgment; its foundations are laid upon the spot where the sword of Jehovah was sheathed.<a name=218:4></a> You will notice that, the site being indicated, David prepared with all his might to rear a structure.<a name=218:5></a>

		Now another feature that came out in connection with David is that <i>he</i> was not allowed to build the house.<a name=218:6></a> He had the desire to build it but the house of God is not built by a man of war.<a name=218:7></a> It is built by a <i>Son</i>.<a name=218:8></a> I want you to take notice of that; it is built by a <i>Son</i>.<a name=218:9></a> You will remember that the first child of Bathsheba died under divine judgment.<a name=218:10></a> David would have saved the child; he lay all night upon the earth, in hope that God would have mercy upon him and spare the child, but the child died, and David bowed to the judgment.<a name=218:11></a> He said, "now he is dead".<a name=218:12></a> The child was never to be revived; "I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:23">2 Samuel  12:23</a>.<a name=218:13></a> He says, virtually, 'not only has the child died, but I am going that way also'.<a name=218:14></a> He bowed to divine judgment, and then there is another child; and Jehovah named <i>that</i> child.<a name=218:15></a> Jehovah loved that child, and He sent by the hand of the prophet Nathan and named him Jedidiah, which signifies <i>The beloved of the Lord</i>.<a name=218:16></a> It is the Son, the beloved of God, that builds the house.<a name=218:17></a> We speak of Solomon and his glory, and he is a type of Christ.<a name=218:18></a> He is Christ in relation to the millennial world; but we must not overlook that Solomon was a <i>son</i>.<a name=218:19></a> Solomon was the object of affection, and the house is built by the beloved of the Lord, and <i>what</i> a house!<a name=218:20></a>

		You will remember that Solomon spoke of everything in creation from the cedar-tree to the hyssop.<a name=219:1></a> He was acquainted with nature; he was in that way qualified to head the millennial world.<a name=219:2></a> All the beauties of nature and the secrets of nature that men spend their lifetime and their means to bring to light now will be spoken of definitely by Christ.<a name=219:3></a> He will show what they signify in regard to God.<a name=219:4></a> Solomon spoke of all these things, but he was also <i>the son</i>, and it was as such that he built the house.<a name=219:5></a> Now, beloved friends, that is what the house of God is; these features that I have intimated suggest to us what the house is; and I would specially dwell upon the fact that it is built by the Son.<a name=219:6></a>

		Now that leads me to the Acts of the Apostles, where you have the development of the course of the testimony; and I take it that in the earlier chapters of Acts we have that which refers to the city and its walls.<a name=219:7></a> It seems to me that it awaited the ministry of Paul to bring in the house according to its true character, and my reason for saying that is this, that Paul preached the <i>Son of God</i>.<a name=219:8></a> That is, he brought in Christ, not exactly officially (although you find that also in his preaching) but he preached the Son of God.<a name=219:9></a> He says, "God .<a name=219:10></a>.<a name=219:11></a>.<a name=219:12></a> was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:16">Galatians  1:16</a>.<a name=219:13></a> That is, Paul preached a Person who was in relationship with God as Son, and the effect of his gospel is to bring in <i>sons</i>.<a name=219:14></a> The house is formed in view of relationships which involve affection; a man's house is not an official place; his house is a place of relationship; a man's house is where his affections flow, and in order that you should see God's affections in flow, you must see the Son as man in relationship with Him, and you must see the <i>sons</i> who are brought in as His brethren.<a name=219:15></a>

		Now what I see is, that the house of God, although upon earth, is composed of what is heavenly; not simply of that which has come out of the death of Christ, but also of that which is heavenly.<a name=220:1></a> It is composed, in other words, of those who are the companions of Christ.<a name=220:2></a> As the companions of Christ, we are the companions of a heavenly Man.<a name=220:3></a> You will remember how that the Lord said to Mary Magdalene, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>); thus intimating that there should be no links upon earth; that all links henceforth should be with Him in connection with heaven, or rather as the heavenly One.<a name=220:4></a> He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=220:5></a> He is the ascending One; He is the One who is in all the liberty of the house.<a name=220:6></a> He has the title to ascend, and He does ascend.<a name=220:7></a> None but the Son could speak thus!<a name=220:8></a> He says, "I ascend".<a name=220:9></a> He is the glorious One, beloved friends, of whom we are the companions.<a name=220:10></a> He is the Son, and hence He is in the liberty of the house; and He goes to the highest point.<a name=220:11></a> In John it is not that He is <i>received</i> up, but He <i>goes</i> up; it involves the liberty of sonship: and we are the companions of that glorious One; and it is as the companions of Christ in heavenly glory that we form the house of God upon earth.<a name=220:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in confirmation of what I have been saying, I refer to the assembly at Ephesus, in which assembly Timothy was when this epistle was written to him.<a name=220:13></a> Ephesus is the end, as it were, of the course of ministry that began in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>.<a name=220:14></a> Paul began with announcing that Jesus was the Son of God; he had received heavenly light into his soul; it was a light from heaven that entered into Paul's soul.<a name=220:15></a> That meant that there was a new centre, and that light was now emanating from it; a heavenly centre, not an earthly one.<a name=220:16></a> Jerusalem as a centre was

		abandoned, and everything was now from heaven.<a name=221:1></a> The light that came into his soul from heaven works out in a ministry that places believers -- the sons -- in heaven.<a name=221:2></a> You will never understand the assembly in any of these features unless you see that its position is in heaven.<a name=221:3></a> Hence Ephesus is the end of that course of ministry.<a name=221:4></a> Chapter 20 of the Acts is the great climax of Paul's testimony, and in writing to these christians he tells them that they were not only raised <i>with</i> Christ, but seated in the heavenlies <i>in</i> Christ.<a name=221:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the first half of chapter 2 of his epistle to the Ephesians; the second half shows that these same people are here upon earth as a habitation of God; in other words, a heavenly people upon earth.<a name=221:6></a> In these people you get all the features indicated in the house in the Old Testament; but there is one feature of supreme beauty, and that is, that in that structure Jesus is the chief corner stone.<a name=221:7></a> "Ye .<a name=221:8></a>.<a name=221:9></a>.<a name=221:10></a> are built", says the apostle, "upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:20">Ephesians  2:20</a>.<a name=221:11></a> God placed Him on high, as Peter tells us; the One that the Jews refused is made the Head of the corner; but He has now obtained that place in the affections of the saints.<a name=221:12></a> Christ is supreme in that circle.<a name=221:13></a> He is the Head of that structure -- the chief corner stone.<a name=221:14></a> That is to say, Christ is the Son, and He is honoured as having the supreme place in that circle.<a name=221:15></a> God dwells in it.<a name=221:16></a> God dwells there in <i>affection:</i> he that dwells in love dwells in God and God in him.<a name=221:17></a> The ministry of Paul brought about upon earth a company of people formed in divine affections; that is, formed in the affections known in the Son.<a name=221:18></a> Affections flow from relationships, not relationships from affections.<a name=221:19></a> The relationships are made known in the gospel preached by Paul; he announced the Son, and affections were formed according to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=222>[Page 222]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		light of the relationships, so that there was a circle in which divine affections flowed.<a name=222:1></a> God dwelt there.<a name=222:2></a> God dwelt at Ephesus; He dwelt in that company; there Jesus was the chief corner stone.<a name=222:3></a> It was a wonderful triumph of the gospel.<a name=222:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you may ask me how I know that Ephesus had reached that point.<a name=222:5></a> Well, there are various answers to that question, but the most conclusive to my mind is that Paul was loved at Ephesus.<a name=222:6></a> He was not generally loved at Corinth; the Corinthian saints were not characterised by love for Paul; but at Ephesus Paul was loved.<a name=222:7></a> You remember how he sent from Miletus to Ephesus and called for the elders; and he calls their attention to the character of his ways and of his ministry; these were after Christ.<a name=222:8></a> Paul was a vessel entirely formed after Christ.<a name=222:9></a> I do not believe that we shall rightly understand his position unless we see this, for as so formed he was a test for the saints, and hence you will find that he frequently refers to himself as such.<a name=222:10></a> You will find it in his letters to the Corinthians habitually, and in his appeal to the elders of Ephesus.<a name=222:11></a> Speaking to the Ephesian elders, he concludes with recalling the word of Christ, with which he was in full accord; that "It is more blessed to give than to receive".<a name=222:12></a> He says, "remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:35">Acts  20:35</a>.<a name=222:13></a> There you have the character of Christ, as it were, condensed, and Paul was entirely in accord with it; his ministry and his ways were in complete agreement with that character.<a name=222:14></a> I need only refer you to his letters as a proof of what I am saying; he was christianity livingly expressed.<a name=222:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The elders loved Paul -- they fell upon his neck and wept sore.<a name=222:16></a> Notice it was the <i>elders</i>.<a name=222:17></a> Difficulties invariably arise from the leaders, so that we may conclude that seeing the elders loved Paul the mass of the saints loved him also.<a name=222:18></a> I take it, therefore,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=223>[Page 223]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that the Ephesian saints were formed by Paul's ministry.<a name=223:1></a> There are other evidences; namely, his epistle to these saints; the character of the truth set forth in that epistle shows that the Ephesians were advanced in the truth, that they loved God, and they loved Christ.<a name=223:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, if you have followed what I have said you will have some idea of the circle in which christian conduct is to shine; and I refer to it for a moment so that we might be exercised as to whether we are equal to it.<a name=223:3></a> Paul's word was, "if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>.<a name=223:4></a> We ought to take note of the word <i>delay</i>.<a name=223:5></a> It puts us to the test.<a name=223:6></a> You will remember how Saul was tested by delay; he could not wait for Samuel: and so we are tested by the absence of Christ.<a name=223:7></a> So Paul says, "if I delay, in order that one ought to know how to behave oneself".<a name=223:8></a> It is not simply that <i>Timothy</i> should know, but that we all should know how one ought to behave oneself in the house of God.<a name=223:9></a> What a dignified position to be introduced into!<a name=223:10></a> The passage was written with a view to acquainting christians as to conduct that is suitable in the house of God.<a name=223:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot enlarge upon it, and I did not intend to; my thought was to show, as I said, the character of the house, and if the character of the house is rightly understood you have the divine standard.<a name=223:12></a> The divine standard of everything is Christ -- the Son.<a name=223:13></a> He is the model.<a name=223:14></a> It is as One in the affections of the Father; One who could lift up His eyes to the Father and speak to Him as Son.<a name=223:15></a> It is the Son in the presence of the Father that is the model.<a name=223:16></a> See <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a> - 30.<a name=223:17></a> He is the standard, and it is beautiful to see how Paul was in accord with that standard; he was formed after Christ.<a name=223:18></a>

		attention to is this; that Timothy was formed after Paul; Timothy was begotten by Paul's testimony.<a name=224:1></a> You will never understand Timothy's position in the Scriptures if you do not see that he was Paul's son in the faith.<a name=224:2></a> The Corinthians were naughty; they were like naughty children in a house; they knew not how to behave themselves in the absence of authority.<a name=224:3></a> Now Paul says, I am not coming to you, but I am sending my son Timothy to you; he is like me; he is my son, and he will put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:17">1 Corinthians  4:17</a>.<a name=224:4></a> Only a son could do that.<a name=224:5></a> One might learn the apostle's doctrine and expatiate upon it, but who can put you in mind of Paul's ways as they were in Christ?<a name=224:6></a> Paul would suggest Christ to you; he was formed after Christ, and Timothy was formed after Paul; he was Paul's son, and hence he could suggest Paul to the Corinthians.<a name=224:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What we require, beloved friends, is that our ways should suggest Christ: that is the test before men; it is a question of how we are formed by the truth; it is not what we <i>say</i>, as we have often heard, it is what we <i>suggest;</i> it is what we put people in mind of; if we are like Christ, we remind people of Him.<a name=224:8></a> I have referred more than once lately to Gideon's interview with the Midianitish kings after having vanquished them.<a name=224:9></a> He said, "What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor?<a name=224:10></a>", <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#8:18">Judges  8:18</a>.<a name=224:11></a> Their reply was, "As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king"; and Gideon answers, "They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother", <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#8:19">Judges  8:19</a>.<a name=224:12></a> That is, they had taken character from their mother, as Gideon had.<a name=224:13></a> Now we christians have all one mother, and that is "Jerusalem above"; it is <i>that</i> which gives character to us.<a name=224:14></a> Jerusalem above is really formed in the light of sonship; it has reference to liberty; "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:26">Galatians  4:26</a>.<a name=224:15></a> God's house is

		Well, now, all that is to be in the house of God.<a name=225:6></a> And then it is "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth".<a name=225:7></a> That I take to be a kind of check, or safeguard, for in evangelical desire we might go beyond the truth.<a name=225:8></a> Many are evangelical at the expense of the truth.<a name=225:9></a> The nearer we are to God the more divinely evangelical we shall become; but being in the light of the assembly as the pillar and base of the truth becomes a safeguard, for you cannot do violence to the truth if you recognise that the assembly is the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=225:10></a>

		I desire to say a word in regard to the work of God as having reference to us inwardly and outwardly, and in this connection to seek to point out the distinction between the bearing of the first and second epistles to the Corinthians.<a name=226:1></a> The second epistle is restorative; it is a question of restoration, and hence <i>the Son</i> is brought in.<a name=226:2></a> The faithfulness of God is established in the <i>Son</i>, and the new covenant is introduced; whereas in the first epistle the point is the <i>authority of Christ</i>.<a name=226:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is helpful to compare these two epistles with the first giving of the law by the hand of Moses and the second giving of the law.<a name=226:4></a> In connection with the first giving of the law, Moses was absent from the camp.<a name=226:5></a> He had received certain communications; he had received the law from the hand of God, as is recorded in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>to 23 inclusive, and he "wrote all the words" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24:4">Exodus  24:4</a>) and left them with the people when he went up to the mount to God; he left with the people the divine commandments; and Aaron and Hur also remained with them.<a name=226:6></a> So we see there the people of God left, as it were, to themselves, to be regulated by God's commandments, and that became the test.<a name=226:7></a> The withdrawal of Moses from the camp put the people to the test.<a name=226:8></a> His absence became a test to them, and they said: "as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what has become of him", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:1">Exodus  32:1</a>.<a name=226:9></a> They professed not to be able to tell what had become of the mediator, and hence they would have another leader and another god, and thus the most serious situation conceivable resulted.<a name=226:10></a>

		The affections of God's people today have been diverted from Christ by the doctrines of Balaam, and the issue is tremendous.<a name=229:4></a> It is appalling to think of the consequences of the issue that has arisen between Christ and Christendom.<a name=229:5></a> Paul asks, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?<a name=229:6></a> are we stronger than he?<a name=229:7></a>", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:22">1 Corinthians  10:22</a>.<a name=229:8></a> The result will show that Christ is stronger.<a name=229:9></a> Well now, Paul remained away so that the Corinthians might escape, and thank God they <i>did</i> escape, and we may thank God that <i>we</i> have escaped.<a name=229:10></a> The only escape now from the result of the burning jealousy of the Lord is separation.<a name=229:11></a> We take sides with Him against idolatry and the spirit of Anti-christ, and as we take up that position we attest our love for Christ, and that results in our getting divine disclosures; that is to say, those who show their love for Christ, their loyalty of heart to Him, get into the light and good of what He is as Head.<a name=229:12></a>

		Now in the second epistle you have what corresponds in a sense to the second giving of the law.<a name=229:13></a> Although the same law was given, it was given under different circumstances.<a name=229:14></a> It was a law given by Jehovah as One who was sovereign in mercy; so that in a certain sense it was a new law, and in that respect there is in it an allusion to the new covenant.<a name=229:15></a> It was not the new covenant, but there was a partial foreshadowing of the new covenant in it.<a name=229:16></a> There was a shining in the face of Moses in connection with the second giving of the law; that is, there was some outshining of Christ in it.<a name=229:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then you get the writing of God.<a name=231:9></a> The writing of God is a most interesting consideration.<a name=231:10></a> There was writing on the tables of stone; that was the writing of God; and there was the writing upon the ground by the Lord Jesus in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>; that was the writing of God; and there is the writing upon the heart of man.<a name=231:11></a> The stone was simply the heart of the unregenerate man; it was the heart of adamant, wholly unsympathetic with the writing.<a name=231:12></a> There is no sympathy whatsoever in a stone; you may engrave something upon it, but it is utterly without sympathy.<a name=231:13></a> The Lord Jesus Christ wrote upon the ground.<a name=231:14></a> He wrote twice; the first writing excluded the Jew, put him out completely.<a name=231:15></a> We read, "they .<a name=231:16></a>.<a name=231:17></a>.<a name=231:18></a> went out", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:9">John  8:9</a>.<a name=231:19></a> The second writing retained the sinful woman and preserved her from judgment.<a name=231:20></a> The second writing signified the death of Christ.<a name=231:21></a> He wrote upon the ground.<a name=231:22></a> When He rose up the second time there was no one present but the sinful woman, and He says to her, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:11">John  8:11</a>.<a name=231:23></a> The writing on the ground secured her from judgment; that is to say, it indicated the preservation of man apart from sin through the death of Christ, and I have no doubt that that is the result of God's covenant.<a name=231:24></a>

		shining in the face of Christ brings in a new order of man here.<a name=232:1></a> The apostle speaks of the Lord as the spirit of the covenant, and His face shines.<a name=232:2></a> We all, looking at the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image.<a name=232:3></a> We are all made alike by beholding the glory.<a name=232:4></a> There is a generation here upon earth produced by the shining of the face of Christ.<a name=232:5></a> So that you have a wonderful generation.<a name=232:6></a> They are all alike in one sense, and yet in another sense there is infinite variety.<a name=232:7></a> According to chapter 15 of the previous epistle, "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.<a name=232:8></a> So also is the resurrection of the dead", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:41">1 Corinthians  15:41</a>.<a name=232:9></a> The difference is simply a difference of glory.<a name=232:10></a> It is a marvellous thought, beloved friends.<a name=232:11></a> It is the world that God has in His mind, a world out of death, each one in it having a body divinely given, but it is a body according to God's pleasure.<a name=232:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it seems to me you have recovery set forth in all that.<a name=232:13></a> The effect of glory is to produce agreement; we are changed into the same image.<a name=232:14></a> The word <i>same</i> in Corinthians has reference, largely, to something in common.<a name=232:15></a> There is the idea of the same Spirit; we all partake of the same loaf; we all drink of the same cup.<a name=232:16></a> It is useless to talk of recovery, beloved friends, unless there is unity, and unity is in affection.<a name=232:17></a> The shining of the glory is really the display of God's nature, and it produces similarity in His people down here.<a name=232:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, what I see in chapter 4 is the character of the minister.<a name=232:19></a> Paul was a minister, and he was in entire accord with his ministry, so that we may take him to represent the <i>inner</i> work of the Spirit.<a name=232:20></a> He says, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our <i>hearts</i>", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>.<a name=232:21></a> That is inward.<a name=232:22></a> It had shone into Paul's heart for the

		shining forth.<a name=233:1></a> I take it that he in that way represents the effect of the inward shining.<a name=233:2></a> This produced similarity to Christ outwardly.<a name=233:3></a> The allusion really is to Gideon.<a name=233:4></a> The testimony that came out in Gideon was that he was a leader, and that his followers were all to act as <i>he acted</i>.<a name=233:5></a> He said: "Look on me, and do likewise", <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#7:17">Judges  7:17</a>.<a name=233:6></a> Now what has Christ done?<a name=233:7></a> He is our great Leader.<a name=233:8></a> What has He done?<a name=233:9></a> He has died.<a name=233:10></a> And what will the Spirit of Christ do in the believer?<a name=233:11></a> He will work out in him the same kind of character.<a name=233:12></a> The character of Christ is reflected in Paul.<a name=233:13></a> Christ was his Leader, and he followed Him closely.<a name=233:14></a> It was a question of the shining forth of what was of God.<a name=233:15></a> The Lord Jesus Christ went into death that there should be the shining forth of the love of God.<a name=233:16></a> He wanted to make that known, and hence He died.<a name=233:17></a> Well, Paul was on the same line, so that the vessel, the "pitcher", as it were, was broken.<a name=233:18></a> He says, "we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:7">2 Corinthians  4:7</a>.<a name=233:19></a> To Paul it was altogether a question of following Jesus.<a name=233:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 4:13 he touches the point of faith.<a name=233:21></a> He says, "having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak".<a name=233:22></a> From that point he is led on to the full fruition of God's work.<a name=233:23></a> There was the <i>inner</i> and the <i>outer</i>, the former having reference to the great future; the great eternal future.<a name=233:24></a> Paul compares his body to a tabernacle, as contrasted with that which he shall have eternally.<a name=233:25></a> What we are at the present moment by the work of God internally is far in excess of what we are externally.<a name=233:26></a> The first verse of chapter 5 shows that he regarded his body as a tent -- a tabernacle.<a name=233:27></a> The allusion is to the tent in the wilderness.<a name=233:28></a> There was nothing imposing about the tabernacle in the wilderness; it was no

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the buildings of Solomon present an entirely different view; the point in the temple was magnificence and glory, and it was <i>abiding</i> -- a <i>building</i>.<a name=234:3></a> And so our present bodies are simply tents, temporary abodes for God's testimony; that is their only value.<a name=234:4></a> The Lord takes care of our bodies; but the death of a christian always reminds me of the taking down of a tabernacle, which has finished its career on earth; it has served its purpose for God's testimony.<a name=234:5></a> But the <i>man</i> is to reside in a <i>building;</i> the man that had been in the tabernacle is to reside in a building; and hence the apostle says, "if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens".<a name=234:6></a> We have all seen the dissolution of the tabernacle; <i>God</i> takes it down.<a name=234:7></a> The death of a christian is never an accident: it is God terminating that aspect of His testimony, but we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<a name=234:8></a>

		Now I wish to dwell on that for a moment, and I will close.<a name=234:9></a> You will recall, perhaps, in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#25">Leviticus  25</a>, that if a man sold a house in a walled city and failed to redeem it within a year, it remained with the purchaser for ever; but if he bought a field, the field returned to its owner in the year of jubilee, regardless entirely of whether the original owner redeemed it or not.<a name=234:10></a> I take that as a type.<a name=234:11></a> The earth belongs to Israel, and to Israel it returns.<a name=234:12></a> The gentile possesses it for the moment; he lays claim to it; but he has to surrender it.<a name=234:13></a> The year of jubilee is coming in which all will return to the original owner, but the Jew failed to redeem his place in the walled city.<a name=234:14></a> Israel failed to redeem it when God, in His patience, waited upon them, and

		J T.<a name=302:1></a> I think it is helpful to connect the first epistle to the Corinthians with the position of Moses when he went up the mount to receive the instructions in regard to the tabernacle.<a name=302:2></a> The first epistle has relation, I think, to that section of Scripture.<a name=302:3></a> The apostle could not come to the Corinthians on account of their condition, which answers, in a way, to Moses being unable to come into the camp with the tables of the covenant; he could not come into the camp on account of the conditions which existed there.<a name=302:4></a> The second epistle corresponds with the renewal of the law; things were now on an entirely new basis, hence you have the shining of Moses' face.<a name=302:5></a> I think the first epistle shows how the absence of Christ tests the saints.<a name=302:6></a> The first epistle corresponds to the first giving of the law; Moses, having gone up to the mount, could not bring into the camp the wonderful light he had received.<a name=302:7></a> He could not introduce it on account of the evil there, and, correspondingly, Paul could not come to Corinth because of the condition there.<a name=302:8></a>
	</div>

		In the second epistle you have things on an entirely different basis; that is, on the basis of the new covenant, and hence it corresponds with the second giving of the law; and connected with that you get the shining of Moses' face.<a name=302:9></a> God was there coming out on the ground of sovereignty, of sovereign mercy.<a name=302:10></a> The first epistle shows that the absence of Christ tested the hearts of the saints, as the absence of Moses had tested Israel.<a name=302:11></a> They said, "as for this Moses -- we wot not what is become of him" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:1">Exodus  32:1</a>)

		I desire to say a word in regard of headship, and to seek to show how Christ is reflected here in her to whom He stands in the relationship of Head.<a name=314:1></a> The idea of headship is not limited, as most of us know, to the church; it has a wider bearing.<a name=314:2></a> A man may be head of his business, head of his family, and head of his wife; each connection suggests a different idea, and it is evident the last is the most intimate.<a name=314:3></a> I venture to read from the book of Proverbs because I think it suggests that which underlies the relationship that has been formed between Christ and the assembly; that is, family affection.<a name=314:4></a> The book of Proverbs, as many of us have observed, is set in connection with the family; and it was a primary thought with God that He should surround Himself with an order of beings who should stand in relationship with Him as a family.<a name=314:5></a> That order of being is man.<a name=314:6></a> That is, Wisdom, personifying itself in the early part of the book, intimates that the order of being it had set its mind upon was man.<a name=314:7></a> So intensely engaged was Wisdom with that order of being that it rejoiced in the sphere in which man should be placed, "in the habitable part of his earth", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:31">Proverbs  8:31</a>.<a name=314:8></a> And then we find, when it comes to the order of being itself, that it is intimated that it would delight in the character of sons; "my delights were with the <i>sons</i> of men", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:31">Proverbs  8:31</a>.<a name=314:9></a>

		Now I think that gives an idea of the point of view which is taken in the book of Proverbs, and it is remarkable that the writer of the book specially speaks of himself as in that peculiar relationship.<a name=314:10></a> He was in the relationship of a son, he tells us, to a father, "tender and only beloved in the sight of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if you consider the Lord in regard to sonship, it is perfectly clear that it was in the mind of God to have a company of sons.<a name=315:5></a> And in that company He would find continuous sympathy.<a name=315:6></a> Hence we are told that when the foundations of the earth were laid the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy, <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38">Job  38</a>.<a name=315:7></a> We thus have the clear intimation that God intended to have a company near Him, observant of all that He was doing, and being all that they should be in the relation of sons.<a name=315:8></a> You will find that the idea of sons is carried all through the Old Testament.<a name=315:9></a> I cannot dwell upon it, but it is alluded to, for instance, in the book of Job.<a name=315:10></a> In the early operations of God the <i>sons</i> were sympathetic with Him, and upon the earth they present themselves before Him, and they have God before them.<a name=315:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the Lord stands in relation to the sons, but you will find that the Spirit of God in the Old Testament carefully guards His personal distinctness.<a name=315:12></a> In Genesis we find an allusion to it in Isaac's relationship with Abraham.<a name=315:13></a> God says to Abraham, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:2">Genesis  22:2</a>.<a name=315:14></a> That is a type of Christ in the unique place in which He stands in relationship with God as an "only one".<a name=315:15></a> It is in that character that He comes out from God and unfolds to us what is in

		the heart of God; that is, that He will have a company like Himself.<a name=316:1></a> And so the book of Proverbs anticipates Christ, for it is only in Christ that you find in a spiritual way the relationships which are contemplated in the setting of the book.<a name=316:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the closing chapters you have two prophecies.<a name=316:3></a> Chapter 30 is a distinct prophecy by itself and chapter 31 is another.<a name=316:4></a> After the light unfolded by Wisdom has taken effect, the spirit of the prophet looks on to a set of conditions that should prevail.<a name=316:5></a> If you look at chapter 30 you will find, as has often been noticed, six sets of four things each, and these conditions arise consequent upon the unfolding of Wisdom.<a name=316:6></a> I need not say that the unfolding of Wisdom was in the ministry of Christ.<a name=316:7></a> The ministry of Christ involved the preaching of Wisdom, the teaching of Wisdom, and, furthermore, a full unfolding of the history of Wisdom itself.<a name=316:8></a> The ministry of Christ brought into evidence the children of Wisdom.<a name=316:9></a> According to the point of view presented by the gospel of Luke, "Wisdom is justified of all her children", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:35">Luke  7:35</a>.<a name=316:10></a> What you find is that the children of Wisdom are set up here in the midst of those adverse conditions, and that without any alteration of the conditions they fully justify Wisdom.<a name=316:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 30 we find these different acts of four each.<a name=316:12></a> I only refer to it as pointing out the conditions in which the children of Wisdom are placed in this world.<a name=316:13></a> The prophet speaks of four evil things, four insatiable things, four inscrutable things, four odious things, four weak but wise things, and lastly, four stately things.<a name=316:14></a> I take it that the things that are weak, but wise, refer to christianity.<a name=316:15></a> So that chapter 30 announces prophetically the conditions in which we are placed here as illuminated by the ministry of Wisdom.<a name=316:16></a> The conditions in which we are found are left as they were, but Wisdom is justified in all her children.<a name=316:17></a> Although the early

		Now chapter 31 is, I think, a prophetic view of the assembly seen in relationship with Christ; and it is of that I wish to speak.<a name=317:2></a> I read the passage in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>to show how the relationship is formed.<a name=317:3></a> Nothing can be greater for our souls to apprehend than the wonderful place that we have as viewed in the light of Christ's resurrection, for it is in that light that we are suited to be united to Him.<a name=317:4></a> To make my thought clear, I would seek to point out that what we are here as individuals in this world is <i>one</i> thought, and what we are in relation to God's purpose as united to Christ is another point entirely.<a name=317:5></a> In regard to the first, we may look upon christians here in this world as God's family.<a name=317:6></a> Nothing can be more precious to the soul of the christian down here than the consciousness that he is a member of God's family.<a name=317:7></a>

		I take the family of Bethany; that is, Mary, Martha and Lazarus, as representing in type the family of God.<a name=317:8></a> What you will observe in that family, beloved friends, is that they were, as presented to us in Scripture, parentless.<a name=317:9></a> Nothing is said about their parents, and this aptly describes our own actual condition here.<a name=317:10></a> The Lord severs His connection with His natural relations in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>.<a name=317:11></a> He says to His mother, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=317:12></a>", <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:4">John  2:4</a>.<a name=317:13></a> He was engaged in His divine ministry with that which was spiritual, not with that which is natural; He was there in regard to a spiritual order of things, forming links between souls and God in a spiritual way.<a name=317:14></a> "God is a Spirit" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:24">John  4:24</a>) and if souls are to be set in relationship with God it must be in a spiritual way.<a name=317:15></a> Hence His mother had no title to make suggestions to Christ in regard of what He was doing spiritually.<a name=317:16></a> He would introduce the new wine, but He would

		introduce it of Himself, and He <i>did</i>.<a name=318:1></a> But whilst He refuses the natural relatives, John, in the development of his gospel, brings to light another family, which the Lord takes up, and we are told that He loved them all.<a name=318:2></a> He "loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:5">John  11:5</a>.<a name=318:3></a> The Spirit of God is careful to emphasise that He loved each and all.<a name=318:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, what I wish to point out is, that as God's family here in an adverse world the Lord knows our name; He knows every member of the family by name.<a name=318:5></a> If one of His family goes into death, as is possible, Christ will abolish death because it has touched that family.<a name=318:6></a> It was in the presence of death, as having broken in upon the family at Bethany, in the person of Lazarus, that He was moved in His spirit.<a name=318:7></a> He was deeply moved in His spirit; a member of that family had gone into death, and the heart of Jesus was moved because of the presence of death as holding a member of that family which He loved.<a name=318:8></a> So if death touches us, and it <i>does</i> touch us, what do we find?<a name=318:9></a> You find that the Lord knows your name even there.<a name=318:10></a> Be the circumstances ever so dark, be Satan's power ever so great, the Lord knows your name, <i>just there</i>, and He calls you by name.<a name=318:11></a> He says, "Lazarus, come forth!<a name=318:12></a>", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:43">John  11:43</a>.<a name=318:13></a> Now, that is the Lord's attitude to God's family.<a name=318:14></a> He takes you up as He finds you.<a name=318:15></a> He takes you up according to your identity as born into this world.<a name=318:16></a> You are known in this world as born into it, and the Lord takes you up <i>just there</i>, so that in all His dealings with you He makes you to know His divine interest in you.<a name=318:17></a> He calls you by name.<a name=318:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show you also that each has another name.<a name=318:19></a> The names that prevail in this world under the government of God do not prevail in the spiritual world, which world must be ordered by Christ.<a name=318:20></a> He has come out of heaven, a new order

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence you find in John's gospel that the Lord gives a name to Simon.<a name=319:5></a> It is not a question of what he is; it is a question of the Lord having authority to give him a name, and He does so; he is to be called Cephas (Peter), because it is Christ's will that he <i>should</i> be called Peter.<a name=319:6></a> If there is anything that we should maintain clearly in our souls, it is the sovereignty of divine Persons.<a name=319:7></a> You should never think of divine Persons acting automatically.<a name=319:8></a> They act sovereignly, and hence we see in John's gospel that if the Lord gives a name, He gives it sovereignly; He has title to give it.<a name=319:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I want to show you how it is that the name the Lord gives in the spiritual world, whilst it is given sovereignly and unalterably, expresses what the thing is.<a name=319:10></a> We see this in the case of Adam; whatever name he gave a creature, that was its name.<a name=319:11></a> That is a point, the name; that has to be considered.<a name=319:12></a> As I have said, He took account of Mary, and Martha, and Lazarus, <i>as they were</i>, and He called them by name; but when you come to the spiritual side, what comes to light is that He gives them a name with divine intelligence.<a name=319:13></a> That leads me to the passage I read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>.<a name=319:14></a> The Spirit tells us, that among all the lower creatures there was not a helpmeet found for Adam.<a name=319:15></a> In all the host of God's creatures there was no helpmeet, no one suited for Adam.<a name=319:16></a> Yet there Adam was, head of the creation, acting with the intelligence suited to it;

	<div class="paragraph">
		as each creature was brought to him his intelligence shone in the name he imparted to it, but then the Spirit tells us that he was without a helpmeet.<a name=320:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, what I wish you to dwell upon is the antitype, not the type; but after the deep sleep of Adam is past, and the woman is <i>builded</i>, God brings her to him, and he is put to the test.<a name=320:2></a> Eve is brought to him; she is a most wonderful creature, and in no instance does Adam's intelligence shine so brightly as in the name he gives her and in his explanation of the name.<a name=320:3></a> He says to Jehovah; "<i>This</i> time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh".<a name=320:4></a> That is, referring to each creature as it had been brought to him, he says to Jehovah: "<i>This</i> time" all is changed; This "is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called <i>Woman</i>, because she was taken out of Man".<a name=320:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus viewed in the light of Christ's death and resurrection, we receive a new name.<a name=320:6></a> I am not now speaking of what we may receive individually, but of what the assembly is as the counterpart of Christ.<a name=320:7></a> He deliberately considers her.<a name=320:8></a> When Mary Magdalene came to the Lord in resurrection, she would have renewed the old associations; she would have renewed, as it were, the connection with Bethany.<a name=320:9></a> I do not say <i>she</i> was of Bethany, but she represented the family that had affection for Christ whilst He was here upon earth.<a name=320:10></a> The Lord says to her, "Touch me not", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=320:11></a> The earthly associations must give place to the heavenly.<a name=320:12></a> "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to <i>my brethren</i>", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=320:13></a> <i>There</i> is the name -- "my brethren".<a name=320:14></a> That is the name that the Lord gives us.<a name=320:15></a> It expresses what we are to Him in virtue of His resurrection -- the brethren of Christ.<a name=320:16></a> Now what <i>are</i> the brethren of Christ?<a name=320:17></a> What marks them?<a name=320:18></a> The <i>sons</i> of God are marked by dignity and liberty.<a name=320:19></a> What marks the <i>brethren</i> of Christ?<a name=320:20></a> What was Christ down here?<a name=320:21></a>

		He was a new order of Man; a heavenly Man amongst men, and what marked Him was the tenderest solicitude and care for the welfare of His own.<a name=321:1></a> This shone out in chapter 13.<a name=321:2></a> It shone at the Supper.<a name=321:3></a> That was the spirit of Christ, and it was by that spirit fully set forth in His death, that the love of God was expressed.<a name=321:4></a> It is in the light of that that the brethren of Christ are formed.<a name=321:5></a> The thought of brethren is that of mutual affection.<a name=321:6></a> We stand in relation to Christ, and in relation to one another, beloved friends, in mutual affection, and the Lord views us as being wholly derived from Himself.<a name=321:7></a> We have our origin in Christ with no history prior to that.<a name=321:8></a> In this connection we stand related to Him, but not in earthly associations.<a name=321:9></a> Mount Olivet is in type the scene of heavenly associations.<a name=321:10></a> Hence when all was over, after the Supper, they sang a hymn and went to the mount of Olives.<a name=321:11></a> He had been accustomed to go there before; in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>we are told that He went there; the disciples went to their own homes; "Jesus went to the mount of Olives", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:1">John  8:1</a>.<a name=321:12></a> It was His own retreat, and now He leads His disciples there.<a name=321:13></a> As His brethren in resurrection we have heavenly links and associations.<a name=321:14></a> Our origin is from Him, and He gives us a name that describes what we are.<a name=321:15></a> "<i>This</i> time", says Adam, "it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man".<a name=321:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it is to that company that Christ is Head, and His headship is known in a spiritual way.<a name=321:17></a> I refer to that just for a moment, because upon it depends what is intimated here in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>, in the "woman of worth", the "virtuous woman".<a name=321:18></a> If the assembly is not set up in heavenly relationship with Christ she cannot fully set Him forth here.<a name=321:19></a> Her testimony is peculiar to herself, and it depends on her knowledge of Him as her Head, as having

	<div class="paragraph">
		given to her a name.<a name=322:1></a> I would ask you, Have you any idea of having received a name from Christ?<a name=322:2></a> It is well that He knows us by name <i>here</i>, where, under the government of God, we all have names, but it is an entirely different thought to be conscious of having a name from Christ in a spiritual way, to be conscious that the name He has given you is a name that involves your qualification to be united to Him.<a name=322:3></a> Adam says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man".<a name=322:4></a> That, I believe, sets forth the Lord Jesus, giving a name to His assembly, and the form the testimony has taken during the interval of His absence is of a feminine character.<a name=322:5></a> The testimony has taken form in the Woman; the Man is out of sight.<a name=322:6></a> He is in heaven, and if the Man is not in evidence here, what does that bring to light?<a name=322:7></a> It brings to light the character of the Woman.<a name=322:8></a> The absence of Christ has become the occasion of the testing of the character of the assembly.<a name=322:9></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#7">Proverbs  7</a>the wicked woman's husband is away; she says, "the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: he hath taken a bag of money with him", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#7:19">Proverbs  7:19</a>,20.<a name=322:10></a> She has no regard as to how long he is going to stay away, and she is utterly unfaithful to him.<a name=322:11></a> She represents that which <i>had</i> a place in relation to Christ, but has proved to be utterly unfaithful to Him and a corruptress of the world.<a name=322:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is found in the "woman of worth" is that she thinks of her husband, and what is more precious still, he has full confidence in her.<a name=322:13></a> "The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her".<a name=322:14></a> Now, if you consider the assembly's position here in regard of Christ in this light, it opens up a wonderful field for instruction.<a name=322:15></a> As I have been saying, chapter 30 gives us a prophetic outline of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=323>[Page 323]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the question arises as to where we are while Christ is absent, where we are in regard of our hearts, our labours, our testimony and our walk.<a name=323:3></a> What is it that controls us?<a name=323:4></a> Well, I can conceive of nothing that maintains christian testimony at its proper standard, but the light in our souls of our heavenly association with Christ.<a name=323:5></a> We are called to that.<a name=323:6></a> We have the first place with Christ.<a name=323:7></a> We are that family that has the first place in His affections, and, as thus privileged, we have the honour of maintaining for Him whilst He is away.<a name=323:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the type set forth here, the first thing noted is that this "woman of worth" is very rare, and then that her husband safely trusts in her.<a name=323:9></a> I think it ought to appeal to us in a direct way as to whether the Lord can commit anything to us.<a name=323:10></a> Now it seems to me the Lord <i>has</i> graciously committed something to us, and when I say 'us' I mean the assembly.<a name=323:11></a> I would never use the collective expression in regard of christians in any other light than that of the whole assembly.<a name=323:12></a> The Lord committed a great deal to the apostles.<a name=323:13></a> Nothing can exceed the beauty of the early chapters of the Acts.<a name=323:14></a> There was a company gazing up as Christ went into heaven; they loved Him, and when the cloud received Him out of their sight they were marked by respect for the authority of the Scriptures.<a name=323:15></a> For the moment the Scriptures were the sole authority recognised by the apostles.<a name=323:16></a> And besides this, they were united in affection and they were all together in one place; they were all of one accord, for they loved Him and loved one another; and it is to that company that the Lord

		Jesus commits His interests.<a name=324:1></a> How much He committed to them!<a name=324:2></a> All the vast interests that belong to Christ were committed to that company.<a name=324:3></a> Think of the weight of responsibility laid upon them, but, beloved brethren, <i>they were true to it</i>.<a name=324:4></a> The Spirit of God shows us that at least for a moment there was a complete answer to the trust and confidence of Christ; they maintained in affection what He had committed to them.<a name=324:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that the Lord has committed something to us.<a name=324:6></a> I have no doubt that in speaking to Sardis the Lord alluded to the great light of the Reformation.<a name=324:7></a> Great light had been vouchsafed, and they were to remember what they had received and heard.<a name=324:8></a> But when He comes to Philadelphia He can address the church and say, "thou hast kept the word of my patience", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>.<a name=324:9></a> There was the answer to His confidence; it was not misplaced.<a name=324:10></a> The Lord had committed something to her and His confidence was not betrayed.<a name=324:11></a> His commendation is this: "thou .<a name=324:12></a>.<a name=324:13></a>.<a name=324:14></a> hast kept my word and hast not denied my name", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a>.<a name=324:15></a> <i>There</i> is the "virtuous woman", the "woman of worth".<a name=324:16></a> After Ephesus there is no real answer to Christ in the assembly until you come to Philadelphia, and <i>there</i> there is complete evidence of an answer to the confidence of Christ as to that which He had committed to her.<a name=324:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Surely it is a matter of great concern what we are going to do with what the Lord has committed to us.<a name=324:18></a> What are we going to do with it?<a name=324:19></a> I am not assuming to lay a burden upon any one.<a name=324:20></a> It is a question of what we are going to do with what the Lord has committed to us.<a name=324:21></a> I doubt not that the traits of the "virtuous woman" will continue to the end, notwithstanding the ruin.<a name=324:22></a> She goes on, and what marks here is that she is true to what has been committed to her, and she makes the most of it.<a name=324:23></a> She is active to promote the interests of her

		I cannot dwell upon the detail only to point out one other thing, and that is, in result, that He who has been, as it were, out of sight is <i>known</i>.<a name=325:6></a> The headship of Christ is a practical thing.<a name=325:7></a> Now the woman is in evidence, and the great result is that when the time comes for Him to sit "among the elders of the land" to take a public place, He is well known.<a name=325:8></a> He is known through His wife.<a name=325:9></a> "Her husband is known in the gates".<a name=325:10></a> In the future Christ will be identified by that which is of Himself which the assembly sets forth.<a name=325:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What that means for us is, that the spiritual order of things which is to prevail in the assembly <i>publicly</i> is already established there <i>now</i>.<a name=325:12></a> Every feature of the order of things that God has in His mind is to find its answer in the assembly, so that "the world to come, whereof we speak" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:5">Hebrews  2:5</a>) is already <i>witnessed to</i>.<a name=325:13></a> It is known in testimony <i>now</i> through the "virtuous woman".<a name=325:14></a> Hence the great importance of <i>virtue</i>.<a name=325:15></a> What I understand by virtue is ability to refuse what is evil and to maintain what is good.<a name=325:16></a> If you have those two things you have what Christ has confidence in; and hence you have testimony.<a name=325:17></a> So that when the Lord arrives He has not to announce Himself again, He is known in the assembly; "Her husband is known in the gates".<a name=325:18></a>

		Now, I should like, the Lord helping me, to make clear to you, before proceeding, what is immediately before me, that is, to show the great difference there is between God's primary thoughts and His government.<a name=328:2></a> To suggest to you further what I mean, I would point out that we find God introducing the idea of a city and the idea of a kingdom.<a name=328:3></a> Now, God was not the first to introduce these things.<a name=328:4></a> The first city mentioned in Scripture is that builded by Cain, and the first kingdom we have in Scripture is that which was established by Nimrod.<a name=328:5></a> God did not introduce these thoughts; they were introduced by man, and their introduction greatly enhanced man's position here in opposition to God.<a name=328:6></a> Any one can see in Cain's city that, as builded, it greatly enhanced his position.<a name=328:7></a> He was a vagabond upon the earth, with the mark of a murderer upon his brow; he goes out from the presence of the Lord and establishes himself on the earth in independence of God, and <i>built a city</i>.<a name=328:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, that thought has never been given up by the world, but God took account of it.<a name=328:9></a> He took note of the advantage that the enemy had acquired by the establishment of a city upon earth.<a name=328:10></a> We find that after the flood the thought reappeared, for directly men got together their thought was to build a city and a tower.<a name=328:11></a> I allude to these thoughts to show you how the world system was established, and then consequent upon that Nimrod established his kingdom; he was "a mighty hunter" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#10:9">Genesis  10:9</a>) before the Lord.<a name=328:12></a> His fame was widespread; he was a mighty one upon the earth; he was a hero, and he established a kingdom.<a name=328:13></a> Now, bear in mind these two thoughts, you have a city, a political centre,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a centre of influence upon earth; and then you have a kingdom, fixed rule established in connection with the city.<a name=329:1></a> Now I repeat that these two thoughts were not introduced by God; they were introduced by man.<a name=329:2></a> The question therefore arose as to how God was going to meet that?<a name=329:3></a> We must remember that God had always a witness here; He had always a people in this world who were in possession of light, and these would feel the character of the advantage that the presence of a city and a kingdom gave to the world.<a name=329:4></a> Therefore the question arose as to how God would meet that state of things, and I repeat that He met it, not by the introduction of a <i>primary</i> thought, but by the introduction of a <i>like</i> thought.<a name=329:5></a> His people were in the world-system, and He designed to call them out of it; He would deliver them out of it, and to that end <i>He</i> established a city and a kingdom of His own.<a name=329:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there can be no greater thought for us in connection with the presence of sin and lawlessness in the world than the setting forth of God's city and God's kingdom.<a name=329:7></a> I need not enlarge upon them, they have often been enlarged upon, I only refer to them as showing the greatness of God's ways in meeting the state of things occasioned by sin, and that the establishment of these two things is for the deliverance of God's people from the world.<a name=329:8></a> We see that both the city and the kingdom have a present existence, and their object is the deliverance of God's people out of the world-system; God has provided a city for us, He has provided a centre for us, and He has established rule for us in the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=329:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two thoughts are clearly brought to light in the gospels.<a name=329:10></a> I would refer to the gospel of Matthew for a moment.<a name=329:11></a> Matthew's great point in regard to the kingdom is, that it was a <i>heavenly</i> kingdom -- heavenly rule.<a name=329:12></a> Now, there may be a question as to

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=330>[Page 330]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what is the point in that?<a name=330:1></a> I believe the idea in Matthew is to show that God had transferred His centre from earth to heaven.<a name=330:2></a> Luke deals with the kingdom of God down here, Matthew with the kingdom of <i>heaven;</i> that is, that rule was henceforth vested in the heavens.<a name=330:3></a> I want to show you the working out of that historically.<a name=330:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jerusalem had been the centre on earth in which the kingdom had been established, and it was there also that the idea of a city had taken form.<a name=330:5></a> God had placed both testimonies there; that is, a city and a kingdom.<a name=330:6></a> He had sent Christ to Jerusalem.<a name=330:7></a> The Lord visited that city, He visited it in full divine affection for Israel, He wept over it, He wept over the city, and He said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye <i>would not</i>!<a name=330:8></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:37">Matthew  23:37</a>.<a name=330:9></a> There was definite refusal to accede to the divine overture; it was rejected; instead of being received there, the Lord was rejected.<a name=330:10></a> He entered it as King, for God had a testimony rendered to His precious Son as the Son of David, and He entered the city as King, but He was rejected as an imposter.<a name=330:11></a> Such was the city.<a name=330:12></a> Such was the power the enemy had acquired in the city in which God had placed these two great testimonies of His in the presence of man.<a name=330:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Did God give up the city?<a name=330:14></a> I think nothing can exceed the grace manifested in God's forbearance with it.<a name=330:15></a> The Lord says that "repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations".<a name=330:16></a> But where was it to begin?<a name=330:17></a> "Beginning", He says, "at Jerusalem", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:47">Luke  24:47</a>.<a name=330:18></a> At that city the gospel of the grace of God was to begin.<a name=330:19></a> I do not know anything that so exhibits the abounding grace of

		Matthew and Mark contemplate the continuance of God's relationship with Israel; the beginning of the Acts contemplates the continuance of God's relationship with Israel soon after the giving of the Spirit, hence you will find that the Supper is not definitely separated from the passover in these two gospels.<a name=331:5></a> God, as it were, lingered over Jerusalem.<a name=331:6></a> The most wonderful thing that had ever been introduced into this world was introduced in the midst of that city.<a name=331:7></a> And, beloved friends, we soon discover in the historical course of events, if indeed further evidence were required, what the city really was morally.<a name=331:8></a> The presence and energy of the Holy Spirit evidenced God's grace to man, but what did it elicit from Jerusalem?<a name=331:9></a> Well, we see at the death of Stephen, in the attitude of Jerusalem towards Stephen, what God's grace to Jerusalem elicited from it.<a name=331:10></a> The city was in the hands of the wicked power.<a name=331:11></a> The Spirit of Jesus, exhibited in His disciples, and manifested so perfectly in Stephen, only drew out the inveterate hatred of the leaders against Jesus and all who belonged to Him.<a name=331:12></a> Stephen was murdered; he was murdered in the presence of Saul, and Saul becomes the personification of the spirit of Jerusalem.<a name=331:13></a> He left that city as the representative of it; he was the official representative of Jerusalem; he went out of it, we are told, "breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:1">Acts  9:1</a>.<a name=331:14></a> It was not simply <i>Saul's</i> hatred of Jesus,

		Then comes a definite break between Jerusalem and God, and the link has never been re-established.<a name=332:2></a> The earthly centre was abandoned by God and the heavenly centre established.<a name=332:3></a> The christian economy is established from heaven.<a name=332:4></a> God, in forbearance with Israel and in grace, brought into that city the most wonderful thing that had ever been introduced, but the rejection of it necessitated a complete break with Israel, and now all is established in heaven.<a name=332:5></a> Saul hears a voice from heaven, and that voice brings him down.<a name=332:6></a> Saul has now recognised that authority is in <i>heaven</i>, not upon <i>earth</i>.<a name=332:7></a> He had come out of Jerusalem armed with the authority of the high priest -- plenty of it -- he was <i>armed</i> with it.<a name=332:8></a> But he hears a voice from heaven, and that voice discloses to him what Matthew enlarges upon, that rule is now in the <i>heavens;</i> hence Saul says, "<i>Lord</i>, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=332:9></a>", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:6">Acts  9:6</a>.<a name=332:10></a> He acknowledges the rule that God had established in heaven, and what follows upon that is, that God's city is introduced.<a name=332:11></a> There is no longer any protection for the things of God, to be looked for in Jerusalem.<a name=332:12></a> The things of God have to be cared for now from another centre.<a name=332:13></a> The high priests are no longer to be depended upon, they are in open opposition to God, and have refused the testimony; God has established rule in heaven, and there is power from thence to protect His interests upon earth.<a name=332:14></a> That power is for the support and protection of the things of God upon earth.<a name=332:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, that is what I understand to be the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens; it is established in Christ.<a name=332:16></a> Saul was the personification of Jewish wickedness against Christ, but God had a complete triumph.<a name=332:17></a> Power and authority from heaven <i>subdued</i> him.<a name=332:18></a> There we see

		how God met the world system, the world city.<a name=333:1></a> God met it <i>in Christ</i>, in the voice of Christ, and in the power of Christ from heaven.<a name=333:2></a> Saul, the great representative of earthly wickedness against God and against Christ, is separated from the power of evil in Jerusalem; he is completely extricated from it, and henceforth he becomes the <i>herald of God's grace from heaven</i>.<a name=333:3></a> Paul brings in the announcement of the <i>Son</i>.<a name=333:4></a> His first preaching is to announce the Son of God.<a name=333:5></a> We are not told that he was sent to preach, or that he was commissioned to preach in Damascus at that moment, but the fact is stated that he <i>did</i> preach, and his preaching in Damascus was the outcome of the impression made upon his heart.<a name=333:6></a> He preached the Son of God.<a name=333:7></a> Now what hangs upon that is, that the Son of God must have His own city; Jerusalem is rejected, but He will establish a heavenly city.<a name=333:8></a> In Christ exalted we have the idea of rule, and all divine power to support it, so that it becomes effective upon earth, and then consequently we have also a new centre for the affections of His people whilst they are down here.<a name=333:9></a> All that takes place outside of Jewish territory, so that the people of God now have an all-powerful kingdom to support them; they have a city established, and they have a new centre to hold their affections, their thoughts, their ambitions and their minds.<a name=333:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to say a word further in regard to the establishment of things from heaven.<a name=333:11></a> Paul's ministry established christianity in the order that it had been in God's thoughts to establish it here upon earth.<a name=333:12></a> God's thought was, as we learn from the epistle to the Ephesians, to have both Jew and gentile in one body.<a name=333:13></a> The true thought of the "one body" does not come out fully until the gentile is brought in.<a name=333:14></a> The gentile is brought in in a collective way.<a name=333:15></a> The Holy Spirit came upon the Jewish remnant

		collectively, as recorded in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, and He came in like manner upon the gentiles in a collective way, as we see in chapter 10.<a name=334:1></a> You will find that the expressions as to the coming of the Holy Spirit are very similar, with this difference, that in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>He came from heaven, but in chapter 10 it is simply that He "fell upon" those who were listening to Peter's preaching (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:44">Acts  10:44</a>).<a name=334:2></a> So that God had secured His thought, He had brought in a company; the gentile is bound up in one bundle of life in company with the Jew.<a name=334:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, further, we find that the Supper is introduced in that connection; the Supper is in the economy of christianity.<a name=334:4></a> The Lord's supper is given from heaven.<a name=334:5></a> According to the testimony of the gospels it was committed to the Jewish disciples of Jesus.<a name=334:6></a> But in Paul's ministry it is received directly from Christ in heaven; that is to say, it is formally separated from the passover.<a name=334:7></a> Luke is the only evangelist who supports that, because Luke invariably supports Paul's testimony.<a name=334:8></a> The Supper is formally separated from the passover, and it is separated from all social connections here upon earth.<a name=334:9></a> It is received directly from heaven and committed to the assembly, as established here by the ministry of Paul.<a name=334:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, when we come to that I think that one may be free to say a word in regard to what the assembly is as a necessity in God's ways for the present moment, and for the future.<a name=334:11></a> It becomes evident that it was a necessity in view of Israel's decease.<a name=334:12></a> The death of Sarah of old, as I have been saying, necessitated the introduction of Rebekah, and now the decease of Israel, the severance of that link, has necessitated that the Lord Jesus should have another companion, and His beloved apostle Paul was the great instrument to bring in that companion.<a name=334:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, beloved friends, what is so touching is this, that the wonderful grace in the ministry of the Lord gathered around Him a company that was marked by affection for Him, and that affection is represented in the attitude of the women who are given prominence to in the gospel narrative.<a name=335:13></a> The record of each evangelist introduces a woman on the resurrection morning.<a name=335:14></a> The Lord had been alone upon the earth in His wonderful activity of grace, and now on the resurrection morning each evangelist in his turn enlarges upon the affection that had been drawn out by the Lord's ministry here.<a name=335:15></a> In the early morning before the dawn that affection exhibits itself.<a name=335:16></a> In whom?<a name=335:17></a> In a woman.<a name=335:18></a> The feminine side is in evidence at once upon the resurrection morning.<a name=335:19></a> I think it is most touching to see how, figuratively, the counterpart had come to light, the counterpart of Christ.<a name=335:20></a> I cannot think of the counterpart of Christ apart from affection.<a name=335:21></a> What marks the woman

		The Scriptures show us how God had ever purposed to have man with Him, to have man <i>near</i> to Him; and in placing Adam in the garden He intended not only that Adam should be in the joys and delights of paradise, but that <i>He</i> should visit him there.<a name=342:2></a> He intended to come to paradise; we read of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.<a name=342:3></a> It would seem that He discriminated in His visits.<a name=342:4></a> He came in at an opportune moment, the cool of the day would be a convenient time for Adam to be with Him.<a name=342:5></a> God discriminates so as to afford Adam every advantage.<a name=342:6></a> He came into the garden with a view to commune with Adam.<a name=342:7></a> Alas!<a name=342:8></a> as we all know, He did not find Adam; but we see in the visitation what was in the divine mind in ordering paradise.<a name=342:9></a> We know full well how that on coming to Adam God found him hidden.<a name=342:10></a> It is a sad thing to be hidden away from God, and it very often happens even with christians.<a name=342:11></a> As Adam might have enjoyed the presence of God in paradise, so christians have this great privilege, but it is on the ground of being apart from the world.<a name=342:12></a> God says, "I will dwell among them, and walk among them"; and "come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and

		Now in the nation God had really better material, in one sense, than that which He had in Adam.<a name=344:6></a> It is perfectly true that Israel were not innocent when they came out of Egypt; they were very far from being innocent, but there was one thing about them pleasing to Jehovah -- they <i>loved</i> Jehovah.<a name=344:7></a> Jehovah in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2">Jeremiah  2</a>, testifies to the affections that were begotten in the nation when they came after Him into the wilderness.<a name=344:8></a> It is one thing for God to comfort you, but it is quite another thing for you to go after Him, especially when it is in a scene where everything is against you.<a name=344:9></a> Now that is what Israel did; Jehovah reminds them in after years of the love of their espousals when they went after Him into the wilderness.<a name=344:10></a> That was a great result for God, and it was the brightest day in Israel's history.<a name=344:11></a> Everything was against them, there was nothing to attract them in the wilderness except Jehovah, and they went after Him into the wilderness.<a name=344:12></a> Now when they had showed their affection in that way, there was material for Jehovah to use, and hence He proposes to build.<a name=344:13></a> He says, "make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:8">Exodus  25:8</a>.<a name=344:14></a> The fact is, <i>they</i> proposed to build God a habitation, and the material for the tabernacle came from them, so that in Israel we see an advance in that sense

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what marked the city?<a name=347:7></a> It only waited for Christ to enter into it, for it to show itself against Him; but after the death of Stephen the wickedness that put Christ to death became more active.<a name=347:8></a> Saul of Tarsus was present at the death of Stephen.<a name=347:9></a> He was a young man, and a young man is emblematic of energy, and Saul had energy to the full.<a name=347:10></a> He watched the death of the martyr, and held the clothes of the executors of it; he completely identified himself with the death of him whose face was the reflection of Christ.<a name=347:11></a> Now, there had never before been such circumstances on earth as that; it was not only the death of Stephen; it was a repetition, in a sense, of the crucifixion of Christ; it was as if Israel said, 'We are not a bit sorry for what we have done to Christ; we would do it again', and they did it again to him who was a perfect reflection of Christ.<a name=347:12></a> He looked up and saw the glory of God and Jesus; his voice and his manner and his words were all a reflection of what he saw; and they stoned Stephen, calling upon God; and Saul was

	<div class="paragraph">
		The opening verses of this book indicate a dark day in Israel; "the judges ruled" but "there was a famine in the land".<a name=353:1></a> At the end of the book of Judges we are told that, "there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes", <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#21:25">Judges  21:25</a>.<a name=353:2></a> <i>Elimelech</i> signifies that God is King; and yet, alas!<a name=353:3></a> he did what was right in his own eyes; he went to Moab.<a name=353:4></a> Elimelech's name signified the ground Israel had taken; they had professed that God only was their Ruler, and yet each was doing what was right in his own eyes.<a name=353:5></a> Elimelech maintained, as it were, the outward profession, and yet pursued his own way in going into Moab.<a name=353:6></a> In the present condition of Christendom there is a strong analogy to this.<a name=353:7></a> Many maintain an outward recognition of God and of Christ and yet pursue the bent of their own wills.<a name=353:8></a> This indeed marks the general profession of christianity; and there are numbers of true believers who, like Elimelech, are governed by circumstances instead of divine principles, and so get into false positions.<a name=353:9></a> Elimelech took his family to Moab, and Moab is the world of pride.<a name=353:10></a> "We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#16:6">Isaiah  16:6</a>.<a name=353:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The circumstances in which Elimelech and his wife and sons were found afford an opportunity for the Spirit of God to show how the believer is recovered through affection.<a name=353:12></a> It has special application to our day.<a name=353:13></a> As said already, there is much outward profession, but souls are moving according to their own wills; and the Lord is waiting to effect recovery.<a name=353:14></a> The end reached, as we shall see more fully, is that there is a marital relation formed, and God secures

		Elimelech being the husband of Naomi, he represents the side of responsibility, while Naomi is a figure of the nation viewed as that in which the light of God was.<a name=354:4></a> She was in the failure with her husband, but as far as her words go she had the mind of God; she had right understanding.<a name=354:5></a> Ruth became attached to her with more than natural attachment, and through her love for Naomi she comes into touch with Boaz and becomes his wife.<a name=354:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Naomi prefigures a true believer: she accepts the consequences of departure as from God.<a name=354:7></a> This is unmistakable evidence of recovery.<a name=354:8></a> She says, "call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me".<a name=354:9></a> The hand of the Lord had gone out against her, and she was humbled and in bitterness.<a name=354:10></a> But this result of God's dealings with us is the sure prelude to immediate and lasting blessing.<a name=354:11></a> Naomi signifies <i>pleasant</i>.<a name=354:12></a> The christian is pleasant in God's eyes, but as reaping the bitter fruits of unbelief he is not conscious of this.<a name=354:13></a> <i>Mara</i> is now appropriate.<a name=354:14></a> Elimelech and Naomi had a good excuse for going into Moab, for there was a famine in Canaan, but unbelief underlay their movement, for if God were King, as they professed, He would take care of them.<a name=354:15></a> Death overtakes Elimelech, Mahlon and Chilion in Moab, and the responsible side disappears.<a name=354:16></a> Naomi is Israel, or the christian, viewed as genuine and possessing the light of God; she continues to the end.<a name=354:17></a> <i>Prophetically</i>, Naomi is Israel, who, although she loses her husband and sons, is in possession of a son at the end, through the remnant, and through Him God's rights are established.<a name=354:18></a> The testimony was: "There is a son born to Naomi", chapter 4:17.<a name=354:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The strong affection of Ruth shines in her determined refusal to be separated from Naomi.<a name=355:12></a> This was more than natural; there was that in the widow of Elimelech which attracted her in a spiritual way.<a name=355:13></a> In Orpah there was nothing beyond the natural.<a name=355:14></a> She kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people and to her gods, "but Ruth clave unto her".<a name=355:15></a> Ruth's decision here has often an analogy now in souls being drawn to those who are moving out of this world as possessed of the light of another.<a name=355:16></a> The attracted ones are thus led to the Source of the light -- Christ Himself.<a name=355:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This but emphasises the importance of christians being governed by the light; "they .<a name=355:18></a>.<a name=355:19></a>.<a name=355:20></a> declare plainly that they seek a country", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:14">Hebrews  11:14</a>.<a name=355:21></a> Naomi had set her face toward the land of Judah, where, as she heard, the Lord had visited His people and was giving them bread.<a name=355:22></a> She came to Bethlehem, where she was well remembered, for "all the city was moved about them" (verse 19).<a name=355:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ruth's decision was most resolute.<a name=355:24></a> "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we have seen, Ruth and Naomi arrived at a most opportune time.<a name=356:4></a> It was "in the beginning of barley harvest".<a name=356:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This points to the time of Christ's resurrection, as the wheat harvest corresponds with the resurrection of the saints; that is, viewed as risen with Him.<a name=356:6></a> Christ is the "firstfruits" of them that slept (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:20">1 Corinthians  15:20</a>), hence the early harvest, which was barley, is used to typify His resurrection.<a name=356:7></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>.<a name=356:8></a> Ruth continued by the maidens of Boaz unto the end of the barley harvest and wheat harvest.<a name=356:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1 teaches recovery; that is, discipline had its healthful result in Naomi, and now she is back at the point of departure, fully owning that the hand of God was upon her.<a name=356:10></a> An important point in connection with recovery is that the Lord is presented to us in a new light to that in which he has been known to us before.<a name=356:11></a> A comparison of the two epistles to the Corinthians would show this.<a name=356:12></a> The second epistle supposes that the first has effected recovery, hence Christ is presented as the Son of God in whom all the promises of God were "Yea" and "Amen", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:20">2 Corinthians  1:20</a>.<a name=356:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was a new thought, and it was introduced to the end that the Corinthian saints might be established in their souls.<a name=356:14></a> In the first epistle the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many ways in which God works with souls so as to lead them out of the world.<a name=357:5></a> One of these is seen in Ruth's history.<a name=357:6></a> She got into touch with one of God's people and was in this way led to him who is a type of Christ.<a name=357:7></a> Coming to Christ now, we come to Him as risen from the dead; it is, as it were, the time of the barley harvest.<a name=357:8></a> If we begin with the barley harvest (Christ) we shall be led on to the wheat harvest; we shall be put into connection with the saints regarded as risen with Him.<a name=357:9></a> The wheat harvest is the fruit of Christ's death, for He was the "corn of wheat" that would have abode alone unless He died, but by dying, He has borne "much fruit", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:24">John  12:24</a>.<a name=357:10></a> Christ is the firstfruits from the dead, afterwards they that are His at His coming (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:23">1 Corinthians  15:23</a>).<a name=357:11></a> When the truth is rightly apprehended the harvests are occasions of feasts (see <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>) but this is not within the scope of this book.<a name=357:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may now consider what is said about Boaz.<a name=357:13></a> He is introduced as related to Naomi -- "a kinsman of her husband's".<a name=357:14></a> This has to be specially noted.<a name=357:15></a> The object of the book is not to bring forward the greatness of Christ personally, but to show how He undertakes for the remnant of Israel in the latter days, and in them to establish the nation in its own land; and in a general way the book sets forth how Christ takes up the cause of any one who claims Him; being Man, He is related to men, and so all

		<a name=358>[Page 358]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		can claim Him.<a name=358:1></a> Thus Boaz is said, at the outset, to be "of the family of Elimelech".<a name=358:2></a> Besides, he was "a mighty man of wealth".<a name=358:3></a> Hence Naomi and Ruth come to recognise in him one who had the right and power of redemption.<a name=358:4></a> Verse 4 affords further light as to the character of Boaz.<a name=358:5></a> "And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you.<a name=358:6></a> And they answered him, The Lord bless thee".<a name=358:7></a> That speaks as to what kind of a man Boaz was.<a name=358:8></a> He says, "The Lord be with you", and they reply in terms which indicate remarkable relations between him and his workmen; they say, "The Lord bless thee".<a name=358:9></a> You feel that God had a great place there.<a name=358:10></a> And this is a sure guide to the believer who wishes to locate the order of things over which Christ holds sway.<a name=358:11></a> Viewed from the side that christians are here to be of help to souls, it is of the very greatest importance that right conditions should prevail.<a name=358:12></a> Young people especially are helped and led on in this way.<a name=358:13></a> They are affected by the care and affection shown among the Lord's people.<a name=358:14></a> Ruth undoubtedly was drawn to Naomi by what was of God in the latter, and Naomi's God should become Ruth's God.<a name=358:15></a> As we see in Ruth, souls are drawn to Christ by what they see in His people.<a name=358:16></a> People thus come on to Christ's <i>field</i> so to speak.<a name=358:17></a> Here they come under His influence, and He demonstrates His grace and goodness to them.<a name=358:18></a> Thus their confidence is gained, and a definite relationship is formed between Him and them.<a name=358:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But light now breaks in.<a name=359:5></a> It is becoming evident to Ruth that Boaz is actuated by something more than compassion, and there is assurance in his address (<a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#2:11">Ruth  2:11</a>) that he was informed of her history; how she had forsaken father and mother and country for people whom she knew not, and how she had shown kindness to Naomi, and had come to trust under the wings of the God of Israel.<a name=359:6></a> In like manner now does the Lord encourage our souls when we take our true place before Him in the light of His grace, reminding us of what is but the effect of His own grace in us.<a name=359:7></a> And how becoming is her attitude: "Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?<a name=359:8></a>" (verse 10).<a name=359:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ruth now returns to her mother-in-law into the city with what she had gleaned in the field of Boaz, and now she is enlightened as to who Boaz is.<a name=359:10></a> "Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen".<a name=359:11></a> In this way light breaks gradually into our souls and increases until the marital relation with Christ is formed.<a name=359:12></a> Chapter 3 will enable us to see how the believer is led on to this.<a name=359:13></a>

		Another point to be taken account of is, that in going down to the threshing floor of Boaz at night Ruth did violence to natural feelings; faith always acts from its own motives, and is unconcerned about the propriety of its course as judged by the principles of this world.<a name=362:10></a> But Ruth was a virtuous woman, a woman of worth, in the eyes of Boaz, <a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#3:11">Ruth  3:11</a>.<a name=362:11></a> He had said of her that she had come under the wings of the Lord God of Israel for protection; now she says virtually to him, 'I want <i>your</i> protection': "spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman".<a name=362:12></a> It is a beautiful example of the knowledge of the Lord.<a name=362:13></a> Ruth here is a type of the christian as he advances in his soul in the knowledge of Christ, leading to our recognition of Him as having full title to us on the ground of redemption.<a name=362:14></a> At this stage Ruth understood that Boaz had <i>ability</i> to redeem, and that he was a kinsman -- he had <i>title;</i> thus she claims him.<a name=362:15></a> Later she had full testimony that he had the <i>heart</i> of a redeemer.<a name=362:16></a> This is the most blessed discovery of all!<a name=362:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The purchase of the field of Machpelah by Abraham helps us in considering the subject of redemption (see <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#23">Genesis  23</a>).<a name=364:2></a> The land belonged to God, and was given in purpose to Abraham; yet the patriarch had to buy a burying-place for his wife.<a name=364:3></a> This showed that the land had passed into alien hands.<a name=364:4></a> Abraham would not accept the field as a gift from Ephron; he would pay for it.<a name=364:5></a> This was an act of faith, for it recognised the consequences of sin; that is, that although the land was God's, yet it was to be held on the ground of purchase.<a name=364:6></a> The cave and the field were made sure to Abraham for the full price.<a name=364:7></a> A leading thought in this transaction was that the money paid was <i>current;</i> "four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#23:16">Genesis  23:16</a>.<a name=364:8></a> The only money current for redemption is the blood of Christ.<a name=364:9></a> We are redeemed "with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:18">1 Peter  1:18</a>,19.<a name=364:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the book of Ruth we learn that those to whom the land belonged have to be redeemed as well as the land itself.<a name=364:11></a> Ruth was purchased by Boaz.<a name=364:12></a> Ruth is a type of the remnant of Israel, and hence we learn that the nation as well as the land shall stand related to Christ on the ground of redemption.<a name=364:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great thought here is that the redeemer must be a kinsman to those needing redemption.<a name=364:14></a> As we have seen, Boaz recognised Ruth's claim of kinship, but there was a nearer than he, and the claim of this nearer relative must be owned.<a name=364:15></a> There can be no doubt that the allusion is to the law.<a name=364:16></a> The law was not a person, of course, but it was set in relationship with men, and what came to light was that it possessed no ability to meet man's case as sold under sin.<a name=364:17></a> "If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness

		Now we come to the great transaction itself, as foreshadowed here.<a name=365:10></a> It takes place in the most public place -- that is the gate of the city.<a name=365:11></a> Redemption was a <i>public</i> transaction.<a name=365:12></a> Redemption is in Christ, and is presented for faith in the gospel, but it was accomplished in the presence of the universe.<a name=365:13></a> Another great feature in this chapter is that all was done <i>legally</i>.<a name=365:14></a> The claim of the nearer kinsman was owned, and then the custom in Israel concerning redeeming and changing was fully observed, <a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#4:7">Ruth  4:7</a>.<a name=365:15></a> If we take "the custom .<a name=365:16></a>.<a name=365:17></a>.<a name=365:18></a> in Israel" as pointing to God's requirement (which the Old Testament clearly teaches to be death), the plucking off of the shoe points to death.<a name=365:19></a> Death lay upon man and on the inheritance, and hence clearance can only be by death.<a name=365:20></a> The whole sacrificial system pointed to the fact that redemption could only be by the death of another, for without shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=365:21></a>

		Ques.<a name=422:1></a> Will you tell us the difference between the aspect of the assembly as presented here, and the way in which it is presented in John?<a name=422:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=422:3></a> I think John presents it from the spiritual point of view; that is, what the assembly is as formed by the Spirit, and its inner privileges; whereas Corinthians presents it in its external character as that in which the divine order is seen here in this world; so that the apostle makes a point of what the outer world might see in the assembly.<a name=422:4></a> Therefore he says; "Let all things be done decently and in order".<a name=422:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=422:8></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=422:9></a> Corinthians is the assembly of God viewed in its local character as that in which divine order is displayed.<a name=422:10></a> In that way I think Corinthians corresponds with the book of Numbers.<a name=422:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=422:14></a> Well, the book of Numbers sets forth the testimony in the wilderness.<a name=422:15></a> The wilderness may be divided into three sections.<a name=422:16></a> The first section is what the people under God had known as pure grace, as having been delivered by Him out of Egypt.<a name=422:17></a> Then followed the legal period; that is, the people under law; and lastly, the people are viewed typically as having the Spirit.<a name=422:18></a> This latter is prefigured in the book of Numbers from chapter 21 onward.<a name=422:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=422:22></a> No.<a name=422:23></a> Romans does not give us the collective side, whereas Numbers does.<a name=422:24></a> The book of Numbers is in relation to the tabernacle, and the priesthood, and the Levites.<a name=422:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=423:7></a> Well, I think that, the details will all come in in their right place if we see that it is the assembly viewed as established here under the eye of the world, and not the assembly viewed in its heavenly relationship as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=423:8></a> So the apostle speaks of the Jews, and the gentile, and the assembly of God.<a name=423:9></a> It was a very great thought with God that He should have <i>His</i> assembly.<a name=423:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=423:13></a> Yes; it could be taken account of as an institution set up here, apart from the world morally, but in the presence of the world.<a name=423:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=423:15></a> In contrast to that which is purely the work of the Spirit of God, as under God's eye.<a name=423:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=423:17></a> Yes, just so; that is more John's line; he presents the inside view, whereas in Corinthians it is the outer aspect; what is under the eye of the world.<a name=423:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=423:19></a> The inner must be right first, before there can be anything outward.<a name=423:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=423:21></a> You see, it is one thing to be here, in this world, under the grace of God; that is the wilderness position up to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>.<a name=423:22></a> It was all a question of pure grace, and a very wonderful period.<a name=423:23></a> But then, if God is going to have an organisation in the presence of the world, there must be a rule; and the collective testimony stands related to the law.<a name=423:24></a> I am not referring to the law now merely as that which brings the knowledge of sin.<a name=423:25></a> The law is really a type; it was the declaration of God's rights, and the tabernacle was set up in connection with

		J.T.<a name=424:5></a> Yes; so that this epistle is what you may call "the law of the house".<a name=424:6></a> The order that is spoken of here is not for heaven, and it necessarily terminates; but what we have in the gospel of John is eternal.<a name=424:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=424:22></a> Well, it is a provisional order of things filling up the interval between the ascension of Christ from the earth, and His appearing in glory.<a name=424:23></a> It is established in the way of testimony; that is, God's order is to be displayed under the eyes of men before it is displayed literally in the heavenly city.<a name=424:24></a> So that here, it may be noticed, the apostle is concerned about the impression made on those who are without.<a name=424:25></a> For instance, if anybody came

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=425:5></a> Yes, the unbeliever is supposed to be able to take account of what is of God there; so that he is convicted; he is impressed that God is there.<a name=425:6></a> I think that is a great point.<a name=425:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=425:8></a> A brother here told us, some time ago, about a person being exercised about the truth, who heard through another of a little meeting near the place where he lived, and he said, 'I cannot say much about it, but what struck me was that God was there'.<a name=425:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=425:10></a> So that the great thought to lay hold of in that regard, is that it is <i>God's</i> assembly.<a name=425:11></a> That is, it is not man's; it is the sphere in which God is dominant.<a name=425:12></a> Hence the importance of the instructions that the apostle gives; and he intimates that the injunctions which were to govern the Corinthian assembly were to govern all the other assemblies; so that you have what one might call a catholic system; that is, the government is the same universally.<a name=425:13></a>

		mother, and brothers, and sisters.<a name=437:1></a> The other gospels give much more prominence to those relations than does John, because John's great aim is to establish the spiritual; he wishes to show that the things of God are necessarily of a spiritual nature; hence he records the Lord's discourse with the woman at the well of Sychar; and amongst other things he records how the Lord impressed upon her that "<i>God is a spirit</i>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:24">John  4:24</a>); and if God formulates a system of things after His own nature, they must be spiritual.<a name=437:2></a> The first was natural; but the second is spiritual; and the spiritual is that which is to remain; the natural disappears.<a name=437:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in a way, nothing could be more important than to bow to that fact, because while most of us may be said to be clear of the world which is dominated by the wicked one, it is questionable whether we are clear of being under the power of natural relationships.<a name=437:4></a> Now, natural relationships are of God; they are God's institutions; but, beloved friends, if God has instituted the spiritual, which He has, the natural must take the second place.<a name=437:5></a> It is all well when the spiritual influences the natural; but it is the contrary, when the natural influences the spiritual.<a name=437:6></a> When the mother of the Lord attempted to influence Him in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:3">John  2:3</a>, He refuses it.<a name=437:7></a> She says, "They have no wine".<a name=437:8></a> She undertook to make Him acquainted with something of which she thought He was ignorant.<a name=437:9></a> Now, why did she speak thus to Christ?<a name=437:10></a> Upon what ground did she do that?<a name=437:11></a> It was on the ground of natural relationship.<a name=437:12></a>

		I have spoken of that to show what is in the Lord's mind; and now I wish to connect what I have said with the first day of the week.<a name=442:6></a> The first day of the week is a spiritual idea; it was not intended for the world; it represents the beginning of things spiritually; it represents the day upon which Christ had His pleasure in the assembly; there can be no doubt about that.<a name=442:7></a> The allusions to the first day of the week in the New Testament show unmistakably that the Lord honoured that day by being in company with His "brethren".<a name=442:8></a> The first point that I would allude to, and it has been much before us, is the Lord's supper.<a name=442:9></a> The early disciples, without any injunction, so far as we know, chose that day to celebrate the Supper; they had Christ before them.<a name=442:10></a> One is not going too far in saying that they all loved Christ; and they came together on the first day of the week to celebrate the Supper.<a name=442:11></a>

		Now, when we are in the Spirit we are for Christ; we have reached the assembly, according to what it really is; a spiritual formation.<a name=443:6></a> It is formed of persons, I need not say; and each person in it has a name; and each person in it is known and loved by Christ; but it is also viewed as a unit, as <i>one;</i> and as such it has a name, which, as I said, indicates its origin.<a name=443:7></a> And as you are in the Spirit, as John was, you answer to what the assembly is to the heart of Christ.<a name=443:8></a> That is what I apprehend to be the proper state for the assembly, viewed as related to Christ in heavenly glory.<a name=443:9></a> Apart from being in the Spirit we do not touch it, but as we are in the Spirit we recognise what the Lord seeks, and we respond to it; we are His, and for His pleasure.<a name=443:10></a>

		Well, that is just what I had on my mind to bring before you.<a name=444:7></a> What has especially exercised me is that the Lord may have something for His own heart.<a name=444:8></a> We all know how He became poor that we might become rich.<a name=444:9></a> The Lord clothed Himself in the humble guise of man, and "took upon him the form of a servant" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:7">Philippians  2:7</a>) and then went into death; and He did it that we might be enriched.<a name=444:10></a> But remember that the Lord has affections that He seeks to gratify, and the assembly is for the gratification of His affections.<a name=444:11></a> It has a wonderful place in that way.<a name=444:12></a> We have alluded to the position which Rebecca occupied in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>.<a name=444:13></a> We are told she was brought into Sarah's tent.<a name=444:14></a> Now, that is no small thought.<a name=444:15></a> Sarah's tent is not a permanent abode for Rebecca, but a provisional one; Sarah's tent represents the sphere occupied by Israel in the testimony.<a name=444:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in venturing to bring forward this great and precious subject one is dealing with what may be called the primary thought with God.<a name=446:3></a> It is important to distinguish between the primary thoughts of God, which of necessity are eternal, and those of a provisional character which have arisen to meet the conditions which arose through the introduction of sin or lawlessness into the world.<a name=446:4></a> I repeat, that it is of great moment that we should become accustomed to distinguish between these two thoughts.<a name=446:5></a> God's primary thoughts are those which He intends to be eternal.<a name=446:6></a> But the introduction of lawlessness into God's creation necessitated a provisional course of dealings on the part of God, by which He met and solved the problem that arose in His creation through the introduction of sin.<a name=446:7></a> In this He had, as it were, to turn aside for a moment and from His point of view it is but a moment, to meet and solve this great problem.<a name=446:8></a> When this great problem is solved, we shall find that God reverts to His primary thoughts.<a name=446:9></a> He never relinquished them for a moment.<a name=446:10></a> Indeed, I think that

		In the light of the gospel of Luke, one cannot fail to see that in Adam the thought was there.<a name=447:3></a> He was in a peculiar and unique relationship with God; he was God's offspring.<a name=447:4></a> There was the parental idea, which relates to the family; and from that point onwards you will find either the thought of father and son, or of brethren in the whole course of God's dealings; and that, I believe, is the link between God's primary thoughts and the course of His governmental dealings.<a name=447:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, going back for a moment beyond the first of Genesis, we find Wisdom in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>, giving us an account of the motives and desires that were active at the outset.<a name=447:6></a> Wisdom was there, as we read, "before his works of old".<a name=447:7></a> Wisdom was with God (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:22">Proverbs  8:22</a>); and directly the earth takes form and the habitable parts come into evidence, Wisdom is intensely interested.<a name=447:8></a> I need not say that there was interest throughout, but that chapter tells us of the special interest which Wisdom took in the sphere in which man was to be.<a name=447:9></a> Wisdom delighted before Jehovah, and delighted "in the habitable part" of His earth.<a name=447:10></a> Wisdom is engaged with a sphere in which man is to subsist.<a name=447:11></a> Then we read, "my delights were with the sons of men", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:31">Proverbs  8:31</a>.<a name=447:12></a> Now, there we get a family thought.<a name=447:13></a> Thus, we see that at that early date the divine thought was that God should have men; and Wisdom delighted in the <i>sons</i> of men.<a name=447:14></a>

		Now, I was saying that the first statement of Wisdom which referred to the habitable earth was that God should have men, and have good pleasure in them as such, as <i>men;</i> and that this corresponds with the testimony of the gospel of Luke; whereas the idea of <i>sons</i>, the family idea, corresponds with the testimony of the gospel of John.<a name=449:2></a> John unites both these ideas in the opening chapter of his gospel.<a name=449:3></a> Giving us an account of the Person of Christ he tells us that "in him was life, and the life was the light of <i>men</i>", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>.<a name=449:4></a> It was not the light of <i>angels</i>, it was the light of <i>men</i>.<a name=449:5></a> In other words, the light as taking form in Man upon earth, has men in view.<a name=449:6></a> Men are to be illuminated, and the life of Christ was the light of men.<a name=449:7></a> That is the first thought.<a name=449:8></a> But John tells us also that the Lord came to His own and His own received Him not; but he adds, "as many as received him, to them gave he right to be (to take the place of) children of God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:12">John  1:12</a>.<a name=449:9></a> <i>There</i> we get the <i>family</i>.<a name=449:10></a> And then he gives us an account of the origin of the children of God.<a name=449:11></a> He says they were born, not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but they were born of God.<a name=449:12></a> Hence the initial idea of the family is, that it is of divine origin.<a name=449:13></a>

		So that, as I was saying, recovery is in a spiritual way; and if God reverts to the idea of a garden, it is in a spiritual sense.<a name=459:9></a> Now you can all understand what a garden is.<a name=459:10></a> If there is anything that marks Scripture, it is the simplicity of its similes.<a name=459:11></a> Everybody, from a child up, may form some idea of a garden; it is a distinct part set aside by the farmer, or the landed proprietor, for his special use.<a name=459:12></a> Now God was pleased to introduce that idea.<a name=459:13></a> God has rights over all men.<a name=459:14></a> We must not limit the rights of God to believers; the Lord Jesus Christ has established His indisputable right to all, even though a man be an infidel.<a name=459:15></a> Do not forget that.<a name=459:16></a> He may not have put His mark on you yet; He would never claim you as His special property as an unbeliever; but He has a right to claim you.<a name=459:17></a> It is one thing to have a right, and it is another thing to assert it.<a name=459:18></a>

		Now, the next thing is that God has sealed us.<a name=460:3></a> He has sealed believers.<a name=460:4></a> He marks them off as His own; it is for us to determine whether it is so.<a name=460:5></a> You remember how Paul raised the question with the Ephesian saints.<a name=460:6></a> There were twelve believers there.<a name=460:7></a> He says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=460:8></a>", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:2">Acts  19:2</a>.<a name=460:9></a> It was for them to answer.<a name=460:10></a> It is a very pertinent question.<a name=460:11></a> You are a believer; or you are a professed believer.<a name=460:12></a> Where is the seal?<a name=460:13></a> God's thought is that you should be sealed as one who is redeemed.<a name=460:14></a> It is a wonderful thought that God would put a distinct stamp upon you, and that stamp is the testimony that you are His.<a name=460:15></a> He has bought you; you are His.<a name=460:16></a> What is the price?<a name=460:17></a> The blood of Jesus.<a name=460:18></a> That is current money, speaking reverently; that is, the currency of the sanctuary.<a name=460:19></a> You are purchased by the blood of God's own Son; you belong, in that sense, to God, and you have the seal; but, as I said, it is for you to answer to that.<a name=460:20></a>

		Then the next thing in regard to the Spirit is, that He is given as the earnest in our hearts.<a name=460:21></a> That is not the external mark; that is something for <i>our hearts</i>.<a name=460:22></a> Do you not need something in your heart?<a name=460:23></a> The Spirit in us is the earnest of coming good things; things which "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a>.<a name=460:24></a> Thus you have means spiritually.<a name=460:25></a> There are many people who have nothing to live on; and they turn to the world.<a name=460:26></a> What is the earnest for?<a name=460:27></a> That is something to live on.<a name=460:28></a> Is it not a handsome income?<a name=460:29></a> The Spirit is life, says the apostle writing to the Romans.<a name=460:30></a> 'Oh well', you say,

		Well now, recovery is on this principle; and if God returns to the idea of a garden, He recovers it in a spiritual way.<a name=461:6></a> You may ask, 'What is the garden?<a name=461:7></a>' Your heart is the garden; that is the garden that God is looking for now.<a name=461:8></a> I will come to that presently.<a name=461:9></a> He had a garden in Eden; planted eastward in Eden.<a name=461:10></a> He made it in every way suited for the satisfaction of the man; it offered every possible means of satisfaction for man; it was a place of delights.<a name=461:11></a> But then it was not only to be for <i>man</i>.<a name=461:12></a> <i>God</i> was to have something to say in it.<a name=461:13></a> I have thought of the river that flowed into it.<a name=461:14></a> You remember that a river rose in Eden; the river did not have its rise in the garden; it rose in Eden, and it flowed into the garden.<a name=461:15></a> Now what that signifies is that God intended to influence the garden; a river is a source of influence; it flowed into the garden as <i>one</i> river, or stream, and it flowed out as <i>four</i>.<a name=461:16></a> Thus God indicated that the antitype, the gift of the Holy Spirit from heaven flowing into the hearts of believers, should be universal in its influence.<a name=461:17></a> Four is a symbol of what is universal.<a name=461:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the river in Eden, God intended to have a hold on the garden; He was to influence it; His river flowed into it, and flowed out of it; and, moreover, as the verse I read stated, God came into it Himself.<a name=461:19></a> Now I want you to dwell on that.<a name=461:20></a> The general idea is that God would have a special place for man, and He would influence the place for good.<a name=461:21></a> Think of the continuous stream flowing into it, influencing it with its refreshing power.<a name=461:22></a> Everything in the garden would benefit by that river; and then God Himself came into the garden.<a name=461:23></a> What I want to show you is this, that He found no response

		Well, these women were not to marry outside their father's house, and the point was that the inheritance should not be diverted from its proper tribe; and for us this sets forth that our inheritance as christians must not be diverted from the people -- the tribe of Christ.<a name=472:1></a> The professing church, as I have been saying, has carried away that which is His and has given it to the world.<a name=472:2></a> That with which the Lord endowed her and adorned her she has carried away and given to another; the very graces which were His she has put upon the world in that way.<a name=472:3></a> We have to be exceedingly jealous over our hearts lest they should be diverted from Christ and directed to another outside our father's tribe.<a name=472:4></a> As I said before, Christ is the only true Husband for His people; He is the only legitimate Husband; we are His.<a name=472:5></a> If you look at Ruth you will see that not only did Boaz love her, but he <i>purchased</i> her for himself; she was a redeemed one.<a name=472:6></a> It is so with us; Christ has redeemed us; He has purchased us for Himself; no other claimant has any title to us but the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=472:7></a> He has bought us for Himself, and if we recognise His claim over us, all that with which He has endowed the church will remain to us, and remaining to us it is secured for Him.<a name=472:8></a> It remains to Him, though He has made it ours.<a name=472:9></a> When the heavenly city comes down from God she appears fully endowed, fully adorned with all that grace has put upon her.<a name=472:10></a> All that she has, every element of glory, is secured to Christ in the church.<a name=472:11></a>

		You can readily discern from the passages I have read that my thought is to seek to direct your minds to God's house, and what I should like to make clear is, that to reach it in our souls, we have to be guided by certain inward marks, and not by outward or visible ones only.<a name=474:1></a> Of course, it is true that God's house has certain outward features which can be taken account of even by the natural mind, but in order to reach it according to God, certain lines have to be followed which can only be discerned by those who have eyes to perceive divine things.<a name=474:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, what I hope to show is, that there are at least three leading initial features as to the house which have to be discerned before anyone can enjoy that place.<a name=474:3></a> The first has reference to the foundation, or, rather, the site of the foundation, and this is seen in the passage in Chronicles; that is to say, the spot upon which God's house was to be erected is identified with the place in which man is accepted with God on the ground of sacrifice; this involving the judgment of sin.<a name=474:4></a> This place was not left to man to choose; it was divinely indicated to David as the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.<a name=474:5></a> David discerned by moral perception that this should be the site on which the house should be built.<a name=474:6></a> He says, "This is the house of the Lord God".<a name=474:7></a> Here the sword of God was sheathed, as we see in verse 27.<a name=474:8></a> This is the first feature which I would dwell upon.<a name=474:9></a>

		My thought is to seek to show the manner of God's operations.<a name=489:1></a> You will have observed in the Scriptures that the <i>Spirit</i> operates in connection with a certain set of circumstances, and that the <i>Lord</i> operates in connection with another set of circumstances, and, finally, that <i>God</i> operates.<a name=489:2></a> And as you pass from one thought to another, the sphere of the operations extends.<a name=489:3></a> When God operates fully according to His own nature the sphere of the operations extends to the whole creation.<a name=489:4></a> He has rights as Creator, and when He is free to act according to His nature He asserts these rights.<a name=489:5></a> He has a right to operate according to His nature.<a name=489:6></a> One thing that gives the present period such a unique character is that it is the moment of God's operations according to His nature as fully revealed.<a name=489:7></a> He operates "all things in all", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:6">1 Corinthians  12:6</a>.<a name=489:8></a>

		Now, I want to show you how God has operated so that the gospel might be extended from the narrow limits of judaism to the wide limits of creation.<a name=491:5></a> God has wrought to that end.<a name=491:6></a> I do not think you get any event in which this is more perfectly stated, than that which is related in this chapter.<a name=491:7></a> It commends itself to me as a most perfect statement to bring into evidence how God has operated so that the light of the gospel should be extended to us gentiles.<a name=491:8></a>

		I wish to go into the matter in a little detail.<a name=491:9></a> A great many things had to be done, and one is struck with the minuteness of detail that is presented.<a name=491:10></a> Cornelius is taken account of outside judaism, and this is a distinct testimony to the sovereign activity of God outside Israel prior to the formal introduction of the gospel to the gentiles.<a name=491:11></a> Peter had to be taken account of in this, for he was the official holder of the keys of the kingdom, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:19">Matthew  16:19</a>.<a name=491:12></a> As yet he was not prepared to use them to admit the gentile, but we shall see that God operated to lead Peter to do this.<a name=491:13></a> I want to show you how God formed Peter to open the door to the gentiles in suitable dignity.<a name=491:14></a> If the door is to be opened it must be opened wide, and with grace and good-will; opened by one who was won over to complete sympathy with God's mind.<a name=491:15></a> The moment had come for it, and God was bent upon this great transaction.<a name=491:16></a>

		I have often thought that God did not leave Israel until they forced Him to leave them; it was a wonderful testimony to His patience.<a name=492:1></a> Nothing can exceed the patience of God in regard to Israel.<a name=492:2></a> He bore with Israel after they had put to death His precious Son, and after the testimony of the twelve was refused He sent Paul throughout the empire, and in every city that Paul visited he went to the "Jew first".<a name=492:3></a> Even when he went to Rome he sent for the Jews, not the brethren; and more than that, when the time came for God to bring in the gentile, and when He succeeded in securing the gentile for His pleasure, He invited the Jew to participate in His joy.<a name=492:4></a> He actually proposes to the Jew to participate in His holy joy in the returned prodigal.<a name=492:5></a> He appeals to the elder brother in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>.<a name=492:6></a> He says, "This thy brother" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:32">Luke  15:32</a>), appealing to his affections, if there were any.<a name=492:7></a> The elder brother says, "This thy son was come" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:30">Luke  15:30</a>), not, my brother.<a name=492:8></a> There was not the least sympathy with the Jew toward the gentile.<a name=492:9></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>the spirit of the elder brother is fully manifest, even in those who were professed believers.<a name=492:10></a> They of the circumcision at Jerusalem contended with Peter, but the apostle justified himself by saying that it was <i>God</i> who acted.<a name=492:11></a> "What was I", he says, "that I could withstand God?<a name=492:12></a>", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:17">Acts  11:17</a>.<a name=492:13></a> As it was, Peter and the other apostles were tardy as to the admission of the gentiles, but God would have Peter act with Him.<a name=492:14></a> He would have the door opened, not simply to what was established in Jerusalem, but to what was established in heaven.<a name=492:15></a> What have I been admitted to as a gentile?<a name=492:16></a> Into what sphere does the door open?<a name=492:17></a> Why, it is into the whole heavenly system.<a name=492:18></a> The gentile was not simply admitted to what was established at Jerusalem; that was not a complete idea; it was connected with Jerusalem; what the gentile is admitted to is the heavenly system, but before the gentile was actually admitted
