		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> From these instances we may see, by the Lord's help, how His testimony stands related to <i>cities</i>.<a name=1:4></a> The relation between the light of heaven and cities is noteworthy.<a name=1:5></a> You will observe that those who saw the Lord ascend, to whom the angels spoke, returned to the city.<a name=1:6></a> Then in Saul's case (chapter 9) the Lord directed him to enter into the city and it should be told him there what he ought to do, and later it says that the Holy Spirit testified to him in every city.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=1:8></a> Is it your thought that the Spirit would move in relation to Christ in heaven in regard to the maintenance of the truth, and therefore what is involved would operate in that city character?<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:10></a> Yes; I think the testimony of God -- of heaven -- should take form as present in the cities in being superior to the concentrated evil of this world.<a name=1:11></a> Hence the apostle Paul in writing to Titus later says that he left him in Crete so that he should set in order the things that were wanting, that there should be nothing omitted in the ordering of the house of God, and particularly that he should ordain elders in every city.<a name=1:12></a> He had already told him to do that (chapter 1:5), but showing the importance of it, he repeated the order.<a name=1:13></a> Earlier they had ordained elders in each assembly, but Titus is charged to ordain them "in every city".<a name=1:14></a> <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#1:5">Titus  1:5</a>.<a name=1:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:1></a> The assembly as such would be in view in the first; in the second the city is in view as a sphere in God's mind for testimony.<a name=2:2></a> The great thought in eldership being rule, implies that there should be subjection.<a name=2:3></a> No assembly could be a vessel in the Lord's hands for testimony in any locality save as subject; as it is said of the assembly, "subjected to the Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:24">Ephesians  5:24</a>.<a name=2:4></a> Without the great principle of subjection the idea of a vessel of testimony is <i>impossible</i>.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=2:6></a> You remarked that in the city the evil and the glory of man are more concentrated, would that be the reason why it is so important that there should be rule and eldership so that there would be an answer on the divine side to the efforts of man?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> God possesses ways of meeting evil on its own ground; hence in Matthew, which is the great church gospel, we find evil in a combined form in <i>twos</i>, so God meets it in a combined way.<a name=2:9></a> We see this in the naming and numbering of the apostles (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:2">Matthew  10:2</a> - 4) and the Lord sending them out in twos.<a name=2:10></a> Then in chapter 18, "if two of you shall agree on the earth", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a> that is, two of the assembly.<a name=2:11></a> Thus we see how God meets evil on its own ground; but this involves subjection in those He uses.<a name=2:12></a> "Ye men of Galilee", the angels in Acts said; they were men of Galilee; I have no doubt that they are regarded not simply as Galileans, but also as subject, for their history in Galilee implied subjection.<a name=2:13></a> Matthew tells us that the Lord would see them there.<a name=2:14></a> In that meeting He maintains His rights in rule and authority, and Matthew leaves us there.<a name=2:15></a> There were no Galileans with such a history as these Galileans; they had had to do with Christ in an exceptional way, as Matthew presents it, after He arose.<a name=2:16></a> The testimony rendered to the women in Matthew is by one who is in every way marked off as a representative of heaven -- an angel.<a name=2:17></a> His countenance was like lightning,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and his raiment white as snow; coming down from heaven in connection with the earthquake, he rolled away the stone from the mouth of the tomb and sat on it.<a name=3:1></a> The keepers became as dead men, but the women who were there were told by the angel not to fear, and he sent them to the disciples to tell them about the Lord, that they would see Him in Galilee.<a name=3:2></a> And then he said, "Behold, I have told you".<a name=3:3></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:7">Matthew  28:7</a>.<a name=3:4></a> Thus the link with Galilee is very marked to the end in Matthew, and what enters into it is not only the reproach attached to it but the history attached to it -- their history with the Lord, involving that they were to be subject.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=3:6></a> Is your thought that there would be nothing of the subject character for Christ to be able to use as material in connection with administration, apart from this exercise?<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:8></a> I think that is the way it stands; the thought is that God meets evil on its own ground, as I may say, in an organised way; that is organisation under Christ, for all is to be subject to Him.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=3:10></a> "Behold, I have told you", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:7">Matthew  28:7</a> the angel says, and then we read that the disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them; I suppose that is the evidence of their subjection.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:12></a> Quite.<a name=3:13></a> And the women too had gone away immediately with the message, showing that they were obedient.<a name=3:14></a> "As they went", it says, Jesus Himself met them, as if to approve of their obedience, saying "All hail", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:9">Matthew  28:9</a> and then He confirms the message, but sending them to His <i>brethren</i>, the word 'brethren' displacing the word 'disciples' which the angel had used.<a name=3:15></a> They are to go to Galilee, and we read they went to Galilee, that is, there is subjection.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=3:17></a> "To the mountain which Jesus had appointed them".<a name=3:18></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:16">Matthew  28:16</a>.<a name=3:19></a> That would convey the thought of subjection, would it not?<a name=3:20></a>

		obedient and subject.<a name=4:1></a> That is how Matthew presents the fact of resurrection.<a name=4:2></a> The angel suggests the key to the passage; he is a divinely accredited representative, hence he says, "Behold, I have told you".<a name=4:3></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:7">Matthew  28:7</a>.<a name=4:4></a> He is a representative of divine authority.<a name=4:5></a>

		F.W.<a name=4:6></a> This journey in the Acts was in the other direction, from Olivet to Jerusalem, was it not?<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> It is founded on what we have been saying in regard to these men of Galilee.<a name=4:9></a> These heavenly speakers knew their history, and they say to them, "why stand ye gazing up into heaven?<a name=4:10></a>" They had had instruction already.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=4:12></a> The Galilean position must precede this.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> That is the order, so without any further word they entered into the city.<a name=4:15></a> "Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey".<a name=4:16></a> The angels said nothing about that; but these men knew what to do.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=4:18></a> Does this suggest spiritual movement on their part?<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:20></a> I think it does; only they were gazing into heaven when it was not a time for sight, for the faith period had begun.<a name=4:21></a> The heavens were opened to Stephen, but that was a spiritual matter; these men were looking with their naked eyes into heaven.<a name=4:22></a> They could see nothing because a cloud had received Him out of their <i>sight</i>, meaning that the <i>faith</i> period had begun; hence the word of the angels was to regulate them.<a name=4:23></a> They knew what to do; it says, "<i>then they returned</i>".<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=4:25></a> They moved by spiritual instinct apparently rather than by command as in Matthew.<a name=4:26></a>

		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> I thought so.<a name=5:2></a> What they found in the city represented what God intends to be in cities throughout the dispensation.<a name=5:3></a> What they found there was well worth the most careful consideration, that is, the upper room and its occupants.<a name=5:4></a> The upper room and its occupants stood in relation to the city.<a name=5:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:6></a> Is the holy city coming down out of heaven a witness to God's testimony?<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:8></a> Yes.<a name=5:9></a> The great thought of God is that there should be a city.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:11></a> So that the city is the full development of normal testimony; the full result of it.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:13></a> It is working up to that.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=5:15></a> Would you say that in the beginning of the epistle to the Corinthians the truth of the cross, and of the Spirit, and the thought of the assembly in a city are set out?<a name=5:16></a> Would Galilee suggest the thought of the cross -- reproach -- as in Matthew, and the mount of Olives in the beginning of the Acts suggest the Spirit?<a name=5:17></a> Would these lead to conditions with us in which we take our part in the assembly of God in a city?<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:19></a> I think so; reproach attaches to us whatever our city, known to ourselves and the Lord.<a name=5:20></a> The Galileans were under reproach, but then the mount of Olives suggests the power by which the dispensation is to be maintained, that is, by the Spirit.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=5:22></a> In what you have brought before us they become subject men; apart from subjection there can be no thought of truly representing God in a vessel.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:24></a> Just so.<a name=5:25></a> As subject we prove there is power enough in the Spirit.<a name=5:26></a> Olivet was near to Jerusalem; the suggestion is that the power by which things are to be maintained in the city is available.<a name=5:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=5:28></a> How do you apply the thought of the city and the upper chamber in our conditions today?<a name=5:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:1></a> The upper chamber is obviously not literal now but moral; it suggests moral elevation from the ordinary religious level.<a name=6:2></a> The latter is one of the greatest snares to us that there is -- conformity to current religious customs and practices.<a name=6:3></a> At the end of Luke the disciples were seen daily in the temple, praising and blessing God, that is to say, it is a question of witnessing to what Christ has effected, hence praising and blessing God.<a name=6:4></a> But the Acts contemplates the saints, not as God's witness to the remnant, but as the <i>assembly</i>, so that they acted instinctively in going to the upper room.<a name=6:5></a> It was suited; it says, not simply that they went to it, but that they went <i>up</i> to it; they knew what they were doing, and they knew that it meant exercise; they went up to it.<a name=6:6></a> One has to leave the level of man's religion, of current religious customs and practices.<a name=6:7></a> There is a great deal of that with us in the way of a mixture of religious sentiment, but going up to the upper room involves the leaving of all that behind, and you find the persons occupying it are such as represent God and the thoughts of God.<a name=6:8></a> They represent what will meet effectively the power of concentrated evil in cities.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=6:10></a> That is very beautiful because what marks cities in a general way is lawlessness and opposition to God, but in connection with a subdued people who have come under Christ in subjection, there would be a distinctive mark in testimony in the city.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:12></a> When they were come into the city they lost no time evidently, they went up to the upper room.<a name=6:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:25></a> It is the same thought carried through, with the addition that the Lord had something there at Damascus, and He knew what He had.<a name=7:26></a> He does not say, 'Go to the saints', He says, "go into the city", for He knew what He had there.<a name=7:27></a> It is a very striking passage, because it really emphasises what we are remarking, that the Lord would have His testimony in cities.<a name=7:28></a>

		You will find in these early books of the Old Testament, that is, in the typical books, that certain spiritual women are presented.<a name=21:2></a> This refers particularly to Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ruth and Samuel.<a name=21:3></a> They represent the work of God in the saints as a whole, developing into what are maternal feelings and affections.<a name=21:4></a> Indeed, all looks on to what God proposed to develop in our own time, which will soon be manifested in a concrete way, for God's operations must ultimately culminate in what is concrete in the most absolute way.<a name=21:5></a> We have to be content with light under certain circumstances and conditions, but what God has in His mind to effect is to be substantial in the most absolute way.<a name=21:6></a> This is seen in the measurement of the holy city, which is said to be the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=21:7></a> All these holy women point forward to this great result.<a name=21:8></a> In Joshua, as an illustration, what is presented are certain women who represent that which maintains what had already been introduced; they are Achsah and the daughters of Zelophehad.<a name=21:9></a> They represent that subjective feature that maintains what has already been introduced by God in power.<a name=21:10></a> The same feature appeared in the early part of Judges in one of the same women, Achsah, the daughter of Caleb.<a name=21:11></a>

		But what comes out in 1 Samuel is a series of crises.<a name=21:12></a> Some of these appear and are met by these women of whom I have read.<a name=21:13></a> It is not a question of prominent leaders who have their place, and who indeed are marked off in a most distinct manner in this very book; but what is in view in these passages is that which is within the range of the saints as a whole, whether few or many, or within the range of any one

		of us.<a name=22:1></a> It is a question of how to meet a crisis according to God.<a name=22:2></a> The history of God's people in the Old and New Testaments furnishes a long series of crises, some of them met according to God, some of them unmet.<a name=22:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I dwell on Hannah first, because she has a most distinct place in the book as a woman.<a name=22:4></a> What she represents, as I apprehend, is soul-history occasioned by the most excruciating rivalry.<a name=22:5></a> Who can stand before envy it is said.<a name=22:6></a> Her rival, Peninnah, Elkanah's other wife, was bitter in her opposition, and evidently without cause, for she had children, but she represents the flesh, especially as brought close to us.<a name=22:7></a> There is nothing more unreasonable than the flesh acting against what is spiritual.<a name=22:8></a> The Lord says, "They hated me without a cause", <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:25">John  15:25</a> it was gratuitous; there was nothing whatever in Christ to incite opposition under any circumstances, but the flesh is such that its opposition is most unreasonable.<a name=22:9></a> The Scriptures abound with evidences of this, so that we should not be discouraged in finding it so; we need not expect anything else.<a name=22:10></a> If the flesh be unjudged in any of us, we shall be not only unreasonable, but most refractory, most intractable and obdurate to all overtures, even the most reasonable.<a name=22:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was so here, and what made the opposition the more poignant was that it came out more particularly as they went up to the house of God.<a name=22:12></a> Why should Peninnah be so opposed to an inoffensive woman deprived of what her heart cherished?<a name=22:13></a> God had deprived her of it, why should she be the object of opposition and persecution?<a name=22:14></a> And yet as they went up to the house of God her rival persecuted her.<a name=22:15></a> There is not a word as to Hannah's retort, she makes no defence, but she felt the persecution most keenly; she was a woman "in bitterness of soul"; she was a woman of secret history with God.<a name=22:16></a> She was a wonderful saint in the making, one of the most remarkable
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=23>[Page 23]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in the scripture.<a name=23:1></a> The process was severe in the extreme, but it was all gone through with the knowledge of God; she said later in her song that He was "a God of knowledge".<a name=23:2></a> <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:3">1 Samuel  2:3</a>.<a name=23:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One might enumerate many things of which He is said to be the God.<a name=23:4></a> One of them is that He is a God of knowledge, and particularly as to what goes on in the hearts of believers -- "the heart-knowing God".<a name=23:5></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:8">Acts  15:8</a>.<a name=23:6></a> And so He weighs things.<a name=23:7></a> "By him", Hannah says, "actions are weighed".<a name=23:8></a> <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:3">1 Samuel  2:3</a>.<a name=23:9></a> He knew what went on in her lonely heart, what sorrow, and what a cup was hers!<a name=23:10></a> But it was a refining time, and it would culminate in a crisis being met in a most noble fashion in the end, in the current crying need being supplied in the most striking manner.<a name=23:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So one would invite your attention to this history, so that each of us might see that it is within our range to meet a crisis and to act in it for God and supply what may be lacking, so that the work of God should proceed, and all that is essential to it should be present.<a name=23:12></a> It is for each of us to determine what may be required in our respective spheres of responsibility.<a name=23:13></a> Let no one assume that he has none; all who do are morally worthless in this world.<a name=23:14></a> We are left here as responsible persons, and it is for us to determine in our respective spheres what is needed, and to see to it that at least we supply something in a positive way towards that need.<a name=23:15></a> No one is of any value unless he accepts responsibility, he has no moral value, but then evidently if I have nothing I can supply nothing.<a name=23:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Hannah, whatever her intelligence was, had one desire, she had one thought.<a name=23:17></a> It was a burning, persistent desire, for years ungratified, but one which had never waned.<a name=23:18></a> The fulfilment of that desire would fill a void in the most remarkable and effective way, and she kept to it.<a name=23:19></a> She kept to it in bitterness of soul and weeping, but persisting in what was right

		and legitimate, knowing that it would culminate in what was needed, in the supply of what was needed in the service of God.<a name=24:1></a> And so she makes a vow.<a name=24:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This came in the course of the exercise, not at the beginning.<a name=24:3></a> I have spoken of worthlessness in those who hold themselves irresponsible, and of worthlessness in those who have nothing.<a name=24:4></a> I now remark on the worthlessness of those who do not make a vow.<a name=24:5></a> What I mean is that many will own their responsibility but are wholly indifferent as to purpose, having neither definite resolve as to what is required in the service of God, nor resolve to meet it.<a name=24:6></a> Hannah makes a vow, and a vow is not to be recalled, for we are told elsewhere, "When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools:" <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#5:4">Ecclesiastes  5:4</a>.<a name=24:7></a> God looks for definiteness of purpose.<a name=24:8></a> And so in order to fulfil her vow she prays earnestly, for where can we get the means of doing things or of carrying out our purpose?<a name=24:9></a> Where is the power, beloved?<a name=24:10></a> We can only get it from God.<a name=24:11></a> He has the means by Him.<a name=24:12></a> Was Samuel an afterthought?<a name=24:13></a> Not at all.<a name=24:14></a> Samuel was in the mind of God long before he was in the mind of Hannah.<a name=24:15></a> How did the desire come into her mind?<a name=24:16></a> Why was all this sorrow, all this bitterness, all this rivalry, all this persecution?<a name=24:17></a> It was to emphasise in the heart of Hannah the desire for a son.<a name=24:18></a> The desire in God's heart was infinitely greater than in Hannah's heart; He needed Samuel far more than Hannah needed him.<a name=24:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us dwell, beloved, at our leisure on the place that Samuel has in the testimony of God, and we shall understand that he was no afterthought or accident.<a name=24:20></a> The thought was from the heart of God, it came into the heart of Hannah and the fulfilment of it was according to the mind of God.<a name=24:21></a> God would bring us through discipline, through persecution, and through suffering into such a state of soul that He can impart His own thoughts to us.<a name=24:22></a> We may not

		understand them, but there they are, they are given from God.<a name=25:1></a> Every right thought comes thence, no right thoughts are begotten in our own hearts, they come from God, He is the source of all that is good, of all that is blessed, of all that meets the need of His testimony here, and He it was who raised up Samuel.<a name=25:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But how blessed to be the vessel, as Hannah was, for the introduction of what is thus from God!<a name=25:3></a> As Mary, one so like her, said later, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word".<a name=25:4></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:38">Luke  1:38</a>.<a name=25:5></a> What absolute submission in a vessel for the bringing in of what meets the requirements of the testimony of God!<a name=25:6></a> The history is well known to us: Hannah needed a child and she got him.<a name=25:7></a> It was a man-child she wanted, a son, and she got him.<a name=25:8></a> She had to wait for him, like the patriarch earlier, for God would have us value what He brings in.<a name=25:9></a> We may not value or care properly for our own children.<a name=25:10></a> Mary and Joseph for instance, the most honoured of all parents, could even travel a day's journey and <i>think</i> He was in the company and He was not.<a name=25:11></a> One wonders at Mary in this incident in view of all she knew about Jesus, none amongst women or men knew more for the moment.<a name=25:12></a> What a history was hers as that blessed Babe grew up year after year under her care; what an experience was hers, unwritten, unknown to all but God and herself!<a name=25:13></a> Think of the ways of that Babe, and the movements of that Boy, that young Man, year after year!<a name=25:14></a> What an experience was hers!<a name=25:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence we see how Hannah had to wait.<a name=25:16></a> God would make us wait for things so that we may value them when they come, for they come from Him.<a name=25:17></a> Whatever comes in here in the testimony is from heaven; whatever route it takes it is from heaven.<a name=25:18></a> But God makes us wait for things; the more you have to wait for them, the more you value them and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=26>[Page 26]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the more they will be to you when you get them.<a name=26:1></a> You see in the progenitors of Abraham that a man lived thirty-five and forty years and then begat sons and daughters, but when we come to Abraham, he had to live to a hundred before he gets a son; God will have even the patriarch, the great father, value his son when he gets him.<a name=26:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Hannah had to wait, but now having got the desire of her heart she weans him; note, <i>she</i> does it.<a name=26:3></a> It is not even said of Sarah that she weaned Isaac, it is said that he <i>was</i> weaned, that is, it is a question of his own state not of her doing.<a name=26:4></a> But what is said here is that Hannah weans the child, meaning that she did not want to attach him to herself.<a name=26:5></a> Her thought was to detach him from herself and to attach him to God and the house of God.<a name=26:6></a> It is the giving over of things in self-sacrificing love; that is what it is, like God who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for us all, as we are told.<a name=26:7></a> And so Hannah does it, she detaches him, she weans him from depending upon herself in order that he should be handed over to God.<a name=26:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And she brings with her a fitting sacrifice, three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine.<a name=26:9></a> There is no want with her, no poverty of spirit; it is whole-hearted devotedness to meet the need.<a name=26:10></a> It is a crisis, and has to be met, and she meets it royally, for she has learned something from God, she has been with God, and she has acted like Him who spared not His own Son.<a name=26:11></a> As we know that we shall learn to give up, and give up what we cherish most, whatever it be; we shall give it up whole-heartedly, for God loves a cheerful giver.<a name=26:12></a> Hannah gave bountifully, too -- three bullocks, the meat-offering and the wine, all denoting a healthy flourishing spiritual state, a state that delights the heart of God.<a name=26:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says of Samuel, "the boy was young".<a name=26:14></a> Why should that be said?<a name=26:15></a> It is quite obvious that he was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		young, why then does the Spirit of God <i>say</i> he was young?<a name=27:1></a> To call attention to what is needful in such a crisis, not something old and worn out, not something sophisticated in the ways of this life, not that hard-hearted thing in us, the flesh, cultivated or sophisticated by experience, but something fresh and young that can take on impressions in the house of God.<a name=27:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I pass on to the next woman, the wife of Phinehas the priest, in chapter 4.<a name=27:3></a> I shall comment on her very briefly.<a name=27:4></a> It is another crisis; it is a question of the state of the nation, the state of the people.<a name=27:5></a> They had thought that external forms would suffice to meet the Philistine attack, but external forms have in themselves no power.<a name=27:6></a> We may have the right order, all that belongs to the breaking of bread, the Lord's supper, baptism, ministry, no lack of anything in the way of light as externally right, but that is not <i>power</i>.<a name=27:7></a> We need more than that for power to meet the Philistine attack.<a name=27:8></a> The ark of God had been taken by the Philistines, for it was detached from the state that was becoming to it.<a name=27:9></a> God would thus warn us as to reliance on mere light and external order.<a name=27:10></a> At this juncture a son is born, a notable event, but not a word of appreciation is spoken of him, and yet it was an auspicious event; but there was no power to take advantage of what God had done.<a name=27:11></a> There was a merely negative state, no power to regard or to say anything as to the son, save that she named him Ichabod.<a name=27:12></a> There is light negatively in the name, but that is not much to say; very many say it today, but have not a word to say about what <i>God</i> has done or is doing.<a name=27:13></a> What has God done?<a name=27:14></a> Ichabod, you say; yes, the glory has departed.<a name=27:15></a> But what was in the dying woman's mind?<a name=27:16></a> The ark of God; yes, but also her father-in-law and her husband -- a <i>mixed</i> state of things.<a name=27:17></a> It is not thus that a crisis is met.<a name=27:18></a> Here is a son that is from God, a son born; a life, as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is there not some possibility of glory in that son?<a name=28:2></a> You will observe that what I am dealing with is inability to take account of what there is of God.<a name=28:3></a> I have no doubt at all that Ichabod was rightly named, it was a proper name, but then it was purely negative.<a name=28:4></a> To say the glory is departing is a negative thing.<a name=28:5></a> What about that son born?<a name=28:6></a> Is that nothing?<a name=28:7></a> What I am occupied with now for the moment is that feature that shows itself in ability to take account of the <i>little life</i> there is; even a new-born babe is not to be ignored.<a name=28:8></a> May I not think of the possibility?<a name=28:9></a> The new-born, a man-child is something born into the world, are there no possibilities there?<a name=28:10></a> Certainly there are, and let us take account of them, however small the life may be.<a name=28:11></a> One regards this dying woman in her terrible circumstances, but she had only ability to say Ichabod, that is all, and that is not meeting the crisis.<a name=28:12></a> Can we think for a moment that God was indifferent to that crisis?<a name=28:13></a> Can we doubt for a moment that the birth of that man-child was an evidence of the power of God?<a name=28:14></a> Surely it was.<a name=28:15></a> However small things are, therefore, let us not be occupied with <i>departed</i> glory, but with the <i>coming</i> glory.<a name=28:16></a>

		The glory had not gone for ever; the God of glory had appeared to Abraham; would He give up His thoughts?<a name=28:17></a> Never!<a name=28:18></a> Why not think a little of the coming glory; indeed, it is a word for the present moment, it is the coming glory that is before us, as it is said elsewhere, "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former".<a name=28:19></a> <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:9">Haggai  2:9</a>.<a name=28:20></a> Let us think of that.<a name=28:21></a> I was remarking of Shem and Japheth that they went backwards with a garment to cover their father's nakedness, their faces were in another direction, they were not occupied with their father's shame, they were looking in another direction.<a name=28:22></a> That other

		Now Abigail is a bright finish to the subject in this book.<a name=29:3></a> I want to show you how nobly a crisis may be met where the features of the assembly appear, for that is what Abigail represents.<a name=29:4></a> She was a woman of a good understanding and of a beautiful countenance; a fine introduction!<a name=29:5></a> And you get that with other dear holy women, for God loves to introduce them in their best features.<a name=29:6></a> I think that with Hannah, for instance, the Spirit of God shows us the effect of her sorrow and the depths of her feelings of sorrow in her song in chapter 2.<a name=29:7></a> It is called 'a prayer of the celebration of the power of God'.<a name=29:8></a> And here you have the introduction of this remarkable woman by the Spirit of God as a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance.<a name=29:9></a>

		The thought of subjection is before me, and so I have liberty in calling attention to 1 Corinthians, which epistle is intended specifically to impress upon us the necessity of subjection to God and to Christ.<a name=48:1></a> It will be remembered that it is said that "the assembly is subjected to the Christ" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:24">Ephesians  5:24</a>, which passage refers to the mind of God for her; the work of God in her leads to that, but the mind of God is clear that she is subjected to Christ.<a name=48:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is thus purposed in the mind of God for the assembly is set out in the Lord Himself first, indeed, we may say that everything that God indicates as His mind for us is seen first in Christ.<a name=48:3></a> The types help us in this respect, as in others.<a name=48:4></a> The pattern of the tabernacle refers to Him; no one really could build the tabernacle, save Moses, for although he had specifications and delivered them to the people, yet he alone had seen the pattern of it; that is, he had an <i>impression</i> of it inwardly, as having seen it, so that while the specifications are given with the utmost detail, what he <i>saw</i> on the mount was the standard.<a name=48:5></a> What is seen, therefore, on the mount refers typically to Christ.<a name=48:6></a> What is presented to us by the inspired pens of the four evangelists -- men fitted for the work -- is ever to be in view in the epistles, so that what is indicated as the mind of God in regard to the assembly is to be traced for its perfection in Christ, for it is in Him you get the perfection.<a name=48:7></a> We get an allusion in this passage, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, not only to what was in Christ as here in the flesh, but to what is in Him, and what shall ever be in Him for ever, that is, <i>subjection</i>.<a name=48:8></a> Not, of course, that there was anything

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to think of what God's conception of man was and is, for after all Adam is but the figure of Him that was to come.<a name=49:2></a> Thus all that we get in the Old Testament relative to man, to his creation, and to the divine thoughts as to him, had in view what God had in His mind.<a name=49:3></a> It could never have been fully presented until the Son became man.<a name=49:4></a> There were indications of it in the figures and in the men of faith, but the men of faith did not refer back to Adam for their model.<a name=49:5></a> The glimmerings of what God had in His mind that came out in these men were the outcome of what God brought to their attention in the way of testimony.<a name=49:6></a> Not that they could have defined what came before them, but God in His wise ways brought to their attention certain things which elicited from them suggestions of Christ, and so we have inklings in the men of faith throughout the Old Testament of what God's mind was in regard of man.<a name=49:7></a> The Lord refers to Abraham as rejoicing to see His day, and he saw it, showing how God answered holy desires, and in answering them elicited from the men of faith that which suggests Christ as in His mind.<a name=49:8></a> We read of another "esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt".<a name=49:9></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:26">Hebrews  11:26</a>.<a name=49:10></a> That also arose from certain circumstances in the history of Moses, not that <i>he</i> would have named these things as representative of Christ, but the Spirit of God does.<a name=49:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were thus inklings, as I said, brought out, but all looking forward to what is in the mind of God being presented perfectly, not in type or shadow or even in substance partially as in the men of faith, but in <i>completeness;</i> for every feature of man as in the mind of God took form and manifested itself in

		It is striking that in this epistle, which is intended to enforce subjection, the <i>end</i> is referred to: "then cometh the end".<a name=51:4></a> The end with every one of us is that the completion of the principle of subjection is wrought out in us, for God can do nothing with us as instruments or vessels until that principle is made good in us.<a name=51:5></a> It is in a subject vessel that God works out His thoughts.<a name=51:6></a> We get the anointing, and then we get the ministry in this epistle, but there must be subjection, so that the apostle says, in coming to the subject of the Supper, "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread".<a name=51:7></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:23">1 Corinthians  11:23</a>.<a name=51:8></a> What he has received of the <i>Lord</i> is before us in the Supper.<a name=51:9></a> It was received of the Lord by Paul, and delivered to the Corinthians without any addition or innovation, and it is intended to convey the Lord's authority, and He will have subjection.<a name=51:10></a> Following upon that, we have the merging of the saints into one body by the Spirit.<a name=51:11></a> How are we merged?<a name=51:12></a> Only as we are subject.<a name=51:13></a> Apart from subjection, the Lord's supper must become a dead letter, and the truth of the assembly as the body of Christ is nothing but a mere theory apart from subjection, because we are all baptised in the power of one Spirit into one body.<a name=51:14></a> How could He merge me so that I am among them save as I am subject?<a name=51:15></a> However distinguished by gift or otherwise one may be, the principle of the baptism of the Spirit is merging, so that each finds his place in the body; and then it says we "have been all made to drink into one Spirit".<a name=51:16></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>.<a name=51:17></a> We are in the thing happily.<a name=51:18></a> If I have drunk into it, I am in

		And then there is the anointing.<a name=52:2></a> "So also is the Christ" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>; that is the order.<a name=52:3></a> Then in chapter 14 we have the brethren together in subjection; they are so together in spirit, and there is such fine sensitiveness, that if one is speaking and something is revealed to another sitting by, the one speaking discerns it.<a name=52:4></a> That fine sensibility all arises from subjection, each finding his place in the body by the Spirit, so that there is no room for the action of our wills.<a name=52:5></a> Think of reaching such a state of things among the brethren that the Spirit of God is free to reveal something to another, and the one speaking is conscious of it!<a name=52:6></a> What fine sensibilities these are!<a name=52:7></a>

		In chapter 15 the apostle finishes the subject of subjection by bringing in the Lord at the end -- what He is at the end.<a name=52:8></a> One might well ask what I am going to be at the end, for it is the end that counts, as has often been remarked.<a name=52:9></a> What about the Lord Jesus at the end?<a name=52:10></a> Think of all these centuries of service in effecting this subjection!<a name=52:11></a> Now what about Himself?<a name=52:12></a> He delivers up the kingdom to God, even the Father.<a name=52:13></a> How restful the heart is as one sees that handed back, without any addition, or subtraction, unalloyed in the least degree, handed back to Him who is God and Father!<a name=52:14></a> And "then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all".<a name=52:15></a> There will be the continuance throughout eternity of this great principle of subjection, and how important to be in accord with it now.<a name=52:16></a> The Lord would have us in accord now with what is going to remain permanently.<a name=52:17></a> The Son Himself exhibits in the most perfect manner the mediatorial place that He has taken; He is "subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all".<a name=52:18></a> We see how the divine thought is perpetuated eternally -- God and man having their respective

		Now I want to show you how Luke outlines this principle in certain women, because the female side in the Scriptures is in the main to bring out this principle of subjection.<a name=53:3></a> Not, of course, that it is limited to them, for it applies to us all, and works up to the assembly.<a name=53:4></a> The assembly is to be subjected to Christ, and Luke shows how the thing is worked out by presenting certain women as illustrative of it.<a name=53:5></a>

		The first great model is Mary, the Lord's mother, a young woman.<a name=53:6></a> What a perfect model she is for all young sisters and all young christians!<a name=53:7></a> for, as I said, the female side being introduced is only to emphasise the principle of subjection, for from the outset of creation the woman had that place.<a name=53:8></a> And so Mary represents the principle of subjection, hence she says, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word".<a name=53:9></a> How that should appeal to the young people, and to all of us!<a name=53:10></a> There was perfect submission and intelligence.<a name=53:11></a> She had an interview with one of the greatest dignitaries in the service of God in heaven, for we rarely get the name of an angel, but Gabriel is mentioned twice by name in this chapter.<a name=53:12></a> "In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth".<a name=53:13></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:26">Luke  1:26</a>.<a name=53:14></a> And he conversed with this young woman.<a name=53:15></a> She was greatly honoured and she knew it.<a name=53:16></a> Zacharias had been similarly honoured, but failed in it.<a name=53:17></a> The honour is not enough; the advantage is not enough.<a name=53:18></a> Zacharias had a conversation with the same Gabriel, and in surroundings that should have impressed him with the divine requirements, in the holy place, at the right side of the altar of incense, and yet he was unbelieving, and was made dumb.<a name=53:19></a> We are thus reminded of the solemnity of a divine overture when

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a lovely scene you get in the hill country!<a name=54:11></a> The hill country here refers to moral elevation, where the society of the people of God is found.<a name=54:12></a> We can picture to ourselves the delightful converse between these holy women, and so it is that subjection to the Lord is sure to be followed by an ascent.<a name=54:13></a> Mary was not looking for the society and companionship of this world; she sought the society that was becoming to her as thus honoured by divine communications, and so she salutes Elizabeth -- a fellow-subject of divine honour.<a name=54:14></a> All that follows only pictures to us what is within the reach of those who are subject to Christ -- that is, communications by the Spirit and a prophetic word.<a name=54:15></a>

		These passages in Romans show how christians come into the service of God in a practical way.<a name=61:4></a> The apostle, at the beginning, tells us that God was his witness whom he served in his spirit in the glad tidings of His Son, showing that it works out from the inner man.<a name=61:5></a> Service as in the hands of christians does not consist in mere outward forms; we begin with our spirits.<a name=61:6></a>

		Now, having thus brought to your attention this remarkable utterance of the Lord in this particular setting, I proceed to show how the scripture illustrates for us the way to it, that is to say, the <i>end</i> of the journey of faith.<a name=128:6></a> The house of God comes in on the way to it; it leads to it, for the house, although a provisional thing, is seen now in that which is eternal, that is, in the assembly.<a name=128:7></a> The house of God is that in which we are to learn now how to behave ourselves, as the scripture says; but then it is also "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>; that is another view.<a name=128:8></a> The one, as I understand it, is provisional, pending the restoration of Israel here, the other is eternal, for the assembly of the living God, as such, is not a temporary or provisional thing, it is a primary thought of God and therefore I connect it with "that world".<a name=128:9></a> Primary thoughts all stretch on to "that world", so that the assembly of the living God is for His use eternally.<a name=128:10></a> It came in in type before sin came in, and in purpose before the world, as Hebron did; they synchronise in that sense.<a name=128:11></a> Eve is the type of the assembly, which suggests that it was in the mind of God before sin was introduced, and that its life was to be out of death, that is to say, the idea of life out of death did not depend on the incoming of sin; it was in the mind of God before.<a name=128:12></a> Historically it became that, but God intimated in the plainest terms that He had before Him that kind of life, life out of death.<a name=128:13></a> It was not death as a penalty, but in the form of sleep -- a well-known term used later as covering death in the scripture.<a name=128:14></a> We have therefore the idea of the assembly in that life before sin came in; it was a divine thought, a primary thought.<a name=128:15></a>

		Not so with this remarkable believer, this type of a mighty man of spiritual energy; he recalls what his strength was forty-five years before.<a name=134:12></a> He was not neglectful to take his own measure.<a name=134:13></a> We should take our own measure; it is wise to do it, for we are to do things according to our measure -- "according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:3">Romans  12:3</a>, and Caleb knew his measure.<a name=134:14></a> He could recall what his strength was forty-five years before, and he says, "It is just as great today, I have lost nothing in regard of strength, in regard of energy".<a name=134:15></a> He had gained much, doubtless, in the way of intelligence and experience.<a name=134:16></a> Where was there another like him?<a name=134:17></a> He had lost nothing in strength.<a name=134:18></a> Old brothers and sisters, of course, have what we younger ones cannot have, that is, experience; but then the point that Caleb makes is not that; the point he makes is "strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in", <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#14:11">Joshua  14:11</a> and it was not in the least degree diminished.<a name=134:19></a> What a man he was!<a name=134:20></a> Is it written for our curiosity?<a name=134:21></a> No!<a name=134:22></a> It is to give a living picture of a spiritual man, for that is what Caleb was.<a name=134:23></a> The fulness of what is presented in him in type is, I believe, in that passage in Philippians where we have a man striving might and main, according to the power that God had given to him, to lay hold of the resurrection -- to "attain",

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Caleb goes over the ground with Joshua -- Joshua representing God here -- and calls attention to what he knew.<a name=135:2></a> He asks for the mountain, knowing full well the kind of inhabitants who were in it; but he was nothing daunted; he had power to overcome and to eject the enemy, for it is a question of enemies.<a name=135:3></a> If a graveyard existed at Hebron there was an enemy there; I mean, death was there, the power by which the family of God was held, but Caleb understood that there was power to overcome that.<a name=135:4></a> It is a question of the resurrection.<a name=135:5></a> Jacob did not have that exactly before him; I mean, he was not stressing that side, whereas Caleb does; he knows the enemy that is there and the power that is there.<a name=135:6></a> The more we are with God, the more we shall recognise the power that is against us.<a name=135:7></a> But then, beloved, "greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:4">1 John  4:4</a>.<a name=135:8></a> There is a means of reaching the resurrection from among the dead; as it is said, we are raised "through faith" -- what faith?<a name=135:9></a> The "faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=135:10></a> It is the same power that worketh in us.<a name=135:11></a> And then we are said to be quickened, so that we are made to live in our affections, and thus can enter on the realm of resurrection, "attaining", as it says, to the "resurrection from among the dead".<a name=135:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, that is what was set out in Caleb in type in the most striking way, and so while he asked for the mountain, nothing daunted, what is before the mind of the Spirit is Hebron.<a name=135:13></a> Hence it is said that "Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.<a name=135:14></a> Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb .<a name=135:15></a>.<a name=135:16></a>.<a name=135:17></a> because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel".<a name=135:18></a> <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#14:13">Joshua  14:13</a>,14.<a name=135:19></a> That is the mind of God.<a name=135:20></a> The mountain represents the power, but what is in the mind of God is Hebron, that is to.<a name=135:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the end, and so I would commend -- especially to the young -- first what Caleb was as a young man, how he had "another spirit", and understood thoroughly that God was able to eject the enemy and to put His people in possession; and then at the age of eighty-five his strength remained, his ardour remained, and his desire for the inheritance remained.<a name=136:13></a> It is not simply a question of the Lord coming to take us, many talk much about that, and read about it, and rightly so far, but they have not thought of laying hold of the thing in the power of the Spirit at the present time, for that is the point, and that is what Caleb represents to us.<a name=136:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=158:7></a> I alluded to Solomon's regime and how much is made of the food provision.<a name=158:8></a> The realm was divided up into twelve sections, each governed by a superintendent, and generally their names are hyphenated, implying sonship.<a name=158:9></a> That is to say, this relationship seems to mark the persons, "Ben-Hur, in mount Ephraim, Ben-Deker in Makaz", <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#4:8">1 Kings  4:8</a>,9 and so forth.<a name=158:10></a> That is, the idea of sonship is attached to each superintendent, and some of them were united in marriage to Solomon's daughters; they were linked in that way with Solomon's house, and there was to be no interference one with the other.<a name=158:11></a> The regulations seemed to be such that each superintendent looked after his own province, and all Israel dwelt safely, "eating and drinking and making merry".<a name=158:12></a> <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#4:20">1 Kings  4:20</a>.<a name=158:13></a> Then we are told what Solomon's provision was for one day, a most sumptuous bill of fare -- fine flour, meal and all kinds of animal food, including oxen and sheep, fallow-deer and fowl.<a name=158:14></a> It was certainly a very rich provision, and the setting of the scripture shows that it was due to those superintendents being over the realm, so that there was the greatest possible result.<a name=158:15></a> Irregularity in the thing would greatly minimise the product; I thought the Lord might help us on the line of co-ordination, that we might see that service involves maturity and known relationship with Christ, so that each knows what he has to do and does it.<a name=158:16></a>

		In reading these scriptures I have been thinking about <i>life</i>.<a name=172:1></a> 2 Corinthians speaks of it in a peculiar way, that is, in its workings in the ministers -- workings through sufferings.<a name=172:2></a> Note, too, life works not only in the person or persons experiencing the sufferings, but in the saints generally, showing how intimately bound up we are and how in the acceptance of suffering we gain the means of helping the saints -- a service which is within the reach of all.<a name=172:3></a> "Death works in us", the apostle says, "but life in you".<a name=172:4></a> His great thought was the manifestation of the life of Jesus, first in his body, meaning the vessel -- as he describes it earlier, the earthen vessel -- and then in his "mortal flesh".<a name=172:5></a> Life is manifested in these two ways, in the body that is in the vessel suggestive of a whole idea (it is worked out in the members, involving our intelligence and the use made of the members, underlying which is the teaching of Romans), and then in the "mortal flesh", that even that should be adorned by the manifestation of the life of Jesus.<a name=172:6></a> This is set down in this letter, so full of the apostle's personal affection for his brethren at Corinth -- another great feature.<a name=172:7></a> His heart was enlarged and his mouth was opened to them so that the life of Jesus should find a place amongst them.<a name=172:8></a>

		The book of Genesis, which has been singled out for many years past by leading opposers of the truth as an object of attack, develops what I have been speaking of -- the idea of life in its own order.<a name=173:11></a> Like all scripture that book was written for us, that is to say, for those who have the Spirit of God.<a name=173:12></a> Christians normally are never viewed as in the nursery.<a name=173:13></a> When, the fulness of time had come, the nursery stage had passed away.<a name=173:14></a> We have arrived at sonship.<a name=173:15></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4">Galatians  4</a>says, "That we might receive sonship.<a name=173:16></a> But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=173:17></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a>.<a name=173:18></a> Thus you have a people potentially matured, equal to understanding things as Christ understands them, for as we read, "we have the mind [the thinking faculty] of Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:16">1 Corinthians  2:16</a>.<a name=173:19></a> It is to such that the Scriptures are addressed.<a name=173:20></a> It was understood by the Old Testament writers that the things which they

		From these scriptures I hope to show something of the way of love, and in speaking of it I would point out that love is of God, and that the manifestation of it is mediatorial.<a name=182:1></a> That is, that while it has been manifested in Christ, and whilst He is personally God, a divine Person, yet He, as here, made it clear that love is "of God".<a name=182:2></a> John, who is employed by the Spirit to expatiate on this great subject, emphasises that it is of God.<a name=182:3></a> In chapter 4 of his first epistle, in which he enlarges upon it, a chapter of twenty-one verses, you will find the word 'God' no less than twenty-nine times.<a name=182:4></a> He says, "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us", the proof being that He sent His Son into the world "that we might live through him", and that He might be the "propitiation for our sins".<a name=182:5></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:10">1 John  4:10</a>.<a name=182:6></a> So that we have to look to the only-begotten Son here, as I said, as sent, or mediatorially, for the manifestation of that love, ever bearing in mind that the testimony is of God.<a name=182:7></a>

		There is also the love of Christ to the assembly which is peculiar to Himself, but I desire on this occasion to emphasise the way of love as finding its expression in One sent, in One here who was in obedience.<a name=182:8></a> I have therefore selected the passage from Numbers and the passage from 2 Corinthians, the first setting out in type in a most beautiful and striking manner love's way as in Christ; the second in a correspondingly beautiful manner, love's way in one of like passions as ourselves, so that it may not appear to be far away, but the rather brought near to us.<a name=182:9></a>

		The combination at Babel was intended to prevent such a way, such a manifestation of God.<a name=183:3></a> The line of blessing had already been introduced in Shem, and you will observe that the Spirit of God gives us his generation, both before and after this great historical event -- the effort to build Babel.<a name=183:4></a> He it was, as you will remember, who led in the hiding of his father's shame, for the divine way takes its course in the recognition of parental rights.<a name=183:5></a> In this he takes the lead with Japheth his brother.<a name=183:6></a> They take the upper garment, placing it upon their shoulders, and going backwards they cover their father's shame and nakedness.<a name=183:7></a> They went backwards, we read.<a name=183:8></a> It was a movement of parental respect, and, I may say, of affection.<a name=183:9></a> Their faces were in another direction, they were not occupied, or would not be occupied with their father's shame, that of which Ham spoke with no concern.<a name=183:10></a> Ham was indifferent and spoke without shame of the self-degradation of Noah, whereas Shem and Japheth took the upper garment and went backwards, their faces being in another direction.<a name=183:11></a> This action in due course God would respect in His government, for in their posterity they should see something blessed different from parental degradation.<a name=183:12></a> Hence we find that Shem is blessed by Jehovah -- the covenant name of God.<a name=183:13></a>

		I like to go back to Genesis, for the root of everything is there.<a name=187:8></a> I think of the appearing of the God of glory to Abraham the great father, and the descendant of Shem whose God was Jehovah, whose servant was to be Canaan.<a name=187:9></a> Canaan was cursed in order to make room for the line of purpose.<a name=187:10></a> Israel went into Canaan legitimately, it was not arbitrarily; it was according to the rights of love.<a name=187:11></a> The curse was there for hundreds and hundreds of years: "Cursed be Canaan".<a name=187:12></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:25">Genesis  9:25</a>.<a name=187:13></a> It is not Ham but <i>Canaan;</i> it is a question of the inheritance of God and room being made in it for His loved ones.<a name=187:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, having said all that, I want to come back to what I began with, and that is the way of love.<a name=187:15></a> You see how beautifully it is presented in the ark.<a name=187:16></a> The ark, as you will all know, is a symbol of Christ as the power of God, and the glory of God.<a name=187:17></a> "He delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:61">Psalm  78:61</a>; that is to say, it is a question of the power as subservient to the love.<a name=187:18></a> Love is behind everything in God and His ways.<a name=187:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, let us look at what love will do, so as to understand its way.<a name=187:20></a> The ark had been enthroned in the midst of the camp; it was to be carried by the levites -- by the Kohathites -- when in movement.<a name=187:21></a> Many of us like to be carried -- a service involving great energy and strength in others.<a name=187:22></a> It also involves love in them, and there is such a thing, thank God, as love in others, so that our burdens should be borne.<a name=187:23></a>

		That is <i>their</i> responsibility, but love's way is not to expect from others.<a name=188:1></a> Love's way is to lay aside one's dignity and take up the most menial, the most arduous, the most trying features of the service.<a name=188:2></a> Hence John says that "Jesus knowing .<a name=188:3></a>.<a name=188:4></a>.<a name=188:5></a> that he was come from God, and went to God .<a name=188:6></a>.<a name=188:7></a>.<a name=188:8></a> laid aside his garments" <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:3">John  13:3</a>,4; note, knowing that He came from God and was going to God, <i>laid aside</i>.<a name=188:9></a> It is all a question of God; God who has been manifested here mediatorially, that is, in One in the place of a servant.<a name=188:10></a> It is a question of God, that He may be known, and that thus the way of love may be known.<a name=188:11></a>

		And so what is emphasised is that the ark goes before on the three days' journey to find out a resting-place for Israel; it goes before, we are told, on the three days' journey.<a name=188:12></a> Every moment of those days you could see the ark going before.<a name=188:13></a> It does not say it was carried, though doubtless it was, but that is not the point; the point is <i>it</i> went before.<a name=188:14></a> <i>Jesus</i> was not carried.<a name=188:15></a> Mary anointed His feet six days before the passover.<a name=188:16></a> There were six days of travel yet ahead for those feet of love, and every inch of that way was travelled by the very feet of Jesus.<a name=188:17></a> He was not carried, He went His way; those feet of love trod every inch of that way.<a name=188:18></a> "If therefore ye seek me, let these go their way".<a name=188:19></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#18:8">John  18:8</a>.<a name=188:20></a> He would go that way; He went down into death to seek out a resting-place.<a name=188:21></a> It was the service of love.<a name=188:22></a> Think of the combination of satanic power that lay athwart that path!<a name=188:23></a> What will love do?<a name=188:24></a> "What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest?<a name=188:25></a>".<a name=188:26></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#114:5">Psalm  114:5</a>.<a name=188:27></a> It was in the presence of the Lord here, as I said, in mediatorial service.<a name=188:28></a> He came as the <i>sent One</i>, as representative of God, that God should be known, and that divine love should be known.<a name=188:29></a> That was the thought, that the saints should live in that love and respond to God in it.<a name=188:30></a> So Jordan fled; it was as the <i>feet</i> of the priests touched the waters.<a name=188:31></a> The type refers to the Lord's own feet, not to any feet

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful theme.<a name=189:4></a> God would impress upon us what love is, and what its way is, the way, as Paul says, of more "surpassing excellence".<a name=189:5></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:31">1 Corinthians  12:31</a>.<a name=189:6></a> So he sets out that way in these verses; "We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God".<a name=189:7></a> It is a question of God, but God as manifested in the life of Jesus; that life should be manifested first in the body, in a vessel, and then in a condition -- mortal flesh.<a name=189:8></a> There can be no question as to what Paul was; he was an earthen vessel and he was in mortal flesh, just what every one of us is, and yet the way of love shone through resplendently.<a name=189:9></a> The glory had shone into that heart, the glory of God in the face of Jesus, The God of glory had appeared to Abraham; now the glory of God in the face of Jesus had shone into that heart.<a name=189:10></a> He was persecuted and cast down, but his way was not entirely shut up.<a name=189:11></a> The enemy would shut it up, but it was never shut up, nor will it ever be.<a name=189:12></a> For any one who is the vessel of that love, the way will never be entirely shut up.<a name=189:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what was Paul's motive?<a name=189:14></a> The Corinthians.<a name=189:15></a> "Death worketh in us".<a name=189:16></a> That was love's way.<a name=189:17></a> Paul, as it were, had placed himself on the altar of God, and whatever the will of God was for him, he accepted it.<a name=189:18></a> The will of God was that he might be a vessel for the help of the Corinthians, refractory as they were, and though the more abundantly he loved them the less he was loved.<a name=189:19></a> But be it so, there he was, it was "death worketh in us, but life in you".<a name=189:20></a> It is a question of the saints; but then what about the vessel?<a name=189:21></a> The God who had raised up Jesus, he says,

		Now note the two expressions -- body and mortal flesh; first in his body.<a name=190:8></a> Every one of us has a body, it is a mortal one, but nevertheless a vessel, fragile indeed, and the more fragile the more the dependence upon God.<a name=190:9></a> "This treasure"; what is that treasure?<a name=190:10></a> The glory of God in His love shining in the face of Jesus, having shone into our hearts; that is the treasure.<a name=190:11></a> That must not be impaired in any way.<a name=190:12></a> Let the vessel be tossed about, it is under divine protection, the way is not entirely shut up; so that the life of Jesus is manifested in it, first in the mortal body, and then in the mortal flesh; that is to say, in my actual living condition every day, but all to the end that the saints should be benefited.<a name=190:13></a> Of what value am I to Christ in this world if the saints are not being benefited by me?<a name=190:14></a> Of what value is any one of us if we are not a benefit to the saints of God, those who are most precious to Christ?<a name=190:15></a> "As ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me".<a name=190:16></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:40">Matthew  25:40</a>.<a name=190:17></a> Hence the way of love is to be here on behalf of others.<a name=190:18></a> "Death worketh in us", but then the resurrection is the great end, the power of God taking us together and lifting us out of death, out of mortal conditions, raising us and making us like Christ altogether.<a name=190:19></a>

		I have in mind in reading these scriptures to point out that the end of our wonderful dispensation will be equal with its beginning, if not in quantity or extent, certainly in quality.<a name=192:4></a> We see the same thing in the end of the Old Testament.<a name=192:5></a> Certain features appeared which were particularly pleasing to God, of which He speaks more appreciatively perhaps than of any previous manifestation of His work, bringing in the suggestion of sonship.<a name=192:6></a> He says of certain ones who feared Him and who thought upon His name, and who spoke often one to another, that they should be His when He made up His jewels (that is, what is most precious, most valuable in His account); and He should spare them as a man spares his own son that serves him; <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:17">Malachi  3:17</a>.<a name=192:7></a> That was what was in His mind in calling Israel out of Egypt at the outset: "Let my son go that he may serve me", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:23">Exodus  4:23</a>.<a name=192:8></a> The end of that dispensation thus accorded with the beginning; and as the time of the Son whom He would call out of Egypt drew nigh, the remnant were putting on a character in agreement with His.<a name=192:9></a>

		And so I have selected this well-known passage in Revelation because it introduces David.<a name=192:10></a> David, I need not say, stands for much in Scripture; but he stands for what is best, and most spiritual, and most refined in the Old Testament, and thus in him we are reminded of quality.<a name=192:11></a> In him was developed that which would bring out the deepest and most refined spiritual feelings, whether of sorrow or of joy.<a name=192:12></a> He represents the great subject of music in the Old Testament which spiritually is calculated to appeal

	<div class="paragraph">
		to the deepest and most refined spiritual feelings of saints.<a name=193:1></a> It is therefore an important element in the Scriptures; whatever it may be in a literal sense, it undoubtedly is intended in the Scriptures to convey to us that which appeals to our deepest spiritual feelings, and these are intended to be for God.<a name=193:2></a> I need not say I am making no reference whatever to those natural feelings that are produced by the music of this world; I am speaking entirely of what is legitimate, what is of the Spirit, and what God seeks from us.<a name=193:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we are at once introduced to this subject in the history of David.<a name=193:4></a> The first commendation of him after he is anointed is that he was a musician; he could play well.<a name=193:5></a> I apprehend, therefore, that this is in view in the Lord's presentation of Himself to us in these last days.<a name=193:6></a> He says, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star".<a name=193:7></a> The assembly would understand as in the company of the Spirit -- for that is the viewpoint -- what these references imply; the root referring to Him as the divine source of all that is best and most delightful to God, and then the offspring -- that worked out in our Lord as Man in the most extraordinary variety of circumstances, particularly in suffering.<a name=193:8></a> The first refers to the gospel of John, with which the Holy Spirit would make us familiar, so as to fortify us against all attacks on the Lord's Person; the second refers to the gospel of Matthew.<a name=193:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		I hope to come back to this presently, but meantime, I wish to point out certain features in the ministry of David which I believe must be understood if these holy feelings, which go to make up that which God values most highly, are to appear in the people of God at the end.<a name=194:12></a> Of light, I need not say, we are not wanting, thank God!<a name=194:13></a> but light is not feeling, nor is it affection.<a name=194:14></a> David sets the way for us in both these respects.<a name=194:15></a> We see in him depth of feeling in suffering, corresponding with what is briefly touched on in the New Testament, for we must go to the Old for the detail; but we have touches in the antitype, as in our Lord saying, "Now is my soul troubled".<a name=194:16></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:27">John  12:27</a>.<a name=194:17></a> Think of the depths of feeling as He contemplated the cross!<a name=194:18></a> He says, "What shall I say?<a name=194:19></a> .<a name=194:20></a>.<a name=194:21></a>.<a name=194:22></a> Father, glorify thy name".<a name=194:23></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:28">John  12:28</a>.<a name=194:24></a> God values those statements.<a name=194:25></a> How much there was for the Father in those expressions!<a name=194:26></a> what depth of feeling in trouble in His beloved Son, who can say?<a name=194:27></a> In the midst of it He challenges Himself, as it were: "What shall I say?<a name=194:28></a>" -- a suggestion to be noted in having to say to God in our feelings.<a name=194:29></a> He immediately says, "Glorify thy name", and the answer from heaven was, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again".<a name=194:30></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:28">John  12:28</a>.<a name=194:31></a> But how much entered into the glorification of that name in the way of sorrow,

		We thus see how the Old Testament opens this up, expands it for us, enlarges upon it, and we find, as I said, this feature of music and song in David, who says of himself, "David, the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:1">2 Samuel  23:1</a>.<a name=195:9></a> These last words of David convey to us what his ministry was in this respect; and a most remarkable thing appears in him, the combination of military with the musical features.<a name=195:10></a> They must go together.<a name=195:11></a> If we are to reach the blend that God seeks in these last days, that refinement of feeling and affection which a bride suggests, as in the passage I read, we must understand the combination of the military and the musical features in David.<a name=195:12></a>

		And now what I would touch on briefly is the reference to garrisons in David's military undertakings.<a name=196:1></a> It will be recalled that he essayed to build a house.<a name=196:2></a> God accredits him with the motive, but reminds him that that was not within his province; that the builder of the house must be appointed by Him, and that he must be a son, and not only a son, but he must be God's Son.<a name=196:3></a> David humbly submits, and enters into the sanctuary of the Lord and sits down there before the Lord; <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:18">2 Samuel  7:18</a>.<a name=196:4></a> This is a very fine example, especially after correction, to enter into the house of Jehovah and to tarry there!<a name=196:5></a> You gather up impressions there as to what is in the mind of God, not only of what He says, but the whole atmosphere breathed in conveys impressions of the divine mind.<a name=196:6></a> As there, David says nothing about his building the house; he was now <i>adjusted</i> in this respect.<a name=196:7></a>

		<i>After this</i>, the scripture says, he subdues the Philistines (chapter 8); you see the relation of the house with the military service.<a name=196:8></a> You cannot have the house with the Philistines, for they stand in the way; they stand right athwart every divine operation, in so far as they may.<a name=196:9></a> And so we have a history of subjugations, of the most extraordinary military prowess in David, for <i>that</i> was his business, not building the house.<a name=196:10></a> At times he fulfilled it with remorseless severity, but he cleared the ground, and then we are told that he garrisoned Syria of Damascus, and Edom; <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#18:6">1 Chronicles  18:6</a>,13.<a name=196:11></a> These represent particularly dangerous elements, in which, although outwardly they may be subject, yet inwardly there is hereditary opposition to what is spiritual.<a name=196:12></a> Both Syria of Damascus and Edom refer, I repeat, to certain hereditary elements that are most dangerous, which although outwardly subdued, can be held in check only by a garrison.<a name=196:13></a> We can hope to be kept from these elements only by a garrison, that is to say, by a permanent

		And then, right through to the end of his career, we find attention to this particular service.<a name=197:3></a> I am not referring to certain failures; the point was clearing the ground, and the ground was cleared of the enemies referred to in an earlier chapter, and after doing so, he devoted himself to the service of the house.<a name=197:4></a> It is the end of the period.<a name=197:5></a> We are told in an earlier chapter (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#23:1">1 Chronicles  23:1</a>) that he was old and feeble, and that he appointed Solomon to be king; that is to say, you have the merging, in the most skilful and unselfish manner, on the part of this great servant of God, of all the experience which he had with the new order of things which was about to be inaugurated in the person of his son.<a name=197:6></a> His son was young and tender.<a name=197:7></a> Applying this to our dispensation, which is typified by David and his regime, it is not to die out in old age; that thought must be banished.<a name=197:8></a> It is the merging of all that experience may have acquired with that which is fresh and young and energetic.<a name=197:9></a> That is how the dispensation will end.<a name=197:10></a>

		And so you find in this chapter that "David and the captains of the host separated for the service those of the sons of Asaph and of Heman and of Jeduthun who were to prophesy with harps, and lutes, and cymbals".<a name=197:11></a> Thus the military are now engaged in the provision whereby the best feelings of Israel are to be secured for God.<a name=197:12></a> As a time of peace prevailed they were concerned that God should have His portion and that it should be of the very best.<a name=197:13></a> We shall be tested, I believe, in respect of what I am saying, because there is so much lightness and shallowness with us, but God is demanding the very best, and He is affording the facilities whereby that is to be secured.<a name=197:14></a> Of military activity, there has been much, and there will be.<a name=197:15></a> We need not hope for any lessening of the pressure; we have a wily foe to contend with, and as

		the days of the end draw near we may be sure of increasing effort.<a name=198:1></a> So you find the military captains of the host with David are concerned here about the number of the levites, for in David's regime everything is brought into order as things are handed over to Solomon.<a name=198:2></a> The wisdom and experience in David merge in the new order of things; that is to say, there is to be freshness, the vigour and energy of youth, and so "the Levites were numbered .<a name=198:3></a>.<a name=198:4></a>.<a name=198:5></a> and their number .<a name=198:6></a>.<a name=198:7></a>.<a name=198:8></a> <i>man by man</i>, was thirty and eight thousand", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#23:3">1 Chronicles  23:3</a>.<a name=198:9></a> That is an appeal to maturity, and development in the brethren, and each has his own value.<a name=198:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as to their work they are divided up, so many to preside over the work of the house of Jehovah, so many for the service of song, and so many to be doorkeepers; <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#23:4">1 Chronicles  23:4</a>,5.<a name=198:11></a> "Of these, twenty-four thousand were to preside over the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges; and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith".<a name=198:12></a> You will notice how the levites, that is to say, the saints viewed as servants, are engaged in bearing the burden of things; and this applies to every one of us, brothers and sisters alike, and it is worthy of note that the number of musicians was equal to the number of doorkeepers.<a name=198:13></a> I apprehend the allusion is to the exclusion now of all mere religious sentiment and feeling in the service of God.<a name=198:14></a> "The doors were shut .<a name=198:15></a>.<a name=198:16></a>.<a name=198:17></a> for fear of the Jews", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>.<a name=198:18></a> There is much of that kind of thing -- natural feelings, sentiment -- mingling with the Spirit, which is obnoxious, and the doorkeepers would shut it out.<a name=198:19></a> And you will see, moreover, throughout these chapters, the constant reference to the number twenty-four as well as to twelve, that is to say, David typically is dealing with the people of God as related to the testimony, and

		Now that is how the matter stands, and so in chapter 25 the military are brought into it -- "the captains of the host", showing that although in the field and exposed to the rigours of war, they have not lost the sense of what was due to God in His house; for the warriors and the levites are the same people in the antitype.<a name=199:8></a> And what I would say to young brothers and young sisters is this, "Thou therefore, my child .<a name=199:9></a>.<a name=199:10></a>.<a name=199:11></a> take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:1">2 Timothy  2:1</a> - 3; it does not say 'in fighting'; no, the point is suffering in warfare; take thy share in it.<a name=199:12></a> It is intended to give tone and lustre to us, not hardness, nor callous hearts which often mark soldiers, but tenderness and patience.<a name=199:13></a> "What sufferings happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:11">2 Timothy  3:11</a> said the great soldier and leader in conflict.<a name=199:14></a>

		These scriptures speak of singing, and I have read them in order to bring forward certain features of divine service associated with and expressed in song.<a name=216:1></a> So I take the passage in Hebrews as the end to be reached in what I have to say, the Lord Himself being presented there as the Singer.<a name=216:2></a> Little is said of Him as singing in the gospels, but we are not to conclude that He did not sing.<a name=216:3></a> We have indeed a notable instance of singing in which evidently He took part.<a name=216:4></a> After the institution of His supper, according to the records of Matthew and Mark, they sang a hymn, and went out to the mount of Olives.<a name=216:5></a> They went out on a note that was to be continued, the mount of Olives denoting that spiritual power and resource for the maintenance of the elevated note indicated in that song.<a name=216:6></a> The Holy Spirit being here, if it has not continued (and we know it has not), there is at least the possibility of recovery in that direction, so that the church should go out on the top-note, so to speak, and not as drooping.<a name=216:7></a>

		of His Person, So when He says, I am the root of David, the assembly understands; the allusion is to the gospel of John; but then He says, "the offspring of David".<a name=217:1></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>.<a name=217:2></a> All that which David sets out has its full, blessed and perfect fruition in Christ, and that includes the service of music, Thus Christ presents Himself to the assembly in a way calculated to draw out of her the best results of the Spirit's work; He appeals to that, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.<a name=217:3></a> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>,17.<a name=217:4></a> You can hear that invitation, I believe.<a name=217:5></a> The Holy Spirit has got the saints thus with Him, I know of nothing that one aims at more than that, to be with the Spirit in what He is doing and saying, and not in any way at cross-purposes with Him.<a name=217:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what the Lord is effecting.<a name=217:7></a> It has already happened; the Lord has addressed Himself to the assembly as the root of David and as the offspring of David -- John and Matthew -- and the assembly understands.<a name=217:8></a> John brings in the root, and it is being greatly emphasised in the ministry of the last days, and if John is understood, Matthew is understood.<a name=217:9></a> We arrive at the assembly; we arrive really at Matthew through John.<a name=217:10></a> Thus in principle at least the Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=217:11></a> The Lord thus addresses us; it is Himself, and there is no change with Him.<a name=217:12></a> What He was, He is; what He is, He shall be.<a name=217:13></a> "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven".<a name=217:14></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:11">Acts  1:11</a>.<a name=217:15></a> He was attractive, they looked after Him.<a name=217:16></a> Then two angels said to them, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?<a name=217:17></a>" So it is a question of turning back into the city, and going to the upper room, full of all the grace and attractiveness of Christ, waiting for the coming out of the same Person, "I Jesus" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>; as it says elsewhere, "The Lord himself with an assembling shout .<a name=217:18></a>.<a name=217:19></a>.<a name=217:20></a> shall descend from heaven" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:16">1 Thessalonians  4:16</a>.<a name=217:21></a>

		In the meanwhile, between His going and His coming, the assembly is developed.<a name=218:4></a> There is no development in <i>Him;</i> the assembly is brought to Him, as Rebecca was brought to Isaac.<a name=218:5></a> Meantime, there is that allusion, the Lord Jesus coming in and going out amongst us.<a name=218:6></a> Spiritually that goes on all the time, so that we are well acquainted with Him; He is no stranger, and; He sings in the assembly.<a name=218:7></a> He has a vessel here so in accord with Himself, so tuned, that He sings in the midst of it.<a name=218:8></a> "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".<a name=218:9></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>.<a name=218:10></a> That is the best.<a name=218:11></a> He has the saints so with Him that there in their midst He sings.<a name=218:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You can thus see the importance of song, and I want to show that it is within the reach of every one of us.<a name=218:13></a> So I come to David, because although there is so little said about the Lord singing in the New Testament, the Old Testament is full of it, and we have to read the Old Testament in the light of Christ.<a name=218:14></a> Hence when I speak of David I speak of him in the sense that he is a type of Christ.<a name=218:15></a> The Old Testament is full of references to singing, and as we have often remarked of Solomon, who is another type, his songs were a thousand and five.<a name=218:16></a> Is that mentioned simply to show that he was a mere rhymer, a man who wrote poetry off-hand?<a name=218:17></a> No; Scripture would pay no attention to such productions.<a name=218:18></a> There is a good deal of that kind of thing, but Solomon's songs are noted by the Spirit, and they are said to be a thousand and five.<a name=218:19></a>

		And so in the same chapter (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16">1 Samuel  16</a>) a young man tells Saul about David.<a name=222:26></a> Saul was told he needed such an one as that to keep away the Wicked spirit, so the young man said to Saul, "I have seen a son of Jesse [not <i>the</i> son of Jesse yet] who is skilful in playing".<a name=222:27></a> <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:18">1 Samuel  16:18</a>.<a name=222:28></a> He had noticed this, he had seen much

		Now I will give you an example: "David delivered first this psalm to give thanks to Jehovah through Asaph and his brethren".<a name=224:3></a> If you compare it, you will find that it is a selection from <i>several</i> psalms, as if David would say, I am so particular about this, that I must have the best for God.<a name=224:4></a> He delivers it to Asaph and his brethren; it is to go up familywise, that is to say, the affections of the family find an outlet in the skill of the musician.<a name=224:5></a> Hence in Hebrews He is not ashamed to call us brethren; then "in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".<a name=224:6></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>.<a name=224:7></a> The assembly contemplates skill, affection and intelligence; in it there is every feature needed for the outgoings to God of the best feelings of the family.<a name=224:8></a> Many do not go beyond the family, but you can never have what is suitable to God without the idea of the assembly.<a name=224:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look now at the composition of this first psalm, delivered to Asaph and his brethren.<a name=224:10></a> As I said, it is a selection from among the psalms, the part I read being from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105">Psalm  105</a>.<a name=224:11></a> I touch for a moment on the thoughts in the psalm.<a name=224:12></a> The thoughts are intended to appeal to our best feelings and affections.<a name=224:13></a> The covenant referred to is not the covenant made at Horeb, but the covenant that God made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob -- an everlasting covenant.<a name=224:14></a>

		THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#4:22">1 Kings  4:22</a> - 34
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was thinking of the greatness of Christ; His greatness in the sense in which it is available to His people.<a name=226:1></a> Bearing in mind that no one knows the Son but the Father, I desire to speak of Him as presented so as to be available to us; and for that reason I have selected Solomon in these verses as a type of Christ.<a name=226:2></a> What I would remark at the outset is that in dealing with types of Christ, if we are to profit, we have to dismiss from our minds what is literal, and think only of what is typified, and who is typified, otherwise we shall lose what is for us; we shall miss the substance, and what God intends for us is the substance and not the shadow.<a name=226:3></a> We cannot live on shadows.<a name=226:4></a> We must have the substance, and in order to have that we must learn to exclude from our minds the literal type, and occupy ourselves with what is typified, so that our souls may be nourished.<a name=226:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Solomon is peculiarly a type of Christ in His personal greatness and royal magnificence as available to us, and so we find his history from the outset, from his infancy.<a name=226:6></a> The Holy Spirit dwells on him as a babe, occupying us with what would come out in him; that is, there are prophetic indications as to what should develop in him from the very outset.<a name=226:7></a> The name given to him by his father and that given to him by Jehovah pointed to what should come out in him in due course, and that was cherished in the minds of those who had faith until the time of his entering on his service when all should be verified.<a name=226:8></a> A long period ensued, for there is little said of him after his birth until he is introduced to us in view of his immediate service; but enough was said at the outset to show that he would be a man of feeling, a man of affection.<a name=226:9></a>

		One of the first great evidences of this appears in the discerning by him of the mother of the child; he could discern the mother.<a name=227:1></a> What lay behind that was the exceptional parental care expended upon himself.<a name=227:2></a> He knew the tender touch of affection of his mother.<a name=227:3></a> He says of her that he was tender and beloved in her sight.<a name=227:4></a> Thus faith would be prepared for right feelings and sensibilities in him, and as these became needed, and they were needed in the history of God's people in a peculiar way, they were there so that he could tell who was the mother of the child.<a name=227:5></a> She would not have the child divided; she would at all costs, even to herself, let the child live.<a name=227:6></a> She indicates to us thus what is so needed amongst the saints of God, the resolve that at all costs the child should live -- truly the initial feature of a mother in Israel.<a name=227:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Solomon is later alluded to in Canticles as one whom his mother crowned in the day of his espousals, in the day of the gladness of his heart.<a name=227:8></a> <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#3:11">Song of Songs  3:11</a>.<a name=227:9></a> That thought therefore was well known to him -- the man of such a mother -- and he is sure to be a man of right feelings and sensibilities.<a name=227:10></a> Now you can see how this feeling so typified would show itself, as he had abundant opportunity and means to show what was in his heart.<a name=227:11></a> God gives us the opportunity and He prepares us for it, otherwise we should belie Him in what we do.<a name=227:12></a> The preparation must precede the opportunity.<a name=227:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you can see, dear brethren, how this, as I said, may be transferred -- it is indeed intended to present to us the Lord Jesus Christ as He is <i>now;</i> that is, Solomon typifies finality, for he presents Christ as expressing the final thought of God.<a name=227:14></a> You will remember how the staves of the ark as set in the house by him were seen without, reminding us that the divine end in the ark of the covenant had been reached, and in what followed we get the feelings of God expressed towards His people.<a name=227:15></a> You may recall

		how, that incident being recorded, Solomon turned his face to the people; <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#6:3">2 Chronicles  6:3</a>,4.<a name=228:1></a> It was a wonderful time, and it represents the present time, when a great system is set up in Christ, the great system known to faith, but which is real by the presence of the Spirit of God here on earth.<a name=228:2></a> So Solomon turned his face to the people -- a beautiful picture of Christ, who turns His face to us, and that face <i>remains</i> turned in this attitude.<a name=228:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we read that all Israel stood, and Solomon blessed the people.<a name=228:4></a> How God would appeal to His people at the present time as to what there is in the face of Christ as having accomplished everything for God!<a name=228:5></a> All was finished here in type, and the ark is set in its place and the staves are drawn out and now he blesses God and he turns his face to the people, and all Israel stood and he blesses them.<a name=228:6></a> The present time is one in which the face of Christ in all that it is, is turned towards us, and there is blessing in it.<a name=228:7></a> And as all Israel stood, so God would seek to get the attention of His people now, that they might stand at attention, as it were.<a name=228:8></a>

		Well now, the first great feature in these verses is <i>food</i>.<a name=228:9></a> This is always a matter of great importance, but it is seen here in a most striking manner, not simply the supply of it, but the quality of it, and note it was Solomon's provision "for one day".<a name=228:10></a> And see the richness of it -- "thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl".<a name=228:11></a> Now, beloved, what about this food?<a name=228:12></a> You see it is for one day.<a name=228:13></a> There is no suggestion of food being carried over for the next day, for we have living stock here; there is a fresh supply, for every day and it is of the very best quality.<a name=228:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now I pass on; but before doing so I would remind you that what I have been presenting corresponds with John's presentation of Christ.<a name=229:11></a> What you get with John in regard of food is the best, both in quality and in the preparation of it.<a name=229:12></a> In the last chapter of his gospel we have the Lord raising the question with Peter and his company who had gone fishing, "Have ye anything to eat?<a name=229:13></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:5">John  21:5</a>.<a name=229:14></a> They had nothing.<a name=229:15></a> In the end of Luke the Lord said, "Have ye anything <i>here</i> to eat?<a name=229:16></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:41">Luke  24:41</a>.<a name=229:17></a> That was a different matter; they had something, but in the time I am referring to they had nothing, and the Lord said, "Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find".<a name=229:18></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:6">John  21:6</a>.<a name=229:19></a> There is a right side and there is a left side, or rather, there is a right side and there is a wrong side.<a name=229:20></a> "Cast the net", He said, "at the right side of the ship and ye will find".<a name=229:21></a> And they found one hundred and fifty and three great fishes; you get not simply the number but the quality; they were <i>great</i>.<a name=229:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to speak of the <i>wisdom</i> of Solomon, another important feature in him.<a name=230:15></a> Indeed, it is that which marks him pre-eminently, that for which he prayed, and so he is in this sense a remarkable type of Christ as the wisdom of God.<a name=230:16></a> The Holy Spirit here enlarges on the fact that he was wiser than all men, and gives a list of the wisest of them, and then He goes on to tell us of the things he spoke about.<a name=230:17></a> You know, the present is a time of speaking; the Lord keeps on speaking.<a name=230:18></a> Here it is said that Solomon spoke three thousand proverbs and that his songs were a thousand and five, and that he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springeth out of the wall, he spoke also of cattle and of fowls and of creeping things and of fishes.<a name=230:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again I refer to John, who presents to us Christ in His greatness.<a name=231:7></a> He refers to things which Jesus did: He said that if they were written one by one not even the world itself would contain the books that should be written.<a name=231:8></a> And then His discourses, conversations, sayings, etc.<a name=231:9></a>; every word of Christ was precious -- pure gold.<a name=231:10></a> They are not all recorded, but we have enough recorded to indicate the character of His speaking, but think of what is not recorded and what He is speaking now.<a name=231:11></a> The Holy Spirit, He said to His disciples, should bring to their remembrance all things that He had said.<a name=231:12></a> Not a word would fall to the ground.<a name=231:13></a> If the words of Samuel did not fall to the ground, how much less the words of Jesus!<a name=231:14></a> And so you find three thousand proverbs.<a name=231:15></a> Do you think one of these proverbs was lost?<a name=231:16></a> The Holy Spirit knows how to carry forward and make effective in His own way every word of Christ.<a name=231:17></a> They are all for us, and how much we need proverbs.<a name=231:18></a> Proverbs are trite and wise sayings that are intended to fix themselves in our minds so that we might keep ourselves in the ways of righteousness.<a name=231:19></a> The opening of the book of Proverbs indicates what they mean, and the Holy Spirit brings every thought of Jesus, every word to the believer, hence it is not only what He has said, but what He is saying.<a name=231:20></a> He speaks through the Spirit now.<a name=231:21></a> "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith"; it is not what He said but what He <i>says</i>.<a name=231:22></a> He brings to us what is needed, and these proverbs are needed.<a name=231:23></a>

		Then, too, we read that he spake of <i>fowls</i>.<a name=234:17></a> There are clean and unclean fowl.<a name=234:18></a> The clean fowl in the type would represent a christian who is independent of the world; he loathes it and is independent of it as having the Spirit of God.<a name=234:19></a> An unclean fowl suggests a person who has this world's means and is thus independent; he is a man who holds his head high, being independent, and looks loftily because of what he has of this world's means.<a name=234:20></a> The income one has in the Spirit of God enables one to take heavenly ground, being superior to this world; but being thus great, he can go along with the lowly.<a name=234:21></a> He is not haughty.<a name=234:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to bring before you certain thoughts in regard to the government of God, first as to how it bears on the ministry or the testimony, and then secondly, how it bears on each of us individually as christians.<a name=236:1></a> The government of God cannot but further His interests; it can never be against His interests either in a general way or in the individual; it always culminates in advantage to the testimony and to His people.<a name=236:2></a> We find in the early part of Genesis when the enemy would centralise the whole race of mankind in the plain of Shinar, that God came down Himself to see what they were doing and building, and seeing what they had begun to do, He confounded their language and scattered the race abroad on the face of the whole earth.<a name=236:3></a> Then we find, having done that, He gives us a second time the genealogy of Shem, that is, the stem whence the testimony or the vessels of it should come, as if He were to say, Now I have dispersed the race over the face of the whole earth, I will bring in the line or family in which I intend to operate.<a name=236:4></a> In other words, He makes a way for the testimony when the enemy would have blotted it out.<a name=236:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This may serve to indicate what I have in my mind -- how God acts in favour of His testimony governmentally.<a name=236:6></a> He actually came down Himself to see what the children of men did, as if He would not judge at a distance but with first-hand evidence.<a name=236:7></a> Then followed the dispersion and the confounding of the languages -- barriers raised up between the nations, and these barriers remain.<a name=236:8></a> Moral walls between the nations are being built higher and higher, and we must not complain because of this.<a name=236:9></a> Divisions are in

		favour of the testimony.<a name=237:1></a> I do not, of course, mean division among the brethren; division among the brethren is another matter.<a name=237:2></a> What we have to dread is centralisation.<a name=237:3></a> We find throughout John's gospel an allusion to divisions among the Jews, and the more the better, for they were those who had become hostile and reprobate, and when it is a question of evil the less concentration the better, the more division the better.<a name=237:4></a> It is a way made for the testimony, for what God is doing.<a name=237:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the present moment comes in on that head, and so I have read these passages, the first as showing what the ministry was at the outset.<a name=237:6></a> It is well that we should compare what we have with what has been.<a name=237:7></a> It is wholesome.<a name=237:8></a> Of old in the days of Ezra the weeping and joy mingled, the weeping being occasioned by the comparison made between what was being built in that day of small things, and what had been in the days of Solomon.<a name=237:9></a> It is wholesome to mingle our tears and our joy; it balances us to remember what <i>has been</i> as compared with what <i>is</i>, and then God comes in and encourages us in regard to what <i>shall be</i>.<a name=237:10></a> What has been, as compared with what is, is discouraging, but perhaps I should not say discouraging, for it produces wholesome humility and sorrow; but the comparison of what is and what shall be induces joy, and God never fails to bring in that which induces joy where there is genuine sorrow, and where things are felt.<a name=237:11></a> He has great regard for those who feel things; the apostle says <i>of</i> Timothy, "who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:20">Philippians  2:20</a> and he says <i>to</i> him, "remembering thy tears".<a name=237:12></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:4">2 Timothy  1:4</a>.<a name=237:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has great regard for these things, and so He furnishes that which induces joy in bringing to our attention what shall be.<a name=237:14></a> Therefore in the minor prophets, that is, in Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, you have the announcement of what is coming in; in Haggai we read.<a name=237:15></a> "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former".<a name=237:16></a> <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:9">Haggai  2:9</a>.<a name=237:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And as I have said, it is well to compare the ministry and the outset, and I believe we cannot get a better example of it than in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>-- a chapter which records its introduction into the western world, into Europe.<a name=238:1></a> The testimony at that moment was under pressure -- great pressure!<a name=238:2></a> What may shine in prosperity may give way under pressure.<a name=238:3></a> It is when things are put to the test that their strength is brought to light.<a name=238:4></a> At times it may be latent and come to light, but With Paul the strength that marked him in his ministry was always there; he speaks of the tribulations he endured.<a name=238:5></a> It is a question of endurance, and so the Holy Spirit gives us at some length the details of his imprisonment with Silas at this juncture.<a name=238:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will observe how the national feeling arose at Philippi, "These men utterly trouble our city, being Jews, and announce customs which it is not lawful for us to receive nor practise, being Romans".<a name=238:7></a> I hardly know of anything more potent in that way than national prejudice.<a name=238:8></a> It was instanced on this occasion -- what <i>we</i> are and what <i>they</i> are -- a very ominous comparison!<a name=238:9></a> The apostle Paul addressing men would say that God made of one blood all nations that dwell upon the earth; here it is, we being Romans, they being Jews.<a name=238:10></a> They are troubling our city; it was a commercial matter.<a name=238:11></a> They were deprived of their gain, and they appealed to the national prejudice, a very common method of hostility, and the multitude was gathered against them.<a name=238:12></a> It was no small affair, an unusual movement was stirred up and so the crowd rose up, too.<a name=238:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God dwells on the severity of the treatment, the cruelty of it, so as to bring to light the character of the ministry, the joy of it, the power of it, and the superiority that shone in it.<a name=238:14></a> The matter is presented in full force to the magistrates, who strip and scourge the prisoners and they were

	<div class="paragraph">
		The prison, as I said, was turned into a sanctuary in which, resounded praise to God.<a name=239:8></a> That is the ministry at its height; and then the word to the jailor, as if to convey the character of the dispensation, was, "Do thyself no harm".<a name=239:9></a> He had done them harm, the magistrates had done them harm, the crowd had done <i>them</i> harm; but they said, "Do thyself no harm".<a name=239:10></a> What a reflection of God had come in in Christ through such ministers!<a name=239:11></a> They were thinking of others.<a name=239:12></a> No one is truly a minister of God who is thinking of himself, or of his own importance.<a name=239:13></a> To be thinking of others is the principle of true service, and here at the very height of physical pressure and suffering meted out to them by this very man -- the jailor -- Paul called out to him with a loud voice, "Do thyself no harm".<a name=239:14></a> It is the voice of the Spirit of God portraying for us the excellency of the ministers.<a name=239:15></a> In saying "Do thyself no harm", with a loud voice, how perfectly he was in accord with the precious

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Judges affords much instruction for the people of God at the present time, and not the least feature of it is that set out in these women of whom I have read.<a name=307:1></a> Women, in the sense of which I speak, usually represent the Spirit of Christ working in the saints, in the assembly or in the members of it, referring to the important necessity in us of subjection to Christ, without which we shall never correspond with the teaching set before us in them.<a name=307:2></a> It is said that "the assembly is subjected to the Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:24">Ephesians  5:24</a>.<a name=307:3></a> No doubt in a general way she is subject, but the force of the word in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>is that she is <i>subjected</i> to Christ, that is to say, it is a question of divine ordering and wisdom.<a name=307:4></a> Any deviation from that position is lawlessness, we are out of hand, so to speak, whereas God's thought is that we should be <i>in</i> hand, that is, under Christ's hand.<a name=307:5></a> Man's hand is so formed, as compared with other members of creation, that it suggests the power of wise manipulation, whether few or many be under it.<a name=307:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many are set under Christ, but He has power to manipulate them all wisely so that the greatest results accrue; but without subjection, as I said, this is impossible, so that no one need assume that he has part in the divine manipulation apart from subjection to Christ.<a name=307:7></a> Paul speaks of being "legitimately subject to Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:21">1 Corinthians  9:21</a> and so also as, already quoted, "the assembly is subjected to Christ".<a name=307:8></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:24">Ephesians  5:24</a>.<a name=307:9></a> With this in view we can understand and profit by the teaching relating to holy women of old, as the scripture regards them.<a name=307:10></a> There were holy men and holy women, all of whom were subject and available for divine uses, and what
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=308>[Page 308]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		comes out in the holy women is certain spiritual movements which portray features of the assembly.<a name=308:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I propose to dwell on these women in Judges, so that we may learn the point of view in that book, and how the light afforded there develops those features.<a name=308:2></a> The first is a well-known figure -- that is, Achsah.<a name=308:3></a> She also appears in the book of Joshua.<a name=308:4></a> She stands related to a well-known family, a family of faith, and so she fits in rightly in the body of the book of Joshua as illustrative of that which not only values the inheritance of God, but retains it in freshness.<a name=308:5></a> In the upper springs and the nether springs she had the power and resources to retain in freshness the inheritance of God.<a name=308:6></a> But she also fits in rightly in Judges because what stands by us in regard of the inheritance of God given us in love, also stands by us in regard of the testimony of God, especially in a dark day, in a day of rapid decline -- a decline culminating in disaster.<a name=308:7></a> The Spirit illustrates for us typically in these upper and nether springs not only what enables the well of water in us to spring up into everlasting life, but it enables us to enjoy the inheritance freshly.<a name=308:8></a> It is also the living water, the rivers of living water flowing out for others in testimony to a glorified Christ, as is the point of view in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>.<a name=308:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is this latter that I allude to in Judges, but particularly in the way of resources in view of contingencies.<a name=308:10></a> The young believer should understand that christianity involves resource, not only for the present, but in view of future contingencies.<a name=308:11></a> You will remember the parable of the ten virgins.<a name=308:12></a> They all bore that desirable designation, but only five of them were really entitled to it, and so when the test came, five of them were wanting in resources; they had no oil in their vessels.<a name=308:13></a> The midnight cry went out and they heard and moved, but they found no power; they had no oil.<a name=308:14></a> Let no one move or pretend to be in christianity without the Spirit, for sooner or later you

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		will be tested and will then realise to your sorrow that you are without spiritual resource.<a name=309:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Achsah represents one who had an eye to possible contingencies as well as present needs, and so she was not content with a certain inheritance, though it was a south land and thus favourable.<a name=309:2></a> What is offered to us in the gospel in an objective way is favourable, but we need more than that.<a name=309:3></a> And hence Achsah moved her husband to ask her father for springs of water, indeed she asked him herself; she understood the resources of her father -- what he could give.<a name=309:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful time, young people, a time of giving on God's part, as the Lord said to the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him".<a name=309:5></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:10">John  4:10</a>.<a name=309:6></a> It is the time of speaking to God, so that Moses in the second instance when the people needed water was told to <i>speak</i> to the rock.<a name=309:7></a> "Take the rod", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20:8">Numbers  20:8</a> the rod of priesthood.<a name=309:8></a> It was a time of life; the rod of Aaron had sprouted and borne almonds; life in perfect order had appeared.<a name=309:9></a> It was a time of life, and Moses is to take that rod and speak to the rock, but instead of doing that, although taking the rod according to commandment, he smites the rock with <i>his own</i> rod contrary to commandment, showing that on the one hand you may appear to be doing the will of God, keeping the commandment of God, whilst on the other hand you are denying His authority.<a name=309:10></a> It was a mixed state of things.<a name=309:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then besides that he called the people 'rebels'.<a name=309:12></a> It was the time of speaking, the time of asking, not the time of smiting.<a name=309:13></a> This is not the time of smiting; it is the time of speaking to God; His resources are boundless.<a name=309:14></a> It is therefore for us to see to it that we get what we need, and it is a great matter to know what we need.<a name=309:15></a> Above all things we need the Holy

		Spirit; we need that, and that is what God is giving.<a name=310:1></a> So that we are told here, he gave Achsah the upper and the nether springs.<a name=310:2></a> Thus you see how the position was fortified at the outset of this remarkable history; at the beginning of decline here we have the two persons united, Othniel the husband, and Achsah his wife.<a name=310:3></a> You can see therefore how they were fortified in divine resources.<a name=310:4></a> The world has resources, and so the first great domination in the book is from the world, from that point of view.<a name=310:5></a> It was the king of Mesopotamia, as you will observe in chapter 3.<a name=310:6></a> The people were sold into his hands under the government of God.<a name=310:7></a> Now this king alludes to resources, Mesopotamia being the land of "two rivers".<a name=310:8></a> The world, as I said, has its resources; there can be no doubt about that.<a name=310:9></a> The question is, How are we to meet these?<a name=310:10></a> and in Achsah we see how she anticipates the emergency.<a name=310:11></a> Her husband stands in the breach; he is qualified to meet this formidable power -- the world with its resources.<a name=310:12></a> Rivers, whilst I have no doubt referring to other things, refer to resourcefulness; without them no land can be productive to any general extent.<a name=310:13></a> They are the guarantee for resourcefulness; hence the king of Mesopotamia would rule the people on those lines, and that has to be met.<a name=310:14></a> The varying resources of the world must strike every observing christian; it is remarkable; it changes its colour and its character to combat what God is doing.<a name=310:15></a> That is unquestionable.<a name=310:16></a> But how is it to be met?<a name=310:17></a> The assembly is equipped with the means of overcoming, so that the king of Syria is overcome by Othniel, the husband of Achsah, and the land had rest forty years.<a name=310:18></a> He was one of the judges, indeed he was the first one; he was one to whom the Spirit comes; we read, "The Spirit of Jehovah was upon him", <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#3:10">Judges  3:10</a>.<a name=310:19></a> I need not say that it was no new thing for him,

	<div class="paragraph">
		for the Spirit of God to come mightily upon him, nor is it a strange experience for any christian who is accustomed to live in the Spirit and to walk in the Spirit, to have the Spirit come upon him in an exceptional manner.<a name=311:1></a> Is it not a matter of desire, dear brethren, to be available to God in emergencies, as accustomed to the Spirit of God, to the resources of God in the Spirit, so that He may come upon us mightily at any given time for the deliverance of His people?<a name=311:2></a> You can see the relation of this woman, therefore, to the first judge of Israel; it was a question of resourcefulness, and I can assure you dear young people that unless you make up your minds for this, to have resources in the Spirit, the king of Mesopotamia will overcome you.<a name=311:3></a> The world is full of resourcefulness appealing to you, and by which it may overcome you.<a name=311:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next woman is the well-known Deborah.<a name=311:5></a> I would she were better known as to her character and typical significance.<a name=311:6></a> What you will observe in her is that she was the wife of a man whose name Lapidoth signifies 'Light', but light is not enough.<a name=311:7></a> She had her own resources besides the light of her husband.<a name=311:8></a> The idea of Lapidoth may be extended beyond one's husband to the responsible element in the house of God, but however much light we have we cannot overcome these nine hundred chariots of Jabin, king of Canaan, by light only.<a name=311:9></a> Light is armour, and we are enjoined to have it on -- "the armour of light" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:12">Romans  13:12</a> -- but armour alone is not enough; we cannot hope to overcome by it.<a name=311:10></a> The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, is the added thing in Ephesians.<a name=311:11></a> The Spirit is living, positive power in the believer, power not only for defence but for attack.<a name=311:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Deborah was the wife of this man, it says.<a name=311:13></a> The original word for a prophetess really means 'a woman prophetess'.<a name=311:14></a> It is evidently to emphasise the thought that it was a woman; the idea is intensified.<a name=311:15></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=312>[Page 312]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At this juncture a woman is shining in the testimony of God, and what kind of a woman?<a name=312:1></a> A woman subject to Christ, so to speak.<a name=312:2></a> She is subject, for she says, "Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel <i>commanded</i>?<a name=312:3></a>" That was the point.<a name=312:4></a> It was a question of what God had commanded, not what she had devised in her own heart, not a mere overture of an ambitious woman to lead in military affairs.<a name=312:5></a> No; the Lord had commanded.<a name=312:6></a> It is a fine touch for all of us, for there is to be no move without the commandment, without the principle governing the position.<a name=312:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see what a woman she was; she dwelt under her own palm tree, "the palm tree of Deborah" -- not of Lapidoth.<a name=312:8></a> She is a person working out things for herself, which is right from the spiritual standpoint.<a name=312:9></a> No woman can rely on the faith or light of her husband, nor can the assembly do so either.<a name=312:10></a> She is to work out things by the Spirit.<a name=312:11></a> The Spirit is given to her as a dowry.<a name=312:12></a> Deborah had wrought things; she was a woman of moral weight; she judged Israel.<a name=312:13></a> She did not go out of her way to become conspicuous; she waited for them to come to her -- a comely attitude for a woman.<a name=312:14></a> The people came to her for judgment.<a name=312:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature in Deborah is that she is a woman of <i>feeling</i>.<a name=312:16></a> The assembly should be marked by feelings, I mean feelings corresponding with Christ, but womanly feelings.<a name=312:17></a> I refer to chapter 5; there Deborah is consciously a mother in Israel, "Until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel".<a name=312:18></a> <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#5:7">Judges  5:7</a>.<a name=312:19></a> It says, too, "Then sang Deborah".<a name=312:20></a> <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#5:1">Judges  5:1</a>.<a name=312:21></a> Singing is the outgoing of feelings, and it was her own composition.<a name=312:22></a> She is a woman full of feelings, full of the song of victory.<a name=312:23></a> It was victory given by God, and she expresses it in intelligent poetic feelings, in which she associates in the most unjealous manner another great woman, Jael, the wife of Heber:

		In reading these verses I am thinking of the coming of the Lord and of the features in His people that portend it, for it is in the saints that we must look for the evidences of its nearness.<a name=330:1></a> There are doubtless collateral happenings in the world which may be taken account of, but no evidences are as reliable as those to be discerned in the saints; indeed, all others are to be regarded in a very secondary way.<a name=330:2></a> We should expect if the Lord is about to come that there will be some inklings of it directly in those whom He loves, and particularly in those who, as having and keeping His commandments, show that they love Him; they are those in the place of friendship, and the Lord will not withhold what indications may be seemly.<a name=330:3></a> He must be the judge, as one has remarked elsewhere.<a name=330:4></a> It is as if a man of note and of large holdings were away from home and his return is left designedly uncertain; it is obvious that the inner circle, or family, will have whatever inklings there are of his return; it is not likely that occurrences on the farm or among the servants would be the first; the indications are obviously to be found in the inner circle.<a name=330:5></a>

		The government of God, is a very real thing and might be treated of extensively, but I allude to one thing, that is, the history of the assembly, what has come to publicly as about to bring down the severest judgments of God.<a name=332:1></a> The book of Revelation, and other parts of Scripture, teach us in the plainest manner what is coming in, and we cannot escape feeling this, but it will not overtake us, for we are to be kept out of it, according to the Lord's promise those who love Him: "I also will keep thee", He says, "out of the hour of trial", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>.<a name=332:2></a> But we are still in the conditions, outwardly, to which that applies, and from that point of view this subject of fear has a great place, especially as our Lord Himself sets us an example as coming in in exactly the same dispensational condition.<a name=332:3></a> He felt what was coming in on the favoured nation.<a name=332:4></a> We read of "strong crying and tears" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:7">Hebrews  5:7</a>, that is, at Gethsemane; in a special way, as facing the cross, the Lord felt what was coming; He entered into it as no one else could, and cried to Him who was able to save Him.<a name=332:5></a> What holy fear marked those moments!<a name=332:6></a> And we are told that He was heard because of that -- in that He feared; showing us how important this matter is, that we should rightly gauge what has come about in that in which we are publicly, because we are in it publicly.<a name=332:7></a> Whatever we may be privately, to which I need not refer, our position corresponds with His, and it is said that He was heard in that He feared.<a name=332:8></a> What a holy example, beloved brethren!<a name=332:9></a> And as one looks abroad today and considers how things are in the history of the assembly, it is of the very last importance that we should fear -- fear God.<a name=332:10></a>

		In these passages in Malachi we have the time of the remnant period in which this thing began to take effect: <i>"Then"</i>, we read, that is to, say, the Spirit calls attention to the time, and what began to show itself in the remnant.<a name=333:3></a> Men were saying hard things of God.<a name=333:4></a> It is vain to serve God, they said.<a name=333:5></a> "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another".<a name=333:6></a> It is a mark, you see, of the end, a sure sign that a change is coming about.<a name=333:7></a> You see, beloved brethren, how the features of the last days began to show themselves, not in an open intervention of God, but in a secret intervention, manifest in those in whom He wrought, for it was not a product of the flesh, I may say.<a name=333:8></a> The ministry of earlier days was being laid hold of -- the book of Proverbs.<a name=333:9></a> In that book we are told that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.<a name=333:10></a> Some of you may have noticed that whilst we have that thought frequently in Proverbs, in chapter 9 it <i>may</i> be rendered, "The fear of the Lord is the principle of wisdom".<a name=333:11></a> <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#9:10">Proverbs  9:10</a>.<a name=333:12></a> It may not have occurred to you that the fear of the Lord is so valuable an element.<a name=333:13></a> In fact it may not have come into your mind in this way as being a feature that marked Christ, and is enjoined upon those of us who are in the nearest place of privilege, upon those who invoke God as Father, so that it is a matter of immense gain, an asset in our experience.<a name=333:14></a> The very principle of wisdom is involved, And so these dear people coming in at the end of the old dispensation were undoubtedly gaining through the ministry of earlier days -- that the fear of the Lord, was a profitable thing, It is the principle, really of wisdom; and in their speaking together can we doubt that wisdom would take form and

		I do not enlarge on the passage in Malachi, so well-known and familiar to us, but it is very suggestive in regard of what I am saying, as marking a certain time, "Then"; and how the saints thus marked are regarded, what they are to God.<a name=335:5></a> Think of being pleasurable to the Lord, dear young people, in talking one to another, as fearing Him; of being a peculiar treasure unto Him, so that He spares us as a man spares his own son that serves him -- for it is a service!<a name=335:6></a> Much enters into it in regard of ourselves, I need not say, that is not noted here, but what is noted here is the delight that God has in those who serve Him thus.<a name=335:7></a>

		It is, I believe, a principle in many of the books of scripture that the women mentioned therein are intended to convey or represent the work of God -- the work of the Spirit in the way of affection, the men representing the intelligent or responsible feature of the formation in view.<a name=355:1></a> This in the Old Testament alludes particularly to the typical books, and in the New Testament to the gospels.<a name=355:2></a> I venture to carry the thought forward tonight into this book -- the Acts -- believing firmly that these women, particularly the three mentioned, set forth the work of God in the sense of being brought into correspondence with the light presented in the book.<a name=355:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the women mentioned in Luke, subjection is in view, and in those mentioned in John, the Spirit of God has spirituality in mind.<a name=355:4></a> Both features appear in the Acts, as we might expect, for there we get the culmination of all the features of the gospels, and so these women mentioned in chapter 1 may be taken to convey to us what may be gathered up in the gospels as the fruit of Christ's own handiwork.<a name=355:5></a> You all know how the cross and the morning of the resurrection were marked by the presence of devout women who followed Him from Galilee.<a name=355:6></a> From amongst them some stood by the cross of Jesus, and then others, notably Mary Magdalene, bore testimony to His triumph on the morning of the resurrection.<a name=355:7></a>

		and so I read in Canticles because we have there, in spirit, the experience of this by a believer, or, as I may say, by the assembly -- at least I am taking the liberty of taking the female speaker there to symbolise in some sense the assembly.<a name=381:1></a> She alludes, doubtless, to the coming remnant of Israel; but assembly features, up to a point, can be traced, and particularly what I am speaking of, the love of Christ.<a name=381:2></a> If I am awakened from death by the voice of the Son of God, I am awakened to live in that love which He so perfectly expressed in His own way.<a name=381:3></a> I begin to apprehend the greatness of the Person, as one who knew better than any what I am speaking of, says, "In that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God".<a name=381:4></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=381:5></a> That is the language of everyone who truly lives.<a name=381:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How much enters into that action of the angel!<a name=383:9></a> Peter here is a man of experience; he had had to do with the side of Christ; he saw that side, and understood, doubtless, what it meant.<a name=383:10></a> It is the way of love, and the way of love is to bring in the assembly; as Eve came out of the side of Adam, so the assembly comes out of Christ.<a name=383:11></a>

		The next action is, the chains fell off his hands; then the angel gives direction.<a name=383:12></a> How people in such circumstances need direction!<a name=383:13></a> It was not as with Paul and Silas, who in prison prayed and sang praises to God at midnight, and who gave direction to the jailer, and whose voices were heard by the prisoners as they listened.<a name=383:14></a> Here it is an unconscious prisoner, but heaven awakens him.<a name=383:15></a> It may be there is someone like that here.<a name=383:16></a> May heaven awaken you!<a name=383:17></a>

		Now you see, beloved brethren, that what I am getting at is that the cities of the nations are under the eye of God, every one of them.<a name=413:16></a> He is constantly bearing witness to them, and if I am resident in one of them, and desire to be in keeping with the mind of the Lord, I must recognise the place where I reside.<a name=413:17></a> Not to do so is to disregard the mind of the Lord.<a name=413:18></a> Oh, you say, but look at the confused conditions

		In directing Saul the Lord gave him no number of a house, no street, no locality.<a name=414:3></a> His word was simply, "Go into the city", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:6">Acts  9:6</a>.<a name=414:4></a> That, then, was the urgent obligation on Saul for the moment.<a name=414:5></a> To disregard it would be to disregard the commandment of the Lord, and to shut himself off from light and guidance.<a name=414:6></a> Within the city the Lord knows the streets better than the aldermen or the mayor do; He knows where His people are, where they reside, and the numbers of their houses.<a name=414:7></a> Accordingly He goes Himself to Ananias in Damascus, to prepare him to serve Saul according to His word.<a name=414:8></a> He directs him to a house in the street called Straight, and Ananias found that house and found Saul, and conveyed to him what the mind of God about him was.<a name=414:9></a> He told him how God had chosen him "to know his will, and to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:14">Acts  22:14</a>.<a name=414:10></a> I do not know anything more precious to the soul than the sense that God has chosen one.<a name=414:11></a> Aaron is said to have been the chosen of the Lord; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105:26">Psalm  105:26</a>.<a name=414:12></a>

		But I do not dwell on that now, but rather on the fact of Saul having been directed to go into the city.<a name=414:13></a> Would he ever forget that?<a name=414:14></a> It was light to him that he subsequently acted upon.<a name=414:15></a> Presently we find him telling how that in every city the Holy Spirit was witnessing to him that bonds and afflictions awaited him at Jerusalem.<a name=414:16></a> Note, "in every city".<a name=414:17></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:23">Acts  20:23</a>.<a name=414:18></a> How definitely he had carried forward in his mind what the Lord's specific directions to him implied, that the Lord would have witnesses in cities, that He would have assemblies in cities; and that those assemblies should be vessels for the Holy Spirit to speak His mind "in every city".<a name=414:19></a>

		This then is the mind of God.<a name=415:1></a> If men build cities, God sets His testimony in them, for grace reigns through righteousness.<a name=415:2></a> He would have not only the preaching of the gospel there, but that His <i>mind</i> should be given expression to there.<a name=415:3></a> How important then to recognise the city, if I am in one, so as to afford the Spirit of God the scope proper to Him in order that He may speak and the mind of God be thus conveyed.<a name=415:4></a> This is most practical; it is no mere theory.<a name=415:5></a> If there are two or three in a city who recognise the Spirit of God, there is room made for Him to speak, not only for the gospel to be preached, but for the mind of God to be conveyed, and that it may be owned that "God is indeed amongst you", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:25">1 Corinthians  14:25</a>.<a name=415:6></a>

		Well, this is what is within our range.<a name=415:7></a> It is a most important thing, and if I had the opportunity, I should like to convey what I am saying to every company of christians in every city throughout the world.<a name=415:8></a> The feature of the moment is the witnessing of God.<a name=415:9></a> If men congregate, God sets His testimony right down in their midst.<a name=415:10></a> In <i>principle</i> this must include every believer in the city.<a name=415:11></a> We cannot be in His testimony in a fragmentary way, but only as in keeping with the mind of God.<a name=415:12></a> In Antioch -- perhaps the most concrete example of this -- there were"in the assembly that was there" certain prophets and teachers, and as they ministered to the Lord and fasted, what is recorded is that "the Holy Spirit said", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:2">Acts  13:2</a>.<a name=415:13></a> The Holy Spirit was free to speak there, and one great feature of this dispensation of God is that He speaks.<a name=415:14></a> What a favour to be the mouthpiece for the Spirit of God!<a name=415:15></a> It is within these limits that the testimony is set; in saints doing His will, God speaks by the Holy Spirit.<a name=415:16></a>
