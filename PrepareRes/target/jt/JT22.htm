		J.T.<a name=1:5></a> A line of thought came before my mind that may commend itself.<a name=1:6></a> The Lord is seen praying frequently throughout Luke's gospel, and in looking into the subject it occurred to me that these instances have a constructive bearing, not in regard to His Person, but in regard to the <i>example</i> He sets, and the results that accrue from prayer as seen in these various instances.<a name=1:7></a> The consideration would enable us to touch on certain features of Luke's gospel that I think would prove helpful.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order that we may have the instances before us, the first is in chapter 3 -- His baptism, the second in chapter 5, the third in chapter 6, the fourth and fifth in chapter 9, the sixth in chapter 11, and the last in chapter 22.<a name=1:9></a> We may now take up chapters 3 and 5, and see how we get on.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose we have all been struck with the place that prayer has in Luke.<a name=1:11></a> The Lord is seen engaged in it in Luke more than in any of the other evangelists, and the book of Acts shows how the example set by the Lord in Luke is taken up by those who followed, particularly in the great vessel through whom the light of the gospel came to us Gentiles.<a name=1:12></a> The Lord's commendation at his conversion was, "Behold he prayeth".<a name=1:13></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:11">Acts  9:11</a>.<a name=1:14></a> He said this to Ananias.<a name=1:15></a> In order to bring the great value of prayer more closely to ourselves, the great work at Philippi, inaugurating the work of God in Europe began in prayer.<a name=1:16></a> Paul and Silas and those with them arriving at Philippi are found in connection with a few who prayed by a river:

		and later it says that as they went to prayer a damsel with a spirit of Python met them and would discredit what they were going on with by calling attention to them as "the servants of the most high God".<a name=2:1></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:17">Acts  16:17</a>.<a name=2:2></a> They were not engaged in that connection.<a name=2:3></a> They were about to introduce the gospel into Europe, and Satan would defeat this if possible.<a name=2:4></a> They are cast into prison, but are said to be engaged in prayer.<a name=2:5></a> Paul and Silas in praying praised God, and the prisoners heard them, and thus the work began.<a name=2:6></a> There can be no doubt that God intends to impress us all by that -- the need of prayer if the work is to be sustained -- if the testimony is to be sustained.<a name=2:7></a> So I thought if we looked at these two passages, perhaps the first would help us as to how the believer takes his place publicly with the people of God, because that is what we see here in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3">Luke  3</a>-- the entry, so to say, of one's way in connection with the testimony of God -- identification with His people.<a name=2:8></a> It says, "When all the people were baptised, it came to pass that Jesus also, being baptised".<a name=2:9></a> There is a word in it especially to young Christians, I believe, as to how they take up their place with the people of God.<a name=2:10></a>

		J.C.<a name=2:16></a>S.<a name=2:17></a> I think that is very good.<a name=2:18></a> The Lord Jesus here is introduced as the Pattern; and, as you said, the work with Paul and Silas was all the fruit of this Pattern.<a name=2:19></a>

		J.C.<a name=4:16></a>S.<a name=4:17></a> Heaven would not be really satisfied with other than a person who prays; that is, it is a praying person who draws out the approval of heaven.<a name=4:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:15></a> The service of adjustment is within the range of sisters.<a name=6:16></a> Anyone may humbly help one like Apollos.<a name=6:17></a> It will be observed that both Aquila and Priscilla had part in the service rendered to him.<a name=6:18></a> It was no question of preaching, nor was it a question of teaching exactly, but of unfolding the way of God more exactly.<a name=6:19></a> One who is on the way can show it.<a name=6:20></a>

		ADJUSTMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:1">Proverbs  25:1</a> - 13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in view on this occasion to speak a word in relation to adjustment.<a name=35:1></a> I have selected a passage from the book of Proverbs because it is intended for adjustment, to the end that there should be vessels of usefulness and of ornamentation.<a name=35:2></a> These are two features that mark the house of God.<a name=35:3></a> Those who are in it aright are at the same time ornamental and useful.<a name=35:4></a> The Son is over the house, as we read in Hebrews, and He is concerned that the house should be in every way according to God.<a name=35:5></a> To this end the process of adjustment continues with every one of us.<a name=35:6></a> God, having brought in a model in Christ, proposes that each one in the house should be brought into accord with that model; and so the Epistle to the Colossians in large measure corresponds with the book of Proverbs.<a name=35:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One feature in Colossians is adjustment; that is, everything is to be according to Christ.<a name=35:8></a> "As therefore ye have received the Christ", it says, "walk in him"; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:6">Colossians  2:6</a> and whatever is not in accord with Christ is to be rejected.<a name=35:9></a> That is the principle in Colossians, and we are told in that epistle that the Father "has delivered us from the authority of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:13">Colossians  1:13</a>.<a name=35:10></a> The book of Proverbs is the book of the Son of the Father's love.<a name=35:11></a> It is the book of Solomon's proverbs, and he is the son of David, we are told.<a name=35:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see, therefore, beloved brethren, that the adjustment is in the hands of One who will deal gently with us -- who will deal in affection with us, and yet with the utmost firmness and precision.<a name=35:13></a> For Solomon, who built the house, being imbued with the most extraordinary wisdom known up to that time,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=36>[Page 36]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		would of necessity act according to that wisdom in all his dealings, and so "the Father .<a name=36:1></a>.<a name=36:2></a>.<a name=36:3></a> has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love".<a name=36:4></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:13">Colossians  1:13</a>.<a name=36:5></a> Notice, it is not into the 'house' of the Son of His love, for we cannot be in the house save as we pass through the kingdom.<a name=36:6></a> It says, "who has delivered us from the authority of darkness".<a name=36:7></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:13">Colossians  1:13</a>.<a name=36:8></a> We need to come under another authority.<a name=36:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What exists abroad in what is called Christendom is the authority of darkness.<a name=36:10></a> That is to say, certain doctrines and systems have authority over men's minds and consciences by reason, in some instances, of their antiquity, and in others by reason of human greatness and learning.<a name=36:11></a> In every instance it is the authority of darkness.<a name=36:12></a> Men are held in it with a good conscience, for the reason that their consciences are darkened, and darkness has authority over them.<a name=36:13></a> Many of the Lord's dear people are held in that darkness, and what God is doing at the present time is delivering souls from the authority of darkness.<a name=36:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark that word 'authority', as it should be rendered.<a name=36:15></a> From whatever cause -- what power such a doctrine or system has over my conscience, and the more restful I am in it, the worse it is.<a name=36:16></a> Hence God moves -- the Father moves -- to deliver souls from the authority of darkness, and to translate us "into the kingdom of the Son of his love".<a name=36:17></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:13">Colossians  1:13</a>.<a name=36:18></a> Think of the difference, beloved, between the authority of darkness and the authority of the Son of the Father's love.<a name=36:19></a> Those of us who have come under the latter know the blessedness of it, that while the Lord is firm in His dealings with us, they are all the dealings of love -- they are the dealings of love combined with infinite wisdom.<a name=36:20></a> So that it is an immense thing for everyone, especially the young ones, to know that they are placed by the Father under the authority of the Son, for it is His kingdom.<a name=36:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, as I said, Solomon is a type of Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		as the Son of the Father's love.<a name=37:1></a> He is the most interesting babe in the Old Testament.<a name=37:2></a> His history is given to us from the very outset, so that we might have a full view of Christ, in type, as the Son of the Father's love.<a name=37:3></a> I do not know an expression that is, in a way, more interesting than that -- "the Son of the Father's love".<a name=37:4></a> John says, "We have contemplated his glory".<a name=37:5></a> "The Word", he says, "became flesh and dwelt among us".<a name=37:6></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>.<a name=37:7></a> One thinks with pleasure of the Lord, "The Word" as become flesh, moving about among men here upon earth.<a name=37:8></a> It is not that He visited among us, but He <i>dwelt</i> among us.<a name=37:9></a> He came within the range of men in that way -- into their houses, mingled in their families, dwelt as a neighbour, so that He might become known to men.<a name=37:10></a> Hence John says, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>.<a name=37:11></a> It is not <i>the</i> Father there.<a name=37:12></a> It is an only one with a father; a figure that is intelligible to everyone on the earth, as one may say, for who is it who has not some idea of an only one with his father?<a name=37:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John contemplated the Lord Jesus as dwelling amongst men as an only one with a father.<a name=37:14></a> Who can undertake to define the details on which that statement was based?<a name=37:15></a> But He was known to the apostles, beloved, in that way.<a name=37:16></a> He was known as an only one with a father.<a name=37:17></a> So in chapter 1 of Hebrews, where the glory of Christ is unfolded before us so that He might become the supreme object of our hearts, we are told that God said, "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:5">Hebrews  1:5</a>.<a name=37:18></a> This is a quotation, as I understand, from <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:14">2 Samuel  7:14</a>, enforced as it is in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89">Psalm  89</a>, showing that Solomon is to be taken as a type of the Lord Jesus as the Son of the Father's love.<a name=37:19></a> Throughout the book of Proverbs we have the rule of the Son of the Father's love.<a name=37:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, Solomon is the most interesting babe in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=38>[Page 38]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Old Testament.<a name=38:1></a> I do not wish to eclipse others, such as Isaac, but what you find is that when Solomon was born he received a name prophetically from Jehovah.<a name=38:2></a> He had the names of Solomon and Jedidiah at the same time.<a name=38:3></a> God Himself loved him, and he is nurtured in the light of what he was to Jehovah both by David and Bathsheba his mother.<a name=38:4></a> He was his father's son; as he says, "I was a son unto my father" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:3">Proverbs  4:3</a> -- that is a word for young believers.<a name=38:5></a> It is not simply that he <i>was</i> David's son, but he was a son <i>unto</i> him, which is a different idea.<a name=38:6></a> In contra-distinction to Absalom and others he grew up in his father's affections and his mother's affections.<a name=38:7></a> As he says, "Tender and an only one in the sight of my mother".<a name=38:8></a> <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:3">Proverbs  4:3</a>.<a name=38:9></a> So he is nurtured in tenderest affections in his father's house, and is qualified to address himself to all those that are transferred from the authority of darkness into the kingdom.<a name=38:10></a> Hence this book of the Proverbs.<a name=38:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having said all this to make the situation clear, I want to come to my subject, and that is -- adjustment.<a name=38:12></a> I use this word because it is a very forceful one -- an expressive one -- as applicable to every believer.<a name=38:13></a> I suppose there is not a believer in the whole world who does not even now need adjustment, and we need it in order that we should be on the one hand ornamental, and on the other useful.<a name=38:14></a> The word comes to us thus severally as to how much we ornament the house of God, and how far we are useful in it.<a name=38:15></a> For the idea of a vessel, as we get it here, is that it is to be useful, and we all know how vessels may be ornamental at the same time as being useful, and that is the divine intent.<a name=38:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea is that there should be a vessel for the refiner, and one covets the thought of it.<a name=38:17></a> The word is applied peculiarly to Paul.<a name=38:18></a> I think he stands out, after Christ, as the ideal of heaven as a vessel.<a name=38:19></a> The Lord said of him, "He is an elect vessel unto me".<a name=38:20></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>.<a name=38:21></a> What an immense thing that was!<a name=38:22></a> And then He
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=39>[Page 39]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		appointed him as a minister and a witness.<a name=39:1></a> I want you to note for a moment, beloved, the great thought the Lord had in that vessel.<a name=39:2></a> He appointed him a minister; that is, an official servant; not a slave, but one set up in dignity in service.<a name=39:3></a> And then He said further, "and a witness"; the two things go together.<a name=39:4></a> The idea of a witness is martyrdom, but service is carried out in authority.<a name=39:5></a> He is a vessel to be employed as a servant and a witness.<a name=39:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that I take it the apostle Paul is our model after Christ.<a name=39:7></a> He was called from heaven; the light shone round about him from heaven; he received his commission from heaven; and he said, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision".<a name=39:8></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:19">Acts  26:19</a>.<a name=39:9></a> He is here now in entire subjection to Christ, and in entire availability to Christ.<a name=39:10></a> He is for use -- he is "sanctified, and meet for the Master's use", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:21">2 Timothy  2:21</a>.<a name=39:11></a> Think, dear brethren, of what the Lord had in that vessel.<a name=39:12></a> One never tires of referring to Paul as a model in that way.<a name=39:13></a> Well now, this chapter, as you will observe, was transcribed by the men of Hezekiah.<a name=39:14></a> It begins the third division of the book of Proverbs, and incidentally calls attention to the great gain of research -- of diligence.<a name=39:15></a> These Proverbs had continued to exist in Israel for many years, and apparently no one obtained any good from them until the days of Hezekiah.<a name=39:16></a> I mention that because of the great importance of research -- of inquiry.<a name=39:17></a> The Lord says, "Search the Scriptures".<a name=39:18></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:39">John  5:39</a>.<a name=39:19></a> We cannot do without that.<a name=39:20></a> Every line of Scripture was inspired of God, and is profitable -- every Scripture; so that we cannot do without the Scriptures.<a name=39:21></a> It is not enough to know the Bible in all the versions; we have to "<i>search</i> the Scriptures".<a name=39:22></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:39">John  5:39</a>.<a name=39:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says, "the <i>men</i> of Hezekiah".<a name=39:24></a> That idea, I take it, corresponds with Solomon's times.<a name=39:25></a> "Happy are thy men", <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#10:8">1 Kings  10:8</a>, <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#9:7">2 Chronicles  9:7</a> the queen of Sheba said; and Hezekiah has men.<a name=39:26></a> It is a great thing to get hold of the idea

		of <i>men</i>.<a name=40:1></a> The epistle to the Corinthians is mainly to bring that about in the Corinthians.<a name=40:2></a> They were babes.<a name=40:3></a> He said he could not write unto them as unto perfect.<a name=40:4></a> He could speak among the perfect the hidden wisdom that God had before the world prepared for those that love Him.<a name=40:5></a> Babes, on account of their state, shut themselves off from the precious hidden wisdom of God.<a name=40:6></a> But Hezekiah has his men, and they transcribed the Proverbs that are recorded in this chapter.<a name=40:7></a> What a find it was in those days!<a name=40:8></a> for Hezekiah's days, as our own, were days in which adjustment was needed.<a name=40:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter opens up with the idea that God hides.<a name=40:10></a> "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing" -- a very remarkable fact to stand out.<a name=40:11></a> If it is the glory of God to hide a thing, then we may be sure there are things hidden which have to be sought out.<a name=40:12></a> For God, in the exigencies of His nature, values the things that He has; and He conceals them in order to disclose them to those who love Him.<a name=40:13></a> "God has revealed them unto us".<a name=40:14></a> "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a>.<a name=40:15></a> Hence He conceals things.<a name=40:16></a> I mention this because it stands out in the forefront of this great principle of adjustment that there are things that God hides.<a name=40:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "The honour of kings is to search out a matter".<a name=40:18></a> That is, what God, in the exigencies of His nature, may hide, Christ searches out officially.<a name=40:19></a> We have to take in the idea of His mediatorship, and one feature is that He searches out things for us.<a name=40:20></a> Solomon himself represents the principle of a king searching out; he had right-of-way everywhere.<a name=40:21></a> If Solomon needed to investigate anything in Beersheba he could do so; he was king.<a name=40:22></a> If he needed to investigate in Dan he could do so.<a name=40:23></a> The king has right-of-way.<a name=40:24></a> Thus the Lord Jesus, having gone on

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		high, is in a position to search out everything officially, and He does so in the gift of the Spirit.<a name=41:1></a> We have here the power of search: "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:10">1 Corinthians  2:10</a>.<a name=41:2></a> Think of what is within our range, dear brethren, on the principle of inquiry!<a name=41:3></a> As the men of Hezekiah transcribed these neglected Proverbs, so the inquiring believer, as having the Spirit, may reach the depths of God.<a name=41:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next great principle that confronts us here is that of <i>height</i>.<a name=41:5></a> It says, "The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable".<a name=41:6></a> You see, adjustment is not local merely; if I am to be adjusted I am standing in relation to the highest heights and the deepest depths.<a name=41:7></a> Think of the vastness of the divine thought, beloved!<a name=41:8></a> We are told that "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:10">Ephesians  4:10</a>.<a name=41:9></a> How far who can tell?<a name=41:10></a> But I am to be adjusted in relation to Christ in that position.<a name=41:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "The earth for depth".<a name=41:12></a> You might inquire, 'Is that the crust of the earth?<a name=41:13></a>' as geologists say.<a name=41:14></a> Which of the strata does that refer to?<a name=41:15></a> It refers to them all, and more.<a name=41:16></a> We are told that the Lord Jesus was three days and three nights -- not in the crust of the earth -- but in the <i>heart</i> of the earth.<a name=41:17></a> He could not go lower than that.<a name=41:18></a> "The earth for depth;" you say, 'Are you speaking geologically?<a name=41:19></a>' No, I am speaking spiritually.<a name=41:20></a> The Lord Jesus Christ went down -- He went down in love.<a name=41:21></a> As the thought of His descent enters into my soul it prepares me for the wonderful adjustment which God proposes.<a name=41:22></a> He lay three days and three nights in the <i>heart</i> of the earth.<a name=41:23></a> He went to the very lowest possible point in His love.<a name=41:24></a> Ephesians contemplates that, through ministry, we are to be brought "to know the breadth and length and depth and height".<a name=41:25></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:18">Ephesians  3:18</a>.<a name=41:26></a> Think of the depth!<a name=41:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would urge everyone here to look at this -- that

		your precious Saviour lay three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<a name=42:1></a> Would you not like to see where He lay?<a name=42:2></a> The angel said, "Come, see the place where the <i>Lord</i> lay", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:6">Matthew  28:6</a>.<a name=42:3></a> We have to take account of it spiritually.<a name=42:4></a> He went down to the lowest possible depth, and we are to know it.<a name=42:5></a> So we have "the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable"; as one may say, "The love of Christ which passeth knowledge".<a name=42:6></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:19">Ephesians  3:19</a>.<a name=42:7></a>

		The next thing, dear brethren, is, "Take away the dross from the silver".<a name=42:8></a> That is a process that we have to submit to.<a name=42:9></a> Young people especially are very slow to admit the presence of the dross, but it is there, and in a large measure.<a name=42:10></a> The silver is there, too, thank God.<a name=42:11></a> It is there in everyone that is "born again"; but the dross has to go.<a name=42:12></a> It may be an irksome experience, but the Lord loves us too well to allow that to stay.<a name=42:13></a> As you see it go, you see the wisdom of His love.<a name=42:14></a> He seeks to have a vessel, and so the dross has to be removed.<a name=42:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "Take away the wicked".<a name=42:16></a> There are those who allow the wicked in their communion.<a name=42:17></a> You cannot have anything suitable unless there is the principle of taking away the wicked.<a name=42:18></a> The fellowship of God's people repels the wicked.<a name=42:19></a> "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a>.<a name=42:20></a> It is obligatory on every company of Christians in the world to remove wickedness.<a name=42:21></a> It has to be dealt with authoritatively.<a name=42:22></a> It is a question of the king's authority, otherwise there is not establishment.<a name=42:23></a> Things were tottering at Corinth because the wicked was allowed.<a name=42:24></a> He had to be removed, and he was removed, thank God.<a name=42:25></a> Then the door was open for God to come in and open up His heart to them, as we see in the second letter to the saints there.<a name=42:26></a> It was only a little while ago that, on the ship on which I was sailing, there was celebrated what is known as Holy Communion at seven o'clock in the morning, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it goes on to speak of our relations one with another.<a name=43:5></a> It says in verse 6, "Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men".<a name=43:6></a> That is the next thing.<a name=43:7></a> This is a word to young men who would serve the Lord.<a name=43:8></a> May He add to their number!<a name=43:9></a> As Moses said, "Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:29">Numbers  11:29</a>.<a name=43:10></a> The need is great, but before we can serve we have to learn to take the low place.<a name=43:11></a> "Put not thyself forth in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men".<a name=43:12></a> That is a principle of adjustment that every young man aspiring to service should take special notice of, because the Lord is over the house, and your place in it must be determined by Him.<a name=43:13></a> True enough that your gift merits room for you; it does, but nevertheless your gift does not determine your place in the house; the Lord determines your place there.<a name=43:14></a> The Son is over the house, and He gives you your place.<a name=43:15></a> No right-minded person would wish it otherwise; you want everything regulated by the Lord.<a name=43:16></a> Hence it goes on to say, "for better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up higher, than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes see".<a name=43:17></a> There is a word; wait for that word from the Prince, "Come up higher".<a name=43:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as I said, it goes on to speak of our relations one with another.<a name=43:19></a> I must hasten through the following verse, "Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame".<a name=43:20></a> Here we have a word for everyone of us, for the tendency with us is to strive -- to contend for our points and our cause;

		Now, dear brethren, I have come to the end of what I call adjustment.<a name=44:14></a> We are set in relation with one another in the light and in the presence of supreme height and depth -- the love of Christ in the depth to which He went, and the height to which He has gone.<a name=44:15></a> We are in the presence of that wonderful love.<a name=44:16></a> We are adjusted in relation to all that; we regard each other in that light, and now we look for ornamentation.<a name=44:17></a> It says, "A word fitly spoken".<a name=44:18></a> How delightful to heaven it is that a company of God's people should be set down thus adjusted!<a name=44:19></a> Then, "a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver".<a name=44:20></a> How delightful to listen to a word like that!<a name=44:21></a> The house of God is ornamented by

		Then the next thing is, "as an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear".<a name=45:3></a> Under these conditions, dear brethren, we are allowed to listen to reproof.<a name=45:4></a> "Faithful are the wounds of a friend"; and heaven looks down as a brother seeks to gain his brother by reproof; and as that brother attends in subjection, it is like "an earring of gold".<a name=45:5></a> As one bends over humbly and in subjection to hear a wise reproof, it is "an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold".<a name=45:6></a> A wise man using his lips to convey a wise reproof, and an attentive ear receiving it, is likened to an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold in that way.<a name=45:7></a>

		Thus in these simple practical ways, dear brethren, the house of God is ornamented.<a name=45:8></a> Then in the next verse, which is the last one I intend to speak on, we have what accrues to God under these circumstances.<a name=45:9></a> It says, "As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him; for he refresheth the soul of his masters".<a name=45:10></a> In these simple ways we have the ornamentation of the house in vessels fitted for it, and then we have refreshment for the blessed God Himself in a messenger.<a name=45:11></a> The idea of a divine messenger is of immense importance, for it involves a question of trustworthiness.<a name=45:12></a> Is there one that God can entrust a message to?<a name=45:13></a> So a faithful messenger is like the cold of snow in harvest; he refreshes the soul of his masters.<a name=45:14></a> Notice the "masters".<a name=45:15></a> Philip had two.<a name=45:16></a> You will remember the angel sent him, and then the Spirit of God sends him.<a name=45:17></a> So that the position of a servant is that he has masters, and in faithfulness he is like snow in harvest time; he is refreshing.<a name=45:18></a> "He refresheth the soul of his masters".<a name=45:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=47:1></a> We might look at two passages -- one in chapter 9 and the other in chapter 11 of Luke.<a name=47:2></a> What has engaged us in our previous readings is that there is a constructive line of instruction in the instances in which the Lord is seen in prayer in this gospel.<a name=47:3></a> We have seen how at His baptism He is so engaged, and is approved of heaven, the Father's voice speaking to Him.<a name=47:4></a> Then in chapter 5, in the presence of need that had come into evidence from His fame, He retired, and was in desert places praying, so that the power of the Lord was there.<a name=47:5></a> The believer, in his progress, corresponds to that; but in seeing the need, his own need being met, turns to God, disallowing the flesh, which the desert places would suggest.<a name=47:6></a> Then in chapter 6 the Lord is seen praying for a whole night; not so much because need is immediately before Him, but because He would have workmen; as if to suggest that one cannot do all.<a name=47:7></a> So He names His apostles, and comes down to the plain with them to meet the need in the plain.<a name=47:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=67:1></a> I thought the Lord would be pleased to help us to see in these passages something of how life is developed, and how it appears collectively.<a name=67:2></a> It occurred to me that the passage in Judges affords the initial idea of collective life; that is, it is life out of death-not simply the light of life, but active life.<a name=67:3></a> Perhaps creation affords no better illustration of life in activity- than that of bees in the hive.<a name=67:4></a> The Spirit of God seems to employ these creatures to illustrate the energy of life in a company.<a name=67:5></a> We may see life illustrated otherwise, as it appears in an individual, but I think this type is life out of death seen properly in a company.<a name=67:6></a> It says, as "he returned to take her (his wife) he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion, and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion, and he took thereof in his hands and went .<a name=67:7></a>.<a name=67:8></a>.<a name=67:9></a>".<a name=67:10></a> We see there, I think, a type of the Lord appropriating the result of His death as it appeared in life.<a name=67:11></a> It is not the abstract idea of life, but the concrete idea.<a name=67:12></a> Thus it is a type of those who have come out of His death, being active in producing that which is acceptable to Him.<a name=67:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=83:1></a> There are some passages in 2 Kings that I believe the Lord would use to link on with what we have had in Luke.<a name=83:2></a> What we have had in the gospel of Luke in connection with prayer as seen in the Lord Jesus has in view that we should be witnesses.<a name=83:3></a> He said in the last chapter, "<i>Ye</i> are witnesses of these things", but they were to remain in the city.<a name=83:4></a> He said, "I send the promise of my Father upon you"; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:48">Luke  24:48</a> - 49 but they were to remain in the city until they should be clothed with power from on high; that is, the witnesses are to be clothed in heavenly power.<a name=83:5></a> Prayer is the secret of power, and it occurred to me that this book of 2 Kings fits in with that teaching.<a name=83:6></a> We see how Elisha clings to Elijah, Elijah emphasising that the Lord had sent him to different points.<a name=83:7></a> It begins with the statement that Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens by a whirlwind, and then it says, "Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.<a name=83:8></a> And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel.<a name=83:9></a> And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.<a name=83:10></a> So they went down to Bethel".<a name=83:11></a> Elijah lays stress on the Lord having sent him to the places mentioned; he was under divine control -- an important point for all of us, especially in connection with witnessing.<a name=83:12></a> The Lord emphasised in the prayer that we read this morning that it was to be the Father's will -- "Not my will, but thine", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:42">Luke  22:42</a> and Elijah here emphasises that point.<a name=83:13></a> He says, "Jehovah has sent me to Bethel", etc.<a name=83:14></a> But the exercise that comes out in Elisha is what underlies this dispensation: "As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee".<a name=83:15></a>

		In purposing to preach the gospel from these scriptures, I have in view, specially, young ones -- young men and young women.<a name=128:1></a> I have selected these scriptures because they refer to young people.<a name=128:2></a> In each of them a young man is mentioned.<a name=128:3></a> Young men are in great demand, and in no quarter are they in greater demand than in heaven.<a name=128:4></a> You will remember how the great vessel through whom the light of heaven came to us -- Paul -- is first introduced in the Scriptures as a young man.<a name=128:5></a> He is introduced as one who witnessed the death of the martyr Stephen.<a name=128:6></a> Not only was he a witness of that crime, but he was <i>consenting</i> to it.<a name=128:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>it is said, "the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul".<a name=128:8></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:58">Acts  7:58</a>.<a name=128:9></a> In the next chapter it is said that Saul was consenting to his death; and in speaking to King Agrippa later he admits fully that he held the clothes of those who killed the Lord's martyr Stephen.<a name=128:10></a> Then when any of the saints were arraigned for judgment he gave his "vote" against them.<a name=128:11></a>

		Such is the early introduction of the great vessel through whom the light of God came into the Gentile world, and I have no doubt that these facts are recorded in order that throughout the gospel period any young ones who may be opposed to the Lord -- and, as opposed to the Lord, opposed to His people -- may see that even for them salvation is available.<a name=128:12></a> Saul says he was an insolent, overbearing man; so that if there are any here who have been hitherto in any way opposed to the Lord and to His people there is salvation even for you.<a name=128:13></a> The Lord would say to you, as He said to that young man as he was found in bitter hostility to Him and to His people,

		I had in mind to speak about the life of Jesus, how it constitutes a testimony to God, what it was as in Him, and how it works out in us.<a name=139:3></a> For it is a divine thought that His life, so precious under God's eye, should not cease with the Lord's death.<a name=139:4></a> It was laid down, but it is to be continued, and was continued, so to speak, in Peter and John, who "stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:20">Acts  5:20</a> that is, the life which was in Jesus.<a name=139:5></a> I selected this passage in the Psalms as presenting Joseph to us, who, as we all know, is one of the most striking types of the Lord Jesus that the Old Testament affords.<a name=139:6></a> As he first appears at his birth, Jacob, his father, evidently recognised the light involved in his advent, so he set to work to prepare to move out of the land of Mesopotamia, and return to the land of his fathers -- to Canaan.<a name=139:7></a> We have, therefore, a clear intimation that Joseph typifies the Lord, for His coming into the world involved light for others.<a name=139:8></a> Even at His birth the shepherds who fed their flocks by night could see light, and so, as Jacob returns to Canaan and meets his brother, Esau, his wives and children were called to pass before Esau, and Joseph is placed before his mother; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#33:7">Genesis  33:7</a>.<a name=139:9></a> He passes before Esau and before his mother, a clear intimation again of a type of Christ, for, in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:11">Matthew  2:11</a>, the little Child is placed before His mother, "That in all things he might have the pre-eminence", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:18">Colossians  1:18</a> and even as to His mother, she has to take a second place to Christ.<a name=139:10></a> So, at the age of seventeen, Joseph is again before us as one who recoiled at the evil discourse of

		J.T.<a name=149:1></a> What has exercised one a good deal is that the dispensation is maintained in freshness by divine manifestations.<a name=149:2></a> Nothing is more essential than that we should be preserved in freshness, and one has had before him the appearings of the Lord.<a name=149:3></a> The divine intent obviously was that those active in the dispensation should know the Lord through personal contact.<a name=149:4></a> It was the divine intent that there should be personal representation here, for without personal representation of Christ -- that is, in those who know Him through intimacy -- we cannot have a general or corporate representation of Christ.<a name=149:5></a> So these appearings, as they are called, were intended to stamp the persons involved with the sense of who the Lord is, and what He is.<a name=149:6></a> This would work out in their ministry, in their influence, and in their example.<a name=149:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=149:10></a> Of course there were wonderful foreshadowings of the present time.<a name=149:11></a> We see particularly from Abraham onwards that Jehovah maintained a personal contact with those who were to represent Him.<a name=149:12></a> We have the statement, "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham".<a name=149:13></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:2">Acts  7:2</a>.<a name=149:14></a> Well, He intended in that appearing to impress him, and no doubt did impress him, but I apprehend that these appearings in the Old Testament were through angelic means.<a name=149:15></a> Although Jehovah Himself is said to have been there, as in the case of the appearing to Abraham in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18">Genesis  18</a>, yet the medium is, I judge, angelic.<a name=149:16></a> <i>Now</i> the appearings are in One who is Himself divine, so that in the period before He ascended, after He rose,

		It will be observed that in this passage a man's name is regarded as sufficient to remove reproach -- it is so regarded by seven women, these seven women representing a spirit of self-judgment.<a name=182:1></a> The previous chapter shows that the women of Jerusalem had so garbed themselves, had so adorned themselves with worldly equipment, that they were evidently under no reproach in <i>this</i> world.<a name=182:2></a> In verses 18 to 24 of chapter 3 it says, "In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the head-bands, and the tablets and the earrings, the rings, and nose-jewels, the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the glasses and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils".<a name=182:3></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#3:18">Isaiah  3:18</a> - 24.<a name=182:4></a> The possession of all these worldly ornamental things by the daughters of Jerusalem rendered them without reproach in the eyes of the world.<a name=182:5></a> But <i>these</i> seven women are not deceived by such outward show.<a name=182:6></a> They are consciously under reproach, and they see that the removal of this reproach lay in the <i>name</i> of a man.<a name=182:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I speak to those who are believers on the Lord Jesus, I need not enlarge on the suggestion that this one Man is no less than the Lord.<a name=182:8></a> For no one has a name in the whole universe of God sufficient to remove reproach from others save the Lord.<a name=182:9></a> He has a name -- God has given him one -- "A name which is above every name" -- which is given under heaven among men whereby they may be saved.<a name=182:10></a> <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:9">Philippians  2:9</a>.<a name=182:11></a> Hence the discernment of these seven women, who saw that reproach could only be removed and dignity assured

		J.T.<a name=210:1></a> It may be well that we should be reminded  that what engaged us yesterday evening -- following upon the previous reading -- was that there was this extraordinary appearing to John, and that it contemplates the great departure and failure of the professing body, and covers the whole history of that failure to the end.<a name=210:2></a> It also indicates recovery, so that the assembly is seen, in Philadelphia, as loved of the Lord; the end thus corresponding with the beginning.<a name=210:3></a> And then it was remarked that the epistle represented the mind of the Lord, as covering the successive stages of failure or recovery, and that the voice of the Spirit, what the Spirit 'says', would be the amplification of <i>that</i> in ministry.<a name=210:4></a> Hence everyone who has an ear to hear is called upon to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.<a name=210:5></a> The appeal to those who have ears to hear, as has often been noted, comes in in the first three assemblies before the word to the overcomer; in the last four it comes in after the word to the overcomer, meaning that, from Thyatira onwards, an ear to hear is contingent on the overcomer.<a name=210:6></a> The public body is no longer appealed to in this day; the appeal comes in after the promises made to the overcomer.<a name=210:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=211:6></a> Yes, just so.<a name=211:7></a> As it says, after chapter 2:24, the "rest", or remnant, who are in Thyatira, "as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden, but what ye have hold fast till I shall come".<a name=211:8></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:24">Revelation  2:24</a>,25.<a name=211:9></a> You see, the "rest" and the "you", and the "ye", refer, not to the public body, but to the remnant.<a name=211:10></a> So that He lightens the burden.<a name=211:11></a> He does not place assembly obligations on the remnant, He does not place on the remnant the obligation that rested on the assembly primarily; that is, of being a public witness, or candlestick; "I do not cast upon you any other burden, but what ye have hold fast till I shall come".<a name=211:12></a> That is another feature, I think, of our position, that the Lord is not putting anything upon us, but to hold fast what we have.<a name=211:13></a> He does not say to the remnant in Thyatira, "I have set before thee an opened door", because this remnant is not regarded as in assembly state.<a name=211:14></a> They simply are said not to have the doctrine of Jezebel, and not to have known the depths of Satan.<a name=211:15></a> They were clean to that extent.<a name=211:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=211:19></a> Well, the position of a remnant, I think, is the one which we should take up.<a name=211:20></a> That is the basis of our position.<a name=211:21></a> The address to Thyatira contemplates the rights of the Son of God.<a name=211:22></a> The Babylonish system contemplated in that address -- Jezebel -- interferes

		with the rights of the Son of God in the house, because another has taken His place as over the house.<a name=212:1></a> That is the position the Pope assumes; he is over the house, he is over the assembly, and it is a direct denial of the place of the Son of God.<a name=212:2></a> The Son of God is over the house of God, and no one else can have that place, so that His eyes are as a flame of fire, and He speaks of doing certain things, acting directly against Jezebel; "behold I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation".<a name=212:3></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:22">Revelation  2:22</a>.<a name=212:4></a> That, I think, is done now; He has done that, so that there is something definitely fixed in regard of her -- judicially fixed -- "She will not repent", He says, so that there is no hope at all of any recovery there; we have the Lord's definite word that she will not repent.<a name=212:5></a>

		God, Himself, gives us a lead as to the idea of a memorial as early as in chapter 9 of the book of Genesis.<a name=227:4></a> He set in the cloud His bow, that which was to be visible in every clime.<a name=227:5></a> It was intended to be a memorial.<a name=227:6></a> So that God thus gives us a lead, which should be observable by all in the matter of this memorial.<a name=227:7></a> He said that when He looked at the bow He would remember His covenant.<a name=227:8></a> How many times He has looked at it, who can say?<a name=227:9></a> But the continuance of the seasons, the stability of the order of things which He inaugurated after the deluge, is a constant reminder to us that He has never forgotten to look at that bow.<a name=227:10></a> If men's hearts, as the apostle said at Lystra, are filled "with food and gladness", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:17">Acts  14:17</a> it is but a testimony to God's constant recognition of what that bow signifies -- that there should be the continuance of the seasons, summer and winter, cold and heat, seed time and harvest.<a name=227:11></a> The continuance of the race on the earth was dependent on God's recognition of that memorial, and at the present time we have a tangible evidence in our very bodies sustained by the fruit of the earth, that God has never forgotten

		Well now, I want to go to Matthew just for a moment, because you have in Matthew and in Mark another memorial besides the one of which I have read in 1 Corinthians.<a name=228:7></a> In Matthew you have the Lord enjoining that, wherever the glad tidings should be preached, what the woman had done who had anointed His head for His burial should be spoken of for a memorial of her.<a name=228:8></a> Mark also relates the same incident, saying that the Lord said of her, "She hath done what she could".<a name=228:9></a> <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:8">Mark  14:8</a>.<a name=228:10></a> She had anointed His body, and wherever the gospel was preached what she did would be spoken of for a memorial of her.<a name=228:11></a> I want to dwell on these two gospels in this respect for a moment, so that young ones here particularly -- and all of us -- may understand how this memorial, of which Matthew and Mark speak, bears on the memorial of which the apostle speaks in 1 Corinthians and of which Luke, confirming Paul, speaks in his gospel narrative.<a name=228:12></a> For Luke only of all the evangelists speaks of this memorial of Christ.<a name=228:13></a> Matthew does not say

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak of Matthew and Mark so that all of us, particularly young ones, here, may understand the bearing of this woman's act on the Lord's supper.<a name=229:4></a> I was saying the apostle had the memorial from heaven, so that as he went out into the Gentile world, and preached Christ, and men and women were converted and drawn together, as at Corinth, into an assembly, he would mention what this woman did for a memorial of her.<a name=229:5></a> I can understand some young one inquiring why she should be remembered.<a name=229:6></a> Why should it not have been Mary of Bethany as <i>John</i> represents her?<a name=229:7></a> Why should it not have been John the evangelist, who was specially loved of Christ?<a name=229:8></a> Why should it not have been Mary Magdalene, who was at the grave?<a name=229:9></a> Well, the answer to me is simple -- that what this woman did, as recorded in Matthew and Mark, involves the principles that are to govern us, as we sit down and partake of the Lord's supper.<a name=229:10></a> The anointing in Matthew signifies that the anointer appreciated the One whom she anointed as presented in that gospel.<a name=229:11></a> In anointing Him she spoke loudly.<a name=229:12></a> If you were to introduce to her the most revered dignitary in Christendom today she would give no ear to him; she would have no place in her mind for what he would have to say; she would say, 'I learn everything from Christ'.<a name=229:13></a> If I am to be governed, if I am to have part in the assembly, I am to be governed only by the principles that <i>He</i> laid down, and I have no ear whatever for any other principles, however plausible they may seem to be -- however necessary it may appear that there should

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I recognise that Christ has foreseen the whole history of the assembly, and He has provided for its government under all conditions and circumstances.<a name=230:3></a> And then, again, if I look at her in Mark, and someone comes to her of high repute, as a minister of religion in the world, and says to her, "Ministry should be under authority, it should be regulated by responsible persons; a minister should have the education of a university or a seminary; he should be a theological student" -- what would this woman say to him, or anyone, like her, who has come to recognise the Lord Jesus as set out in the gospel of Mark?<a name=230:4></a> She would turn a deaf ear to him; she would say, "My Lord and Master has laid down principles in that book for every Levite, and unless you are governed by those principles I have no ear for you".<a name=230:5></a> You see what a revolution this woman would make in modern Christendom were she heard -- were her example followed -- and how she would keep out from the circle of the saints all human principles and innovations by adhering to the principles laid down by the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=230:6></a> Hence, as Paul preached at Corinth, he would mention, according to the Lord's injunction, what this woman had done for a memorial of her.<a name=230:7></a> Indeed, he was himself, in his ways and actions and words at Corinth, the embodiment of this woman.<a name=230:8></a> His epistles show that he refuses at every point human innovations in the government of the assembly, and in the levitical service.<a name=230:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Matthew and Mark have to be taken into account by young Christians, as well as by all of us, if we are to have intelligent part in this memorial of which Luke speaks in his gospel, and of which the apostle Paul speaks in the passage I read.<a name=230:10></a> We have to see what this woman did, and we have to emulate

		Having said that much, I may proceed to say a word as to this memorial, and I wanted to show how it had been anticipated in the Old Testament, and incidentally to call attention to the importance of Christians reading the Old Testament, because you find in the Old Testament amplifications and details of great truths, which the New Testament does not contain.<a name=231:7></a> I may further add the great importance of becoming familiar with Scripture; for as, in this instance, and in all others, in order to be intelligent, we have to understand Scripture.<a name=231:8></a> Every scripture, as we are told, is inspired of God, and is profitable for doctrine and for reproof, and for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work.<a name=231:9></a> Hence the importance of the Scriptures, and so the Lord in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>, when He came into the gathered company, as you will recall, says, "It is I myself".<a name=231:10></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:39">Luke  24:39</a>.<a name=231:11></a> He is never represented <i>in</i> the assembly by an angel.<a name=231:12></a> The angel represents distance in that sense, -- He comes into the assembly Himself.<a name=231:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as in the assembly, He opens the Scriptures, and from the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms, on the road to Emmaus, He expounds to them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning Himself.<a name=231:14></a> How that should appeal to our hearts!<a name=231:15></a>

		Now, in view of this terrible fact, which none of us should ignore, the importance of the testimony of Jesus is evident; that we should have in our souls, dear brethren, a right conception of the Man -- as it is said here -- the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=237:8></a> As He was about to die, you will recall, Pilate brought Him forth, and called attention to Him, as if, under God, the Man

		So the testimony of Scripture is before one this afternoon as regards the Man.<a name=238:10></a> It is laid upon my heart, because of the importance of having clearly in our souls a conception of Him, in view of the awful revelation that is about to be made of the man of sin, so that we may not be deceived in any sense, for we are told that the second beast had two horns, as a lamb.<a name=238:11></a> That is, there shall be an imitation of Christ; Satan's great weapon to oppose the truth <i>is imitation</i>.<a name=238:12></a> As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so today Satan is withstanding the truth of the Person of Jesus by imitation.<a name=238:13></a> It is seen everywhere at the present time, and it is about to culminate in the second beast, who is said to have two horns, as a lamb.<a name=238:14></a> Think for a moment of the audacity of the enemy in imitating the Man of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>, "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:7">Isaiah  53:7</a>.<a name=238:15></a>

		Such is the testimony of prophecy, beloved friends, in regard to this Man, and I dwell for a moment on the preaching of Him as we get it in Philip.<a name=239:4></a> You will remember that Philip in Samaria preached "the Christ" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:5">Acts  8:5</a> -- one who does everything for God and for man; but then he is directed to go into the desert, and in the desert he meets the Ethiopian -- he is definitely called an Ethiopian -- who was returning from Jerusalem, and who was reading, we are told, from the prophet Esaias.<a name=239:5></a> He was reading the testimony of Jesus.<a name=239:6></a> And it says Philip began at the same scripture, that is <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>, and announced unto him Jesus.<a name=239:7></a> The Man Christ Jesus, you see, has reference to the Ethiopian as He has to the European or the Asiatic.<a name=239:8></a> Under divine direction, undoubtedly, this Ethiopian was reading the prophet Isaiah -- and that remarkable chapter, which is above all others the testimony of Jesus.<a name=239:9></a> The Man whom God approves of, the Man whom God has set over all, the Head of every man now, is the One of whom that chapter speaks.<a name=239:10></a> "Philip", it says, "preached unto him Jesus".<a name=239:11></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:35">Acts  8:35</a>.<a name=239:12></a> The Ethiopian believed the testimony of Jesus.<a name=239:13></a> I wonder if we have all believed that testimony?<a name=239:14></a> The eunuch believed, and Jesus became the object of his affections.<a name=239:15></a> That is what I want to get before us, beloved friends, that we may so apprehend the Man that He shall control our affections and our lives; otherwise we are sure to come under the influence, in one way or another, of the man that is about to be revealed, the features of whom, as I said, already exist.<a name=239:16></a> So the eunuch says, "Here is water".<a name=239:17></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:36">Acts  8:36</a>.<a name=239:18></a> You see where Christ has entrance into the heart there is no deferring of identification with Him.<a name=239:19></a>

		Let us not defer for a moment complete identification with this Man; as was said to Rebecca, "Wilt thou go with this man?<a name=240:1></a>" The eunuch had no hesitation; he says, "Here is water" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:36">Acts  8:36</a> -- a most remarkable thing in the desert, but you may be sure that where God is working there will be all the requisites of complete identification with Christ.<a name=240:2></a> The water was there.<a name=240:3></a> "Here is water", he says; "what doth hinder me to be baptised?<a name=240:4></a>" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:36">Acts  8:36</a>.<a name=240:5></a> And they went down -- Philip and the eunuch -- into the water together.<a name=240:6></a> That is, there was in Philip the spirit of the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=240:7></a> He would not stand on the dry land, and see his brother go into the water.<a name=240:8></a> He would go into the water with him.<a name=240:9></a> What a spectacle for heaven to see those two dear men, one a black man and the other an Asiatic, standing together in the water!<a name=240:10></a> And Philip baptised him, and we are told the eunuch went on his way rejoicing, and Philip was caught away by the Spirit of God, and was found at Azotus.<a name=240:11></a> You may say, "Why did not Philip stay with him and teach him; or why did he not direct him back to Jerusalem, so that he might be instructed by the apostles?<a name=240:12></a>" No, the Man Christ Jesus has universal power.<a name=240:13></a> He can direct, and teach, and preserve a man in Ethiopia, as if that man were in Jerusalem.<a name=240:14></a> I speak thus for the encouragement of individuals here who may have anxiety as to the future.<a name=240:15></a> If you commit yourself to Christ, you need have no anxiety, even though the will of God takes you into the centre of this continent.<a name=240:16></a> You may be assured that the Lord Jesus can take care of you.<a name=240:17></a> You see He has universal dominion and power, and it matters nothing where you are, or what race you belong to, so as you commit yourself definitely to Jesus He will take care of you.<a name=240:18></a> The eunuch had the knowledge of Jesus in his soul, and he had committed himself definitely to Him in baptism -- so he could go on his way rejoicing.<a name=240:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=241>[Page 241]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Old Testament.<a name=241:1></a> You see in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105">Psalm  105</a>that God called for a famine and broke the whole staff of bread.<a name=241:2></a> Why did God do that?<a name=241:3></a> To bring out His resources in a Man.<a name=241:4></a> Everything converges on Christ.<a name=241:5></a> You see, whatever happens in the history of the race is to bring out what the Man is.<a name=241:6></a> God has His Man, and He loves to bring out the perfections and the power and the resources that are in that Man.<a name=241:7></a> So it says, "He sent a man before them".<a name=241:8></a> I wanted just to dwell for a moment on the feature of the Man Christ Jesus that is presented in Joseph.<a name=241:9></a> He appears at the very outset as a type of Christ.<a name=241:10></a> When he was born Jacob spoke of leaving Syria -- a very remarkable suggestion, for, as the light of Jesus comes into your soul, the next thing is, are you prepared to move with Him?<a name=241:11></a> He is not dwelling in this world.<a name=241:12></a> His life is taken from the earth.<a name=241:13></a> The man of sin will be set up in this world.<a name=241:14></a> It is his sphere.<a name=241:15></a> He comes in his own name, and he intends to set himself up here, whereas the life of Jesus was taken from this world, and as He comes into your soul you move.<a name=241:16></a> That is the suggestion -- you move.<a name=241:17></a> Jacob spoke of leaving Syria as Joseph was born; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#30:25">Genesis  30:25</a>.<a name=241:18></a> So, also, as he meets with his brother Esau, and causes his family to pass before him, Joseph goes before Rachel.<a name=241:19></a> I have spoken of this frequently, because I enjoy it so much.<a name=241:20></a> I enjoy the thought of the pre-eminence of Christ even in His infancy, and, unless you learn to acknowledge the pre-eminence of Jesus in your soul, you will not be formed after Him.<a name=241:21></a> So, as Jacob met with Esau, and as they all passed before Esau and did obeisance, Joseph passed on before his mother.<a name=241:22></a> He had the pre-eminence.<a name=241:23></a> Then, at the age of seventeen, we are told, he is definitely loved of his father.<a name=241:24></a> How beautifully Joseph stands out there, at the immature age of seventeen, as the object of his father's affection!<a name=241:25></a> And he brought back to his father the report of the evil discourse of his brethren.<a name=241:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=242>[Page 242]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How beautifully the traits of Jesus shine in Joseph.<a name=242:1></a> You see, God intends that these traits should appear even in the youngest believer.<a name=242:2></a> As a young man, or a young woman, the light of Christ comes into your soul, and you hear filthy conversation, and you abhor it.<a name=242:3></a> The theatres and the picture shows all suggest what is filthy.<a name=242:4></a> If I come, at the age of seventeen, into those traits, so beautifully expressed in Joseph, I shall not be found in association with those who use filthy language -- "their evil discourse".<a name=242:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, we find that he had the light of God in his soul.<a name=242:6></a> I think of Jesus here in this world -- the Man, all the light of God was there.<a name=242:7></a> He says, "I am the light of the world", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a> and so Joseph says to his brethren, "I have dreamed: for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and also stood upright".<a name=242:8></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37:7">Genesis  37:7</a>.<a name=242:9></a> Can the man of sin raise the dead?<a name=242:10></a> No, beloved.<a name=242:11></a> He may imitate, and bring fire down from heaven, as the magicians of Egypt did.<a name=242:12></a> But can he raise the dead?<a name=242:13></a> No.<a name=242:14></a> When Moses brought forth the lice, we are told the magicians said, "This is the finger of God".<a name=242:15></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#8:19">Exodus  8:19</a>.<a name=242:16></a> It was the power of God in a man.<a name=242:17></a> Jesus is declared to be Son of God with power, by resurrection.<a name=242:18></a> In the type His sheaf stood upright.<a name=242:19></a> It was impossible that He should be holden of death.<a name=242:20></a> What a fact to get into our souls as to Jesus!<a name=242:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, Joseph had another dream, and he says, "Behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me".<a name=242:22></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37:9">Genesis  37:9</a>.<a name=242:23></a> It is Christ <i>in heaven</i> -- the glad tidings that Jesus is the Christ.<a name=242:24></a> That is really what is bound up in this dream, Principalities and powers and authorities are subject to Him.<a name=242:25></a> You see what strength of soul we acquire as we pursue Scripture, and get into our souls the testimony of it about Jesus.<a name=242:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Joseph is spoken of as in prison.<a name=242:27></a> You see how the man whom God sent before them portrays

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said so much about Joseph, I want to say a word about Moses, the next great vessel used in the testimony.<a name=243:14></a> You see the Spirit of God at this particular juncture in Moses' life calls attention to the fact that he was <i>the meekest man in all the earth</i>.<a name=243:15></a> I ask you to dwell on that.<a name=243:16></a> It is not a mere incidental statement; it is said expressly to call attention to the man; none had a better opportunity of proving the manhood of Moses than Miriam, and yet you find her at this time opposing Moses.<a name=243:17></a> It is a very searching matter.<a name=243:18></a> She was his sister after the flesh, and was considerably older than Moses.<a name=243:19></a> She watched him, in his infancy, as he was in the ark.<a name=243:20></a> She knew him as a baby; she knew his history, and so did Aaron, for Aaron was two years older than Moses.<a name=243:21></a> How much they owed to Moses!<a name=243:22></a> They owed all their dignity, under God, to Moses, and yet they were

	<div class="paragraph">
		What has given it its distinction in this world?<a name=244:4></a> Why, it is the light of Jesus.<a name=244:5></a> The introduction of the testimony of Jesus into Europe is most striking.<a name=244:6></a> It is said that "the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:7">Acts  16:7</a> to go into Bithynia.<a name=244:7></a> Why?<a name=244:8></a> He wanted the testimony of Jesus in Europe; and so Europe has been enlightened.<a name=244:9></a> It has been lifted above the rest of the world through that testimony, and yet the greatest combination against Christ is there.<a name=244:10></a> It is at this point that the Spirit of God calls attention to the meekness of Moses.<a name=244:11></a> There is an awful combination against Jesus at the present time, but the believer knows that He is the meekest of men.<a name=244:12></a> "He was led as a lamb" -- that is the type of meekness -- "to the slaughter, and, as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth".<a name=244:13></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:7">Isaiah  53:7</a>.<a name=244:14></a> That is the testimony of Jesus.<a name=244:15></a> Miriam and Aaron combined against such a man.<a name=244:16></a> How awful is the guilt of Christendom, the guilt of Europe, I may say, for there it is that the combination has been formed against Jesus.<a name=244:17></a> And why did Aaron and Miriam oppose Moses here?<a name=244:18></a> Because he had married an Ethiopian.<a name=244:19></a> I beg of you to note the connection between that passage and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>.<a name=244:20></a> An Ethiopian is brought.<a name=244:21></a> Japheth looks down on the African, but what about Jesus?<a name=244:22></a> Does He look down on the African?<a name=244:23></a> No.<a name=244:24></a> As you see the three races standing over against each other in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>,9, and 10 -- the African, the Ethiopian, is enlightened first.<a name=244:25></a> The testimony of Jesus takes account of <i>men</i>.<a name=244:26></a> There is no 'favoured nation clause' in the gospel.<a name=244:27></a> The Man Christ Jesus is the Mediator between God and men, and the Ethiopian was as much a man as Philip or Paul.<a name=244:28></a> Paul had left Jerusalem, we might say, almost at the same time to go to Damascus as the Ethiopian had left to go south.<a name=244:29></a> The Ethiopian is

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us not be found arrayed, either by association, or by the adoption of principles, against Him.<a name=245:13></a> It is easy for even Christians to slip into opposition to Jesus.<a name=245:14></a> Satan darkens our minds, and we are found, perhaps quite unintentionally arrayed against Him.<a name=245:15></a> It is a serious matter that God should have to say to you, 'Why should you oppose Him; He is the meekest Man in all the earth?<a name=245:16></a>' The Lord says to Saul, "Why persecutest thou me?<a name=245:17></a>" Why should he persecute Jesus?<a name=245:18></a> "Who art thou, Lord?<a name=245:19></a>" He says, "I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest".<a name=245:20></a> Let us see to it, dear brethren; let us look into our hearts and see if we are in any way persecuting Jesus.<a name=245:21></a> If I am not following His principles, and am not identified with Him and His people, I am very likely to be arrayed against Him, for He says, "He that is not with me is against me" -- a very solemn word.<a name=245:22></a>

		It is in my mind to speak from these scriptures of spiritual wealth, and consequent independency of this world, and of men in it.<a name=247:1></a> It is a divine thought that we should be individually, as well as collectively, wealthy.<a name=247:2></a> The idea of wealth -- divine wealth -- is prominent throughout Scripture, and in that epistle which may be said to be peculiarly <i>our</i> 'light' -- that is, the epistle to the Ephesians -- we read of the "unsearchable riches of Christ".<a name=247:3></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>.<a name=247:4></a> The glad tidings announce these riches, as it is said, "the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of Christ".<a name=247:5></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>.<a name=247:6></a> And so I wish to show how the believer comes into this divine wealth, and how he is thereby set up in independency of the world, and then, how the assembly is seen in the chapter in Proverbs as also possessed of this wealth, so that she needs not to ask accommodation from the world.<a name=247:7></a> Indeed, what has marked the history of the assembly, the public body in the world, is that it fell to the level of the world in first seeking accommodation from it, and then allying itself with it, so that it is now indistinguishable from the world.<a name=247:8></a> And, as the Lord has come in for us, dear brethren, in recovering us from all this, my exercise is that we may be preserved; that we may not rely on light only; that we may understand the income that there is whereby we are to be maintained at the full height of the position in which the light sets us.<a name=247:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=261:3></a> I have been thinking of that feature of the dispensation which we speak of as administrative -- administration.<a name=261:4></a> It occurred to me that a consideration of the administrative feature of this dispensation would help to clear the position at the outset.<a name=261:5></a> Some of us, elsewhere, were looking at the Lord's services, as risen, before He ascended, having in view that they indicate His present personal activity for the assembly during its sojourn on earth.<a name=261:6></a> We were enabled, by the Lord's help, to see that each evangelist presents some feature of this service.<a name=261:7></a> We began with John and worked backwards to Matthew, on the principle that John is intended for our own times, especially -- that is for recovery.<a name=261:8></a> And, working backwards, we arrived at Matthew, who is evidently the administrative evangelist.<a name=261:9></a> Then we touched on the first chapter of Acts, because it gives us a further feature of the Lord's activities before He ascended, after He rose.<a name=261:10></a> It tells us the number of days (namely) forty.<a name=261:11></a> The feature of the first chapter of Acts is that the Lord "assembled with them".<a name=261:12></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:4">Acts  1:4</a>.<a name=261:13></a> It says, first of all "having, by the Holy Spirit, charged the apostles, whom he had chosen, he was taken up: to whom, also, he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs, being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and, being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye have heard of me.<a name=261:14></a> For John, indeed, baptised with water, but ye shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:2">Acts  1:2</a> - 5.<a name=261:15></a>

		So that Luke, in this further narrative regarding the Lord's activities and service during the period of His sojourn here after He rose, emphasises the fact that He employed the Spirit, It says, He charged the apostles "by the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:2">Acts  1:2</a> which indicates that the book of the Acts is on the line of the activities, or services, of the Spirit, and the use, so to speak, that may be made of the Spirit during the present time.<a name=262:1></a> So that they were to learn, from the Lord's manner of workmanship, how the dispensation was to be maintained, and the place that the Spirit was to have in it.<a name=262:2></a> So, it says, "He was taken up" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:11">Acts  1:11</a> from them.<a name=262:3></a> Then it says what the qualifications were to be, of the one who should take the place of Judas -- that he should be one who had assembled with them during all the time the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst them, from the baptism of John, until He was received up.<a name=262:4></a> That is to say, from the time when the Spirit descended and abode on Christ until He was received up.<a name=262:5></a> And he was to have been familiar with the Lord's manner of coming in and going out amongst them, and to know how to assemble.<a name=262:6></a> The apostle Peter stands up amongst the brethren, after the Lord had ascended, and calls attention to what the Holy Spirit says, by the mouth of David, about Judas.<a name=262:7></a> You will observe the emphasis laid on the "Holy Spirit".<a name=262:8></a> In the second chapter he stands up with the eleven, but here he stood up in the midst of the brethren, and during the ten days that elapsed between the Lord's going up, and the Spirit coming down, Peter stands up amongst the brethren, calling attention to what the Holy Spirit had said about Judas, and proceeding, after having called attention to the qualifications that were necessary for the apostle who was to take Judas' place, to the necessity for the completion of the number <i>twelve</i>.<a name=262:9></a> I mention the number twelve because I think

		It is one of the keys to the position.<a name=263:1></a> It says, "He was numbered with the eleven", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:26">Acts  1:26</a> making twelve, which is the great administrative number in Scripture.<a name=263:2></a> One calls attention to that particularly, because of the place the number has in the gospels, and in Acts, and again, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, which gives us a list of the Lord's appearings after He rose.<a name=263:3></a> It says, "He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:5">1 Corinthians  15:5</a>.<a name=263:4></a> The appearings there are constructive -- that is, they lead on in a constructive way, first with Cephas, and then the twelve, indicating, I think, that the Lord, in appearing to the twelve, would impress them with the idea of what was becoming to their administrative position during His absence.<a name=263:5></a> The apostle there also says that, "He appeared to all the apostles" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:7">1 Corinthians  15:7</a>.<a name=263:6></a> That is another thought.<a name=263:7></a> But before that, we have the statement that He appeared to the twelve.<a name=263:8></a> So that Peter, in standing up with the eleven, is obviously on an administrative platform in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, but his great theme is to call attention to the Lord on high, and to the presence of the Holy Spirit, who had come down in consequence of that.<a name=263:9></a> It was an administrative action.<a name=263:10></a>

		I had in mind to speak tonight about <i>suffering</i>, taking up my thought from the types referred to in the book of Exodus, in which we are told that as the tabernacle was reared up it was to be anointed, in all its details, with the holy oil.<a name=280:1></a> The prominent component part of this oil is stated to be myrrh -- the first ingredient, indeed -- which, throughout Scripture, represents suffering love.<a name=280:2></a> The way of that suffering love, of which the type speaks, has to be learnt through Christ.<a name=280:3></a> He leads the way in sufferings, as in all else, for us.<a name=280:4></a> So, as this book of the Acts records the anti-typical setting up of the tabernacle, it abounds with references to sufferings.<a name=280:5></a> Indeed, in recording the activities of our Lord Jesus during the forty days of His sojourn on earth after He rose, it says that He appeared unto His disciples <i>after He suffered</i>.<a name=280:6></a> The Spirit of God begins the great theme of the book by introducing this feature, viz.<a name=280:7></a>, that in charging His apostles by the Spirit, and in His other ministry during the forty days, it was <i>after</i> He had <i>suffered</i>.<a name=280:8></a> That is to say, they were familiarised with Christ as risen during those forty days as the One who had suffered.<a name=280:9></a>

		forty days to which I have referred, and He says, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest".<a name=281:1></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:18">John  21:18</a>.<a name=281:2></a> That is a word that comes very closely to the young ones here, as it does, indeed, to every one of us.<a name=281:3></a> In our youthful days, the tendency is to gird ourselves and to go where we wish; but, under the discipline of the Lord and the wisdom which comes of advancing years under the government of God, we learn to submit ourselves.<a name=281:4></a> So the Lord says to Peter, "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:18">John  21:18</a>.<a name=281:5></a> We may be assured, dear brethren, that that "other" will not be wanting as we are true followers and witnesses of Christ -- that "other", namely, the agent of the enemy, will not be wanting as we prove true to Christ.<a name=281:6></a> Peter, therefore, was to be honoured, according to his wish, as he grew old.<a name=281:7></a> To "another" he resigned -- he stretched forth his hands; instead of cowering in the presence of opposition and persecution, he stretched forth his hands and another girded him and carried him to his martyrdom.<a name=281:8></a> It was the intent of the Lord that all those who should be partakers in the tabernacle should have also a part in the oil.<a name=281:9></a> Hence, at the very outset of this book, you have the Lord Jesus presented as the One who suffered.<a name=281:10></a> Indeed, He it is who affords, thus, the anointing oil of the tabernacle.<a name=281:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I would refer for a moment, dear brethren, to the synoptic gospels, to call attention to the Lord as He is about to face the suffering into which His love was bringing Him.<a name=281:12></a> Let us look at Matthew and Mark.<a name=281:13></a> We find Him, in the one instance, <i>on His face</i>.<a name=281:14></a> Think of the Lord of glory -- He from whose face now radiates the glory of God -- think of Him, I say, <i>on His face</i>!<a name=281:15></a> It was in the presence of suffering.<a name=281:16></a> And, again, in Mark, He falls to the ground.<a name=281:17></a> The sufferings

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, when we come to Luke, we find that He <i>knelt down</i>.<a name=282:4></a> He is seen in Luke's gospel, as many of us know, in the attitude of prayer in many connections; but in the last and final instance, we find Him at Olivet -- we find the Lord of glory, whose right it was to command, and who did command -- we find Him, of whom it is written, "Without him was not anything made that was made" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:3">John  1:3</a> -- in the presence of those awful sufferings into which His love was leading Him, deliberately kneeling down before God and praying.<a name=282:5></a> Luke, being ever concerned about what is comely as before God and before men, presents to us a model in the Lord as He faced those sufferings, telling us that He knelt down.<a name=282:6></a> The heart is drawn to Him as one observes, in His blessed posture before God, what is comely at that moment.<a name=282:7></a> Then, again, we are told by Luke, "Being in conflict, he prayed more intently".<a name=282:8></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:44">Luke  22:44</a>.<a name=282:9></a>

		That is the secret of coming into the sufferings of Christ.<a name=283:1></a> We may evade them, as Peter did.<a name=283:2></a> The secret of coming under the sufferings of Christ lies in unqualified submission to the will of God.<a name=283:3></a> The will of God in this world involves a path of suffering, and suffering experienced in the path of the will of God lends lustre and character to our testimony, marking it off as of a piece with the testimony of Him who, before Pontius Pilate, "witnessed a good confession".<a name=283:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:13">1 Timothy  6:13</a>.<a name=283:5></a> Timothy is enjoined to take his share in it, and I would say to everyone here, old and young, that <i>your share</i> is there, whether you take it or not.<a name=283:6></a> It is your privilege to take it.<a name=283:7></a> There is a share for every one of us of that holy compound; composed of the ingredients that appear in the path of Jesus' suffering.<a name=283:8></a> So Timothy is enjoined to take his share.<a name=283:9></a> In these days of commercial prosperity -- when there is no opposition outwardly; when, under the government of God, we can meet, as we are met here tonight, no man forbidding us, when we can pursue our way without fear of molestation from the authorities or the powers that be -- we are in great danger of overlooking the fact that there is a share of suffering for every one of us, and we are enjoined to take it.<a name=283:10></a> To miss it is an irrevocable loss -- it can never be made up.<a name=283:11></a> Every part of the tabernacle was to be anointed with it, particularly the brazen altar.<a name=283:12></a> You may remember that Moses, in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>, was enjoined to anoint the tabernacle, and that he sprinkled the oil on the brazen altar seven times.<a name=283:13></a>

		In what I have in mind to say on these scriptures, my object is that in the people of God at the present time, and until the end of the assembly's sojourn on earth, there is to be a representation of Christ; that is, a representation of His personal feelings, affections, and sympathies.<a name=307:1></a> I have selected passages covering the three great servants who, in the beginning of the divine economy on earth, were personal representatives of the Lord.<a name=307:2></a> They, of course, were employed in the establishment and maintenance of the whole economy of God, for they had to do with the public administration of the kingdom.<a name=307:3></a> But I hope we shall see that, whilst this is so, they, in a peculiar way, represented Christ in a personal sense, for we have to distinguish what refers to the Lord, personally, from what is general.<a name=307:4></a> The revelation of God in Christ involves the whole truth as to God; but, then, there is bound up in that what is special to Christ.<a name=307:5></a>
