		MARK'S GOSPEL (1)

		<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:1">Mark  1:1</a> - 45
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> What is proposed for these five readings is the gospel of Mark, the early chapters.<a name=1:2></a> The first chapter at this time.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is understood that Mark is the servant's gospel.<a name=1:4></a> The character of it is to aid the servants in setting out the <i>glad tidings</i>.<a name=1:5></a> The word commences, "<i>Beginning</i> of the glad tidings", beginning of them!<a name=1:6></a> What a vast thing is ahead of us therefore.<a name=1:7></a> This book is the beginning of them, "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God".<a name=1:8></a> The opening verses are to introduce that the Son of God should be spoken of as glad tidings, and spoken of briefly and clearly so that all should hear.<a name=1:9></a> It is to be understood, of course, that this meeting is not a discourse but a Bible reading.<a name=1:10></a> The way is open for every brother to speak who has anything to say that would be profitable to the brethren.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=1:12></a>M.<a name=1:13></a> In alluding to the word "Beginning", is it in your mind that there is a glorious unfolding and fullness of the glad tidings as Paul's ministry comes in, in the light of the assembly?<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:15></a> Quite so.<a name=1:16></a> The word comes to one now that we should speak as we ought to speak, and everybody should have in his mind that if he has anything to say it should be said as he ought to say it.<a name=1:17></a> We will have to take the whole of this

		reading to cover the detail of this chapter, to be engaged with the first chapter of Mark, and we will seek to bring out what is available to the <i>servants</i>, those who are serving the Lord in any way in the ministry.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=2:2></a>D.<a name=2:3></a> What particular feature do you see in the first chapter?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:5></a> What have you to say?<a name=2:6></a> I have said quite a little.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=2:8></a>D.<a name=2:9></a> Well, one was impressed with the greatness of the Person as the scripture was being read, the greatness of this Person.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:11></a> Quite so.<a name=2:12></a> That is just what is said, "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ".<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It goes on that He is the Son of God, <i>He</i> is the Son of God.<a name=2:14></a> I think it would be well for the brothers to take part, that each should be free to say what he should say.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:16></a> Is it of interest that as soon as the Person is identified clearly as the Son of God that the prophetic word comes in, as though it is available to those who would serve in the glad tidings?<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:18></a> That is just the idea at this time.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=2:20></a>M.<a name=2:21></a> Is the great thought of service elevated to sonship?<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:23></a> Well, I should think so.<a name=2:24></a> I would like to say, myself, that it is a question of sonship; not simply Jesus Christ, but the Son of God, "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God".<a name=2:25></a> Of course, John's gospel brings that out fully, but Mark is dealing with the servants,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=3:2></a>P.<a name=3:3></a> The apostle Paul preached straightway that He is the Son of God.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.A.<a name=3:5></a>T.<a name=3:6></a> Why did not Peter bring out the truth of the Son of God?<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:8></a> He did not have the commission to do it.<a name=3:9></a> Paul had the commission to do it.<a name=3:10></a> Of course, Peter was an apostle and Paul was an apostle and Peter was an apostle before Paul was, but Paul was the apostle of the assembly; the matter of the assembly is with Paul, Peter was a general apostle; the general truth of the assembly was in his mind.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=3:12></a>M.<a name=3:13></a> Does it not seem to be a matter of sovereign selection as to who should bring out this great truth, and was it not needed to dignify Paul's commission?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> Well, compare the introduction of the Son of God here with Paul's commission.<a name=3:16></a> The idea is the truth, the truth purely of Christianity -the power given to them to minister it, the power given to them by the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:17></a> For that is in mind in Mark.<a name=3:18></a> It is the beginning of the gospel, but it is the gospel not only of Jesus Christ but also of the Son of God.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=3:20></a>F.<a name=3:21></a> Is that why the two features of baptism are spoken of by John here immediately?<a name=3:22></a> Baptism by water and "he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit?<a name=3:23></a>" I thought the first baptism would be the setting aside of the man that was the opposite of the Son of God, and the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:2></a> Just so.<a name=4:3></a> Well, I think we have a good start.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.H.<a name=4:5></a>MacP.<a name=4:6></a> Would Paul's remark about John Mark help ".<a name=4:7></a>.<a name=4:8></a>.<a name=4:9></a> for he is serviceable to me for ministry", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:11">2 Timothy  4:11</a>?<a name=4:10></a> And I was wondering if the Holy Spirit would help us to support those who minister by taking on the ministry and speaking about it?<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:12></a> Just so.<a name=4:13></a> That is the idea in this gospel.<a name=4:14></a> It is the brevity of it and the consciousness of it that is in mind.<a name=4:15></a> If we have something to say, we want to say it quickly and concisely.<a name=4:16></a> Whatever we say, we say it rightly and concisely.<a name=4:17></a> It is wonderful that God comes in, in such a gospel as this, coming in from heaven to say things about the Lord Jesus.<a name=4:18></a> He is the Son of God, He is the Father's Son.<a name=4:19></a> "The Father has sent the Son", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:14">1 John  4:14</a>.<a name=4:20></a> "Thou art my beloved Son", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:11">Mark  1:11</a>.<a name=4:21></a>

		A.A.<a name=4:22></a>T.<a name=4:23></a> Peter speaks of Marcus my son.<a name=4:24></a> Is this the same Mark?<a name=4:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:26></a> That is right, John Mark.<a name=4:27></a> Mark is the name he is known by.<a name=4:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=4:29></a>M.<a name=4:30></a> Are there two great thoughts to keep in mind in this chapter?<a name=4:31></a> The greatness of the Person who is serving and the pleasure of the Father in Him as such, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=4:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:33></a> Beautiful, the pleasure of the Father!<a name=4:34></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> Not Christ Jesus, you mean; it is not Christ Jesus, but Jesus Christ.<a name=5:2></a> It is the man that is in mind.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.C.<a name=5:4></a>S.<a name=5:5></a>P.<a name=5:6></a> Does the emphatic "I", "Behold, I send my messenger", have a bearing on the ability to serve?<a name=5:7></a> And I wondered whether the recognition of authority in sending a servant enters into the pleasure God had in his service?<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:9></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=5:10></a> "Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way".<a name=5:11></a> God is the One who is speaking.<a name=5:12></a> God is entering into the matter, and we see what He has to say.<a name=5:13></a> God used the twelve apostles to say things.<a name=5:14></a> John the baptist comes in himself, "There came John baptizing", that is before the Lord Jesus enters into His service, John the baptist is His herald.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=5:16></a>P.<a name=5:17></a> He is called "my messenger" here.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:19></a> That is right, he is the forerunner, the one that leads in the whole matter, the one that leads is under Christ.<a name=5:20></a> And "there came John baptizing", not simply came but he is baptizing.<a name=5:21></a> He is doing the <i>work</i>, baptizing in the wilderness, that is <i>where</i> he is doing the work.<a name=5:22></a> It is a difficult place to do the work, but he is doing it.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.H.<a name=5:24></a>MacP.<a name=5:25></a> This raises inquiry about the glad tidings; for the one who serves, is he sent to serve or just asked to serve?<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:27></a> Well, what it says here first is "There came John baptizing".<a name=5:28></a> The enlargement is in the first of John's gospel that John the baptist

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it goes on to say, "Voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight".<a name=6:5></a> That is the opening of Mark, remarkable opening, showing that the thing is very urgent and has to be done quickly but done well; that is, the ministry of the gospel, and whatever other ministry it may be, because the truth of the gospel unfolded has the assembly in mind.<a name=6:6></a> The assembly is the vessel, the vessel of the Holy Spirit.<a name=6:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W. McK.<a name=6:8></a> Paul refers to his preaching saying, "I .<a name=6:9></a>.<a name=6:10></a>.<a name=6:11></a> have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:19">Romans  15:19</a>; his service was well done.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:13></a> Quite so, fully preached, it was done fully.<a name=6:14></a> I think that is excellent to bring forward, that things should be done fully.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:16></a> Would you say a word more about this matter of brevity?<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:18></a> Well, I think if we are going to do anything for the Lord, it ought to be done at once but done in faith, not done at the expense of the truth.<a name=6:19></a> It should be done at once, but done well and briefly.<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:21></a> After the Spirit came at Pentecost, Peter stood up (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>) and covered the whole matter and three thousand souls were the result.<a name=6:22></a> Is that God putting the stamp of approval on ministry marked by brevity and power?<a name=6:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=7:3></a>M.<a name=7:4></a> Will you say something about the two words used here, "I send" and the "voice?<a name=7:5></a>" Immediately there is a reference to the voice.<a name=7:6></a> If there is no sending, there would not be the voice.<a name=7:7></a> There must be the element of sending if there is to be the voice.<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:9></a> Very good.<a name=7:10></a> If someone is going to say something, has he been sent to say it?<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=7:12></a>F.<a name=7:13></a> Would the voice represent a prophetic word, the word coming from God, the speaking?<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:15></a> Well, I would think so, the voice is very clear.<a name=7:16></a> We would say in a general way that there should be a voice.<a name=7:17></a> The voice is really the voice of God, it is a prophetic voice.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=7:19></a> Is there a suggestion of that in the apostle's word when he says in 1 Corinthians, "I desire to speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:19">1 Corinthians  14:19</a>.<a name=7:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:21></a> Now, that is just what we have been talking about, that the voice should be distinct and it should be in clarity.<a name=7:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.H.<a name=7:23></a>MacP.<a name=7:24></a> Peter caught on quickly to the thought of the voice.<a name=7:25></a> He speaks of "this voice we heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain", <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:18">2 Peter  1:18</a>?<a name=7:26></a> Do the glad tidings come from that kind of environment?<a name=7:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:28></a> Very good.<a name=7:29></a> Just as this environment

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		here today, there should be in it something about the assembly, something profitable.<a name=8:1></a> The environment is good; it is not the same environment as we might have in our houses, it is an assembly environment, the Spirit of God is here.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=8:3></a>M.<a name=8:4></a> It needs a divine Person for the proclamation of the glad tidings, the Lord Himself first and now the Spirit sent from heaven.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.H.<a name=8:6></a>MacP.<a name=8:7></a> Peter speaks of "this voice we heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain".<a name=8:8></a> And then not only the glory, but "by the excellent glory" so we would love the company of Peter in our Bible readings and our gospel preachings.<a name=8:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:10></a> Hence the present moment is an environment in which we might hear something definite from the gospel of Mark.<a name=8:11></a>

		R.R.<a name=8:12></a>T.<a name=8:13></a> Is there a principle for us here in regard to preparation on the part of God going before in the servants?<a name=8:14></a> You were referring to Mark's gospel as particularly helpful to these who serve.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:16></a> Now there are many who are in the service, many brothers who are actually in the service, and of course these meetings are intended to help us all, that we might do the work better than we have been doing it.<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.R.<a name=8:18></a>T.<a name=8:19></a> I was thinking, as an example, of Peter going down to Cornelius.<a name=8:20></a> What marvellous preparation of God entered into that before ever Peter came there.<a name=8:21></a> Would that be on this line in principle?<a name=8:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:7></a> Quite so, very good.<a name=9:8></a> It is remarkable that that is stressed here.<a name=9:9></a> John was baptizing in the wilderness, and then his preaching is in the wilderness.<a name=9:10></a> The Lord was in the wilderness but did not continue there, because the gospel brings in other things as well.<a name=9:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:20></a> Exactly, there is nothing for the flesh at all.<a name=9:21></a> You have to suffer, to work at a disadvantage if necessary.<a name=9:22></a> It is not that you have a big job and a good salary, but you are suffering in it, you are ready for suffering.<a name=9:23></a> "Because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him, but the suffering for him also", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:29">Philippians  1:29</a>.<a name=9:24></a> That is the word of God, "to suffer".<a name=9:25></a> You enlarge on it.<a name=9:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=10:23></a> The introduction of the Son of God here is particularly noticeable.<a name=10:24></a> The phrase "Son of God" must enter into the whole of the gospel of Mark.<a name=10:25></a> The whole of the gospel of Mark must be governed somewhat by the presence of the term

		Well, I thought to suggest this passage because it enters so directly into our subject this afternoon; that is to say, the idea of the Lord's supper, the idea of man first and then the idea of the woman and how the man is formed out of the clay as we see in the first chapter, and how the woman is made out of a rib that is taken out of his side.<a name=120:8></a> There is perfect unity, perfect oneness in the thought of the Lord's supper, perfect oneness leading up to the full thought of Christ and the assembly in a spiritual sense.<a name=120:9></a> When we go to heaven, there will be individuality, of course, each one will go; at the same time, the Lord's supper involves the body, the body which is a great matter divinely, and we will have to understand that the body of Christ will be seen in heaven, and we being part of it.<a name=120:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=121:4></a> That is right, something concrete in that sense.<a name=121:5></a> What we are touching on implies that the man and the woman are one.<a name=121:6></a> They shall be one flesh, they are one flesh.<a name=121:7></a> The oneness is a great matter in Christianity and that is what we have in mind this afternoon, and the brother and the sister, as it were, the man and the woman, are one flesh.<a name=121:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		I wish to speak about the tribe of Levi, a tribe, as you all know, specially selected from among the other eleven tribes of Israel, and as such, specially typical of Christians, those who are partakers of the heavenly calling.<a name=181:1></a> A very great thought for us, as I hope to show, especially as it suggests the thought of our being a kind of firstfruits of God's creatures.<a name=181:2></a> There is always something special about firstfruits, and they refer to the early product of the Spirit as coming from heaven.<a name=181:3></a> The Lord having ascended into heaven as Man proposes to bring about a heavenly state of things down here, and hence He gave the Spirit in a unique way to His followers, so that in the freshness and enjoyment of the Spirit there might be brought about here a heavenly order of things; a people whose calling is heavenly, whose relationships are heavenly, and whose spirit, being the spirit of the ascended Man, is heavenly.<a name=181:4></a> In that way, we have brought to light the sovereign act of God referred to by James, "According to his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we should be a certain first-fruits of his

		It is in mind to stress the idea of completeness in the things of God.<a name=213:1></a> There has been completeness from the divine side which we all accept, but what is to be stressed is completeness from our side, that we go the whole way.<a name=213:2></a> The idea of finish marks God's way and works.<a name=213:3></a> If we trace the way the Lord went as indicated in the gospels to secure us, we shall find that there was finish and completeness.<a name=213:4></a> The thought becomes wider and greater as we trace the work of our Lord Jesus Christ, the redemption work was complete.<a name=213:5></a> That is a point that should always be stressed in the gospel; "I have finished the work .<a name=213:6></a>.<a name=213:7></a>.<a name=213:8></a>", He says.<a name=213:9></a> The apostle Paul speaks of the gospel he announced to the Corinthians and says, "Which also ye received .<a name=213:10></a>.<a name=213:11></a>.<a name=213:12></a> that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures".<a name=213:13></a> All this detail is brought in as we view the vicarious work of Christ.<a name=213:14></a> It was complete; but for the fullness of the gospel, the exaltation of Christ must be added.<a name=213:15></a> Paul goes on to say in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:5">1 Corinthians  15:5</a>, that Christ "appeared to Cephas" - he brings forward a witness to the fact

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the resurrection of Christ does not take in the fullness of the gospel, though it certainly goes a long way.<a name=214:3></a> Scripture is extremely accurate as to what is the end in the gospel.<a name=214:4></a> Then the apostle Paul says, "He appeared to James", to one brother, a reliable man, reliable in the service of God, a person you could trust.<a name=214:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Vacillation in the things of God is despicable; Christianity requires men that stand by the truth.<a name=214:6></a> Well, Paul says, "He appeared to James; then to all the apostles, and last of all, as to an abortion (one born out of due time) - he appeared to me also".<a name=214:7></a> This man who says of himself that he was less than the least of all saints, says Christ "appeared to me;" one who was not fit to be called an apostle, because he persecuted the assembly of God.<a name=214:8></a> But, says Paul, "By the grace of God I am what I am;" a great matter to understand.<a name=214:9></a> In the service of God, administrative service, a man is what he is; you understand that you are what you are, by the grace of God.<a name=214:10></a> A real Christian is what he is by the grace of God, and it is required that we recognize a man according to what he is.<a name=214:11></a> Paul went to the third heaven, by the grace of God being what he was.<a name=214:12></a> All this not only brings us to resurrection, but to a risen Man, witnessed to by all these persons.<a name=214:13></a> The Lord saw to that.<a name=214:14></a> Peter,

		We were reading yesterday in another place, from the eleventh chapter of this epistle in view of the fact that it dealt with the service of God as it was at the beginning relating to the Lord's supper and that the continuation of this might be seen at the present time.<a name=227:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=227:7></a> You spoke of the sects that are referred to in the eleventh chapter, the apostle saying that there must also be sects among you that the approved may become manifest.<a name=227:8></a> Would you say a little as to that in the light of the two portions read?<a name=227:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=227:10></a> We spoke yesterday of the Lord's supper and the privileges connected with it, and that what is referred to as sects is clearly possible where love is not active.<a name=227:11></a> The idea of sects is that the approved may be manifest, that is, we are going on with God and if there is a party it should be condemned, and condemned at once, and not only that but the eleventh chapter contemplates a penalty if there is anything like sects.<a name=227:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=228:2></a> Quite so.<a name=228:3></a> Then the idea of what is abstract is important.<a name=228:4></a> The apostle is about to speak about divisions and he first speaks of what is right and he goes on to say, "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge, (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you), so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=228:5></a> These verses are abstract.<a name=228:6></a> The Spirit of God has a right to speak of things abstractly so that the brethren should not be discouraged but should see that God is for them.<a name=228:7></a> Whatever He may have to do in a corrective way He is for them.<a name=228:8></a> So that in the first paragraph Paul is said to be "called apostle".<a name=228:9></a> That is to say God has called him into apostleship.<a name=228:10></a> The assembly is accredited as "of God".<a name=228:11></a> "Called saints", or they are saints by calling "with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours".<a name=228:12></a> The idea of the universal fellowship is asserted.<a name=228:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=229:4></a> "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=229:5></a> While Paul was concerned about conditions at Corinth, he held on to the saints according to God's thoughts.<a name=229:6></a> In Thessalonians Paul speaks in the greatest terms of their faithfulness, but here he speaks of the Corinthians in the abstract, so that things may be held and were held at that time.<a name=229:7></a> The same may be said today.<a name=229:8></a> God is helping the brethren all over the world.<a name=229:9></a> We must go on.<a name=229:10></a> If anything is to be done we do it and the Spirit of God is here sent down from heaven to add His help to our weaknesses.<a name=229:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=229:12></a> Do you think if the saints were in the good of what it means to be called to the level of the fellowship of God's Son it would help them in the working out of what is presented in this chapter?<a name=229:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=229:14></a> Yes, however bad things may seem to be they can be met.<a name=229:15></a> The man spoken of in the first epistle is restored, showing that God is ready to help them.<a name=229:16></a> Paul says in the second epistle, 'encourage him, restore him'.<a name=229:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=230:10></a> If they are calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they should be in fellowship.<a name=230:11></a> That implies that they would be separated from everything that is contrary.<a name=230:12></a> Then there is the idea of the abstract.<a name=230:13></a> God is entitled to deal with things in the abstract.<a name=230:14></a> The apostle has already said, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=230:15></a> Are these people to whom you refer in fellowship?<a name=230:16></a> That is the general idea of fellowship, calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, both theirs and ours.<a name=230:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
