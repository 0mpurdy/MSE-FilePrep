		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> What I had in mind arises somewhat from the introductory remarks of the evangelist.<a name=1:3></a> It is said that many had taken in hand to give an account of the things believed among them; evidently there had been much given out, but his narrative is intended to be authoritative, as of one accurately acquainted with all things from the outset.<a name=1:4></a> He had in view, among other things, to call attention to the order and comeliness which marked the ministry of the grace of God at the outset.<a name=1:5></a> It occurred to me there was a parallel, in a much more obscure way, of course, at the present time.<a name=1:6></a> The Lord has helped, and many have been in service and much has come before us, and I thought that perhaps this gospel would help us at this juncture as showing what marked the Lord externally first of all, and then those whom He appointed to serve at the beginning.<a name=1:7></a> Besides in our Lord Himself, a certain grace and dignity marked all those who were called into service; indeed, the house of God, which this evangelist takes account of more than the others, was also marked by that outward adornment to which I refer.<a name=1:8></a> That may suffice, perhaps to indicate what is in view.<a name=1:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought was expressed by some that we could not undertake to go into the book in any exhaustive way, even if we touched on the various subjects in it.<a name=1:10></a> The idea was to take it up in five sections with these thoughts in view, so that what is before us now is the section covered from chapters 1 to 4, in which we see how the Lord entered on His service.<a name=1:11></a>

		of the suitability of the vessel to whom the testimony was committed?<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:2></a> Yes; so that the narrative begins with drawing attention to certain antecedents, first of John the baptist, then of the Lord Himself.<a name=2:3></a> God never begins in an instantaneous way, there is always preparation; so we get a priest and his wife of the daughters of Aaron introduced, reminding us that in drawing near to man there would be sympathy with man.<a name=2:4></a> Indeed, the fact that the gospel is addressed to an individual bears out the same thought, because a communication from one individual to another necessarily carries more sympathy than a communication addressed in a general way such as we see in the other gospels.<a name=2:5></a> It is as if God would address each man separately.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=2:7></a> What was your thought in regard to the priest and his wife of the daughters of Aaron as bearing on the subject?<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:9></a> A reminder that the communication would be on sympathetic lines.<a name=2:10></a> Compassion and sympathy were to characterise a priest; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:2">Hebrews  5:2</a>.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=2:12></a>H.<a name=2:13></a> Are you suggesting that this spirit of sympathy should be one of the features that should mark the vessel?<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:15></a> Yes.<a name=2:16></a> This gospel tells us that after praying all night the Lord appointed His apostles, and then it says He descended with them to a level place; He would descend to the level of men.<a name=2:17></a> The early introduction of the priest indicated that God was approaching man in a sympathetic way, and the persons brought into view were in accord with this.<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=2:19></a>H.<a name=2:20></a> Have you the thought that all that came out afterwards in the twelve, and in the seventy, and in the house of God generally is set forth, first in Himself as a pattern -- the obedient, dependent Man as a sample of the kingdom; not only preaching it, but presenting it in Himself?<a name=2:21></a>

		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:1></a> Yes; He wrought Himself first.<a name=3:2></a> The beauty and grace which marked His service are seen before others have part in it.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:4></a> Would you say a little more as to what was before your mind with regard to sympathy?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> I think the narrative being addressed by one individual to another would imply that.<a name=3:7></a> Luke takes account of Theophilus' state of soul; he needed to be assured, or made certain, of the things he had been instructed in; and then the mention of Zacharias and his wife -- the priestly family -- and he serving in his course, suggests sympathy.<a name=3:8></a> He was not merely an official priest, he was righteous, serving in his course and offering incense.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=3:10></a>H.<a name=3:11></a> I should like to ask, with regard to the word 'vessel' that has been used once or twice, have you the thought of the individual vessels -- every saint of God -- or of the assembly?<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:13></a> Both.<a name=3:14></a> One has to arrive at the assembly through the understanding one has of God in the way He deals with oneself.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=3:16></a>McB.<a name=3:17></a> I have thought that was largely the reason why this gospel was presented to an individual, that he might become personally sympathetic with the operations of God in a corporate way.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:19></a> It seems as if God would impress upon us at the outset that He is interested in <i>each</i> of us; this is a very affecting thing.<a name=3:20></a> I do not think that ministry can be effective unless the one who ministers is in sympathy with those to whom he ministers.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=3:22></a> What is the force of the fact that he was serving in his course and offering incense?<a name=3:23></a> Is it in contrast with the official priesthood?<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:25></a> Serving in his course would show that he recognised not only the primary thought of the priesthood as given by Moses, but what it was as taken up by David.<a name=3:26></a> David took up priesthood in a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=4:3></a> In view of the yield for God?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:5></a> Yes.<a name=4:6></a> The first book of Chronicles enters into it; we have a record there that goes back to the beginning -- to Adam.<a name=4:7></a> Now Luke is aiming at that, and the Holy Spirit gives us these touches to show how the thread of the testimony was preserved.<a name=4:8></a> Luke links up the testimony from the beginning in referring to 1 Chronicles.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=4:10></a>K.<a name=4:11></a> Do you mean to imply that the priesthood is brought in early in this book in order that we might see that on the one hand there is a link with God, and on the other a link with man in sympathy?<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> Yes.<a name=4:14></a> That would come out in Zacharias; he was <i>serving in the order of his course</i> and offering incense, which was according to the custom of the priesthood; and the people were in prayer outside.<a name=4:15></a> That was a remarkable feature.<a name=4:16></a> In however few the thread of the testimony was, it was there, and it is called attention to in a very remarkable way by Luke so that we may see the antecedents of what we have presented in Christ, and, later, in the apostles.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.R.<a name=4:18></a>M.<a name=4:19></a> Then we get angelic sympathy too in Gabriel and the heavenly hosts?<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:21></a> Just so: "I am Gabriel, who stand before God".<a name=4:22></a> He is brought in to show, among other things, how sympathetic heaven was in what was transpiring.<a name=4:23></a> We may say that the dignity and intelligence of the heavenly host were represented in Gabriel.<a name=4:24></a> The service of God was being carried on by Zacharias.<a name=4:25></a> Things were maintained not only according to the primary institution of priesthood, but according to its highest conception in the Old Testament, as represented in David.<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=4:27></a>K.<a name=4:28></a> So that if the kingdom is established as suggested in David, it is established on priestly lines.<a name=4:29></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> It is not only the establishment of the kingdom but of the service of God; that was the great thing in 1 Chronicles -- the service of God was set up; and the courses of the priests and the courses of the Levites were to that end.<a name=5:2></a> You might say priesthood was there in its highest form.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:4></a> Would the praying company outside carry your thought as to sympathy in connection with the interests of the house?<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> Quite.<a name=5:7></a> It is not a question of how many were included, but the thing was there.<a name=5:8></a> Matthew gives us another picture altogether.<a name=5:9></a> Luke takes up what is for God, and one's exercise is that we might see what was at the beginning in this respect, so that it might have its bearing now.<a name=5:10></a> Indeed, the Lord would have us to be affected by what was at the beginning as recorded in each of the gospels.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=5:12></a>H.<a name=5:13></a> You think then that Luke presents two sides -- the Vessel of God here and all that is of God presented to men in Him, and also the gathering up of what is for the <i>service of God</i>?<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:15></a> Yes; and he emphasises the order and comeliness that marked all.<a name=5:16></a> Another feature is that you feel you are in close touch with heaven throughout; there is a certain heavenly spring in all.<a name=5:17></a> Gabriel comes in here and announces his name.<a name=5:18></a> In the next chapter there are no names of angels mentioned, but Gabriel in announcing his would be representative of the order of things in heaven, for we may be assured that in the dignitaries there everything is in perfect order.<a name=5:19></a> We know from Ezekiel, too (chapter 28: 12 - 14), what personal ornamentation marked angelic dignitaries.<a name=5:20></a> If rightly apprehended, the house of God is in close proximity to heaven; there is very little between heaven and the house of God.<a name=5:21></a> The first time the house of God is mentioned in Scripture it says it was "the gate of heaven"; thus the testimony is in connection with what is positively attractive

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:4></a> Does this opening portion of the gospel give us the positive assurance that what God had set up in all its moral features was maintained by Himself in spite of the national breakdown?<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:6></a> Yes, it does; and it ought to touch our hearts that we can be maintained in a broken day in the full height of priesthood according to its primary institution.<a name=6:7></a> The reference is to David's day, not to that of Moses.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=6:9></a> Is what you are saying historically illustrated in the antecedents of Paul before going out in service?<a name=6:10></a> He went first to Antioch.<a name=6:11></a> Here we have the antecedents of the Lord before moving out in ministry.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D'A.<a name=6:13></a>C.<a name=6:14></a> It was "that holy thing which shall be born", and therefore all the surroundings had to be holy and heavenly.<a name=6:15></a> There was nothing outwardly glorious and palatial; outwardly things were little, but wonderfully holy.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:17></a> Quite; and there is a reminder of the wealth of heaven.<a name=6:18></a> Although outwardly small yet there is spiritual superabundance.<a name=6:19></a> You get Elizabeth as she is, very comely.<a name=6:20></a> At the outset she hid herself five months -- a very fine example of comeliness.<a name=6:21></a> As Mary's voice falls on her ears the babe leaps in her womb, and the Holy Spirit comes upon her, and she cries out.<a name=6:22></a> Then we have Mary's contribution marked by a wealth of intelligent enjoyment, then Zacharias himself joining in: a wonderful chorus of appreciation of what was there from hearts that were genuinely affected.<a name=6:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=6:24></a> Does it suggest the state of the saints in the appreciation of Christ prior to the ministry going out?<a name=6:25></a> Is that how it applies to us?<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>

		J.T.<a name=6:27></a> That is the thought.<a name=6:28></a>

		of the kingdom here in the Person of the Lord Himself, and that all the attendant circumstances would suggest the character of the kingdom that is coming in?<a name=7:1></a> The kingdom will be manifested by-and-by, and all these various elements will appear -- the house of God connected with heaven, and a system of things which will be quite according to Christ.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:3></a> Yes.<a name=7:4></a> What we are occupied with is the service of God; that which is affected by heaven and its results God-ward, so that the wealth that is there is reflected.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=7:6></a>McB.<a name=7:7></a> Your thought is that the kingdom comes in more incidental to that?<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:9></a> Well, it does.<a name=7:10></a> The kingdom is a means to an end; 1 Chronicles is to show how the service of God was set up under David, and this gospel corresponds.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.W.<a name=7:12></a>B.<a name=7:13></a> Will you say a little more as to priesthood in David, as to why it reaches its height there?<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:15></a> I think David acts typically in the capacity of head.<a name=7:16></a> He is not told exactly what to do, although it does say that he had the pattern of the house by the Spirit; but it is not "Thus saith the Lord"; it is not the Lord speaking to David, but what David does; it is what was done by one who was continually affected by God.<a name=7:17></a> He sat in his house and considered that he dwelt in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of Jehovah was under curtains, and the word was, "Do all that is in thine heart, for God is with thee".<a name=7:18></a> That was the thing, what was in his heart.<a name=7:19></a> Then the message comes to him from God through Nathan, and it discloses what was in the mind of God for him and for his house.<a name=7:20></a> But the ark was the great thought of David's life, "Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.<a name=7:21></a> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord,

		an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob".<a name=8:1></a> That is what he had before him, so that what he sets up is in keeping with that.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The author of the first book of Chronicles shows how the thread of the testimony was carried through, because he begins with Adam, showing that everything is preserved and all is now in the hands of David.<a name=8:3></a> I think the writer, whoever he was -- probably Ezra -- besides being inspired, was in full sympathy with the mind of God, and so would delight in the thought that everything now is in the hands of one who loved God and who had it in his heart to serve God.<a name=8:4></a> The whole book shows how true David was, and how intelligent he was in what he did; I think that the twenty-four courses would imply that he carried both dispensations forward; he took up what was in the previous one and connected it with what was in his own.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=8:6></a> We are not isolated; what we are going on with is what was at the beginning.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=8:8></a>McB.<a name=8:9></a> I was going to ask whether you had in your mind as to the twenty-four courses that the priesthood was on a basis that was not so much connected with the wilderness conditions and its needs, but with the service of God at its height.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:11></a> I think so.<a name=8:12></a> What came out in the wilderness under Moses is not ignored.<a name=8:13></a> David valued that, but then there is a new order of things under him -- a kind of forecast of our own day.<a name=8:14></a> David's service is typical of our own time, and the reference to it here in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>is very significant.<a name=8:15></a> It shows how the thread of the testimony is preserved.<a name=8:16></a> The one who writes the record of David's service reaches right back to Adam.<a name=8:17></a> Now in Simeon, who was not of the priestly family according to flesh, we have the change to the spiritual priesthood; he is the true priest in the sense that he is governed by the Spirit, and he says, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=9:4></a>K.<a name=9:5></a> Would you say that the kingdom reached a climax in the establishment of the ark on mount Zion, and everything flowed from that in the service of song that was appointed?<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:7></a> Quite.<a name=9:8></a> In Chronicles you have the priest, and not only that but you have in David the subjective response to what is presented on the part of God; he is the sweet psalmist of Israel.<a name=9:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:15></a> The ark was God's glory; it represented what was of God and for God, so that David in dancing before it showed he was more than a king; he was a priest, he was clothed with a linen ephod.<a name=9:16></a> It was necessary to be clothed with linen, for it was a priestly undergarment, but it was very suitable in one of royal dignity that he should put it on, because the wearing of it tends to reduction, and sobriety, and to the removal of natural feeling.<a name=9:17></a> In dancing before the ark he recognised what the ark represented; he had heard of it, but now he had <i>found</i> it.<a name=9:18></a>

		The shepherds were abiding without, keeping watch by night over their flock; they were without shelter, and were affected by their interest in their flocks, "And lo, an angel of the Lord was there by them", as if to intimate that heaven takes note of this spirit of keeping watch over the flock at night and abiding in the field.<a name=10:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=10:10></a> Yes.<a name=10:11></a> The chapter goes on next to the announcement, "Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord".<a name=10:12></a> The angel announced something that he called "good tidings of great joy"; one is impressed with the fulness of the thing, the wealth that is in it.<a name=10:13></a> Then suddenly a multitude of the heavenly host was with the angel; heaven was thus brought very near in sympathy with God and with man.<a name=10:14></a> Then the shepherds go to Bethlehem to see this thing which had come to pass.<a name=10:15></a> Now Simeon would gather up all that in his service.<a name=10:16></a> I think he represents what is in view in this gospel, the spiritual nature of things; it had been revealed to him by the Spirit that he should, see the Lord's Christ, and he came by the Spirit into the temple and took the Babe up in his arms.<a name=10:17></a>

		In chapter 5 we saw that He would associate others with Him, and so He deals in grace with Simon.<a name=37:5></a> I might remark what was omitted yesterday -- that Simon was in partnership with others.<a name=37:6></a> There were two boats in the company apparently, and the Lord entered into Simon's boat and spoke to the crowd out of it.<a name=37:7></a> The two boats, I think, refer to what existed in Judaism.<a name=37:8></a> The Lord then turns to Simon and says, "Launch out into the deep for a draught", and the haul was so great that the net broke.<a name=37:9></a> Then Simon beckons to his partners; they were acting together, so that both boats were filled and about to sink, as if the Lord would indicate to them that the great result of His ministry must go for nothing if entrusted to such a vessel as Judaism provided.<a name=37:10></a> The draught, through the gospel, must be provided for elsewhere.<a name=37:11></a> I think that stands out at the beginning of this section, and so the Lord sets about to produce a condition of things that would contain the draught.<a name=37:12></a> What the gospel would bring about must be provided for in better conditions than the two boats, and the partnership involved in them, afforded.<a name=37:13></a> They were not to be despised, but the net broke and the boats were sinking; so that chapters 5, 6 and 7 would bring about conditions leading up to the new order of things, which was to take form in the house.<a name=37:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=77:4></a> There is.<a name=77:5></a> Riches tend to induce earthly-mindedness, but they are not to be despised, and if taken up as a stewardship may serve to provide for the future in a spiritual way.<a name=77:6></a> The Lord, speaking to His disciples, says, "Make to yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles".<a name=77:7></a> Then the subject is again referred to in the ruler who desires to know what he should do to have eternal life; chapter 18.<a name=77:8></a> He is to sell what he has.<a name=77:9></a> "Sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor .<a name=77:10></a>.<a name=77:11></a>.<a name=77:12></a> and come, follow me".<a name=77:13></a> It occurred to me that it would serve a good end to be reminded of these instructions.<a name=77:14></a> The Lord in the case of Zacchaeus enters into his house.<a name=77:15></a> He also was a man of means.<a name=77:16></a> He says, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I return him fourfold".<a name=77:17></a> The Lord, however, does not suggest to him that he should sell all that he has and give to the poor, as if He would remind us that there are those who can well be trusted.<a name=77:18></a> Jesus says of Zacchaeus that he is a son of Abraham.<a name=77:19></a> Then finally (chapter 21) the Lord looked up and saw the widow casting her offering into the treasury of God.<a name=77:20></a> So the exercise is left with us as to what we shall do with what is in our hands in the way of means to which no formal claim is made.<a name=77:21></a> After all, the saints are not dependent on anybody's riches; the exercise, therefore, is one for those who have them.<a name=77:22></a> The Lord shows throughout that riches may be used for the spiritual advantage of the one who has them.<a name=77:23></a> But then He sees the widow casting into the <i>treasury of God</i>.<a name=77:24></a> What will one do there?<a name=77:25></a> This seems to lift the "box", as we

		I have heard it said that when the truth was revived through brethren who have now gone to be with the Lord, that <i>Ephesians</i> was the best part of Scripture, and I believe it; for next to the gospels, which stand first in my estimate of the Scriptures, Ephesians should command the attention of the believer.<a name=109:11></a><a name=109:8></a> It is what we may call "<i>our</i> light".<a name=109:12></a><a name=109:9></a> Israel have their light -- "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee".<a name=109:13></a><a name=109:10></a> Now Ephesians is that light for us, and we should look into <i>our</i> light, for "heavenly light", as the line in the hymn puts it so beautifully, "makes all things bright" (<a href=".<a name=109:14></a>.<a name=109:15></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=109:16></a>htm#12:3">Hymn 12</a>).<a name=109:17></a> Every part of the inspired word is illuminated from that altitude.<a name=109:18></a> Here they found what corresponds with Ephesians, they found the feast of tabernacles.<a name=109:19></a> It was a "good reading", as we speak.<a name=109:20></a> I can understand those chief fathers, and those priests and those Levites with Ezra enjoying the time they had together.<a name=109:21></a> They were helped that day, that second day of "the conference", as we may call it, and they found that it was written that Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month.<a name=109:22></a> As love works in our hearts we seek to dwell together.<a name=109:23></a> God would have us dwell in companies.<a name=109:24></a> It is not here in <i>one</i> booth, but in booths; and if we

		I intend to refer to other scriptures, but I read this at the outset so as to introduce what I have in mind, namely, that the church proves a trustworthy vessel; having that in view, I wish to speak about trustworthiness.<a name=114:1></a> In employing the word I have in mind that the apostle John was employed by the Lord to ensure this trustworthiness in the assembly.<a name=114:2></a> It is he who tells us that the Lord, being at Jerusalem at the time of the Passover, was believed on by many on account of His miracles, but that He did not commit Himself to them, for "He knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man".<a name=114:3></a> This is a singular fact to be brought to our attention by him, who presents to us the church as coming down from God out of heaven, "<i>having</i> the glory of God".<a name=114:4></a> It is a searching fact, too, because it reminds us of the utter untrustworthiness of man, and if of man, of all of us as in the flesh.<a name=114:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now to inquire how it is that this wonderful vessel, composed as it is of men, is possessed of the glory of God.<a name=114:6></a> She <i>has</i> it, and so I wish to bring forward at the outset one who is spoken of in Scripture as the friend of God, having in view that trustworthiness must primarily include <i>confidence</i>; it must depend on friendship.<a name=114:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find, according to Stephen, that "the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham" -- the first one, as far as I know, to whom He is said to have <i>appeared</i>.<a name=114:8></a> He had <i>spoken</i> to others; He had spoken to Adam and to Eve, and to Cain, and to Noah; but in appearing to Abraham God intended to establish a peculiar personal link with him.<a name=114:9></a> I urge this at the beginning because a personal link is essential to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Adam had proved untrustworthy; Eve had proved untrustworthy, Cain had proved untrustworthy; indeed Cain formally avows that he was <i>not</i> his brother's keeper.<a name=115:2></a> If he could not be entrusted with his brother, with whom then could he be entrusted?<a name=115:3></a> When we come to Enoch, the mind is detained because in him we have a distinct indication of trustworthiness.<a name=115:4></a> We are told that he begat a son, and in begetting a son he <i>walked with God</i>.<a name=115:5></a> If God entrusts us with a son, it is essential that we should walk with Him or we shall not bring him up for God.<a name=115:6></a> Enoch walked with God, we are told, after he begat a son, three hundred years.<a name=115:7></a> Trustworthiness could be developed in a walk with God.<a name=115:8></a> In that walk he pleased God and God took him.<a name=115:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Noah we have a remarkable testimony, as if God would set him up in trustworthiness in this world.<a name=115:10></a> He gave him the specification for an ark.<a name=115:11></a> He loved his family (he was a family man), and God directed him how to save his family.<a name=115:12></a> One can understand that such instruction would fit with Enoch, but it was given to Noah, and in the specification of the ark God made sure that it should be "thoroughly", as we say, "sea-going".<a name=115:13></a> There is not the least hint that one drop of water ever leaked through, and in that way God at the outset indicated what Christ should be, and it was for Noah to take note of it.<a name=115:14></a> He was to learn from the ark.<a name=115:15></a> But what came to pass was that that with which he was entrusted, namely, the government of the world, utterly failed in his hands, for he could not rule himself; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:20">Genesis  9:20</a>, 21.<a name=115:16></a> You may depend upon it that unless we learn how to control ourselves, how to rule our spirits, we shall never be entrusted with spiritual things.<a name=115:17></a>

		So Stephen in beginning his address to the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem says, "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia", and at the end of his wonderful speech it is said that he saw "the glory of God, and Jesus".<a name=117:10></a> The glory had pertained to Israel (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:4">Romans  9:4</a>), but that nation had forfeited it, and now it was in heaven with Jesus; but the church was to have it -- first, in testimony on earth and then permanently in heaven.<a name=117:11></a> This is one of the most interesting suggestions that could be made: that it pleases God to deposit His glory in that of which <i>we</i> form a part!<a name=117:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=143:1></a> I would suggest that it may be helpful to consider the assembly as seen at Thessalonica, at Corinth, and at Ephesus.<a name=143:2></a> From these scriptures, taken rightly in connection with the epistles that refer to them -- Thessalonians, Corinthians and Ephesians -- we may see what the assembly is as set up under Paul's ministry.<a name=143:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Thessalonians teaches us what the assembly was in its beginnings as marked by youthful freshness and vigour; the assembly at Corinth serves to indicate what it is in connection with the testimony here in this world, and the assembly seen at Ephesus indicates what it is in connection with the future; "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".<a name=143:4></a> It was in my mind to consider the assembly in these connections, so that we might have an increased apprehension of what we are called to.<a name=143:5></a> I observe in moving about among the Lord's people many who are possessed of the idea of a congregation only, and with little conception of what it is to assemble.<a name=143:6></a> The Lord, in speaking of the assembly, said that the gates of hell should not prevail against it, and that is another feature of it.<a name=143:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=144:18></a> Being gathered together is very near to the thought of the assembly; it is a <i>mutual</i> thought; still the word 'assemble' implies that we are together intelligently as in relation to each other.<a name=144:19></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>you have the statement made of the Lord, "being <i>assembled</i> with them" (verse 4); in verse 6, "they therefore, being come <i>together</i>", He spoke to them about the coming of the Spirit.<a name=144:20></a> When they were gathered together they <i>asked</i> Him about certain things; this might correspond to a meeting for prayer.<a name=144:21></a> One's thought was that we might see briefly what the assembly was as seen in these three localities, so that we might learn in what is presented how to assemble, and hence how to be in the assembly and of the assembly, and what we are as of it.<a name=144:22></a>

		First you have in Thessalonica the work of God developing in a few weeks.<a name=145:1></a> The apostle, it says, "went in among them".<a name=145:2></a> In going in among them he acted somewhat in accord with the Lord during the forty days; He assembled with them.<a name=145:3></a> He moved about among them, and in doing so He would convey to them what it was to assemble.<a name=145:4></a> That is a point of great importance to note in regard of this subject, and it is well for young Christians especially to take account of how experienced ones act, because in the epistle to the Thessalonians the apostle says, "Ye became followers of us", and in their turn they themselves became models, "ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia".<a name=145:5></a> Then further it says, "Ye, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus".<a name=145:6></a> In that way the principle of example in spiritual things is set up in the Acts, and the principle, too, of following an example.<a name=145:7></a> Christianity is based more on that than on precept.<a name=145:8></a> The Lord brought in divine thoughts from heaven and exemplified them in the midst of His people, and the disciples thus became children of wisdom.<a name=145:9></a> In those who followed after the Lord -- the apostles -- the same thing was carried on, so that in a place like Thessalonica the disciples took note of what Paul did as well as of what he said.<a name=145:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=152:10></a> What you get in the book of Joshua, among many other things, is the idea of <i>springs</i>.<a name=152:11></a> Achsah says, "Give me springs of water".<a name=152:12></a> "And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs".<a name=152:13></a> The Spirit of God records that fact again in the book of Judges, and one has often wondered why it is so, why there is a second record of that simple occurrence.<a name=152:14></a> I think I see now the thought of it -- that the spirit of the assembly is set forth in Achsah; she had in view that there should be continual freshness, that, in spite of the decline, there should be the vigour of the spring.<a name=152:15></a> If you have that, you will have freshness and vigour among the saints.<a name=152:16></a> I have no doubt that John's ministry is intended to bring that about today.<a name=152:17></a> God reverted to that in Hosea when He said, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him"; at the time He spoke Ephraim had grown old; "Gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#7:9">Hosea  7:9</a>.<a name=152:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well known to us that the book of Numbers is distinctively a wilderness book.<a name=159:1></a> Being written like the other scriptures for our admonition, it particularly affords instruction as to exercise and conflict.<a name=159:2></a> The fact that the tabernacle was set up and the mind and heart of God disclosed, and that the people had moved on in the light of what the mountain of Jehovah represented, necessarily brought out the opposition of the enemy.<a name=159:3></a> You will recall how that, having remained in camp before the mountain of Jehovah for a long period, they set forward from that mount and the ark went before them to search out a resting place; and as the ark moved, Moses said, "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered".<a name=159:4></a> Thus the ark went before to scatter the enemies; the enemies being known to be there, they had to be scattered, in order that the people should pass on.<a name=159:5></a> We may reckon on this scattering of enemies, beloved brethren; indeed we could not be in the wilderness for God apart from it.<a name=159:6></a> It is the knowledge that the Lord goes before -- indeed, has gone before -- and that no enemy can stand before Him, which gives us resource.<a name=159:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But whilst this is so, we have to learn to heed the enemy; we have to learn war.<a name=159:8></a> You may remember that, at the outset, the Lord would not lead them by the way of enemies that they should not see war; He did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines lest they should be discouraged.<a name=159:9></a> God graciously takes account of our capabilities, and He does not allow us to be tempted above that we are able.<a name=159:10></a> Nevertheless we have to learn war, otherwise our names will not appear in the book of the wars of

		the Lord.<a name=160:1></a> The book of Numbers speaks of this book.<a name=160:2></a> We have all to face the solemn fact that identification with the testimony in this world involves warfare.<a name=160:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first great conflict, after the children of Israel came out of Egypt -- the conflict with Amalek -- God said that He would make war with Amalek from generation to generation.<a name=160:4></a> The believer has to learn what that means, that there is to be continual warfare with Amalek.<a name=160:5></a> Now this conflict with the Midianites affords perhaps the best illustration we could get of the nature of wilderness conflict.<a name=160:6></a> The conflict has its individual form and its collective form.<a name=160:7></a> The war with Amalek was an individual matter; it was a hidden thing.<a name=160:8></a> Some of us young people are engaged in it, and at the same time may maintain an outwardly placid exterior.<a name=160:9></a> We are engaged in continuous conflict within, with the flesh.<a name=160:10></a> It began, you will remember, after they had drunk of the water from the smitten rock.<a name=160:11></a> They drink of the rock, and immediately Amalek attacks, that is to say, as the young believer understands that he has the Spirit, and drinks of the Spirit, the enemy would attack him through the flesh.<a name=160:12></a> The conflict goes on, and there are certain features indicated in the chapter in which it is recounted which are most important to understand; I name two -- intercession and purity.<a name=160:13></a> Moses hands are uplifted, supported by Aaron and Hur; that is to say, you have the element of purity introduced, as well as that of priesthood and intercession.<a name=160:14></a> Hur means purity.<a name=160:15></a> It is therefore a question of your motives.<a name=160:16></a> You may not be intelligent as to the flesh that is working in you; you are painfully aware of it, but you do not understand its character and working.<a name=160:17></a> The apostle says, "I myself with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law".<a name=160:18></a> He carefully distinguishes his mind from the flesh in him, for he says, "I delight in the law of God after the inward man".<a name=160:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the battle with Amalek is a continuous one, for the Lord announced that He will carry on that conflict from generation to generation.<a name=161:1></a> I say particularly to young people -- see to it that in your minds you are pure, and be the conflict what it may, that your conscience is good.<a name=161:2></a> There is a beautiful word in John's epistle: "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin"; it does not say <i>sins</i> there; it refers to the evil present in us, of sin in us, and yet the conscience can be perfectly at rest through the precious blood of Christ.<a name=161:3></a> It cleanses from all sin, so that the enemy is defeated.<a name=161:4></a> If he can succeed in creating in you a bad conscience because of the existence of sin in you, he deceives you, but the answer to all his promptings is that wonderful statement, "The blood .<a name=161:5></a>.<a name=161:6></a>.<a name=161:7></a> cleanseth us from all sin", and thus we are preserved in fellowship; "we have fellowship one with another".<a name=161:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this conflict with Midian may be taken, as I have said, to fully represent wilderness warfare -- warfare which comes in not only after the drinking of the smitten rock (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>), but after the drinking of the well at Beer (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>); that is to say, it comes in after the believer has formally recognised the Holy Spirit here.<a name=161:9></a> "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it".<a name=161:10></a> It contemplates the saints as collectively possessing the Holy Spirit, and accordingly the enemy attacks first in a spiritual way, and then through the flesh.<a name=161:11></a> Now Balaam represents the enemy's strategy from the spiritual side.<a name=161:12></a> You will all remember how Balak employed this man of religious reputation to curse the people, that is to say, to move God against them.<a name=161:13></a> Now think of the boldness of our adversary; we must not under-estimate satanic power and boldness; we may be assured of it that he stops at nothing.<a name=161:14></a> Contemplate the boldness of the enemy in attempting to turn the mind of God against His people; it is a blind, futile effort, nevertheless it is a

		Some of us here have been recently occupied with the thought of the family.<a name=163:6></a> We have noted how the believer's household could contribute to the house of God -- a most interesting consideration.<a name=163:7></a> You recall how the principle of the household runs through the book of Genesis; how, when Methuselah was born to Enoch, Enoch began to walk with God, "And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years", we read; that is, if a child is given, the thought comes into the soul of the man of faith -- I must walk with God now if that child is to be for God; and if he is not to be for God, it were better that I never had him at all.<a name=163:8></a> But the possibility is that the child is to be for God, and if so, I must walk with God.<a name=163:9></a> So Enoch walked with God for three hundred years.<a name=163:10></a> What a long walk it was!<a name=163:11></a> But what an opportunity for Methuselah to see his father walk with God all these years.<a name=163:12></a> He lived six hundred and odd years after that, but in those three hundred years when he saw his father walk with God, what an opportunity he had to be a man of God!<a name=163:13></a> He did not see his father die; Enoch was not, for God took him.<a name=163:14></a> What light for Methuselah, and what light for all the children of believers if their parents walk with God.<a name=163:15></a>

		One other thought: the conflict results in contribution to the house of God.<a name=167:14></a> Read verses 50 - 53.<a name=167:15></a> We see there the aggregate of the spoil, but the aggregate is made up by each one taking spoil for himself.<a name=167:16></a> What have you got for yourself?<a name=167:17></a> What have you got out of it?<a name=167:18></a> Every exercise that comes up is intended to issue in spoil, and it is for each one to get something for himself; then we can count and see what the aggregate is.<a name=167:19></a> So we read that Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=167:20></a> The company is all the richer for it; the exercises result in the enrichment of the company.<a name=167:21></a> If not, the conflict, so far as you are concerned, is in vain; but if I have

		<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8:22">Mark  8:22</a> - 26
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two features which mark the gospel that I wish to refer to this evening amongst others, namely, that on the one hand, God in announcing His glad tidings draws near to men in Christ, so as to encourage confidence in Himself; and on the other hand, that He <i>works in men</i>.<a name=169:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, He would draw near to men in such wise as to disarm prejudice and induce confidence and self-judgment.<a name=169:2></a> Luke has this line particularly in view in his gospel, so that he presents the Lord as coming in in the simplest possible way, as the angel announced to the shepherds, "For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord".<a name=169:3></a> The shepherds were abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night, "and lo, an angel of the Lord was there by them".<a name=169:4></a> He was there to announce to them this wonderful news.<a name=169:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so throughout Luke's narrative we have the Lord coming near to man.<a name=169:6></a> He would go into the house of any one who invited Him; even if a proud Pharisee, such as Simon (chapter 7), invited Him.<a name=169:7></a> He would go in, in order to bring the wonderful grace that He had brought to earth to that man.<a name=169:8></a> Simon invited Him in a patronising kind of way.<a name=169:9></a> The Lord of glory was there.<a name=169:10></a> Simon did not know it, but He was there, and He brought to that board all the grace of heaven.<a name=169:11></a> He brought it there, and Simon could have it; He had brought it into his house, to his table.<a name=169:12></a> It was there for him, but Simon did not know it; he did not avail himself of what was there.<a name=169:13></a> Michael and Gabriel knew what was going on -- they knew who the Person present there was; Gabriel had announced His coming to Mary; they would, as

	<div class="paragraph">
		we may well assume, wonder at the Pharisee.<a name=170:1></a> The Lord of glory was there at Simon's table, but Simon did not know Him; he was utterly heedless, neither realising his own need, nor the grace that had come near to him.<a name=170:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Simon", the Lord says, "I have somewhat to say unto thee".<a name=170:3></a> Hearer, place yourself now in Simon's position.<a name=170:4></a> The Lord says, "There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.<a name=170:5></a> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both".<a name=170:6></a> Note the word 'frankly'.<a name=170:7></a> The grace of heaven had come nigh; it was by him.<a name=170:8></a> Sinner, the Lord would speak to you <i>now</i>.<a name=170:9></a> In Luke things are made present.<a name=170:10></a> The angel says, "Unto you is born <i>this day</i>".<a name=170:11></a> I say to you tonight, on the authority of Scripture, that not only is the Saviour born to you, but He has died and risen and gone to heaven.<a name=170:12></a> There could not possibly be a greater offer to you than this, for Christ, in whom is redemption and who gives the Spirit to men, is presented to you today.<a name=170:13></a> Are you prepared to receive Him?<a name=170:14></a> Simon was not.<a name=170:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord, when He spoke at Nazareth, said, "<i>This day</i> is this scripture fulfilled in your ears".<a name=170:16></a> But it is one thing to have it fulfilled in your <i>ears</i>, and another to have it fulfilled in your <i>heart</i>.<a name=170:17></a> Is the scripture that announces forgiveness fulfilled in your heart?<a name=170:18></a> Forgiveness is preached to you; "through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins".<a name=170:19></a> "Simon", says the Lord, "I have somewhat to say unto thee".<a name=170:20></a> And so He would speak to sinners here now.<a name=170:21></a> You owe five hundred pence, although perhaps on your own reckoning you owe but fifty.<a name=170:22></a> The woman owed five hundred; forgiveness is for her; her five hundred pence is wiped out, and your fifty pence debt is wiped out; you are both in the same position; both debtors were forgiven, for that

		is God's attitude today in grace.<a name=171:1></a> Not that Simon's debt was just a small debt.<a name=171:2></a> Another Pharisee, in a later day, who had come to reckon up his debt, said he was the "<i>chief of sinners</i>", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:15">1 Timothy  1:15</a>.<a name=171:3></a> Think of the depth of self-judgment that marked that man, who had called himself a Pharisee and the son of a Pharisee!<a name=171:4></a> Simon's estimate of himself could not be God's estimate; but whatever it was, the Lord said, "When they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both".<a name=171:5></a> So that remission was announced to Simon at his table.<a name=171:6></a> What an opportunity for him God remitted His claim against Simon.<a name=171:7></a> Think of the claims God has upon every one of us -- all guilty before Him; He remits those claims.<a name=171:8></a> He can do this righteously, for Christ gave Himself a ransom for <i>all</i>.<a name=171:9></a> The Lord directed "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=171:10></a> Consider it!<a name=171:11></a> God remits His claim against you through the death of Christ, that He might give you the Holy Spirit and that you might be free to serve Him.<a name=171:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is how the matter stands.<a name=171:13></a> Luke pursues that line.<a name=171:14></a> And when afterwards the house is brought in, he says, "Come, for all things are now ready".<a name=171:15></a> But alas!<a name=171:16></a> they all began to make excuse; then the master of the house says to his servant, "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring here the poor and crippled and lame and blind", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14:21">Luke  14:21</a>.<a name=171:17></a> Now think of the forbearing grace of God, as Luke presents it.<a name=171:18></a> The city was Jerusalem, where Jesus had been put to death.<a name=171:19></a> The leaders had already been addressed by God's messengers -- the prophets -- and they had killed one after another.<a name=171:20></a> Now God says, "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind".<a name=171:21></a> He pursues men into the lanes.<a name=171:22></a> The preaching was to begin at Jerusalem; whether it was the high priest,

	<div class="paragraph">
		or Pilate, or Herod, or the scribes or Pharisees -- they were <i>all</i> bidden.<a name=172:1></a> But then the grace pursued the men in the streets and lanes of the city -- "the dregs of society", as they would be regarded.<a name=172:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the other side, the second feature I have already indicated, is that the gospel involves God's work in men's souls.<a name=172:3></a> John presents the gospel from that side, and so the Lord, according to John, says, "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him".<a name=172:4></a> You may say, I do not realise the drawing; but if you have a thirst after righteousness, any craving after God, then I would encourage you by letting you know that that is the effect of God's work in your soul.<a name=172:5></a> God is working with you; the very fact that you are here tonight may be taken as an evidence of the work of God in you.<a name=172:6></a> If you have come to spend an hour religiously there is no moral value in that; but if you have come with any kind of desire to hear the word of God, then I say, God is working with you.<a name=172:7></a> The flesh would not have brought it about; it is the work of God.<a name=172:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is a third feature mentioned, and that is what you get in Mark; that not only has God drawn near to man, but that the evangelical spirit is in the world today.<a name=172:9></a> What you see here in chapter 8 is that others brought the blind man to the Lord.<a name=172:10></a> It does not say the Lord found him, nor does it say that he sought or found the Lord.<a name=172:11></a> "They" -- whoever they were -- brought him to Jesus.<a name=172:12></a> God's work in His people leads them into sympathy with you; I believe that God would effect in us all that evangelical spirit.<a name=172:13></a> The need around us is appalling; there is blindness, deafness, dumbness and lameness; there is leprosy and palsy and what not.<a name=172:14></a> All these spiritual maladies prevail; have we got a heart?<a name=172:15></a> Here they bring him to the Lord.<a name=172:16></a> Those who brought the blind man to the Lord had an evangelical spirit.<a name=172:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said that I shall dwell now on how the Lord treats this blind man.<a name=173:1></a> Those who brought him besought Jesus to touch him.<a name=173:2></a> There is not one Christian here who may not be engaged in this blessed work.<a name=173:3></a> There is no gift necessary for it; not but that the Lord furnishes every one with a certain gift, for every one of us has received grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a>), but for such work as this you do not need a special gift.<a name=173:4></a> What you need for it is a <i>love for souls</i>.<a name=173:5></a> As we Christians know, there are such things as love to God, love to Christ, love to one another; but then there is also the love that God has manifested to the world.<a name=173:6></a> It is a love that rises above the sin of the world and takes account of the need of men; it is, in other words, what we may call an evangelical love.<a name=173:7></a> The apostle, writing to Titus, speaks about "the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:4">Titus  3:4</a>.<a name=173:8></a> That is the love that takes account of need as it is in men, whoever they may be.<a name=173:9></a> God is no respecter of persons, and therefore there is not a believer in this company or in the world who may not be engaged in the service indicated in verse 22.<a name=173:10></a> "They bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him".<a name=173:11></a> We can all do that service; it may be wife, or husband, or child, son or daughter, neighbour, employer or employee -- we can bring them to the Lord, we can pray for them.<a name=173:12></a> Every one of us may be engaged in this service of which Mark speaks.<a name=173:13></a>

		We have been dwelling this afternoon on the Thessalonian saints; they were said to be "in God the Father".<a name=179:1></a> The apostle further says that they were "beloved by God".<a name=179:2></a> The secret of that is that they were lovers of God.<a name=179:3></a> Let us not rest in the thought of the supremacy of love as it is in God; let us be concerned about being lovers of God.<a name=179:4></a> Paul speaks of "those who love God".<a name=179:5></a> And so John is said to be, and speaks of himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=179:6></a> Can we doubt that Jesus loved Peter, or James, or Matthew?<a name=179:7></a> No; He loved them all.<a name=179:8></a> Why then is John singled out as one loved?<a name=179:9></a> Because he was lovable.<a name=179:10></a> He was in the bosom of Jesus; he had access to His heart, and the Lord loved him; he had contemplated the glory of the One on whose breast he leaned.<a name=179:11></a> John would be detained as he observed the movements of this One -- movements such as no other could exhibit.<a name=179:12></a> He was cast upon God from the beginning.<a name=179:13></a> John does not say, "The Word became <i>man</i>", he says, "The Word became <i>flesh</i>".<a name=179:14></a> He refers to the incarnation.<a name=179:15></a> The infancy, boyhood, and manhood of Christ -- all these are included in the thought of "flesh", and in all these relations He was to be contemplated.<a name=179:16></a>

		So John takes note of things; he would observe what occurred before his eyes, and in observing, he discovered that the relations of this One, an outcast here, were as of an only one with a father.<a name=179:17></a> He was the object of the supreme love of heaven; the Father cared for Him as an only One.<a name=179:18></a> He had a glory that belonged to Him as Son, but a glory that could be and was contemplated, so that John, in a special way, became a son of light.<a name=179:19></a> The light was available; it appeared in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not, but he apprehended it, and contemplated the glory of the Person, and says of Him.<a name=179:20></a> He was "full of grace and truth".<a name=179:21></a>

		love to convey to you by the Spirit what that life was here that is said to have been the "light of men".<a name=180:1></a> But I will confine myself to the effect of it on those who came under its beams, and so my thought is to trace out as briefly as possible how we become sons of light in the varied relationships in which we are found in this world; for it is obvious that if God has caused light to shine it must affect us in every relationship in which we are placed legitimately as down here.<a name=180:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you look at chapter 1, you will see that what God has in His mind to reach is stated almost at the outset, namely, that there should be a family of children here in this world: "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God", as if to intimate the honour conferred on such; they should be given a title to take the place of children of God.<a name=180:3></a> Then again, "who have been born, not of blood nor of flesh's will nor of man's will, but of God".<a name=180:4></a> That is the object of the gospel, one may say, set out from the very beginning, that there should be in this world a people who received Christ; it is not here who believe the gospel; the point with John is the Person, the reception of the Person, "as many as received <i>him</i>".<a name=180:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show you how the light affected those who came under its influence in every relationship in which they were set in this world.<a name=180:6></a> First of all I would refer to chapter 4, where I think we see how we become sons of light in regard to our <i>bodies</i>.<a name=180:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord says in the passage I read in chapter 12, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light".<a name=180:8></a> His thought was that His people should be in this world, not exactly sons of God, but "sons of light" -- that is, formed <i>intelligently</i> by the light, for that is what I apprehend by a son of light.<a name=180:9></a> So the first relation in which I am set is in respect of my body; I am in a body here; I have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Corinthians teaches us that the body is the Lord's.<a name=181:4></a> Think of having a vessel here in which a divine treasure is set, as the apostle says, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels".<a name=181:5></a> How important, therefore, that I should be right in regard to this.<a name=181:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>we are told that "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin"; that is, it is wholly indifferent, unaffected by what is of time; my body is dead; "but the Spirit life on account of righteousness", and in the power of that Spirit I present my body a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God.<a name=181:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to the woman of Samaria, who came out of the city to draw water with her water-pot.<a name=181:8></a> Jesus sat just as He was on the well, and He was weary.<a name=181:9></a> The Lord knew weariness, but He was not too weary to cause the light to shine.<a name=181:10></a> He spoke to the woman about the living water; the water which "I shall give him shall become <i>in him</i> [He refers to the body] a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life".<a name=181:11></a> What a body!<a name=181:12></a> Think of the transformation of that sin-worn body, now to become a body marked by living water.<a name=181:13></a> So it says she <i>left her water-pot</i>; she caught the Lord's thought.<a name=181:14></a> Have we?<a name=181:15></a> She might have filled her water-pot, but the Spirit of God says she <i>left</i> it.<a name=181:16></a> There is a spiritual thought in that; her body was now to be the vessel, so she went into the town and said to the men, "Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?<a name=181:17></a>" The Christ is the One who can use our bodies, for it is not only that He <i>tells</i> us all things, but He <i>does</i> all things for God, and He is pleased to use our bodies for God, and that woman enters at

		The next thought that one may refer to in regard to the light has reference to a man in his house.<a name=182:3></a> If I have learnt to offer my body to God as a living sacrifice, then that should be immediately manifest in my house.<a name=182:4></a> Those in my house will take notice of it first; so in the same chapter you have the case of the nobleman.<a name=182:5></a> You will remember how that his son was at the point of death, so he goes to Jesus and says to Him, "Come down ere my child die"; the Lord immediately says, "Go, thy son lives".<a name=182:6></a> The Lord uses the word 'son', He would have that man and his house in a new way; he would be henceforth a believer, and thus he would belong to the true nobility of God.<a name=182:7></a> Therefore the Lord uses another word from that of 'child'; He says, "thy son".<a name=182:8></a> The man went down to Capernaum to be met by his servants with the good news that his child lived.<a name=182:9></a> The nobleman was occupied with his own generation, but it is not to be his; it is to be God's generation, and God's generation is truly noble.<a name=182:10></a> So the word 'son' is used -- a son made to live by Christ.<a name=182:11></a> The Lord made no mistake in calling him son.<a name=182:12></a> Those of us who are parents, who have children truly affected by Christ, know that they are no longer merely our children; they have taken on a new nobility; no longer a child, but a brother truly.<a name=182:13></a> And so it says the man "inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better.<a name=182:14></a> And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.<a name=182:15></a> The father therefore knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house".<a name=182:16></a>

		The next case is the man in chapter 9.<a name=185:3></a> You will remember that he was one in whom the works of God were to be manifested.<a name=185:4></a> Think of yourself -- let me think of myself -- as one in whom the works of God are to be manifested.<a name=185:5></a> Think of the universe: it is not said to be that in which the works of God are manifested, although it is wonderful beyond our comprehension.<a name=185:6></a> Think of the Spirit of God taking a poor blind man and saying that he was not blind because he or his parents had sinned, but because the works of God were to be manifested in him.<a name=185:7></a> So in the end of the chapter he comes out as a son of light in regard of a new order of things, for the works of God cannot be connected with this present world system; even the very heavens and the earth themselves are reserved to be burned up; but in regard of the spiritual world -- the new order which God will bring in -- it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel in that day, "What hath God wrought"!<a name=185:8></a> The works of God in me have reference to another world altogether, where all things are of Him.<a name=185:9></a>

		Now we get the final thought in chapter 12, where all this culminates, for John builds up a structure from the very outset, and thus if we are sons of light in these varied relations, we get them all put together in chapter 12 in the family.<a name=186:19></a> You will recall how the family at Bethany had no head.<a name=186:20></a> It was a family of two sisters and one brother -- a headless family -- and the Lord comes in.<a name=186:21></a> The Lord knows what the end is to be.<a name=186:22></a> At the beginning of chapter 11 it says Bethany was the town of Mary and her sister Martha, and it was that Mary which anointed the Lord's feet whose brother Lazarus was sick.<a name=186:23></a> All that happened was in

		I have in mind to speak about the subject of life -- as a believer enters into it, and as it is seen in a company of believers.<a name=189:3></a> We have first to learn life individually, and then we gravitate towards others who have it; so that we see it in a company, and as in a company we see it in the present provisional state of things in a locality; there is the idea of life in a locality.<a name=189:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this way John supports the local economy of the assembly as presented in 1 Corinthians, for outward order, as seen in the meetings, can afford but little for God unless there be life.<a name=189:5></a> God looks for that; He looks for correspondence in us here with the life of Christ -- the green.<a name=189:6></a> God looks for <i>life</i>; the world will abound with it soon; not only spiritually, but as righteousness prevails life in every form will abound in the world.<a name=189:7></a> This earth is in for a wonderful time, for God has it in mind to exhibit life.<a name=189:8></a> The millennial day is really in the form of an exhibition -- it is not a final state of things; it is an order of things in which God will exhibit what He can do.<a name=189:9></a> In removing death, and in the establishing of righteousness on the earth, God will show what He can do even on the present earth before it is changed.<a name=189:10></a> And God can effect more in us, by reason of our great calling, than He will effect in the future; by reason of the fact that we have a heavenly calling, and are left down here, life takes on a more dignified, and extensive, and varied form, than it will in the millennium; so that you can understand that the saints of God as left here are to know how to move about in the power of life.<a name=189:11></a> They are to add to it,

		The intention was that life should be in individuals, and also that it should be in companies, and as in companies, in localities, so that the truth of the assembly, or the structure as set up by the apostle Paul, is supported to the end by the presence of life in the saints.<a name=190:6></a> You see, if one go to sleep (and many of the Lord's people have gone to sleep) like Eutychus, through not being able to enjoy the ministry, if they are recovered they are presented alive.<a name=190:7></a> It says of Eutychus that he was presented "alive".<a name=190:8></a> The assembly at Troas would be wonderfully augmented by the presence of a youth like that.<a name=190:9></a> The boy had fallen down through negligence, but he is restored by Paul, and presented alive.<a name=190:10></a>

		The writings of John are of such importance because they work out the great principles of life in individuals, and if I have got life individually, I stand; but if I am among those who live, I can stand much more effectively and firmly, and in a much more dignified way.<a name=190:11></a> Now chapter 8 is remarkable in this way, that it comes in after the Lord had

		opened out the great principles that underlie life.<a name=191:1></a> There are new birth, the uplifting of the Son of man, living water, the quickening power of the Son, the food that sustains the life, and the Holy Spirit come down from heaven, the power for public testimony.<a name=191:2></a> After these principles are enunciated by the Lord, we have this statement: "I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life"; that is to say, He is moving, and those who follow have the light of life, hence any follower of Jesus as the light of the world cannot remain in associations which are devoid of life.<a name=191:3></a> He has got light as to them and he compares the light with the conditions where he is, and he discerns that the light is not in these.<a name=191:4></a> You may take the most antiquated society in this land, or in any other land, and examine it, and you will find it has not the conditions of life.<a name=191:5></a> None of the religious societies have the conditions of life, though there may be that which appears to have some virtue in them.<a name=191:6></a> There are the great religious bodies, but one of them at least is apostate, and in the Revelation it says, "and her children will I kill with death", chapter 2: 23.<a name=191:7></a> Apostasy prevails in that system, and hence no one can live there.<a name=191:8></a> You will die there for want of breath, for want of good air, and light and food, and the same thing in measure applies in all the organisations of men, whatever their names.<a name=191:9></a> It is as well we should be plain, because, if we have got the light of life, we cannot stay where the conditions of life are not found.<a name=191:10></a> You will pardon the exhortation, but you cannot remain in associations where the conditions of life are not found, so the Lord says, "He that follows me shall not walk in darkness".<a name=191:11></a> It is not only that the conditions of life are absent, but there is in these human organisations the authority of darkness.<a name=191:12></a> That word in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>is to be noted; it says, "Giving thanks to the Father .<a name=191:13></a>.<a name=191:14></a>.<a name=191:15></a> who has delivered us from

		J.T.<a name=200:1></a> It seemed to me that some consideration of the subject of levitical service would be helpful at the present time, and the question was whether it should be taken up from the official side or from the moral aspect, and I thought John presents things in the latter way as in a day of brokenness.<a name=200:2></a> We have to arrive at the truth now through him, so that, in referring to those who serve, he avoids official designations and brings forward vessels who are moved at the outset more from instinct and affection.<a name=200:3></a> He begins with one -- John the baptist -- who had a very great official place, but in recording the facts relative to his ministry, he emphasises John's own estimate of himself, which showed that he had a true estimate of himself and avoided the snares that were laid for him.<a name=200:4></a> He records of him: "He confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ".<a name=200:5></a> So as to the Lord's conversation with this woman of Samaria; the result in her, I thought, suggested how in a broken day the Levitical service begins.<a name=200:6></a> We see the need and we are impelled, according to our measure, to meet it, without assuming anything beyond that.<a name=200:7></a> This woman was serving; the official ones were out of communion.<a name=200:8></a> They wondered that He talked with a woman.<a name=200:9></a> They had been occupied in an expedition to buy meat while He was carrying on alone the work of God; so the incident leads to His calling their attention to the fact that they were entering on other men's labours; they were not the starters of the movement.<a name=200:10></a> Do you catch what is in my mind?<a name=200:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=216:1></a> For those who were not present at the last meeting, I would say we are considering the subject of the Levites and their service.<a name=216:2></a> It was thought that, as with all other subjects, we have, in order to understand it rightly, to approach it through John's writings, because of the brokenness of the present state of things; so that John names certain ones as coming forward and serving without any direct commission, but as the result of the light that came to them.<a name=216:3></a> As an example, Andrew went out and found Peter, Philip found Nathanael, and the woman of Sychar returned to the city and addressed herself to the men, telling them about the Lord.<a name=216:4></a> The object of John in recording this subject, as in all others, is to show that it is progressive; so that the woman in chapter 4, being set right as to her vessel, left her water-pot and went her way into the city; then chapter 6 shows that the vessel being secured, the Levite apprehends Christ as the "holy one of God", recognising that the work of God is carried on in holiness.<a name=216:5></a> The levitical activity is shown, too, to be the outcome and result of love, that is, the Lord probes Peter as to loving Him and then commits the sheep and the lambs to him.<a name=216:6></a> Then John is seen as one that is following the Lord.<a name=216:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought now is to look at Mark and see how the Levites are recognised officially; how they come into evidence in an official way, and for that they come under the Lord's direct influence and training.<a name=216:8></a> That is why I suggested chapter 3; it refers to the Lord's sovereign selection: "That he might send them forth to preach".<a name=216:9></a> I thought the occasion arises from being with Him on the mount.<a name=216:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=217:5></a> Quite.<a name=217:6></a> The Holy Spirit records that he remained certain days with the disciples and then preached in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=217:7></a> In the ordinary version it says that Saul inquired of the Lord what he should do, but verse 6 of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>does not appear in the original: not that Saul did not ask, but the Holy Spirit appears to have left it out at the outset, therefore showing in greater relief the fact that he <i>acted of himself</i> in preaching in the synagogues.<a name=217:8></a> And then we are told that he went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, showing how wise he was in recognising the particular vessel already in active service.<a name=217:9></a> It appears, too, that Peter took notice of the progress the testimony was making, for in raising up Aeneas he says, "Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed", as if to say the order now is to learn to do things for oneself.<a name=217:10></a> Then he restores Tabitha from the dead and presents her alive.<a name=217:11></a> All that I think serves to enhance Paul's visit to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter.<a name=217:12></a> The testimony would move on in that way in happy fellowship.<a name=217:13></a> But still he has to wait, and Barnabas finds him at Tarsus and brings him to Antioch, and he remains there for a year serving the saints with Barnabas.<a name=217:14></a> Then the Holy Spirit says when they were ministering to the Lord: "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them"; that is, the servants are now ready; the saints have had full opportunity to be acquainted with them and the Holy Spirit gives this charge.<a name=217:15></a> It was the sovereign act of the Spirit to call them out and send them forth.<a name=217:16></a> And so I think the apostle Paul may be taken as a

		In seeking to minister one always has in mind that we know in part.<a name=231:1></a> In the epistles the truth is presented in this way -- in part -- the Spirit of God taking account of our limitations so that we minister according to our capacity, having in view that in due time "we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>.<a name=231:2></a> As arriving at this, we are in a position to read the gospels rightly.<a name=231:3></a> We may read them as we read the epistles, in order to obtain help in our souls, but to read them rightly we have to take up the divine point of view and to see that in becoming Man the Son of God had in view the carrying out of the entire will of God.<a name=231:4></a> He refers, in spirit, in the Psalms to a book in which it had been written of Him that a body should be prepared for Him in which He would do the will of God, in which, indeed, He would delight to do it, so that there should be no item of that will neglected or unaccomplished; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:7">Psalm  40:7</a>, 8.<a name=231:5></a> We are therefore on a much wider platform in the gospels than we are in the epistles.<a name=231:6></a>

		The gospels present the incarnation of Christ and the death of Christ in connection with the whole will of God, and consequently with the whole work of God; they, therefore, become the solid food by which full-grown men are sustained, and as thus sustained are instructed in all His mind.<a name=231:7></a> Hence the Lord says in the gospel of John (chapter 4), "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me".<a name=231:8></a> We have to understand what His meat was.<a name=231:9></a> What did He live on?<a name=231:10></a> The disciples had gone away into the city to buy meat, and having returned they propose to the Lord that

		He should eat, and so He makes this remarkable statement which is full of spiritual import as to what a man who is here for God is to be sustained by "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and <i>to finish</i> his work".<a name=232:1></a> It was to be finished; every thought of God will find its completion in Christ.<a name=232:2></a> He is on the way to that; things are not all done yet, but He speaks in this gospel of having finished the work which is given Him to do; He speaks thus in anticipation, referring to the cross and all that preceded it.<a name=232:3></a> In detail there is much to be done, and so He is not found sitting; <i>He stood</i> in the midst, and indeed He is on the way yet to the completion of the work, and He would have us with Him in what He is doing.<a name=232:4></a>

		What I wanted to point out from the passage I read was that He would have us to understand the dignity that attaches to us whilst still in this world.<a name=232:5></a> Our dignity in the future will be indisputable, we shall come out in wonderful dignity; it is said of the holy city that it <i>descends</i> from God out of heaven, having the glory of God, and her light like unto a stone most precious.<a name=232:6></a> (See <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:10">Revelation  21:10</a>, 11.<a name=232:7></a>) There will be no question at all as to her dignity then, but the Lord would have us to understand that there is a dignity now, even whilst in the same circumstances in which we were converted, for it is not the thought of God to change these circumstances.<a name=232:8></a> His thought is to change <i>us as in them</i>; and so Lazarus came out of the tomb into his old circumstances, he came out with his <i>graveclothes on</i>.<a name=232:9></a> The Son of God in coming out of the grave Himself, came out <i>without them</i>, and He remains without them.<a name=232:10></a> He entered into new conditions, new circumstances, and He remains in these.<a name=232:11></a> But in His ministry here He was in very lowly guise.<a name=232:12></a> John presents Him to us at the well of Sychar; he says, "Jesus .<a name=232:13></a>.<a name=232:14></a>.<a name=232:15></a> being wearied .<a name=232:16></a>.<a name=232:17></a>.<a name=232:18></a> sat thus on the well".<a name=232:19></a> He sat on it as He was; He was weary.<a name=232:20></a>

		I read these two passages because they are clearly linked together in the most intimate way as dealing with the same subject, and I would remark as regards the book of Job that it stands out as an independent witness.<a name=241:5></a> We have been speaking this afternoon of the Lord moving out into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon; He had previously sent out His apostles, and had listened to the reports of their labours, and then invited them into the desert to rest awhile, but He by Himself and of Himself -- as far as the record goes -- rose up and went away thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, that is, He reserved the right of His sovereignty in His labours.<a name=241:6></a> He was not limited to those whom He had chosen and whom He had ordained, and whom indeed He had found effective in their service.<a name=241:7></a> He would place Himself within the range of the Gentiles.<a name=241:8></a> And so, too, in taking up Abraham of old, God shows in other and independent witnesses that He was then acting in sovereignty.<a name=241:9></a> Abraham had been called out and the God of glory

		Christ in heaven -- the Son of man who is in heaven -- He is operating in <i>all</i> the earth, and in the light of heaven, so we must not for a moment limit God, for He is sovereign.<a name=243:1></a> In Abraham's day He had Melchisedec and His Job, and we must ever remember and make room for such witnesses.<a name=243:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if Melchisedec represents God's rights, Job represents the patience of God in His love, working in discipline, so that Job should be blessed in his latter end; and that is a principle of God's dealings with every one of us, and what is so remarkable is that while Melchisedec is in an official position, Job is seen in connection with the family of God.<a name=243:3></a> The family is a primary thought with God, and we see how it comes into evidence in this remarkable book -- Job -- just as it does in the passage in Hebrews.<a name=243:4></a> We read that there was a day in which the sons of God came to appear before Him.<a name=243:5></a> We may speculate as to their identity, but let us just leave the word in its own dignity as it stands.<a name=243:6></a> God had His sons, God has His sons, and God will have His sons for ever.<a name=243:7></a> He reminds Job of them in speaking to him; almost the first word that is addressed to Job is in regard of the foundations of the earth, when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy -- mark, <i>all</i> of them.<a name=243:8></a> Thus God intimates at once to His child with whom He was dealing and whom He is about to bring into this great dignity in principle, that all His sons were sympathetic with Him at the beginning.<a name=243:9></a> It was as if He said to Job, You are not in sympathy.<a name=243:10></a> It may be there are many like that here, they are not in sympathy.<a name=243:11></a> God is a Father and a father yearns for sons and for sons' affections.<a name=243:12></a> We read of Him naming every family in the heavens and in the earth.<a name=243:13></a> What a domain, what circles of affection there will be!<a name=243:14></a> all in their measure answering to God.<a name=243:15></a> He has accorded that place to us and addresses us in the light of sonship.<a name=243:16></a> "Ye are all

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, while addressing us in the full height of our dignity, He would have us to accept that the realisation of that depends on chastisement.<a name=244:5></a> "If ye endure for chastening, God conducts himself towards you as towards sons; for who is the son that the father chastens not?<a name=244:6></a> But if ye are without chastening, of which all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons".<a name=244:7></a> And so God reminds Job that at the beginning of His operations, <i>all</i> the sons were in sympathy.<a name=244:8></a> Not only were they in sympathy secretly, but they <i>shouted</i>, they "shouted for joy", He says.<a name=244:9></a> What a remarkable witness that is to the wonderful sympathy of the sons of God in what He was about to do, and so He would bring us now into sympathy as sons with the great work He is carrying on in this world.<a name=244:10></a>

		Now, I need not go into details, but I want to show you the results as briefly as possible, how that God turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends.<a name=244:11></a> It is an important thing to have friends, but we are in danger if we have only three.<a name=244:12></a> Job had three according to their own profession.<a name=244:13></a> They came each from his own place by appointment, to condole with Job and to comfort him, but they had no power to condole and no power to comfort.<a name=244:14></a> Ability to criticise and to impute motives, to say right things in a wrong way and with a wrong application, they had in abundance.<a name=244:15></a> Such may our professed friends be: but we see how God Himself took up the work which the friends were incapable of accomplishing; and the Spirit of God tells us that God turned the

		captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends.<a name=245:1></a> One thanks God for the fact that Christians are friends; we should regard each other, beloved, in that light; it is a poor thing if we cannot befriend each other, but then there are those in that position who, alas!<a name=245:2></a> are unable to do the part of friends; as I said, they can criticise and speak eloquently and at length, and say right things with a wrong application, but this is sure to induce resentment, and it tests us as to how we can regard them when they prove otherwise than we expected.<a name=245:3></a> No one can comfort us, no one can mourn rightly with us save one who knows the compassions of God.<a name=245:4></a> The compassions of God found expression in Christ in His death, and as one who desired to comfort the saints tells us, he had been brought down to death itself, despairing even of life (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1">2 Corinthians  1</a>), but he trusted in God, who raises the dead, and the comfort accruing from God Himself in "so great a death", as he calls it, enabled him to comfort others.<a name=245:5></a> He was truly a friend of the Corinthians, although he said, "The more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved".<a name=245:6></a> They had a friend in him who was closer than a brother; and so, as I said, Job's misplaced confidence in his friends arouses resentment, and we see the results of it.<a name=245:7></a> But later Job prays for them, and that is a great moral victory, that is worth knowing.<a name=245:8></a> <i>All</i> of us are in the school of God, the school of His discipline, and we cannot get on together unless we learn to overcome evil with good.<a name=245:9></a> It is the knowledge of God and of His compassions, as seen in Christ, that enables us to overcome evil with good.<a name=245:10></a> Job is true to this, for it says he prayed for his three friends, and God took note of that.<a name=245:11></a> There may be those who have betrayed my confidence and who instead of yielding love have yielded hatred and criticism.<a name=245:12></a> How do I regard them?<a name=245:13></a> Job prayed for his three friends.<a name=245:14></a> What a word that is!<a name=245:15></a> I do not know of any greater service that any

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now leading on from that I want to show how Job being restored was brought into fellowship, as we speak.<a name=246:5></a> It says that the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before; he is not coming back in poverty; as his captivity is turned he is enriched, he has got substance.<a name=246:6></a> In Proverbs wisdom says, "I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance".<a name=246:7></a> A truly restored person is enriched divinely and he shows it.<a name=246:8></a> He is not demanding of others now, he is not complaining, he has got enough and to spare, he has twice as much as he had before.<a name=246:9></a> Thus we read, "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.<a name=246:10></a> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house .<a name=246:11></a>.<a name=246:12></a>.<a name=246:13></a> every one also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold", or as it is more properly rendered, "a golden ring", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:10">Job  42:10</a>, 11.<a name=246:14></a> Think of that, dear brethren.<a name=246:15></a> There can be nothing lost; the way of love ensures that, and if there be any one here who is in this case, in any special way, I would urge you to be patient and look out for your brethren; they are going to come; you will be tested, for they have been with God about you, but they are going to come to you.<a name=246:16></a> Job had already shown that he was learning the great lesson

	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of the inheritance came in with Abraham, and it is connected with the gospel.<a name=260:4></a> The Lord said that those who believed should receive an inheritance, and it is that which renders us independent of what we may have, or what may be in prospect, as after the flesh, setting us up in spiritual independence.<a name=260:5></a> Ephesians speaks of <i>our</i> inheritance, meaning that we who form the church have something altogether to ourselves -- a special portion that belongs to us; and besides that we have what others will have, and we have that in the meanwhile in a provisional way.<a name=260:6></a>

		Is the inheritance a gift?<a name=260:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, in a way it is, but it comes in rather through relationship.<a name=260:8></a> "If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ".<a name=260:9></a> That is how we come into it; but then there is an inheritance which we come into through redemption; the Lord said to Paul when He told him for what purpose He had appeared unto him, "That they may receive remission of sins, and inheritance", without specifying what it is.<a name=260:10></a>

		I was going to ask if you were referring, when you spoke of receiving an inheritance, to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26">Acts  26</a>, when the Lord said to the apostle Paul, "That they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me"?<a name=261:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=273:4></a> I thought we might be helped in looking into John's reference to the work of God as underlying all dispensations, and as unaffected by conditions occasioned by failure on man's part.<a name=273:5></a> The Lord said, according to John, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work".<a name=273:6></a> The Father had been working, and in contemplating it, we have to begin with Genesis; although this reference goes further back.<a name=273:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=273:10></a> Yes.<a name=273:11></a> We have to take account of Genesis, especially because there it is that God began to operate in the heavens and the earth which we know.<a name=273:12></a> And the idea of seed is introduced and continued, each after its kind.<a name=273:13></a> Then we have the idea of "a wholly right seed" in Israel; <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:21">Jeremiah  2:21</a>.<a name=273:14></a> Abraham was this seed; Jeremiah refers to the nation as planted in the land.<a name=273:15></a> But what was sown in Genesis bears fruit in Exodus, in which book we see God as He was revealed to Moses, i.<a name=273:16></a>e.<a name=273:17></a>, "I AM"; and then what He <i>had</i> been: the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and then how He should be known, His name would be His <i>memorial</i> unto all generations.<a name=273:18></a> So that in entering into relationship with His people He was to be known as the present living God -- "I AM".<a name=273:19></a> They were to understand what He was, and what He should be, from the knowledge that He imparted to them as to His present being: "I AM".<a name=273:20></a> So it works out, that the way in which we know God <i>now</i> (any one of us), is the measure in which we know what He was, and what He shall be.<a name=273:21></a>

		Then Moses in his prayer in the Psalms (the Psalms present the experimental side, the Pentateuch being more the revelation of God) says, "From everlasting to everlasting thou art God", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90:2">Psalm  90:2</a>.<a name=274:1></a> God would, I think, lead His people to such a knowledge of Himself that there should be "men of God"; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90">Psalm  90</a>is "a prayer of Moses, the man of God", and in that prayer he expresses what God was to His people: "Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations .<a name=274:2></a>.<a name=274:3></a>.<a name=274:4></a> from everlasting to everlasting thou art God".<a name=274:5></a> It is the knowledge of God in that way that enables the believer when things have broken down, to be restful; because he sees things as from the beginning.<a name=274:6></a> As John says here, "In the beginning".<a name=274:7></a> From the beginning God operated even in the material system; if chaos ensued He did not desist, because Genesis opens with the fact of the Spirit of God hovering over the face of the waters.<a name=274:8></a> There may be patience on God's part in His work, but His work proceeds.<a name=274:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=274:13></a> Yes, man was in view.<a name=274:14></a> Proverbs helps in respect of that, and so in our chapter, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men", verse 4.<a name=274:15></a> Man was in view; so that if we have the statement that without Him not one thing received being which has received being, it says, "In him was life and the life was the light of men".<a name=274:16></a> That being set down at the outset, we may be sure that the thought of God is to bring about a response to that light in men.<a name=274:17></a> Hence the first requirement in the operations, as we know them historically is -- "God said, Let there be light"; He commanded that light should shine out of darkness.<a name=274:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=276:17></a> That is the principle, exactly.<a name=276:18></a> John is the expansion of Moses; Moses says, What shall I say unto the people who sent me?<a name=276:19></a> He says, "I AM", go tell them that.<a name=276:20></a> You see, it is not what I was, or what I shall be, it is what I am.<a name=276:21></a> That is what God would bring us to; it is what He is.<a name=276:22></a> And now in the knowledge or measure in which you know Him you understand what is past.<a name=276:23></a> So in sending the message to Israel He said, tell them "I AM" hath sent you; and then He says, Tell them, moreover, that the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath sent you; and tell them another thing, that this is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3:14">Exodus  3:14</a>, 15.<a name=276:24></a> That is the position in Exodus.<a name=276:25></a> But that position is now much

		J.T.<a name=277:6></a> Yes; so that John's gospel you might say, is the most profound of all Scripture, and yet the most simple in its language.<a name=277:7></a> It is the most difficult to grasp because it supposes the knowledge of God.<a name=277:8></a> So that starting out from that basis, he takes you back to the beginning, and he takes you on to the end; that is to say, you are engaged with God whose operations underlie all dispensations.<a name=277:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is as knowing Him there in His nearness to you that you would follow this.<a name=278:3></a> Early in the 13th chapter we read, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God, rises from supper and lays aside his garments".<a name=278:4></a> This gospel enables us to stand and see that the work of God proceeds; there is no cessation in it really, and its results are in life.<a name=278:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=278:8></a> That is it.<a name=278:9></a> It is not that these things were written merely in a provisional way to meet the needs of the saints then; God was speaking from His own standpoint.<a name=278:10></a> It is all out now.<a name=278:11></a> But what was spoken then was part and parcel of what is now, and what was done then is what is done now.<a name=278:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=287:3></a> The thought that I had arose from <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3">Exodus  3</a>.<a name=287:4></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3">Exodus  3</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90">Psalm  90</a>put together enable us to gather what light Moses had; the Psalm indicating that he had come to the knowledge of God in so far as was possible.<a name=287:5></a> There is in that way a correspondence between the Pentateuch and John's gospel, and the Psalms and John's epistle.<a name=287:6></a> Moses in the Pentateuch gives an account of things as they were; he writes by the Spirit, from the knowledge he had of God, and he brings God in: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<a name=287:7></a> And the earth was waste, and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.<a name=287:8></a> And God said, Let there be light, and there was light", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a> - 3.<a name=287:9></a> He brings God in; but he brings Him in as One known, not only as the One who dwelt in the bush, but as One who was known to him in the tabernacle.<a name=287:10></a> That is, God had come within his range.<a name=287:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He led his flock to the back side of the desert, to Horeb the mount of God, and the bush burned, the "thorn-bush"; God had come into that; into very humble circumstances; and Moses says, "Let me now turn aside and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt".<a name=287:12></a> That is to say, he was thoughtful; he indicates at once spiritual thoughtfulness.<a name=287:13></a> And then when God saw that he turned aside He spoke to Him out of the bush, and said, "Moses, Moses!<a name=287:14></a>" Now that was God introducing Himself.<a name=287:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then subsequently He called Moses up to the

		mount; and Moses there on two occasions of forty days each, with God.<a name=288:1></a> And in the unfolding of the tabernacle, Moses had the opportunity of apprehending that God was coming into circumstances that were within his range, not only in the burning bush, which was unconsumed, but in that which was embellished, that which was made artistically; God would be there.<a name=288:2></a> So that God had come to dwell in circumstances suited, but nevertheless such as were measurable.<a name=288:3></a> Moses, therefore, had an opportunity of apprehending God as no one else, for the way into the holiest was never barred to him; he always had access; and God spoke to him as a man would speak to his friend, face to face.<a name=288:4></a> So that he came to apprehend God in that way.<a name=288:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in referring to God in the Psalms, which would be the outcome of all this, he goes far back; he says, "From everlasting to everlasting thou art God".<a name=288:6></a> "Before the mountains were brought forth, and thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to eternity thou art God".<a name=288:7></a> Now to my mind this gospel is the extension or opening up of that; and I think it is arrived at through the epistle of John, for in the epistle he begins by referring to what the apostles had seen, what they had heard, and what they had touched, or handled, what had come within their range.<a name=288:8></a> And then he says at the end, "We know that the Son of God has come".<a name=288:9></a> He had come in flesh and blood.<a name=288:10></a> Earlier in the chapter he had said, "This is he that came by water and blood".<a name=288:11></a> But then he says, "We know that the Son of God has come".<a name=288:12></a> That is experience; that is not simply by report, it is by experience; just as Moses could say it by experience; the Psalm is experimental.<a name=288:13></a> And so John says, He "has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=288:14></a> He is the true God and eternal life", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=288:15></a>

		Well, that in the language of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90">Psalm  90</a>goes back to before the mountains were brought forth; but then He is that -- it is what He is, the true God -- that is what He is to us, and eternal life.<a name=289:1></a> In other words, God has come within our range in a Man; He has come within the range of our intelligence, and our affections.<a name=289:2></a> He was seen, and heard, and handled.<a name=289:3></a> And that is what makes it so intensely interesting, that it is the One who has thus been known in a familiar way by those who loved Him, that is the true God.<a name=289:4></a> He is known not simply by report, but by experience, as Thomas says, "My Lord and my God".<a name=289:5></a> That was the result of a touch of the finger and the hand.<a name=289:6></a> If He is my Lord and my God, He is Eternal Life, and that extends backwards and forwards; God said to Moses, Tell them "I AM" hath sent you.<a name=289:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=291:20></a> Well, the appellation is one by which He was know here; and it is employed to designate the Person at any time.<a name=291:21></a> "In the beginning was the Word"; that does not convey that He was <i>then</i> expressing God, but that the Person was there; it goes on to say that the Word <i>was God</i>.<a name=291:22></a> We have to be careful not to go beyond Scripture, and predicate things of Him as "in the form of God" that strictly refer to Him as Man.<a name=291:23></a>

		That is how the matter stands.<a name=293:1></a> We have introduced at once the great testimony set out in Abraham, because he above all men represents a father, and Isaac an only one: "Take now thy son, thine only son, Isaac, whom thou lovest".<a name=293:2></a> You see Moses regarded what came before him; and it helps greatly to introduce Moses here, because this is the fulness of Moses.<a name=293:3></a> Christianity, therefore, is revelation connected with family relationship.<a name=293:4></a> We are prepared not only for the words of God in the Word becoming flesh, but a family relationship is set out in the "only-begotten".<a name=293:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=294:15></a> Luke says, the Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where the man was; but that is not John's point of view; John's point is that He has come so far that the work of God in man might come to light; so that souls having come and enquired after Him when they hear John speak (Jesus having turned and seeing them following), He says to them, "What seek ye?<a name=294:16></a> And they said to him, Rabbi, where abidest thou?<a name=294:17></a> He says to them, Come and see".<a name=294:18></a> That is what you look for in John; hence the practical word to us is, Am I moving?<a name=294:19></a> After this the chapter shows one and another moving.<a name=294:20></a>

		So we were led this morning to refer to the opening of Genesis, in which Moses, having already acquired a knowledge of God, refers to Him as creating all things at the beginning.<a name=302:4></a> That is, as God is known to us now we are instructed as to Him as He was and shall be known.<a name=302:5></a> So that as God is known, as we have it in John's epistle, known in Jesus (He is said to be the true God and Eternal Life), this gospel becomes intelligible as giving an account of the Word, who being with God as God in the beginning.<a name=302:6></a> He is presented as such to those who have acquired a knowledge of Him as having become flesh.<a name=302:7></a> So that it is said the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.<a name=302:8></a> He thus came within the range of men, dwelling amongst them in every-day life.<a name=302:9></a>

		It is important in regard to the ministry to the Jews that the minister should be well versed in the Scriptures; this is indeed important for any ministry, but especially in that connection.<a name=319:1></a> In the epistle to the Hebrews the first chapter is based on quotations from the Old Testament scriptures.<a name=319:2></a> Hence Philip says, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph".<a name=319:3></a> The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews shows an extraordinary acquaintance with the Old Testament scriptures; so does Stephen, who also addresses the Jews.<a name=319:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This morning we dwelt on the second and third days, referred to in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>and 2, and we noted that the work of God was there compressed into three days, involving the assembly emanating from the two hours of John the baptist's day.<a name=332:3></a> The two disciples followed the Lord and abode with Him, after which one of these disciples, Andrew, found his brother Simon, and led him to Jesus; and when Jesus saw him He named him: "Thou shalt be called Cephas", He said, which signified a stone.<a name=332:4></a> This thought we had before us a good deal, leading to the truth of the assembly as emanating from the divine abode, and being fully developed in the ministry of Paul, who was called out of heaven, and who brought out the great truth of the mystery, which was not spoken of in the earlier ages of God's ways.<a name=332:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the assembly belongs to heaven, it comes down from God out of heaven -- not strictly forming part of the work of God in the day next mentioned.<a name=332:6></a> The next day introduced the Lord's <i>direct</i> ministry, being occupied with the call of Philip, who found Nathanael.<a name=332:7></a> We noted that Philip was acquainted with the Scriptures, and referred to them in his ministry; this is in keeping with all ministry to the Jews.<a name=332:8></a> The Scriptures are invariably commented on in ministry to the Jews.<a name=332:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That was briefly what we had this morning, and the suggestion now is that we should look at the truth of the Spirit, as necessarily entering into the great subject of the work of God.<a name=333:6></a> The Holy Spirit is carrying on that work.<a name=333:7></a> We cannot really understand the work of God unless we understand that it is by the Spirit.<a name=333:8></a> The passages read are to call attention to the Spirit as the Agent employed in the work of God, in the individual believer first, and then as the divine Person here, dwelling with the saints, acting sovereignly, but ever remaining in the unity of the Godhead.<a name=333:9></a> God is one; the work is one.<a name=333:10></a>

		The Holy Spirit came in sympathetically as the Father expressed His appreciation of the Son.<a name=333:11></a> The Godhead is seen there.<a name=333:12></a> The Holy Spirit comes in in relation to the Son, as expressive of the Father's appreciation of Him.<a name=333:13></a> So that the position is clearly defined.<a name=333:14></a> "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work", the Lord says; <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:17">John  5:17</a>.<a name=333:15></a> The Father sealed Him; <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:27">John  6:27</a>.<a name=333:16></a> And the work of God in a man is that he believes on Him whom the Father hath sent.<a name=333:17></a>

		What is in these passages is the idea of <i>preparation</i> in relation to the things of God, indeed the thought of preparation is very prominent in the Scriptures.<a name=388:1></a> We read of the preparation of the heavens (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:27">Proverbs  8:27</a>) and the Scriptures speak of things prepared for those who love God, which eye has not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man.<a name=388:2></a> This is a very affecting thought, for it shows the divine forethought in regard of those who love God!<a name=388:3></a> Those who love God have the first place with Him, and the Scriptures speak of things prepared for them; things, as I said, which eye has not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man.<a name=388:4></a> They are disclosed, however, as the apostle further says, "But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God", or "the depths of God".<a name=388:5></a> The Spirit has access to all there is, not only provisional things connected with Israel, and which are now taken up in the assembly, upon whom the ends of the ages are come, but hidden things also.<a name=388:6></a> The Spirit emphasises things connected with the kingdom which come in in a provisional way in the assembly, but He has access to the hidden things.<a name=388:7></a> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, and He had concealed the greatest things, the "better things", as Paul says, but these have now come out, the Spirit who is in us as those who love God searches all things.<a name=388:8></a> He searches the depths of God.<a name=388:9></a> He would not leave one iota untold; He would bring them forward to those who love God, but I refer to them because they are prepared of God.<a name=388:10></a>

		Well, now you can understand from what I have said how the idea of preparation enters into the divine thoughts.<a name=392:1></a> He says to them after their inquiry as to where they should prepare, "As ye enter into the city a man will meet you .<a name=392:2></a>.<a name=392:3></a>.<a name=392:4></a> follow him".<a name=392:5></a> Note, they had learned not to intrude as to suggestions.<a name=392:6></a> If we are to prepare, we must learn from Him as to when and where; there must be no innovations; and so they have to follow the man with the pitcher of water.<a name=392:7></a> The Lord left nothing to their imagination and device, nevertheless they are entrusted with the preparation, and so it says they prepared; it was done, that is a great thing as to service, it is not half done or postponed.<a name=392:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In suggesting these scriptures I was thinking of <i>discipleship</i> as emphasised in Matthew.<a name=420:1></a> Disciples are regulated by the Master and governed by His movements and direction whatever the consequences.<a name=420:2></a> Matthew has also the Lord's <i>influence</i> in view, as dominating His own, and involving their <i>formation</i>.<a name=420:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John, influence is seen more in the sense of attraction; you have the feature of being drawn to the Lord as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:32">John  12:32</a>: "And I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me".<a name=420:4></a> Matthew has in mind the Lord's influence in the sense of <i>rule</i>, of which the sun is symbolic, in that all things are dominated by it.<a name=420:5></a> We are to be the sons of our Father who is in the heavens, "for he makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:45">Matthew  5:45</a>.<a name=420:6></a> At the transfiguration in Matthew, the Lord's face "shone as the sun" (chapter 17: 2), showing that He is dominant; and He forms us so that we are brought into accord with Him.<a name=420:7></a> Then the disciples, as thus made, are themselves to make disciples; chapter 28: 19.<a name=420:8></a> So that Andrew and Peter are made "fishers of men" in this gospel.<a name=420:9></a> We are not only to have light and knowledge, but influence according to God, and this should mark every believer.<a name=420:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Influence is a subtle thing, and if used in the exercise of absolute good, as in Christ, is immense in its result.<a name=420:11></a> Matthew alludes to the heavens more than any other evangelist, thus bringing out this idea of a dominative influence for good.<a name=420:12></a> What is formative is in view, in order that divine influence should extend.<a name=420:13></a> Being the sons of our Father who is in the heavens, we are not only to have light, but to be

		Well now, the final thought in this section is in Noah.<a name=448:2></a> Enoch is taken away from this scene at God's pleasure; but we have "This is the history of Noah".<a name=448:3></a> Here again is a <i>man</i>.<a name=448:4></a> God does not write the history of a man or his generations unless he is of spiritual importance.<a name=448:5></a> It is said, "Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God".<a name=448:6></a> We have <i>increase</i> in manhood in him in the thought of justness and perfectness.<a name=448:7></a> Although neither Methushelah nor Lemech is said to have carried on the thought of manhood seen in Enoch, it appeared in Noah, his great-grandson.<a name=448:8></a> He was a just man, perfect in his generations and walked with God.<a name=448:9></a> God valued him accordingly.<a name=448:10></a> There was in him moral stamina, that we have in Noah a man who <i>faces difficulties</i>.<a name=448:11></a> He was building the ark a hundred and twenty years <i>before</i> the flood came.<a name=448:12></a> Think of the weight of that upon his mind!<a name=448:13></a> May we not suppose that he was jeered at by his neighbours for building such a thing as an ark when there was no apparent need for it?<a name=448:14></a> There is not a word about rain in Scripture until the flood.<a name=448:15></a> Doubtless there was rain, but the lack of mention of it is no doubt to bring the position of Noah into greater prominence.<a name=448:16></a> It would appear a ridiculous thing to the natural mind to build an ark -- a ship, that is what it was, a very big ship; so that it would draw great attention, you may be sure.<a name=448:17></a> There was not the like of it before, and here was a man toiling day in and day out on this hitherto unheard-of thing.<a name=448:18></a> But he had light in his soul, and what a burden it would be to him -- the prospect of the whole race of mankind save himself and his family wiped out; and here he is, toiling and toiling.<a name=448:19></a> It is an example for us in our days of difficult toiling.<a name=448:20></a> It was not to be "in vain".<a name=448:21></a> Scripture encourages us with this: "ye know that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The New Testament says that Noah by faith, "prepared an ark for the saving of his house"; and in this we have a very important feature of manhood there is not only headship, but also the consideration and provision that go with it.<a name=449:8></a> Noah is also marked by discernment, a quality noted in Scripture as essential to manhood.<a name=449:9></a> He distinguished between clean and unclean animals.<a name=449:10></a>

		Finally, Noah was a worshipper of God.<a name=449:11></a> His is the first altar mentioned in Scripture; he offered thereon to Jehovah burnt-offerings of clean animals and fowls.<a name=449:12></a> And in this service we may observe wholehearted devotedness, for it is said that he offered of <i>every</i> clean animal, and of <i>all</i> clean fowl; "and Jehovah smelled the sweet odour".<a name=449:13></a> On this ground God makes a covenant with Noah and the creation, and man is invested with general governmental prerogative.<a name=449:14></a>

		All that I have been saying is presented in absolute fulness in Christ -- "the man Christ Jesus".<a name=450:2></a> John's gospel calls attention to Him in this sense strikingly.<a name=450:3></a> Pilate brought forth the Lord Jesus robed in the robes His enemies put upon Him.<a name=450:4></a> How it touches our hearts to see our Saviour so maltreated by His creatures!<a name=450:5></a> But there He was in the presence of the gathered throng of Israel, their priests animated with hatred against their Messiah, and Pilate said, "Behold the man!<a name=450:6></a>" What a word that was!<a name=450:7></a> As thus presented, the chief priests and officers of Israel railed against Him, saying, "Crucify, crucify him".<a name=450:8></a> Paul says, triumphantly, "the man Christ Jesus" the anointed One!<a name=450:9></a> He is everything to God and has done all things well.<a name=450:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have on my mind to speak a little about adjustment in the things of the Lord.<a name=451:1></a> The word has application at the present moment, both in regard to each Christian, and each company of Christians, and also in regard to those who minister.<a name=451:2></a> I am particularly concerned about the local setting of the saints.<a name=451:3></a> Luke has this in view; he presents to us the moral side of the truth.<a name=451:4></a> He is concerned as to what is suitable to God morally, which includes our general conduct.<a name=451:5></a> Thus he makes much of Peter's conversion, not in the way of confession of guilt so much as his <i>state</i>.<a name=451:6></a> Peter is a kind of model from that point of view, as the woman in the seventh chapter is from the point of view of <i>sins</i>.<a name=451:7></a> Mary of Bethany in chapter 10 represents adjustment in regard of the word of Christ.<a name=451:8></a> She is listening to Him as a choice.<a name=451:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these things are from the standpoint of moral adjustment, what Luke has in mind to bring about, culminating, as it does, in a company of people who are gathered together in relation to the eleven apostles, and who are saying certain things that indicate that they have learnt morally.<a name=451:10></a> You will all remember how the gathered company is presented at the end of this gospel.<a name=451:11></a> They are saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon".<a name=451:12></a> That is to say, they are occupied with what has happened to the Lord, and that He has appeared to one who has erred.<a name=451:13></a> That is what they are saying.<a name=451:14></a> You can understand how they would regard the appearance to the erring one; it was <i>grace</i>.<a name=451:15></a> "The Lord is risen indeed".<a name=451:16></a> He has come out of death as the righteous Man, for Luke presents Him from that side.<a name=451:17></a> Faith recognises that He is righteous; that He has "done nothing

		amiss".<a name=452:1></a> The centurion also says, "Certainly this was a righteous man".<a name=452:2></a> According to Matthew and Mark he says that He was the Son of God, but in Luke He is a righteous Man.<a name=452:3></a> So that a righteous Man is risen -- righteousness is vindicated.<a name=452:4></a> The Lord says Himself that the Holy Spirit would bring in the demonstration of righteousness because He was going to the Father.<a name=452:5></a> Righteousness is vindicated, which is a great moral triumph.<a name=452:6></a> It is seen in Christ as with the Father; <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>.<a name=452:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He is righteous in the sense of dealing with erring ones.<a name=452:8></a> He prays for the forgiveness even of His murderers; He had looked on Peter, and Peter had wept bitterly, and now the Lord had appeared to him.<a name=452:9></a> It is a principle by which we should be governed locally.<a name=452:10></a> Luke makes much of what is said; so of the two who came back from Emmaus, "what happened by the way".<a name=452:11></a> But it is not only what happens by the way, but what happened at the <i>end</i> of the way, which was that He was known to them in the breaking of bread.<a name=452:12></a> They recognised Christ in the breaking of bread.<a name=452:13></a> They were qualified for the assembly, and were contributors.<a name=452:14></a> In the midst of that company He comes; He stood there.<a name=452:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what Luke has in view, and I want to point out that Mary of Bethany in chapter 10 is a kind of example of what the Lord has in His mind in the local company.<a name=452:16></a> You will remember that this chapter begins with the Lord sending out the disciples two by two into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.<a name=452:17></a> The Lord has in our own times moved on the line of "every city and place", indeed, the epistle to the Corinthians takes up that thought.<a name=452:18></a> To put it more exactly, Luke takes up the thought of 1 Corinthians, for he would support the word to that assembly.<a name=452:19></a> So that in that epistle we have Corinth as a city, and then "every place".<a name=452:20></a> Here we have it in every city and place to which the Lord will come.<a name=452:21></a>

		What the Lord particularly deals with in His instructions to the seventy are the houses and the cities.<a name=453:1></a> These are the two main features.<a name=453:2></a> He speaks specially of the city as the area of testimony.<a name=453:3></a> They were to enter into a city, and if they were received, they had certain instructions, and if not received, they had certain instructions, and in either case the wonderful testimony of God had been brought to the city.<a name=453:4></a> They were to go out into the streets if the testimony were not received, and they were to shake off the dust of the city and say, "Be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you".<a name=453:5></a> It was a time when the testimony of God was brought to cities and places.<a name=453:6></a> The cities are particularly held responsible, so that He adds that they were to say to that city that rejected the testimony, that it would be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for it.<a name=453:7></a> It may be thought that the matter of cities is of little importance, but it is of great importance in the sight of God, for there is not a city that is not under His eye.<a name=453:8></a>

		We are here in the presence of an actual case of the Lord's visitation to a village, and we have brought before us in that village -- in a house in it -- two remarkable persons, Martha and Mary.<a name=453:9></a> Martha became serviceable later, as John shows us.<a name=453:10></a> You say that she was serving here, but she did not know how to serve, however much she was exercised.<a name=453:11></a> So far removed was she from the idea that she <i>reproves the Lord</i>.<a name=453:12></a> "Carest thou not that my sister has left me to serve alone?<a name=453:13></a>" she says.<a name=453:14></a> It is well that she was serving alone, for the more service in <i>that</i> spirit, the worse for the locality.<a name=453:15></a> If others are added to you in that spirit, He is not adding them.<a name=453:16></a> The sequel shows that she was a genuine believer, she received Him into her house, but that is not all.<a name=453:17></a>

		Passing on to Acts, I wish to show how the principle works out in that book, and to observe that in the verses read in chapter 19 it is a question of passing from one ministry to another -- not a bad ministry, not an imperfect one, but one that was right and of God as far as it went.<a name=454:16></a> John the baptist's ministry was of God.<a name=454:17></a> You will remember how the Lord questioned His enemies as to it: "Is it of heaven or of man?<a name=454:18></a>" It was of heaven, it was of God.<a name=454:19></a> Now what I want to say is, we may often put what is of God between us and something else that is of God.<a name=454:20></a> You will remember how in John it says, "I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment", and then he tells us what the old commandment

		What is in mind is to speak about what believers receive.<a name=459:1></a> The word 'receive' is found in each of these scriptures, and it is thought that we might look first at what may be received in the way of doctrine, which is included in the gospel which, though received, yet the person receiving it may not be saved.<a name=459:2></a> In the second letter to the Corinthians the apostle speaks about receiving the grace of God in vain -- a very searching matter.<a name=459:3></a> In the first epistle he speaks of the truth of the gospel that the Corinthians had received, saying "by which also ye are saved, unless ye have believed in vain".<a name=459:4></a> It will be wholesome to dwell on this side of the matter, for we are now in this island, where the gospel in its terms is generally accepted.<a name=459:5></a> Were one to enquire of every person in the island as to whether he or she believed in Christ, the answer from most would be 'Yes', meaning that he was not a heathen, or a Jew, or a Mohammedan, but it would just convey that he was like the rest of the people, a Christian by profession.<a name=459:6></a> Were one to enquire in detail, he would own he believed in the inspiration of the Scriptures, and other acknowledgments would be readily made by most of the inhabitants of the island in order to show that they are Christians.<a name=459:7></a> Now the Corinthians were in that sense Christians; they had heard Paul preach; he had been there a year and a half and had preached many times.<a name=459:8></a> Others too had preached there; Timotheus and Silvanus, and in this passage Paul calls attention to what had been preached and made known to the Corinthians by him.<a name=459:9></a> He says, ".<a name=459:10></a>.<a name=459:11></a>.<a name=459:12></a> which also ye have received".<a name=459:13></a> The things he presented would effect their salvation as they kept them in mind, "unless ye have believed
