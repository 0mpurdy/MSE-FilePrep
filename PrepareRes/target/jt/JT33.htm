		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> I thought a word on the Spirit would help us, and that we might look at the power and effect of the truth typically upon the woman of Samaria and on Hagar.<a name=1:4></a> Then I think we may see how the idea of the Spirit, or the well in Genesis, is carried through in Abraham.<a name=1:5></a> The idea of the well goes further than the Spirit personally, including, as it does, the system of grace in which the Spirit operates, and from that point of view it is introduced first in Scripture in connection with Hagar, as belonging to the household of faith, though she never fully availed herself of it.<a name=1:6></a> That is, it had no permanent effect, so that she goes to Egypt for a wife for her son, she being an Egyptian.<a name=1:7></a> But the woman of Samaria goes back to the men of the city, but they have no power over her.<a name=1:8></a> Hagar goes back to where she came from for a wife for her son, proving that she was not free from it; but the woman of Sychar went back to the city, to the men, and proved that she was completely delivered from them, and from the world, in that she invites them to a Man who is not of it at all, and her invitation is effective.<a name=1:9></a> That is, it has power, in that it is from one in deliverance.<a name=1:10></a> It is in that power of deliverance from the world that we may hope to attract persons out of it.<a name=1:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=1:15></a> In chapter 7 it is rivers, alluding to the superabundance of the effect of the Spirit.<a name=1:16></a> "This he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a>), which I believe alludes

		J.T.<a name=2:7></a> I think it does.<a name=2:8></a> It springs up into everlasting life; it has God in view.<a name=2:9></a> It springs up, and the action of it here shows that the result is for God.<a name=2:10></a> It is the smallest subdivision of water mentioned, and is first connected with Hagar.<a name=2:11></a> It comes to light here first, and the well is called "Beer-lahai-roi" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#16:14">Genesis  16:14</a>), 'Well of the Living who was seen'.<a name=2:12></a> It is by the well that she is brought into direct touch with God.<a name=2:13></a> The moral effect was not there in Hagar's case, but it was evident in this woman of Samaria in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=2:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.T.<a name=2:15></a> You are not speaking of the Spirit as the Comforter, but as of service as in us individually.<a name=2:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:17></a> The thought of the well is first connected with our state of soul, for that is the point the Lord makes; He says, "Go, call thy husband".<a name=2:18></a> The moral state has to be adjusted before we can come into it.<a name=2:19></a> Hagar did not answer to it, though it was the place where she came into touch with God.<a name=2:20></a> At first she left the house of faith in self-will, but in spite of that, God met her.<a name=2:21></a> She goes out, but God met her; showing what grace is, and how this type involves that God follows us up.<a name=2:22></a>

		The woman of Samaria, on the other hand, was an outcast, and when she gets instruction as to the well, she seems to get the spiritual thought, for she says, "Give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> It did not bring Hagar into a link with God.<a name=3:12></a> God showed wonderful grace in allowing her to find herself in these circumstances, for in them she would get the benefit of the system of grace; circumstances brought about by her own conduct.<a name=3:13></a> But it is added that she goes to Egypt for a wife for her son.<a name=3:14></a> She is responsible for her son: "lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand"; she was held to that.<a name=3:15></a> She made her son to drink, then she goes off to Egypt.<a name=3:16></a> The self-acting organs, so to speak, were not under the influence of the Spirit.<a name=3:17></a> The woman of Samaria goes back to the city and says, "Come, see a man".<a name=3:18></a> She is delivered; the men of the city have no power over her; she has power over them for good; she is completely delivered, being in possession, in principle, of the living water.<a name=3:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:18></a> In the end of chapter 3 it says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand".<a name=4:19></a> This is the filling out of that.<a name=4:20></a> "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=4:21></a> The gift of God is through a divine Person, "<i>who</i> it is that saith to thee".<a name=4:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:25></a> She made room for Abraham's servant.<a name=4:26></a> One great idea with Rebekah is sufficiency, plenty of room, plenty of everything; but there is nothing of that about Hagar, only narrowness and worldliness.<a name=4:27></a> And yet God helped Ishmael; God was with him, and he became an archer, but his mother took him a wife out of Egypt.<a name=4:28></a> She is a type therefore of those who today participate in the Spirit (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6">Hebrews  6</a>), but are worldly, and never come to anything spiritually.<a name=4:29></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:3></a> Quite.<a name=5:4></a> If you take the thing typically, it is a question of the Spirit.<a name=5:5></a> We have to understand the types from the standpoint of the New Testament, so the well in these passages points to the energy of life and consequent power and wealth that lie in the Spirit.<a name=5:6></a>

		F.W.<a name=5:7></a>B.<a name=5:8></a> What is involved in Ishmael becoming an archer?<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:10></a> It is rather a reproach in Genesis to be an archer; it is a man who fights at a distance.<a name=5:11></a> It is recorded of Joseph that he is "a fruitful bough by a well".<a name=5:12></a> That is Christ in the fulness of grace; "the archers .<a name=5:13></a>.<a name=5:14></a>.<a name=5:15></a> shot at him .<a name=5:16></a>.<a name=5:17></a>.<a name=5:18></a> but his bow abode in strength".<a name=5:19></a> That is what the Jews did to Him, and Ishmael and Hagar are the Jewish element.<a name=5:20></a> They were the persecutors of Christ.<a name=5:21></a>

		W.T.<a name=5:22></a> The woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>was needy.<a name=5:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:24></a> You see the complete deliverance in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>in this practical way, that she goes back to her old haunts and has power for good over the men, and she directs them to a Man she has found who told her all things she ever did.<a name=5:25></a> She valued and enjoyed the light, although it exposed her.<a name=5:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:29></a> Surely; the only-begotten Son was there, declaring God.<a name=5:30></a> Of Hagar it reads, "The Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water", as if it were God showing interest in her though she was self-willed, and then the well is named because she was conscious that God saw her.<a name=5:31></a> It would be like the revelation of God to her.<a name=5:32></a> In the next incident her eyes are opened and she is held responsible.<a name=5:33></a> "Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand".<a name=5:34></a> The lad drinks, but there is no moral effect, and his history shows that he corresponds with the Jews as hating Christ.<a name=5:35></a> Unless the inward members are morally cleansed through the purifying of the mind, there will be no outward effect in separation from the world.<a name=5:36></a> I think it is a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:11></a> I think you see how she overcomes the prejudices that existed between Samaria and Jerusalem.<a name=6:12></a> She had talked about the Jews and the Samaritans and their rival claims.<a name=6:13></a> The Lord asserted what God had set among the Jews, that salvation was of them, and His word evidently affected her.<a name=6:14></a> The result was that her testimony brings about an abiding-place for Christ among the Samaritans, for "he abode there two days".<a name=6:15></a> How can there be a state of things suitable for this in a local company save as they are unworldly?<a name=6:16></a> The result at Samaria would indicate deliverance from the world in a moral sense; they were not thinking nationally, for as they came to Him and heard Him themselves, they say, "We have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world" (verse 42).<a name=6:17></a> "He abode there two days"; the period is testimony.<a name=6:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=19:23></a> The communication is to Moses, but Aaron is brought into it.<a name=19:24></a> It says in verse 9, "And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel, Come near unto the presence of Jehovah, for he has heard your murmurings".<a name=19:25></a> At this stage of the people's history grace ruled, and this is conveyed peculiarly in the speaking of Aaron, that is, as through a brother.<a name=19:26></a> "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=19:27></a> I know that he can speak well".<a name=19:28></a> God had heard him speak -- perhaps in prayer, so that the speaking coming through Aaron would convey divine sympathy and consideration for the people at this

		stage.<a name=20:1></a> Although they were murmuring, God would hold to His principle of grace ruling, and so what comes out in chapter 16 is the manna.<a name=20:2></a> As the people murmured Jehovah said, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you".<a name=20:3></a> The manna also speaks of littleness, but it is from <i>heaven</i> -- "a small round thing".<a name=20:4></a> It is Christ as Man; what He was down here in wilderness circumstances.<a name=20:5></a> That is what the manna is -- a heavenly Man here.<a name=20:6></a> The word 'manna' is from 'man', referring to the inquiry as to what it was (verse 15).<a name=20:7></a> We may well inquire what it is, and get the true answer.<a name=20:8></a> It is Christ as in this world, in which He had to do with all human circum stances, sin apart.<a name=20:9></a> It is Christ thus as food for us, as in the wilderness.<a name=20:10></a> They had spoken of sitting by the flesh-pot in Egypt and eating bread to the full.<a name=20:11></a> God says, I will give you bread from heaven.<a name=20:12></a> There was no reproof; it was accompanied by this tender, sympathetic, gracious consideration.<a name=20:13></a> Even if they "sat by the flesh-pots" in Egypt, it would not be for very long, the taskmasters would tell them to move; but God says in effect, 'I have a rest, a holy Sabbath for you' (verse 23); 'I want you to come into My sabbath, to sit for a whole day and do nothing but enjoy this bread that I am going to rain down for you from heaven'.<a name=20:14></a> All this is in keeping with Aaron's speaking, hearing which the people turned toward the wilderness, and the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.<a name=20:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=28:6></a> Yes.<a name=28:7></a> The passage read involves our understanding the way into heaven, so that emphasis is laid upon the fact that He was taken up, <i>they beholding</i> Him.<a name=28:8></a> It is not only the fact that He was taken up, but that they beheld Him.<a name=28:9></a> In Luke it is as He blesses them that He is carried up; mention is not made of their seeing Him, but in the Acts note is taken of the fact that they beheld Him.<a name=28:10></a> Then again the two men say, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven".<a name=28:11></a> So that the instruction here, I believe, includes our knowledge of the manner of going into heaven and of coming out of heaven.<a name=28:12></a> The Lord must lead in everything.<a name=28:13></a> They beholding Him would get the impression of how He went in, and then that He would come out as they beheld Him go in.<a name=28:14></a>

		The principle of divine leading is most essential now -- as at all times, but now because of the extraordinary difficulties that souls have in finding their way, and then as having found it, in being brought to the point of understanding the leading of the Spirit.<a name=28:15></a> The leading of the Spirit has to be taken up itself.<a name=28:16></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God".<a name=28:17></a> It implies what is more advanced in our experience than the leading of the Lord.<a name=28:18></a> There is also angelic leading, which the book of Acts indicates, and which has to be noted; but I thought we might confine

		J.T.<a name=29:9></a> Yes.<a name=29:10></a> We have the leading of the Lord after we learn in subjection how to follow the Lord.<a name=29:11></a> The Corinthians were defective; they were not even proving the leadership of the Lord in their position at Corinth, greatly as they needed that leading; they were occupied with men as leaders.<a name=29:12></a> One said he was of Paul, another of Apollos, another of Cephas, and another of Christ -- not Christ in the proper sense, but Christ as connected with a party, which He could never be.<a name=29:13></a> We can never connect Christ with a party, but these men were endeavouring to do it for the sake of appearance.<a name=29:14></a> It was on partisan lines; it was not the leading of the Lord at all.<a name=29:15></a> Hence <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>shows how to get rid of the natural man who has become distinguished and influential among christians and seeks to be a leader; the first chapter shows how the saints should get rid of him.<a name=29:16></a> Chapter 2 makes room for the Spirit, so that the Spirit has His place amongst us.<a name=29:17></a>

		These scriptures treat of divine movement having a certain end in view, and I refer to them not exactly because of that end, or indeed because they speak of divine movement in itself, but rather of the possibility alluded to in the first passage, of the Lord passing us by.<a name=45:1></a> That is a touch in Mark's record of this occurrence.<a name=45:2></a> It is also recorded by others, but he alone mentions that the Lord in walking on the water "would have passed by them".<a name=45:3></a> No doubt in the history of the assembly, or of the testimony on earth, there has been much of this passing by.<a name=45:4></a> We have but an indication here of all that has now become history.<a name=45:5></a> It is therefore a warning to us, while incidentally indicating that the Lord is not at all stopped because of the necessity of passing any of us by: He goes on.<a name=45:6></a> It comes out very prominently in the history of the gospels, that He goes on -- no circumstance can hinder Him.<a name=45:7></a> "<i>He</i> passing through the midst of them", we are told in one case, "went his way", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:30">Luke  4:30</a>).<a name=45:8></a> So that He goes on, but He takes with Him certain according to His choice.<a name=45:9></a> This evangelist makes much of the selection He made; but the selection is not all, nor is the training all, for prior to this He had had them on the mountain "that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:14">Mark  3:14</a>).<a name=45:10></a> There was much instruction by way of word and example.<a name=45:11></a> They had themselves proved their efficiency as ministers, and yet He would have passed them by; not that He in result intended to do so, for the sequel shows that they were not to be passed by.<a name=45:12></a> The Lord will not pass by any of us without exercising every possible means of help and recovery, for no one is as gracious as He.<a name=45:13></a> The fact

		The passage goes on to tell us that their hearts were hardened (verse 52).<a name=46:2></a> They were toiling in rowing, but toiling is not everything.<a name=46:3></a> I might journey from here to the Antipodes and toil for months or years, but it would not be everything; it might not be anything; it might not be sufficient to attract the Lord's attention.<a name=46:4></a> So here, they were toiling in rowing, and the wind was contrary to them.<a name=46:5></a> But then we are told that "their heart was hardened", in spite of the fact that they were working hard.<a name=46:6></a> They had not seen the point in the feeding of the five thousand; they had not taken into their souls the import of that marvellous service of Christ.<a name=46:7></a> They had some five loaves and a few fishes, but He had even to put it to them to go and see what they had; "Go and see", He says, as if they did not know.<a name=46:8></a> Well, this is how matters stood, and He would have passed them by.<a name=46:9></a> Was it for nothing?<a name=46:10></a> Not at all.<a name=46:11></a> The most honoured of servants were in that boat, the most effective ones; how much we owe them who can say?<a name=46:12></a> But He would have passed them by.<a name=46:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a lesson for them!<a name=46:14></a> Mark understood what the Lord meant by this incident when he wrote this account; he understood how servants, or saints, may be in such a state, notwithstanding that they are, so to speak, toiling in rowing, that they may be passed by -- for the Lord knows what is going on <i>underneath</i>.<a name=46:15></a> In the book of Judges it is said that God raised up judges.<a name=46:16></a> It is a book of decline.<a name=46:17></a> The underlying state of the people is disclosed in the last few chapters.<a name=46:18></a> The interventions of God are in the early chapters.<a name=46:19></a> It says when God raised up a judge He was with the judge, but when the judge was removed the people sinned, and sinned "more than their fathers" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#2:19">Judges  2:19</a>), so that it was continual decline.<a name=46:20></a> After each judge died, things became worse than ever; it is very solemn.<a name=46:21></a> So that the Lord is not looking on the outward thing, but at the inner state of things, at what is

		going on underneath.<a name=47:1></a> There may be full meetings and fresh ministry, but that is not all; the Lord is looking at what is below.<a name=47:2></a> So here, He knew that in that boatful of men there was a hardened state; that they had not been affected by the most marvellous expression of grace, for look at what had happened.<a name=47:3></a> As the Lord takes up a few loaves and fishes, He lifts His eyes to heaven, blesses them, hands them to His disciples to give to the five thousand people, and they are filled.<a name=47:4></a> We never had anything like that!<a name=47:5></a> I am not despising what God is doing today; but though the most marvellous thing had happened; yet their hearts were hardened, when they should have been most softened and impressionable.<a name=47:6></a> With hardened hearts they were toiling in rowing and the wind was contrary to them, and He would have passed them by.<a name=47:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in brief, I want to show the contrast to this.<a name=47:8></a> I do not go into the detail of the chapter; I wish to show the contrast, from these other scriptures, in Abraham.<a name=47:9></a> What you observe in the first passage in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17">Genesis  17</a>is that God went <i>up</i> from Abraham.<a name=47:10></a> We talk much about going to heaven, and we ought to, for we are going there, but one wonders how much conception we have of going up.<a name=47:11></a> The point made in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>is that they beheld the Lord as He went up.<a name=47:12></a> That is not mentioned for nothing.<a name=47:13></a> Attention is called to what they beheld.<a name=47:14></a> So it reads, "they beholding him".<a name=47:15></a> Then the two men say to them, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:11">Acts  1:11</a>).<a name=47:16></a> Did you ever stop to picture in your mind, spiritually, what that movement was?<a name=47:17></a> It is a sort of pattern of what is going to happen -- the idea of going up.<a name=47:18></a> "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven"; not "as he went up", but '<i>as ye have seen him</i> go up', that is the point which is to be impressed upon us.<a name=47:19></a> So here you see God went up from Abraham.<a name=47:20></a> Think of the importance

	<div class="paragraph">
		But what I want to point out is that God "left off talking to him".<a name=48:3></a> When you break off a conversation, it does not necessarily mean that you have finished, but often that you intend to resume it, and that is how the thing is put here.<a name=48:4></a> God had commanded Abraham that he and his house should be circumcised, which implies that the flesh profits nothing; and God made a covenant with him on these lines, and He left off talking to him.<a name=48:5></a> But that is not the end of the matter; there is something to follow.<a name=48:6></a> Now what is Abraham to do?<a name=48:7></a> What has he in his mind?<a name=48:8></a> Jehovah went up, as if He were to say to Abraham, 'I am leaving you to yourself; I am going up and you are to be here'.<a name=48:9></a> Now that is the position today.<a name=48:10></a> Christ is in heaven; He has been seen going into heaven and He is coming back, and the interval in which we are is a marvellous period of time, in which the church is called out.<a name=48:11></a> How called out?<a name=48:12></a> On the principle of obedience, for what is the church if it cannot be faithful in the absence of Christ?<a name=48:13></a> Of the virtuous woman in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31:11">Proverbs  31:11</a> it is said, "The heart of her husband confideth in her".<a name=48:14></a> It is therefore a question of obedience and trustworthiness, and so those who heard the two men speak in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, who saw Him go up, went back into the city; they went to the upper room.<a name=48:15></a> That shows that they are in accord in their walk here with what they had seen.<a name=48:16></a> It would convey to us that there is not to be any outward religious show, for it is a faith period.<a name=48:17></a> He went up into heaven, but He was received in a cloud out of their sight.<a name=48:18></a> "A cloud received him out of their sight", and so it is now a question of faith.<a name=48:19></a> It is a time of obscurity, and not of Babylonish show.<a name=48:20></a> The whole fabric of modern christendom is show; it has been Babylonish from the first century.<a name=48:21></a> But faith is the principle today, and that involves that one is out of sight of men as to one's glory,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=49>[Page 49]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as to one's place with God.<a name=49:1></a> Of course there is testimony, but the principle of faith is the negation of outward show, so they went to the upper room.<a name=49:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then throughout the Acts one great feature is <i>obedience</i>.<a name=49:3></a> God gives the Spirit to those who obey Christ.<a name=49:4></a> Let no one talk about having part in the church apart from obedience.<a name=49:5></a> No one has the Holy Spirit apart from obedience; "if ye love me, keep my commandments", the Lord says, (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:15">John  14:15</a>).<a name=49:6></a> The Spirit is given on the principle of obedience, for God does not offer His gift to unappreciative people.<a name=49:7></a> A principle underlying the gift is that you appreciate it, and this marks the church.<a name=49:8></a> Thus here, God has gone up, and Abraham is left, and what does he do?<a name=49:9></a> He circumcises to the <i>fullest</i> extent, according to the commandment of God, in complete disregard of age: Ishmael was thirteen years old, and Abraham ninety-nine.<a name=49:10></a> The thing has to be applied without modification.<a name=49:11></a> God loves obedience.<a name=49:12></a> You can understand, therefore, why He "left off".<a name=49:13></a> He would give His servant an opportunity of proving his love, and he proved it fully, and hence the detail of circumcision here, which you can scarcely find anywhere else on this subject.<a name=49:14></a>

		Well, now he is sitting at the tent door by the oaks of Mamre, in the heat of the day.<a name=49:15></a> He is not governed by the flesh; if he were, he would not be in the tent door when it was hot, he would be seeking repose in a "cool" place, like Eglon, king of Moab; but he is alert, he is, so to speak, walking "not after the flesh, but after the Spirit", for that is the spiritual counterpart of circumcision.<a name=49:16></a> Circumcision is the negation of the flesh, and the Holy Spirit is power in the believer to do the will of God.<a name=49:17></a> Abraham is found alert, sitting in the heat of the day at the tent door, and three men stood by him.<a name=49:18></a> It is not the Lord now by Himself; He has got company; it is heaven, as I might say, brought down within Abraham's range; a most touching scene; three men, and they are "standing near him".<a name=49:19></a> They are not passing him by; they are

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, this is, as we can see, a wonderful time; it was not simply that the three men came and took a

		But this is not all; it says, "Abraham remained yet standing before Jehovah".<a name=51:19></a> The men went on to Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah, and the two men went on, and a further thing came out, for the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?<a name=51:20></a>" as if the heart of the blessed God is drawn out towards us as we answer to His mind.<a name=51:21></a> This is simply a suggestion of what meetings may be, of what the assembly may be as

		Now I want to show, beloved brethren, from the Old Testament how this principle of youthful maturity is developed in the service of God.<a name=57:8></a> It first shows itself in instinct, and when I speak of instinct in the types I go to the book of Genesis; it is the great book of instincts.<a name=57:9></a> What you find in the book of Genesis is that things are done generally without any specification, and yet what is done conforms to the divine specification when it is given; that is to say, it is on the principle of John's ministry: "I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it".<a name=57:10></a> It is a question of knowing the thing in a spiritually instinctive way, and then knowing it in detail, so that what you know by spiritual instinct is found to agree with what is presented to you in spiritual ministry, so that there can be no disparity between them.<a name=57:11></a> There is the principle of reception with intelligence.<a name=57:12></a> The "good ground" is one who hears and <i>understands</i> the word, (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:23">Matthew  13:23</a>).<a name=57:13></a> No teacher can teach a child save the child has the power of reception in an intelligent way, and so it is spiritually.<a name=57:14></a> I speak of that because of the importance of cultivating instincts.<a name=57:15></a>

		And so, in the book of Genesis, you find youthfulness in service.<a name=58:1></a> The book is to be regarded generally as a book of old men; Genesis abounds in references to old people.<a name=58:2></a> In this world old people grow rather uninteresting, but it is not so with God.<a name=58:3></a> You find in the inspired word that age continues in the service of God; age adds to interest rather than takes from it.<a name=58:4></a> So in the millennial times, we read of men and women who are very aged, but they are not uninteresting.<a name=58:5></a> Nor are they uninterested; they are contemplated as sitting there, and then over against them there are the boys and girls playing in the streets, (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#8:4">Zechariah  8:4</a>,5).<a name=58:6></a> It is as if God would set down together the extremes of human life.<a name=58:7></a> An old man of that day could tell me something about the Lord Jesus coming out of heaven; he could tell me about the great preparatory work of God in the millennial day; he has been through it; he is full of the most precious things.<a name=58:8></a> He is an eyewitness; he is better than a written record.<a name=58:9></a> Peter says, as an old man about to put off his tabernacle, "Having been eyewitnesses of <i>his</i> majesty", (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:16">2 Peter  1:16</a>).<a name=58:10></a> Look at that; he is about to put off his tabernacle, and he is occupied with the majesty of Christ.<a name=58:11></a> Who can tell me as much as Peter of the wonders of Christ's ministry on earth?<a name=58:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Romans presents the kingdom, the object of which, in the main, is subjection; involving sometimes severe struggles, both on the part of God and on the part of the subject of His will.<a name=188:2></a> Ephesians does not contemplate this side, but rather that, in the exercise of His will, God is occupied with material already prepared.<a name=188:3></a> This is according to the principle of the building of the temple: the stones were brought as already prepared, so that no sound of hammer or axe or any instrument of iron should be heard.<a name=188:4></a> But a great deal of sound was heard in those quarries whence the stones came!<a name=188:5></a> There were stonesquarers, and those men had to use hammers without regard to the ears of those who may have stood by.<a name=188:6></a> And so we have examples in certain believers, descriptive of all of us, of the service God thus renders, having in view <i>prepared</i> material; and He is very patient in this process.<a name=188:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We find men like Jacob, Moses, David, Peter, and Paul, who are but types of us all, in the preparation of whom there were many struggles; but in result the finished product appeared.<a name=188:8></a> With Jacob, for instance, as he went into Egypt, you have his family from four mothers.<a name=188:9></a> Not in any way conducive to good material is the plurality of mothers; but God would show that He carries on His work in spite of the most adverse conditions.<a name=188:10></a> If there was a family in which conditions were adverse, it was that of Jacob, not only on account of the plurality of mothers, but because of the difference in their social status, affording occasion for jealousy

		I have been thinking recently of the link there is between the epistle to the Ephesians and the ministry of David and Solomon.<a name=198:5></a> In this connection it is interesting to note that the prayer of Moses the man of God has in view eternity; he says, "From eternity to eternity thou art God" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90:2">Psalm  90:2</a>), and David, in inaugurating the service of God in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#16">1 Chronicles  16</a>, delivers a psalm which is formed of parts of several psalms ending with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#106">Psalm  106</a>, in which he says, "Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, from eternity and to eternity!<a name=198:6></a>" In bearing these thoughts in mind, we shall be able to see what is in view in this epistle.<a name=198:7></a> The epistle brings before us what is really "from eternity to eternity", going back to the purpose of God and culminating in glory to God in the "assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:21">Ephesians  3:21</a>).<a name=198:8></a> In David's psalm (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#16">1 Chronicles  16</a>), all the people <i>said</i>, Amen, that is to say, there is the suggestion of the saints being brought into agreement with what is stated, that is, of our being brought on to the ground of eternity -- "from eternity to eternity".<a name=198:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=214:1></a> In addition to what we touched upon this morning in chapter 1, it may be pointed out that what is brought before us in the chapter involves the will of God and the power of God.<a name=214:2></a> Having come down to the sphere of testimony, we have the subject of redemption mentioned (verse 7) whence all is worked out.<a name=214:3></a> The "administration of the fulness of times" implies that all is to be carried over as finished, or in a mature condition.<a name=214:4></a> Hence the apostle speaks of "all wisdom and intelligence", and having spoken of the "good pleasure of his will" he proceeds to allude to the "mystery of his will" and the "counsel of his own will".<a name=214:5></a> The period from Adam to Noah illustrates the working out of these things; so that we have the expression, "the seventh from Adam", as indicating full development, Enoch being translated; and then, in Noah, the carrying over of the result of the testimony, involving maturity; for all that entered into the ark was mature, there was no idea of multiplication in the ark.<a name=214:6></a> All the living creatures came to Noah; and his sons and their wives were, of course, full grown.<a name=214:7></a> There were no children in the ark and nothing immature.<a name=214:8></a> In all this, too, there was the idea of mystery.<a name=214:9></a> The epistle to the Ephesians has maturity in view; what is going over is to be mature.<a name=214:10></a> The teaching of this epistle is to lead to that.<a name=214:11></a> Hence we read, "that we may be no longer babes" (chapter 4:14).<a name=214:12></a> Maturity should ever be before us, especially as we draw near the end.<a name=214:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=231:1></a> What I believe the Lord would stress in this chapter, is the relation of the apostle to the things of which he wrote; and the depth of spiritual wealth that was there in him as reflecting what is in Christ -- "the unsearchable riches of the Christ".<a name=231:2></a> It will require perhaps a little more spirituality to lay hold of this feature; but in relation to the ministry it is quite clear that God intends, whilst presenting these thoughts to us, that there should be an understanding of what spiritual wealth there may be; for unless the ministry is accompanied by spiritual wealth, there is not much to commend it.<a name=231:3></a> This epistle contemplates the gospel as that of "the unsearchable riches of the Christ".<a name=231:4></a> The gospel was never intended to be presented in spiritual poverty.<a name=231:5></a> So that, whilst the ministry of Peter was in abeyance in the early record in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>- 9 there was the clear evidence of the body of spiritual wealth that he represented; whilst younger men came forward, such as Stephen, Philip and others, there was extant this spiritual wealth.<a name=231:6></a> Of Peter it is said that his 'shadow' was a feature.<a name=231:7></a> That would point to his spirituality.<a name=231:8></a> I think we may see a similar feature here in the apostle alluding to himself as "I Paul".<a name=231:9></a> The name meant much to the Ephesians, and he being a prisoner, enhanced it.<a name=231:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=269:1></a> There are two main subjects in the chapters still to be considered -- the church and the conflict; we might concentrate on these.<a name=269:2></a> It was thought that the details in the exhortatory part of chapters 4 and 5 might be left as time does not permit of going into them.<a name=269:3></a> The assembly in a peculiar way is brought to our attention in the verses read, and this affords an opportunity for briefly looking into the whole subject.<a name=269:4></a> There are, however, two features in chapters 4 and 5 that might first be touched upon; namely, the "new man" in chapter 4 and the "beloved children" in chapter 5.<a name=269:5></a> On these two features hang, practically, all that is said in detail, the "new man" having reference to what we put on, being more public; and the subject of "beloved children" bringing us into very close correspondence with Christ.<a name=269:6></a> Certain conduct is treated as hinging on these two features.<a name=269:7></a>

		Then another point in chapter 4 is the "unity of the faith" which was scarcely noticed yesterday.<a name=269:8></a> We were engaged generally with the "unity of the Spirit"; but the "unity of the faith" as having a bearing upon full growth, is a very important matter in its setting in chapter 4 leading up to the self-action of the body, which implies the absence of the babe condition (verses 1 - 16) and involves each being in his place in intelligence and affection.<a name=269:9></a> The chapter speaks of both the unity of the Spirit and the unity of the faith, the latter implying that those who compose the assembly should never assume that there <i>must</i> be differences existing.<a name=269:10></a> The saints being fully grown should surely be able, in the presence of the Lord, to see the right and wrong of everything.<a name=269:11></a> I thought it would be well, perhaps, to mention these general features in

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak about service, and to show, in so doing, how it entered into our dispensation and became diversified there.<a name=306:1></a> The best features of everything are seen in this dispensation, and so, whilst service and servants appear throughout the Old Testament, they do not rise to the level of our times.<a name=306:2></a> In our dispensation we have the idea presented in perfection in our Lord Jesus Christ, "who", as we read, "subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form", (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:6">Philippians  2:6</a>,7).<a name=306:3></a> So that we have One here in whom the idea of service is fully and perfectly presented, according to the prophetic word, "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!<a name=306:4></a>" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:1">Isaiah  42:1</a>).<a name=306:5></a> I commend that word at the outset, for it conveys to us how deeply divine feelings were engaged and moved as Jesus appeared here as a Bondman.<a name=306:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to show from the three servants mentioned in the passages read, the prominent varieties, such as were intended to give character to the dispensation from the beginning to the end, the first representing election, for the Lord in answering Ananias says, referring to Saul, "Go, for this man is an <i>elect</i> vessel to me", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>).<a name=306:7></a> I wish to dwell on the Lord's word as to this servant before he began to serve, as conveying what I may call the most unique feature of service, namely, that it is the outcome of divine selection.<a name=306:8></a> But then to go over the other points briefly; in Simon Peter we have one who was <i>made</i> a servant, which is the second point; the Lord saying to him with his brother, "I will make you fishers

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak to you under those three heads, because they enter importantly into service, and must combine if service is to be effectual; the first corresponding strikingly with Christ Himself, who is formally said to be Jehovah's elect One, in whom His soul delighted.<a name=307:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Election as to the servant is not the same as election for eternity.<a name=307:3></a> The latter refers to all believers.<a name=307:4></a> The former is very special and has the testimony in view; but it implies great forethought on the part of the Lord and preparation of the vessel, the word 'vessel', in this sense, being peculiar to Paul.<a name=307:5></a> It implies that the Lord has gone a long way up the stream, so to speak, and looked after the forefathers, the training and the environment of the person selected.<a name=307:6></a> So that the apostle Paul was in the Lord's mind long before He called him.<a name=307:7></a> He had elected him, and He had elected him with a view to a certain use, in which only he could be employed, and He had in mind that no one should displace him.<a name=307:8></a> In the course of his testimony, he became very much disliked by many, even some whom he had served at the cost of his life.<a name=307:9></a> They might not object to his ministry and teaching, but they would in time prefer that some one else should be doing the teaching and the preaching.<a name=307:10></a> But the Lord had elected this servant.<a name=307:11></a> He had a work for him to do which was special, and He was determined that no one should displace him.<a name=307:12></a> So, at the end of his ministry, he says that the Lord stood by him -- to deliver him from the lion's mouth, but not only that, but rather that <i>by him</i> the preaching might be <i>fully</i> known.<a name=307:13></a> Some might think that others could preach as well as he, but this was not the Lord's mind; He determined that the preaching should be fully presented in this great vessel that He had elected.<a name=307:14></a> No one else could have done it; there was not a man in the whole world that could preach like Paul.<a name=307:15></a> I do not say that as a gratuitous statement, but that we might

		Those first mentioned by the Lord to be served by Paul are the <i>nations</i>; then <i>kings</i>, and then the <i>sons of Israel</i>.<a name=308:4></a> He was to bear the Lord's name before nations.<a name=308:5></a> The world under the government of God is composed of nations.<a name=308:6></a> God intervened according to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11">Genesis  11</a>, early in the history of mankind, after the flood, to separate it into nations, meaning that a centralised combination as at Shinar, would hinder the testimony.<a name=308:7></a> Then you find with the nations thus formed, that the Spirit of God returns to the posterity of Shem, that being the line in which the testimony should come to the nations.<a name=308:8></a> It is as if God were to say, 'I have created circumstances in My government, which will admit of the nations, in due course, being reached'.<a name=308:9></a> But each of the nations had its own interests and aspirations, and so it required skill, that the preaching, in the name of the Lord Jesus, might be carried to each of them.<a name=308:10></a> Paul used the utmost care in preaching to the nations, so that there should be no prejudice aroused, and yet that he should be able to take out from each of them, a people, detached from its own national traits, so as to be linked on with those taken out of the other nations.<a name=308:11></a> It was a wonderful piece of work, and he speaks of it as "the offering up of the nations", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:16">Romans  15:16</a>).<a name=308:12></a> He was carrying on a kind of sacrificial service, "that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit".<a name=308:13></a> It was no question with him of numbers; you will not find specific

		So Acts shows that Peter was first, and he is so perfectly made of the Lord, that he can be in unjealous obscurity when others, like Stephen and Philip, come forward.<a name=313:3></a> But he is there to be called upon, which is a fine feature; hence in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>he is actually <i>sent</i> by the apostles with John.<a name=313:4></a> Peter and John were sent down to Samaria by the apostles that were at Jerusalem.<a name=313:5></a> I mention that, because it shows that whilst he was first, he was ready to be merged among his brethren, his fellow apostles, and to be subservient to them to do their bidding.<a name=313:6></a> That is the workmanship of Christ.<a name=313:7></a> How elastic, so to speak, it is in the subject of it.<a name=313:8></a> The body of spiritual wealth and experience seen in Peter in the later chapters of Acts is a further but most important feature of the making power of Christ in His servants.<a name=313:9></a>

		The next thing is the lovability of the servant, and that is John.<a name=313:10></a> And what I would mention first about John is that he can take a <i>second</i> place.<a name=313:11></a> Now it is a hard thing with some of us to do this, but John is almost invariably seen in that position, and he fits it beautifully -- "Peter and John".<a name=313:12></a> It is a very fine quality in service, to be able to take a second place, or, if necessary, a third place.<a name=313:13></a> Of course, in a sense, you do not want a place at all, but I am speaking of the Lord's ordering.<a name=313:14></a> If Peter is first, then somebody must be second; there are not two firsts.<a name=313:15></a> That is a test.<a name=313:16></a> So it is "Peter and John", and I think the Lord greatly honoured John because of this quality.<a name=313:17></a> I look at him in that well-known chapter in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>, how he went up with Peter to the temple at the hour of prayer.<a name=313:18></a> I suppose since the walk of Jesus on earth, heaven never saw anything so beautiful as that, the one that was set 'first' as the workmanship of Christ in the service, and then the one that was second.<a name=313:19></a> There they are; what a pair for heaven's eye!<a name=313:20></a> It was the hour of prayer; it was

		I think John would bring forward persons who <i>can be</i> silent in the service.<a name=314:6></a> It seems to me he has in mind something of that kind in the way he mentions Lazarus.<a name=314:7></a> Lazarus never says anything, as far as Scripture records, but in spite of this people <i>are believing on Jesus because of him</i> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:11">John  12:11</a>).<a name=314:8></a> Now that is a very fine thing.<a name=314:9></a> What kind of man must he be -- he is not saying anything, and yet people are believing on Jesus because of him!<a name=314:10></a> Others sought to kill him because of this.<a name=314:11></a> The next thing you get after that is that the Lord found a colt and sat on him; the <i>Lord</i> found him.<a name=314:12></a> Can we say in fairness that the Lord had Lazarus in mind when He got the colt?<a name=314:13></a> It was His own finding.<a name=314:14></a> Lazarus was the Lord's immediate product.<a name=314:15></a> He raised him.<a name=314:16></a> He was the Lord's friend.<a name=314:17></a> Is it not lovely to be the Lord's friend?<a name=314:18></a> "Our friend Lazarus", He says, (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:11">John  11:11</a>).<a name=314:19></a> Moses called his firstborn, Gershom -- "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land".<a name=314:20></a> That is what the world was to Jesus.<a name=314:21></a> He made it: "the world was made by him, and the world knew him not", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:10">John  1:10</a>).<a name=314:22></a> How strange it must have been that there was no response -- but now He had a friend in it.<a name=314:23></a> Lazarus is a friend of Jesus in this strange place that He had to do with.<a name=314:24></a> I believe the conditions He found in the world caused the Lord constant sorrow; the whole scene was blighted and opposed.<a name=314:25></a> Every step He took aroused strange opposition.<a name=314:26></a> It was most unfair and uncalled for, as He says: "They hated me without a cause", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:25">John  15:25</a>).<a name=314:27></a> How valuable was a friend in it!<a name=314:28></a> That is what Lazarus was, and what the disciples were according to John: "I call you not servants .<a name=314:29></a>.<a name=314:30></a>.<a name=314:31></a> but I have called you friends", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:15">John  15:15</a>).<a name=314:32></a> Wonderful, indeed, to be a friend to Jesus in a strange

		J.T.<a name=330:1></a> We are occupied with priesthood as in the book of Numbers, especially in its relation to levitical service.<a name=330:2></a> We have noted that the levites were given to Aaron and his sons for the service of the tabernacle, and that in the great rebellion of Korah and his company, priesthood was brought into evidence by life in Aaron's rod; it was not resurrection as a matter of doctrine, but the actual fruit of life; then in chapter 18 it is said that the levites were to be <i>united</i> with Aaron.<a name=330:3></a> We have also seen the bearing of Aaron's rod as typically governing the dispensation in relation to the Spirit.<a name=330:4></a> The rock was to be spoken to, the rod being in the hand of Moses, and we noted that the official element -- typically represented in Moses and Aaron -- would deny and falsify the dispensation in using the rod of authority, when it should have been the rod of grace.<a name=330:5></a> Moses should have spoken to the rock instead of smiting it; but notwithstanding the water flowed.<a name=330:6></a> So that we have God acting in the presence of the rod of priesthood maintaining the dispensation in its full character.<a name=330:7></a> The water flowed, and the people drank, and their cattle.<a name=330:8></a> That was the point we reached; and I think it may be remarked that priesthood is seen first in a general way, in its normal relations in the early chapters, and then, as meeting the rebellion; the latter, typical of the way God has met the great rebellion in christendom, the levitical rebellion, which is seen in the clerical system as having assumed priesthood.<a name=330:9></a> That is met in life, and finally, in the continuance of priesthood, as I hope we may see now.<a name=330:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=331:8></a> That is what I thought.<a name=331:9></a> We must see the character of the circumstances in which it appeared; that is, the dual effort through Balaam, first, as representing a great religious system having a prophetic character, and owning God, yet opposed to His people in the most deadly way, and the effort against them carried on secretly.<a name=331:10></a> But failing on that side, there was a great sensual effort.<a name=331:11></a> It is a dual attack; Satan attacking on the side which he considers the most likely to succeed, and which would be the most overwhelming, but failing in that, he attacks through our natural propensities.<a name=331:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=361:1></a> The brethren will, no doubt, discern that the proposal in taking up the book of Daniel is not to make prophecy our subject, but rather that we might see the moral teaching that stands related to prophecy, which this book specially furnishes; for the servant is prominent throughout the book, and the service is definitely connected with his state -- a very practical suggestion, for it shows that if the Lord is to continue His service the younger ones have to see that the service of God stands related to moral conditions; a condition indeed so pleasing that, as in Daniel, it rises to the divine approval in the words, a "man greatly beloved".<a name=361:2></a> The service must be in such a vessel, if it is to be pleasing to heaven.<a name=361:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=416:1></a> What is seen in the second part of the book which is now before us, is the confidence that God placed in Daniel; he has the place of a friend.<a name=416:2></a> According to the word, God would do nothing save what He would make known to His servants the prophets (<a href="../bible/Amos.htm#3:7">Amos  3:7</a>).<a name=416:3></a> That is a principle of great importance.<a name=416:4></a> God would draw us into His secrets.<a name=416:5></a> So that evidently Daniel rises in the appreciation of heaven: his value on the earth is depreciating, but he increases in value in heaven; he is regarded as 'beloved' several times in these chapters, suggestive of the advance that the servant makes.<a name=416:6></a> In devotedness to God's interests he becomes increasingly beloved.<a name=416:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 7 he has visions from God.<a name=416:8></a> "Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed".<a name=416:9></a> That is, they are not from the standpoint of his exercises.<a name=416:10></a> Chapter 9 <i>is</i> from this standpoint, but here he gets the vision <i>on his bed</i>.<a name=416:11></a> God unfolds to him in these two chapters (7 and 8) the two great branches of the gentile domination, those towards the west in chapter 7, and those towards the east in chapter 8.<a name=416:12></a> And then, chapter 9 is the outcome of his exercises; it is not what he gets on his bed, but on his <i>knees</i>.<a name=416:13></a> He is exercised about his own people, his own city; taking an intercessory place with God with regard to them.<a name=416:14></a> He is seen praying, elsewhere, but we have his prayer <i>in extenso</i> in chapter 9; it runs on to the end of verse 19.<a name=416:15></a> I suppose the Holy Spirit would lay out before us the intercessory character of his service with regard to that which was dearest to the heart of God, and dearest to the heart of Daniel; that is, Jerusalem and God's people.<a name=416:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=417:4></a> Yes.<a name=417:5></a> That is, he prays to God as then known, the covenant God of Israel.<a name=417:6></a> It is a great matter to have a right basis for our prayer.<a name=417:7></a> So that he first says, "I Daniel understood by the books that the number of the years, whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem, was seventy years".<a name=417:8></a> That is the first thing, that he understood, not simply by Jeremiah's prophecy, but by <i>books</i>.<a name=417:9></a> He no doubt read what there was of value.<a name=417:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=417:14></a> Yes.<a name=417:15></a> Chapters 7 and 8 are more God's concern -- what Daniel gets on his bed.<a name=417:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=417:20></a> Immediately, it is because of his great exercise in his prayer in regard to the city and the people, but the 'beloved' character of the man goes back farther than that.<a name=417:21></a> It is well to bear in mind that heaven has likes and dislikes.<a name=417:22></a> This book shows that in our walk and service we have to inquire whether we are liked up there.<a name=417:23></a> A beloved person is a lovable person.<a name=417:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=417:25></a>T.<a name=417:26></a> I was wondering if the lovable feature of Paul would come out early; and then the Lord appearing to him by night in a vision, saying, "I have much people in this city", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>) would correspond with Daniel 7 and 8.<a name=417:27></a> And then, bowing his knees to the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ -- would that go with chapter 9?<a name=417:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=417:29></a> I am sure there is correspondence.<a name=417:30></a> The knees bowed means exercise in prayer; (compare <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:1">Colossians  2:1</a> - 3).<a name=417:31></a>

		J.T.<a name=418:1></a> Quite so.<a name=418:2></a> I think John's writings would amplify this thought, that not only is one to be successful in his service, but he is to be lovable.<a name=418:3></a> John is not presented in Scripture as a leader or model in service; he was a companion of Peter in his early work, but aside from his writings there is not much prominence given to his individual service; but he makes much of lovability.<a name=418:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=418:11></a> Yes.<a name=418:12></a> I think he represents, in the New Testament, lovability.<a name=418:13></a> Normally heaven's tastes are reflected in the saints.<a name=418:14></a> So that, whilst one may be an effective servant in the way of preaching and teaching, he must not forget that he must be a lovable servant as well.<a name=418:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That Daniel should become the depositary of God's mind as regards the east and west is a very important matter.<a name=418:16></a> Chapters 7 and 8 are most interesting and instructive.<a name=418:17></a> As we are equal to it, God talks of His things to us.<a name=418:18></a> We are told that Abraham was His friend, and we are told that God spoke to Moses as a man speaks to his friend.<a name=418:19></a> We can understand therefore that God graciously makes things known to those who love Him.<a name=418:20></a> Of course I am not overlooking that Daniel was a prophet, and that he is employed here as such.<a name=418:21></a> In these chapters Christ is alluded to prophetically as Son of man, and Daniel is addressed by this title, so that the ground is wider than that of Israel.<a name=418:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=418:23></a> Was he maintained in the spirit of Christ in this service?<a name=418:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=418:25></a> He was.<a name=418:26></a> One point with Daniel is continuance, so that in the midst of these great events there is one to whom God can speak.<a name=418:27></a> God primarily speaks to him without any solicitation on his part, as far as Scripture shows; but in chapter 9 it <i>is</i> on account of his solicitation.<a name=418:28></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=419:4></a> But in chapter 10 Daniel is not equal in strength to the great revelation, and here we get another thing -- priestly support.<a name=419:5></a> I mention this as indicating what is in the chapter for our souls.<a name=419:6></a> First, we have a man getting the divine mind without special solicitations, and then receiving it on account of solicitations, and then again the great exercise of fasting and prayer, and another great revelation or disclosure, and he is not equal to it; all this brings out what is available for the servant.<a name=419:7></a> In chapter 10 there is the priestly support that we get in relation to the <i>man</i> clothed with linen.<a name=419:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		G.F.<a name=419:13></a>G.<a name=419:14></a> Is it your thought that before it is said he understood by books he had a vision from God?<a name=419:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=419:16></a> Yes, in chapters 7 and 8.<a name=419:17></a> But you will notice in these chapters that he is not without interest in the visions, but is very concerned to understand them, especially what relates to the fourth beast.<a name=419:18></a> This is the beast that had to do with Christ directly, and with christianity.<a name=419:19></a> It is to be remarked that while these six chapters are prophetic, each vision gives special encouragement for faith, for the final deliverance of the people of God is ever in view.<a name=419:20></a> This is for the cheer of those in the Lord's service also; we are to be assured that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.<a name=419:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=419:25></a> That is a touch; it would mean that Daniel was maintaining the full height of spirituality.<a name=419:26></a> The evening oblation is to correspond with the morning.<a name=419:27></a> As you will remember, in the types there were the morning and the evening lambs, accompanied by the oblations and drink

		offerings (see <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29:38">Exodus  29:38</a> - 41).<a name=420:1></a> It was about the time of the evening oblation, which would be dear to his heart.<a name=420:2></a> He would value the morning and the evening sacrifices.<a name=420:3></a> Many of us are more vigorous in the morning than in the evening.<a name=420:4></a> The evening sacrifice is that I should be equally vigorous in the evening as in the morning, that there should be no diminution in spiritual power by the wear and tear of the day.<a name=420:5></a> Daniel evidently maintained the height of spirituality under all circumstances.<a name=420:6></a> The morning and evening sacrifices were of equal value.<a name=420:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=420:8></a>M.<a name=420:9></a> David says, "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening oblation", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#141:2">Psalm  141:2</a>).<a name=420:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=420:11></a> Normally we are vigorous in the morning, but the heat of the day causes decline.<a name=420:12></a> I believe that household readings and prayer are of great value in God's sight.<a name=420:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=420:17></a> Yes.<a name=420:18></a> So that Daniel says, "Whilst I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God; whilst I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, flying swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation".<a name=420:19></a> That would mean that Daniel was in full priestly vigour in his prayer -- <i>whilst</i> he was doing these things.<a name=420:20></a> He enumerates what he was doing.<a name=420:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=420:24></a> Yes.<a name=420:25></a> The experience of lying in bed, in chapter 7, would be quite acceptable to God; you are restful, that is necessary.<a name=420:26></a> It is not easy to get much of that in these meetings; you do not get much time for rest.<a name=420:27></a> But it is very important to be restful, if you are to receive something from God.<a name=420:28></a> Being on your knees, as in chapter 9, is also most necessary; but in a time of restfulness God can pour in His thoughts to the soul.<a name=420:29></a> It is not laziness, it is

		J.T.<a name=421:17></a> I thought that -- priestly ministration.<a name=421:18></a> He would thoroughly understand Daniel, and his priestly exercise here, and so conveys the mind of God to him.<a name=421:19></a> God used him to convey His mind to the prophet.<a name=421:20></a> And so, in regard to the birth of John the baptist, he understood the position of the golden altar (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>).<a name=421:21></a> No doubt the heavenly dignitaries have their offices; I should say that Gabriel's is priestly.<a name=421:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=421:23></a> This heavenly dignitary was detained three weeks, (chapter 10:13).<a name=421:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=421:25></a> That would be spiritual opposition; "The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me".<a name=421:26></a> It would be most comforting to Daniel to have a priestly dignitary in heaven, and one who could come to him in this way.<a name=421:27></a> Of course, that is all centred in Christ now -- all that Michael meant, all that Gabriel meant, is centred in Christ personally in heaven.<a name=421:28></a> The same remarks apply to angelic representation of children spoken of by the Lord in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=421:29></a>

		J.T.<a name=422:9></a> That is what comes out in chapters 10 and 11; the great sympathy of heaven with Daniel.<a name=422:10></a> The lesson for us is that as we advance in the Lord's service heaven becomes more interested: we begin to get weak as we grow old.<a name=422:11></a> God knows this and has sympathy for us, helping us accordingly.<a name=422:12></a> So that there is a great deal in these chapters to encourage the servants who are advanced in years to continue, not to give up, but to go on.<a name=422:13></a> As was remarked, Daniel was very old at this time.<a name=422:14></a>

		Thus the truth in these two gospels, besides the testimony of the other scriptures, being known in the assembly, the Lord's words here are understood; and so the Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=440:5></a> This is not simply historical, it is the present answer of the assembly as well as that of the Spirit.<a name=440:6></a> Revelation is the voice of God at the present time.<a name=440:7></a> "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", runs right down to our time; the whole history of the assembly is in view -- the witness goes on.<a name=440:8></a>

		Then, the second year, they were to eat "that which springeth of the same"; alluding evidently to a growth from the previous one -- what grew of itself in the first year, but still without cultivation.<a name=444:8></a> This has to be noted.<a name=444:9></a> With none of the so-called religious denominations of christendom is there any culture according to God.<a name=444:10></a> They know nothing about God's agricultural year, one of the most interesting things in Scripture.<a name=444:11></a> It involves the idea of the 'field' (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#5:9">Ecclesiastes  5:9</a>), upon which the king himself is dependent.<a name=444:12></a> But if the king lives of the field he sees that it is properly tilled.<a name=444:13></a> He sows to obtain a certain crop and gets it.<a name=444:14></a> We all know how Solomon had superintendents who provided for him and his household throughout the whole year (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#4">1 Kings  4</a>), so that there was abundance of food.<a name=444:15></a> Solomon's table was not furnished with fruits that grew of themselves.<a name=444:16></a> They were from gardens, and fields, properly cultivated and cared for.<a name=444:17></a>

		In this third year there is sowing and reaping, planting and eating the fruit, and then we have the application of the figure to the remnant: "Judah shall again take root downward".<a name=445:10></a> That is the secret of the whole matter; we do not like the going down; but in order to "bear fruit upward", there must be the taking root downward.<a name=445:11></a> As I said, it is not now that I come back to my place in the counsel of God; I do recognise that of course, but I do not become inactive there; I must take root downward.<a name=445:12></a> God has fixed the root where it is immovable; that belongs to His counsel, and every christian should understand what we mean when we say 'the security of the believer', but it should not make people content without taking root downward; if it does there is little or no practical growth; taking root downward implies self-judgment.<a name=445:13></a> How do I learn to go down?<a name=445:14></a> From Christ.<a name=445:15></a> He

		I have read these verses, dear brethren, to apply them to a local company of believers, for, while this chapter is vast in its scope as regards the Person of Christ, His power and His glory, the bearing of it is on the local assembly.<a name=447:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While John does not use the word "assembly" in his gospel, he has it in view, however, and would promote in it not only order but a <i>living</i> state of things; for order, in itself, is cold; it is most important, of course, but it must be associated with <i>life</i>.<a name=447:2></a> This is seen generally in Colossians.<a name=447:3></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>and 12 this is also contemplated, so that chapter 12 is the result of the ministry of Christ in chapter 11.<a name=447:4></a> The Lord comes to Bethany six days before the passover; and being there, and in what ensues -- supper is prepared -- He says nothing, save to rebuke Judas; nor does anyone else say anything.<a name=447:5></a> Judas breaks the silence, producing a foreign element, criticising the worshipper.<a name=447:6></a> It is a scene (aside from Judas and aside from the Lord's rebuke) of spiritual power in silence.<a name=447:7></a> This must underlie all assembly meetings, if conditions are to exist such as are suitable for divine operations, for the service of Christ as Head, as the minister of the sanctuary.<a name=447:8></a>

		Now, chapter 11 is preparatory to all this.<a name=447:9></a> It has in view not simply to establish order in the place, but a living state of things.<a name=447:10></a> What occurred at Bethany was a shining forth of glory: "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it".<a name=447:11></a> What was seen, therefore, when the Lord came to Bethany later, was the outcome of this presentation of glory.<a name=447:12></a> Chapter 11 is of infinite scope, and yet what is presented converges on a small town; it is "the village"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to point out very briefly that feature of the ministry which establishes balance in a local company, spiritual balance; and that is to be observed in Martha as seen here.<a name=448:4></a> It is said, "Martha then, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him: but Mary sat in the house".<a name=448:5></a> Now, John has a peculiar way, by the Spirit, of bringing forward every item of the work of God.<a name=448:6></a> Martha has acquired in our minds a certain character drawn from Luke's presentation of her (chapter 10:38 - 42).<a name=448:7></a> Luke introduces Martha to us as a busy sort of woman, owning a house, and possessed of a complaining spirit; and her criticism was not limited to her sister, but extended even to the Lord Himself.<a name=448:8></a> "Dost <i>thou</i> not care", she says to the Lord, "that my sister hath left me to serve alone?<a name=448:9></a>" That is Luke's record, the first we have of Martha, and it appears to me that generally the saints have formed their judgment of her from that record, not having given due weight to John's account of her.<a name=448:10></a> I am not speaking, nor did the Holy Spirit record these things, merely to call attention to this one person.<a name=448:11></a> He is dealing with a quality, a certain character that shows itself in us, and how an objectionable feature is displaced by what is desirable and essential to a local assembly.<a name=448:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so John says, "Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him".<a name=448:13></a> I may remark here that John alone mentions Nicodemus.<a name=448:14></a> And he brings forward certain commendable things about Thomas, as in this chapter, for instance: "Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow disciples, Let <i>us</i> also go, that we may die with him" (verse 16).<a name=448:15></a> We call Thomas the doubter, but we must not

		omit this record of him because, it is a question, as I said, of bringing in the work of God, every bit of it; that not one item, however small, or however allied with other things, even with extraneous matter, must fail to be taken into account and made room for in the assembly, if we are to profit by it.<a name=449:1></a> One great point in John is, that the works of God should be manifest.<a name=449:2></a> And so the record here is that Martha, having heard "that Jesus was coming, went out and met him".<a name=449:3></a> Not simply that He came, but He <i>was coming</i>.<a name=449:4></a> That is another point that John emphasises, that Jesus <i>comes</i>; He moves towards us, and He honours those who meet Him.<a name=449:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Martha went immediately to meet Him, and, when Mary comes into evidence, it is said that the Lord was still <i>in the place</i> where Martha met Him; as if we are not to forget that the Lord took notice of that.<a name=449:6></a> He is still in the same place when Mary comes.<a name=449:7></a> Much transpired there.<a name=449:8></a> Every believer ought to take note of the conversation that passed in that place.<a name=449:9></a> "Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.<a name=449:10></a> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.<a name=449:11></a> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.<a name=449:12></a> Believest thou this?<a name=449:13></a> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world".<a name=449:14></a> That was the conversation between the Son of God and a believer, for such Martha was.<a name=449:15></a> She was active and energetic, but this conversation shows that she was a genuinely interested person, who loved the Lord Jesus, and would know the truth; and the Lord took account of her and instructed her, and made her what she had never been before, a believer in Him as "the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world".<a name=449:16></a> That was the result of this remarkable meeting.<a name=449:17></a>

		Mary "arose quickly and came to him", we are told.<a name=450:6></a> No doubt the Lord would have her particularly in His heart, because the chapter at the outset specially mentions that she was the Mary who had anointed Him.<a name=450:7></a> She is in the mind of the Spirit, because she is the worshipper.<a name=450:8></a> John is emphasising the worshipper; and whatever activity there may be, whatever intelligence, as in Martha, if there be not the spirit of worship, our testimony must be on a low level, and wanting of the heavenly touch.<a name=450:9></a> So that Mary is specially in the mind of the Spirit here.<a name=450:10></a> She represents the spirituality of the place.<a name=450:11></a> She "sat still in the house".<a name=450:12></a> I do not criticise that; she was restful; but still I cannot ignore the fact that the Lord did not go to her: He remained in the place where Martha met Him.<a name=450:13></a> It is as if He would free us in our minds from undue occupation with this one or that one who is reputed, and rightly so, to be spiritual; as if He would establish a balance amongst us, in each local assembly, that whilst full value is to be accorded to those who deserve it (those who are spiritual, those who are worshippers) we must not ignore the work of God, however small, in others.<a name=450:14></a> It must be taken account of.<a name=450:15></a> It is pure

		So that, as I noted, the Lord does not go to Mary; she comes to Him.<a name=451:3></a> And the Holy Spirit tells us that Jesus was still in the same place where Martha met Him.<a name=451:4></a> I rather think that is the principle of the gathering at Bethany; it is the place where Martha met Him, where the light of the conversation with her shone.<a name=451:5></a> Evidently, there were no others present, but you have the principle of conversation carried on -- the Lord of glory conversing with a sister who, as I have said, did not have a good beginning.<a name=451:6></a> But the Lord is now taking account of her, and she is constituted a believer in Him as "the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world".<a name=451:7></a> She is, as I may say, a board in the tabernacle.<a name=451:8></a> She is of that which is to be filled with the glory.<a name=451:9></a> And you get what corresponds with this in the next chapter: the odour of the ointment <i>filled</i> the house.<a name=451:10></a> The Lord remained in the place where Martha met Him until Mary came.<a name=451:11></a> She went to Him; and I believe that involves a principle.<a name=451:12></a> We come together on ground wide enough to include all in whom God had wrought in any given locality.<a name=451:13></a> The worship of God in the true sense <i>may</i> be found there, but all in whom God has wrought have normally recognition there.<a name=451:14></a>

		The Holy Spirit loves to enlarge on what is "more excellent"; the epistle to the Philippians makes provision for that, not only what is excellent, but "more excellent" (chapter 1:10).<a name=451:15></a> Martha has made headway, but Mary still represents what is more excellent.<a name=451:16></a> And so as soon as she heard that the Lord called for her, "she arose quickly, and came unto him".<a name=451:17></a> And: "The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there".<a name=451:18></a>

		Martha moves, nobody moved with her.<a name=452:1></a> That is to say, she does not represent <i>influence</i>.<a name=452:2></a> When Mary moved, others moved with her, so that she represents that in the believer which influences others towards Christ.<a name=452:3></a> As she went, they went.<a name=452:4></a> You may say that they were only Jews actuated by natural feelings; but then verse 33 says, "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came <i>with her</i>".<a name=452:5></a> They were also weeping, and He took account of them.<a name=452:6></a> It is a tribute to Mary's spirituality; she had influenced others, and as influenced by her, the Lord takes account of them, and goes so far as to weep Himself.<a name=452:7></a> Marvellous thing!<a name=452:8></a> Mary is weeping, and the Jews are weeping, and when He saw them, <i>He</i> wept.<a name=452:9></a> There is a great deal in that, spiritually.<a name=452:10></a> The Lord joins in the feelings centring in Mary.<a name=452:11></a> Martha received intelligence from Him, but there is nothing about her tears, whereas Mary's weeping and the weeping of those she influenced, affect Him.<a name=452:12></a>

		The assembly should be a place of influence.<a name=452:13></a> I do not mean weeping, but it is certainly a place of feeling, a place where the Holy Spirit is free to act on our holy sentiments and feelings.<a name=452:14></a> And the wonderful thing is that the Lord joins in this, as we see in this touching scene at Bethany.<a name=452:15></a> It is affecting that He should take notice of Mary in this way, and the influence she had with others -- that what they did, He did.<a name=452:16></a> His tender heart of sympathy was moved: "Jesus therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit, and was troubled, and said, Where have ye put him?<a name=452:17></a> They say to him, Lord, come and see.<a name=452:18></a> Jesus wept".<a name=452:19></a> Except Gethsemane and the cross, Scripture presents no scene more touching than this.<a name=452:20></a> But what I call special attention to is, that seeing Mary weep, and seeing the Jews who came with her weep, the Lord wept.<a name=452:21></a> You get the principle there of the Lord coming in and having part with us in the expression of our holy spiritual feelings.<a name=452:22></a> Mary thus represents what is spiritual, what the
