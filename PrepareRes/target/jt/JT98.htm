		THE PLACE OF ISRAEL IN THE THOUGHTS OF GOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:1">Romans  9:1</a> - 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> It might be very profitable for us to consider the place of Israel in the thoughts of God.<a name=1:2></a> The first few verses of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>seem to me to indicate the place of Israel in the thoughts of God.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=1:4></a> I suppose the tendency with us has been to be so engaged with our own blessing that we have overlooked a great deal that belongs to the truth of God.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:6></a> I have been thinking too that perhaps most of the things that we speak of as blessings which we have come into in christianity, we find in Scripture to be primarily connected with Israel.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:8></a> For instance, sonship?<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:10></a> Yes, that is the first thing mentioned: the adoption belongs to them.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=1:12></a> And the adoption is sonship.<a name=1:13></a> I believe what is so important and so helpful to us is to apprehend the greatness of God's purposes, not simply to take in our part, but to apprehend God's purposes in their entirety.<a name=1:14></a> I think that everything then falls into its own place.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=1:16></a> Whether as regards Israel or the church.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:18></a> Yes, and it is not only that these things are presented as a subject for faith (that is, as something to come in in the future) in the Scriptures, but I think that every element is available at the present time.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=1:20></a>R.<a name=1:21></a> What do you mean by that?<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:23></a> Well, take the first one here, the adoption; it is not simply represented as a matter of faith, but it is available, as is clearly shown in chapter 8.<a name=1:24></a> It is not simply that you are in the light of sonship, but that you have the spirit of sonship: "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God".<a name=1:25></a>
	</div>

		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=2:1></a> What about the glory?<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:3></a> I suppose that also is connected with the Holy Spirit.<a name=2:4></a> He is the "Spirit of glory", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:14">1 Peter  4:14</a>.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:6></a> You mean that those things are available <i>now</i>?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> Certainly; I think that this is exceedingly practical, because it shows that the thoughts of God have taken form, every one of them.<a name=2:9></a> Of course, where it says, "according to flesh", you cannot apply that to the church; he is speaking here of the things that particularly distinguish Israel.<a name=2:10></a> What may be called blessings apply to the church now.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:12></a> Will Israel pass through death in the same manner in which the believer now does in order to enter into these blessings?<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:14></a> Israel is viewed as dead, and they come into resurrection.<a name=2:15></a> The figure in Ezekiel is very clear "These bones are the whole house of Israel", <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#37:11">Ezekiel  37:11</a>.<a name=2:16></a> That is what was said to the prophet, and verily they assume form and come to life.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:18></a> It is national resurrection; they are not in view today.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:20></a> They are only in view in the assembly now.<a name=2:21></a> In the assembly proper there is neither Jew nor gentile, but the remnant of Israel is maintained there.<a name=2:22></a> That is the point the apostle makes in chapter 11: he adduces himself as a proof of it.<a name=2:23></a> Indeed the apostle goes so far as to say elsewhere that not only the remnant shall be saved, but that the whole twelve tribes were "instantly serving God day and night" and that they hoped to come to the resurrection (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:7">Acts  26:7</a>).<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:25></a> I do not quite understand how they are preserved in the assembly.<a name=2:26></a> You mean that there are Israelites coming into the light of God's favour now?<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:28></a> I think so; a remnant of Israel is merged into the assembly; they are so taken account of.<a name=2:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=2:30></a> God added to the assembly such as should be saved.<a name=2:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:1></a> Yes, the spared remnant of Israel.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:3></a> Then their place is far better than Israel nationally.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:5></a> They come into heavenly glory in result.<a name=3:6></a> In spite of the national breakdown God preserves the true Israel in the church.<a name=3:7></a> Nothing that God introduces here can lapse.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D-t.<a name=3:9></a> It is always deeply interesting to me to see the work of God among the Israelites; the faithfulness of God is really what carries them through in the church.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> That is the idea; the church is where things are preserved.<a name=3:12></a> Take the law; it is maintained, only that it reappears in a better form.<a name=3:13></a> The righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk not according to the flesh but according to Spirit (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:4">Romans  8:4</a>).<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=3:15></a> I was just thinking how the Lord is causing the truth of the assembly to grow in our souls; it is really marvellous.<a name=3:16></a> You know all we think of is that we have got a little blessing for ourselves, but if it were not for the assembly, where would the character of God be maintained?<a name=3:17></a> Really everything is maintained in the assembly.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:19></a> Everything.<a name=3:20></a> There is a very interesting point in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#8">Isaiah  8</a>, where, in view of Jehovah hiding His face from the house of Jacob, it says, "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples" (verse 16).<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=3:22></a> And does not the Spirit of God take up that scripture in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>?<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:24></a> He does: "I and the children which God has given me".<a name=3:25></a> They are to be for signs and wonders to Israel.<a name=3:26></a> And then in the same chapter (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#8">Isaiah  8</a>) the law and the testimony are the test of everything, and they are the test of everything today.<a name=3:27></a> For faith everything is intact.<a name=3:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=3:29></a>S.<a name=3:30></a> Suppose some person came to you and said, 'But the church has failed'.<a name=3:31></a> What would you say to him?<a name=3:32></a> What about the shipwreck in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27">Acts  27</a>?<a name=3:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:1></a> Well, the shipwreck did not take place until they got close enough to land to get ashore.<a name=4:2></a> Every single passenger on board that ship upon which Paul sailed got to land safely.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=4:4></a> There are things connected with the church on the divine side according to the purposes of God which never fail.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:6></a> In view of the breakdown of the assembly the guarantee for everything is in Christ, the faithful and true witness.<a name=4:7></a> Directly the breakdown of the assembly comes into evidence then Christ becomes prominent as the faithful and true witness.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:9></a> I was thinking with regard to the shipwreck that God said to Paul, "God hath given thee all them that sail with thee".<a name=4:10></a> Their salvation was bound up with Paul.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:12></a> Quite so.<a name=4:13></a> While the ship was at sea the only salvation for the passengers was to abide in the ship; but directly it got close to land, their salvation depended on leaving the ship and going on to land.<a name=4:14></a> I think Christ becomes the land.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B-t.<a name=4:16></a> I think that is a very important point for souls, because they have to learn to rest in Christ; everything is maintained in Christ.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:18></a> Things are maintained <i>down here</i> at the present time for the reason that the Holy Spirit is here; they are not maintained in what is ecclesiastical.<a name=4:19></a> The ship refers to what is ecclesiastical.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:21></a> I have heard it said that too much is made of the assembly, and the assembly has been put in the place of Christ.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:23></a> I do not think you can make too much of the assembly, because God has placed His testimony in the assembly, and so far as I see it will be there eternally; I do not think there will be any change.<a name=4:24></a> What God has placed in the assembly here will come out in it in the future.<a name=4:25></a> It is not the saints as dissociated from the Lord.<a name=4:26></a> If it is a question of

		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		ecclesiasticism, you may make too much of it, as in Rome.<a name=5:1></a> The idea is that the assembly is Christ morally.<a name=5:2></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>the term, "the Christ", includes the assembly; it is His body.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B-t.<a name=5:4></a> I look upon it as the Person of Christ first, the assembly second.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> But that is not it.<a name=5:7></a> It is all right in a way, but at the present moment Christ is expressed in the church; you cannot separate them.<a name=5:8></a> The Lord is not acting on different principles now than He did in the beginning.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		O.R.<a name=5:10></a> God will never give up His thoughts.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:12></a> You cannot dissociate Christ from His body.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:14></a> If everything is maintained in the church, how does that connect with chapters 2 and 3 of Revelation?<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:16></a> There it is the public, historical thing that is in view, that which was established to bear the light of Christ to the world during His absence.<a name=5:17></a> Then you must remember that Philadelphia comes into view, and I have no doubt that Philadelphia represents the church according to what it is to Christ.<a name=5:18></a> You get the overcomer, of course, in all the phases of the church, but what He says to the overcomer in Philadelphia is very different from what He says to the other overcomers.<a name=5:19></a> He speaks of the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, and so on.<a name=5:20></a> The thing to see is that although the ecclesiastical and official thing has broken down, yet the Holy Spirit is here, and the saints are here, and if the Lord is acting down here at all He is acting in connection with these, and that is what the gates of Hades will not prevail against.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=5:22></a> That about the overcomer is very beautiful.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>

		There were the three 'mys' on their side, and He answered with all the 'mys' on His side.<a name=5:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:25></a> And then as you proceed with the message to Laodicea, the Lord is standing outside; but where is

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He outside?<a name=6:1></a> What I understand is that He is outside the ecclesiastical system, and He is found among His people, those who are morally outside.<a name=6:2></a> I think Thyatira is the ecclesiastical system.<a name=6:3></a> The Lord recognised the assembly ecclesiastically until Thyatira; in that church a remnant is recognised, and that involves separation morally.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:5></a> But I have heard it said that the church never was ecclesiastical; it was always in the power of the Spirit.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:7></a> That is true, but there was that which was public and official, and with which the Lord had been identified, which had the place of the candlestick.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what I mean by ecclesiastical, the proper church position publicly.<a name=6:9></a> I think the Lord suffered the church up to Thyatira.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:11></a> One would see it in the early chapters of the Acts outwardly.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:13></a> That is the idea.<a name=6:14></a> But to return to Israel; God had reserved a remnant, and the apostle Paul was the testimony to it.<a name=6:15></a> He says, "I also am an Israelite .<a name=6:16></a>.<a name=6:17></a>.<a name=6:18></a>", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:1">Romans  11:1</a>.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:20></a> We get that in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, too: "We .<a name=6:21></a>.<a name=6:22></a>.<a name=6:23></a> who first trusted in Christ".<a name=6:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:25></a> As a principle, do not the remnant always come in for the best?<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:27></a> They do.<a name=6:28></a> They always come in for what is better than that to which they were previously attached.<a name=6:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remnant of Israel came into the church.<a name=6:30></a> But then in these chapters it is not the church in its heavenly character as connected with the divine counsels, but as the gentiles occupying properly the place of Israel down here.<a name=6:31></a> Israel is set aside, and it contemplates the setting aside of the gentiles also.<a name=6:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:33></a> But they are grafted in.<a name=6:34></a> I think this chapter is very wonderful; it is most important to see the consistency of God with Himself.<a name=6:35></a>

		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:1></a> So you get the doxology in the end of chapter 11: "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=7:2></a> .<a name=7:3></a>.<a name=7:4></a>.<a name=7:5></a>".<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=7:7></a> It looks as though the apostle, when he got to the end of the theme, was overpowered with the grandeur of it and he breaks out with the doxology.<a name=7:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:9></a> It is the glory of God that is in view, and the glory of God is in resurrection.<a name=7:10></a> What is really involved is the bringing in of Israel into resurrection, and in that way God's glory is brought to pass.<a name=7:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:15></a> The church has its distinct place in the divine scheme, but it is not so contemplated here; it is not even called the church.<a name=7:16></a> It is simply the gentiles that are in view here and they are occupying the place of Israel, so that Israel is cut off.<a name=7:17></a> But the point is to show the faithfulness of God in regard to promise "For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance", and so it says, "All Israel shall be saved",

		J.P.<a name=7:18></a> There is a divine needs-be for these chapters; we get to the middle of chapter 3 and it looks as though Israel's fate is hopeless; then another line is followed out and the Spirit of God takes up the threads, unites them, interweaves them and brings them out in the fulness of time.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:20></a> You get the gentiles here coming into the goodness of God; their salvation depends on their continuing in this goodness, and if they do not continue they also will be cut off.<a name=7:21></a>

		I have before me tonight to seek to show how God has broken off all relations with the world.<a name=83:1></a> There have been three worlds with which God stood connected.<a name=83:2></a> The first was that which was before the flood.<a name=83:3></a> It was owned in a certain relation as proceeding from Seth, the man whom God gave to Adam and Eve instead of Abel.<a name=83:4></a> His name signifies that he was appointed, and his posterity is given in Genesis S.<a name=83:5></a> God stood in a measure related to that world.<a name=83:6></a> There was one man in it who walked with God, and in that way maintained what was due to Him, no doubt as a testimony.<a name=83:7></a> That man was translated, and another appears to take his place.<a name=83:8></a> The appearance of Noah became a resting-place for the heart and mind of God, and in Noah He perceives one in whom He could inaugurate and set up another world; hence He breaks His relations with the first world.<a name=83:9></a> He gave men one hundred and twenty years, and during all that time there was one man who was endued with the Spirit of Christ; he was endued with the spirit of evangelisation.<a name=83:10></a> What grace on God's part; but all in vain!<a name=83:11></a> There was a complete termination of that world; but then it was replaced by another, for <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9">Genesis  9</a>records the establishment of another world.<a name=83:12></a> It was set up on another work, but owned of God, and He entered into a covenant with it.<a name=83:13></a> That would receive divine support.<a name=83:14></a> There was in the cloud the token of God's covenant.<a name=83:15></a> What was the result?<a name=83:16></a> We are told that men deliberately chose to eliminate God from their knowledge.<a name=83:17></a> The men of that world, in spite of all the kindness and power that God showed them, deliberately chose to eliminate God from their

		My thought in reading these two passages is to show you how God meets imperialism.<a name=102:1></a> I refer to that because it is in imperialism that Satan has sought to set aside the divine thought in regard to the race of mankind.<a name=102:2></a> God interfered with men when they sought to combine in a unity, and He set up barriers, so that the combination should be prevented.<a name=102:3></a> God will not allow of any universal combination of men, except as it is under the influence of Christ.<a name=102:4></a> He will not admit of any other, and any attempt to bring it about, He regards, to use a military term, as a declaration of war.<a name=102:5></a> Any attempt to bring about a universal unity, God regards as open opposition to Himself.<a name=102:6></a> Men may not intend that it is in opposition to God; they may endeavour to hide the real motive, or in other words, men may not quite know what the power by which they are controlled intends in the attempt; they may not be aware of it, but Satan is aware of it.<a name=102:7></a> Men do things that they are not quite intelligent about; they are impelled to do them by a power that is outside them, for there is a power in this world which is hostile to God, and its imperial motives always are antagonistic to God.<a name=102:8></a> All will appear nakedly in the future, when it succeeds in unifying the different nations of the world under one head.<a name=102:9></a> When the enemy succeeds in doing that, he comes out openly.<a name=102:10></a> That head is supported by him, whose names are given to us in Revelation, "The ancient serpent, he who is called Devil and Satan".<a name=102:11></a> He has got a variety of designations, and they are all given in that passage, so that there might be no mistake as to him, and he gives all his power to the beast.<a name=102:12></a> So that it is all now manifested.<a name=102:13></a> His great aim from the building of the

		That is perhaps something that you have not thought much about, but that is what obtains in the world at the present time, an endeavour to bring about a universal unity.<a name=103:7></a> I want to show you that God has met that in Christ.<a name=103:8></a> It is always attractive to be diverted from what Satan is doing to what God is doing, and what God is doing is all centred in the Lord Jesus.<a name=103:9></a> The Lord Jesus appearing in this world was for God's pleasure.<a name=103:10></a> He is the Man of God's pleasure.<a name=103:11></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17">Acts  17</a>that God is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness, and it is by the Man whom He has ordained, that is to say, by Christ.<a name=103:12></a> Then it says, "giving the proof of it to all in having raised him from among the dead".<a name=103:13></a> Now, in that sense, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was God's way of emphasising His approval of Him.<a name=103:14></a> The approved Man is raised, beloved friends, the <i>approved Man</i>!<a name=103:15></a> Now why was the Lord Jesus approved?<a name=103:16></a> We are told that He loved righteousness-He <i>loved</i> it -- and He hated lawlessness.<a name=103:17></a> He was the opposite of Nimrod.<a name=103:18></a> He was the opposite, in fact, of all the great rulers of antiquity.<a name=103:19></a> They did not love righteousness.<a name=103:20></a> Now what is said of the Lord Jesus is that He <i>loved</i> it.<a name=103:21></a> That came out in His path here; it came out in all His ways.<a name=103:22></a> Many of us are young people, and, I speak

		My dear Brother,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have your letter of September 20th and I am interested in its contents.<a name=205:4></a> The expression that the children of the saints do not need conversion is misleading and indeed literally untrue, as many, alas!<a name=205:5></a> get far astray; but even as to those who do not go into the world the statement is misleading, unless guarded.<a name=205:6></a> I do not recall making this statement-if I did it would be to call attention to the difference between those wholly away from God and the children of believers who have proceeded outwardly with their parents in the truth.<a name=205:7></a> It is really a question of the right use of words.<a name=205:8></a> The word 'convert' or 'conversion' has reference to persons who by <i>profession</i> or <i>conduct</i> are wholly away from God.<a name=205:9></a> The word therefore could hardly apply to Timothy, for there is no evidence that he had turned away from the faith of his mother and grandmother.<a name=205:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But then "that which is born of the flesh is flesh", and hence the children of believers need to be born again as others, and this, I think, is what needs to be pressed.<a name=205:11></a> The fact that the flesh profits <i>nothing</i> should be pressed on children and the necessity not only of being born of the Spirit, but also of <i>water</i>.<a name=205:12></a> It is in the evidence of possessing spiritual instincts and pure instincts that the children of believers, who have not by word or deed adopted the world, should be accepted as eligible for christian fellowship.<a name=205:13></a> And I believe a young person should be able to give <i>some</i> account of when he began to experience the effect of the work

		The apostle links the saints with himself in what he was passing through.<a name=207:10></a> In christendom the clergy are above the laity, but the Leader of our salvation is made perfect through sufferings.<a name=207:11></a> He descended first.<a name=207:12></a> He takes the lead in suffering, "As the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us", the apostle says.<a name=207:13></a> The thing is to accept discipline, and to see how blessing comes in by going down.<a name=207:14></a> The apostle despaired even of life.<a name=207:15></a> Discipline is preservative and formative.<a name=207:16></a> In bereavement or sorrow, we may go down to the gates of death; we may even be brought down to that ourselves.<a name=207:17></a> Hezekiah is an instance, but he comes up with a sense of the love of God.<a name=207:18></a> So the apostle goes down and this characterises his letter.<a name=207:19></a> In the ways of God the apostle has to go through this.<a name=207:20></a> Reduction has to be effected, and we are all drawn together in our spirits by the discipline of God.<a name=207:21></a>

		It will be observed by most of us that this epistle opens as an address to the assembly of God at Corinth, hence all the teaching has reference to that position, and in reading this letter it is helpful to connect with it the initial work at Corinth, the apostle's early circumstances and work there.<a name=209:1></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:2">Acts  18:2</a>, he found "a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife".<a name=209:2></a> I thought it well to call attention to that as it sheds light on the epistle.<a name=209:3></a> The Lord had the formation of the assembly in view, and the architect was known at the outset as a tent-maker, and lodged with Aquila and Priscilla, who were not Corinthians at all but Jews by race belonging to Pontus, who had been ordered to leave Rome.<a name=209:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the three are in no way such as would be held in favour at Corinth.<a name=209:5></a> Their rank would be nothing beyond that of trades people and their trade of no special consequence to a town built up on architecture.<a name=209:6></a> It is as if God would begin in this unpretentious way where His assembly should be set up.<a name=209:7></a> It was the word that was exercising the apostle, and it was a question of teaching the word of God.<a name=209:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thoughts of God should take form in the assembly.<a name=209:9></a> The simplest person in Corinth would have access to those three people.<a name=209:10></a> The question might arise, 'How is God to work out His thoughts?<a name=209:11></a>'.<a name=209:12></a> In Exodus, which corresponds with this, His greatness is called attention to, the elders go up to the mountain to see the greatness of God before He requests the people to build Him a tabernacle.<a name=209:13></a> But He virtually says after that, 'I am to come into very small circumstances

		ADMINISTRATION IN @MATTHEW 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:1">Matthew  2:1</a> - 23
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter suggests the condition of things into which the Administrator is introduced, and which He has to deal with.<a name=219:1></a> It is the state of things in Israel, officially or nationally, and is in great contrast to the godly remnant which we see in the first two chapters of Luke.<a name=219:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There should have been light in Jerusalem, but there was complete breakdown in regard to God's thought for Israel, so that we see the sovereign operation of God outside of Israel, in bringing in light from heaven.<a name=219:3></a> The star appearing to the wise men suggests this.<a name=219:4></a> From the official element in Jerusalem they could get scriptural information, and they were able to use and apply this in the heavenly light they had received.<a name=219:5></a> Israel had the oracles of God in Scripture but the Scriptures are only understood in the heavenly light which has come in through the church.<a name=219:6></a> Going to Jerusalem exposes the darkness there, but it was also an intimation to the nation that God was moving.<a name=219:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Wisdom is a great necessity in administration hence the wise men.<a name=219:8></a> In Luke the shepherds suggest God's care for man, as God would still have men as His flock.<a name=219:9></a> The star coming in here in connection with the King suggests the Star and the Sceptre in Balaam's prophecy (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#24:17">Numbers  24:17</a>).<a name=219:10></a> The star, too, announces in a dignified way the arrival of the King.<a name=219:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Administration in the first chapter would appear to be in connection with the rights ("Son of David" ), and promises ("Son of Abraham" ) of God.<a name=219:12></a> In the second chapter the introduction of heavenly light suggests the administration of His glory.<a name=219:13></a> The administration is to be from heaven.<a name=219:14></a> There is light from heaven to bear on everything here in connection with the exercises of administration.<a name=219:15></a>

		<a name=220>[Page 220]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew things are viewed in responsibility.<a name=220:1></a> We see that God is going to assert and maintain His rights through the King.<a name=220:2></a> There is in the King the solution of every difficulty that is raised in connection with the condition of things found here (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#8:4">Ecclesiastes  8:4</a>).<a name=220:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two important features of the administration are suggested by the twofold way in which Christ is presented.<a name=220:4></a> First as "the little child"; then as in verse 15, "Out of Egypt have I called my Son", (compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a>).<a name=220:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The expression "the little child" occurs very frequently and suggests the spirit that should mark the administration of the kingdom.<a name=220:6></a> It is the only kind of spirit that is suitable to the kingdom as seen in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:1">Matthew  18:1</a> - 4.<a name=220:7></a> Solomon speaks of himself as a little child on taking up the kingdom (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#3:7">1 Kings  3:7</a>).<a name=220:8></a> The great failure in man's administration in the world today is that the people cannot be controlled and led.<a name=220:9></a> But in the coming day of the kingdom "a little child shall lead them".<a name=220:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of sonship is developed in Matthew in connection with the administration of the kingdom.<a name=220:11></a> There can be no right administration apart from the sense and liberty of sonship.<a name=220:12></a> Saints are sometimes almost afraid to touch matters connected with divine administration because they are not in the liberty of sonship.<a name=220:13></a> "David's sons were chief rulers", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#8:18">2 Samuel  8:18</a>.<a name=220:14></a> Who would have more care for the interests of the kingdom than the king's sons?<a name=220:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The three cities mentioned seem to answer to the three divisions of the generations in chapter 1.<a name=220:16></a> The first division would bring you to Christ, under His authority, which answers to Jerusalem the city of the great King.<a name=220:17></a> In Bethlehem, which was "little", we have suggested the absence of anything in the way of outward show, which corresponds to the breakdown of the public aspect of things marked by the Babylonish

	<div class="paragraph">
		W e find the brethren, it may be said, compassionately in connection with the kingdom in Matthew.<a name=221:3></a> Peter's line discovers to us our need of the brethren in this way.<a name=221:4></a> In Colossians on the other hand, we find the brethren constitutionally on the other side of Jordan.<a name=221:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Nazareth, "He shall be called a Nazaraean", you reach Christ personally as the One who is not accepted publicly and you accept that place with Him.<a name=221:6></a> So you are in line with the whole spirit of prophetic ministry in regard to Christ as rejected.<a name=221:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is when we feel most the state of captivity that we get most light as to Christ.<a name=221:8></a> Compare Daniel in Babylon, Paul in prison, and John in Patmos.<a name=221:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1 may be regarded as presenting the kind of man and chapter 2, the King.<a name=221:10></a> There is a suggestion of the two pillars of the temple, Beauty and Strength.<a name=221:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew does not refer to the Babe; Luke does because he is presenting the Lord Jesus as Man.<a name=221:12></a> In Matthew it is the King.<a name=221:13></a> The thought of Emmanuel in Matthew, God with us, is God with His people in support, whereas John presents God come in a Man.<a name=221:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gifts of the wise men are suggestive of the divine glory of Christ (the gold), His perfection and fragrance to God as Man (the frankincense) and His sufferings (the myrrh).<a name=221:15></a> The first may also suggest what God is towards man, the second what man was in Christ to God, and the myrrh His sufferings as Man with men.<a name=221:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is instructive also to note the circumstances in which the Lord Jesus is "found" in the gospels.<a name=221:17></a> In Matthew, with His mother in the house, a circle of affection is suggested; in Mark Peter and the others found Him in prayer (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:37">Mark  1:37</a>), indicating levitical exercise; in Luke in the temple (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:46">Luke  2:46</a>) there is what is priestly; in John He is found in connection

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord going down into Egypt may be regarded in different ways.<a name=222:11></a> It suggests the Lord identifying Himself with Israel in their whole course from Egypt to "the land of Israel".<a name=222:12></a> It may suggest also the Lord putting Himself in a place in which we all are, starting from a point where all may be reached.<a name=222:13></a> The reference to Egypt in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#19:24">Isaiah  19:24</a>, 25, suggests God's providential goodness to Egypt for providing shelter for Christ.<a name=222:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The house in verse 1 I suggests the church as the house and the position of the star as over the house suggests the present position in a beautiful way.<a name=222:17></a> Heavenly light directs attention to Christ cherished in the affections of the saints in the house.<a name=222:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=223:1></a> It occurred to me that the light that shone from heaven around Saul enters into everything that he treats of, and above all, the Lord's supper.<a name=223:2></a> There is nothing perhaps that has occasioned more controversy among the people of God than the Lord's supper and yet it is encircled with the greatest light, as if the divine intent was that there should be no doubt or shade of doubt as to its meaning and bearing.<a name=223:3></a> So that, in introducing it in this epistle, the apostle regards the saints as intelligent persons and as such they were to judge what he said.<a name=223:4></a> As we remarked, Matthew and Mark do not speak of the Lord's supper as a memorial; they speak of the woman who anointed the Lord in Simon the leper's house as to be remembered: what she did was to be spoken of as a memorial of her wherever the gospel should be preached.<a name=223:5></a> Luke alone speaks of the memorial of Christ, and he presents the subject evidently as supporting Paul's presentation of it.<a name=223:6></a> An understanding of the memorial of what the woman did would lead to the conditions suitable for a memorial of the Lord's supper.<a name=223:7></a> Perhaps we have not thought much about this memorial of the woman.<a name=223:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.W.<a name=223:9></a> Not in connection with the Supper, I am sure.<a name=223:10></a> Perhaps you would say a little as to how what the woman did prepares us for the memorial of the Lord's supper.<a name=223:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=223:12></a> I was thinking the Lord's supper has become enshrouded with the greatest darkness among the people of God generally.<a name=223:13></a> As we all know, it has become degraded into idolatry in some; the grossest darkness enshrouds the institution in others; and then with others, there are uncertainty and materialism.<a name=223:14></a> So the obvious reason is that what this woman represents

	<div class="paragraph">
		has not been observed.<a name=224:1></a> The Lord enjoined here that what she did should be spoken of as a memorial of her wherever the gospel should be preached.<a name=224:2></a> If what she represents were announced in the ministry of the gospel, the converts would be prepared for the memorial of the Lord's supper; because in Matthew she represents one who regards the Lord Jesus as the only One fit to govern and rule, and in Mark she would look for the levitical service as seen in Christ.<a name=224:3></a> I think if christians generally understood these two features the memorial of the Lord's supper would be seen in its proper setting.<a name=224:4></a> The government of the church of God is in the hands of men who are in many instances perhaps not christians at all, so what can you expect but darkness and uncertainty?<a name=224:5></a> Then the ministry too is carried on by men who are not christians, and how can they comply with what the woman would look for?<a name=224:6></a> So that the government of the church and the ministry are in the hands generally of men who are not really christians, and hence the darkness.<a name=224:7></a> So that evidently the Lord's injunction in regard of her has been overlooked, disregarded.<a name=224:8></a>

		In preaching the gospel at this time I wish to show from these scriptures that it has <i>families</i> in view.<a name=238:1></a> It is, of course, to the individual in each family, to each individual in the world, indeed, but God did not intend men to live otherwise than in families, and so it shall be in the world to come of which we believers speak.<a name=238:2></a> So also that eternal state of things which God has before Him is in entire keeping with His own nature.<a name=238:3></a> He will surround Himself eternally with families.<a name=238:4></a> As the apostle Paul says, "For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a>, 15.<a name=238:5></a> They are all named of the Father; named doubtless according to the measure of their knowledge of God in Christ, but nevertheless all named of the Father, so that He will be surrounded by families eternally blest in Christ.<a name=238:6></a> And so from the outset it became apparent that man was to live family-wise.<a name=238:7></a> It is true that the family from the very beginning became degraded and marred.<a name=238:8></a> You all remember how Eve named her first son and her second son, and how, in taking the initiative in the family, disaster ensued, so that her firstborn became a murderer, and as a murderer, went out from the presence of the Lord.<a name=238:9></a> As time went on the marriage institution became degraded in the posterity of Cain, and with it necessarily the family became degraded and deranged, so that corruption and lawlessness prevailed.<a name=238:10></a>

		I wanted to show how that in introducing the gospel into the Western World, which includes ourselves, the household idea appears.<a name=240:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>, Timothy is taken up by the apostle Paul and is chosen to accompany him; his mother is said to be a "believing woman", a fine tribute to any mother!<a name=240:3></a> No mother can effect anything for God in her family save as she is a believing woman, and the mother of Timothy was called a believing woman.<a name=240:4></a> Faith <i>dwelt</i> in her, and it dwelt in her mother; and the faith that dwelt in her mother and in her dwelt in Timotheus (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:5">2 Timothy  1:5</a>).<a name=240:5></a> So that we have a young man accompanying the great apostle to Europe, the product of a believing household.<a name=240:6></a> He had thus by his side a living witness to the great value of a believing woman as a mother.<a name=240:7></a>

		The jailor was awakened, and instinctively he felt that he needed lights, and he called for them.<a name=241:19></a> The lights were there in Paul and Silas.<a name=241:20></a> The voice of Christ through Paul from the inner prison says, "Do thyself no harm, for we are all here".<a name=241:21></a> It was the voice of compassion.<a name=241:22></a> And now he says, "Sirs".<a name=241:23></a> He speaks respectfully to the servants of Christ, those whom a few moments before he had thrust shamelessly and cruelly into the inner prison.<a name=241:24></a> In whom was the change, in them or in him?<a name=241:25></a> He asked, "What must I do that I may be saved?<a name=241:26></a>", and the answer is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house".<a name=241:27></a> There is a beautiful touch to my mind in the expression 'Lord Jesus'.<a name=241:28></a> He has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=314:1></a> What comes into view in these verses is the result of the work of God in different persons: one of them a rich man who was holding a social status in the world; another of them the teacher of Israel, holding a status also in the world; another a person with a disreputable history; two others, men of low estate, fishermen: all drawn to Christ-whether thought to be dead or alive, the work of God seen thus but as requiring adjustment.<a name=314:2></a> That was what I had in mind that we might consider.<a name=314:3></a> Nicodemus belonged to a class, and so did Joseph, and so did the Magdalene, and so also Peter and John; each had his class viewed here as under the government of God, but the effect of the work of God in us, is to take us out of our several classes and set us together.<a name=314:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=314:7></a> Quite so.<a name=314:8></a> The word 'class' is sometimes used to describe only persons elevated in society, but the word really implies all grades of society in this world.<a name=314:9></a> God works indiscriminately; He is the Maker of them all, and He works as He wills, selecting whom He will.<a name=314:10></a> The Lord says, "The wind bloweth where it listeth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:8">John  3:8</a>); we have to accept that and note the effect of it.<a name=314:11></a> But adjustment is needed; the general result is that each is taken out of his class in spirit and mind and brought into the heavenly circle, the circle of the brethren: "Go to my brethren .<a name=314:12></a>.<a name=314:13></a>.<a name=314:14></a>".<a name=314:15></a> In principle, that would, of course, include all these persons, but they all needed adjustment-every one of them.<a name=314:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=315:1></a> You feel what it must have cost Joseph, to begin with, to identify himself in the presence of Pilate with the rejected Nazarene, for doubtless he was known to Pilate as a distinguished man.<a name=315:2></a> For a rich man to associate himself with a poorer person was a comparatively small thing, but when he identifies himself with a rejected Christ before persons of his own rank, or it may be even those superior in rank to himself, which would make it more difficult still, there is something moving in his soul.<a name=315:3></a> He is like Moses, who recognised the slaves of Egypt, the Israelites, as his brethren.<a name=315:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=315:7></a> Yes, I think he took advantage of his status to do that; no doubt Pilate would recognise he had a right to do that.<a name=315:8></a> But could he have done it aside from the help of God?<a name=315:9></a> It must have cost him much in the way of sacrifice of feelings to do it.<a name=315:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=315:18></a> That shows the nature of the work; this is the result.<a name=315:19></a> We do not see the proper result in Nicodemus; he slips out of view, we find him in chapter 7 but he is still in his class, "being one of them"; he speaks a word for Christ, but that is all.<a name=315:20></a>

		We are reminded, dear brethren, of the importance of being in accord with God, having tastes according to God.<a name=337:9></a> God's hatred of Esau and His love for Jacob was no matter of purpose, no matter of predestination; it was the outcome of what each person was, namely, that Jacob became lovable and was lovable in the eyes of God, and Esau in his history was hateful and God hated him.<a name=337:10></a>

		Well now, you will observe the word 'field' is applied to Jacob here, for Isaac is now speaking by faith.<a name=337:11></a> God saw to it, in His faithfulness, that the parent did not divert the blessing, for the blessing must reach its object, whatever the enemy may do.<a name=337:12></a> Moreover, the blesser must be a parent; in this case it must be Isaac, for in spite of his natural appetite, he represented God, but how sorrowful that a parent, who does indeed represent God in his house, should become opposed in his tastes and attitude to what God loves.<a name=337:13></a> But God compelled Isaac to bless, even as, later, he compelled Balaam to bless.<a name=337:14></a> Not indeed that there is any real comparison between the persons, but in this case Isaac is compelled to bless.<a name=337:15></a> He thought he was blessing Esau, but he was blessing Jacob, Such,

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I wanted to show how all this enters into the idea of a field.<a name=338:4></a> Not a mere field, such I have alluded to in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, where you have the evil seed, or tares, sown.<a name=338:5></a> The point of view in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27">Genesis  27</a>is the fertility of the field.<a name=338:6></a> There is no suggestion of soil for tares in this allusion.<a name=338:7></a> I am speaking now to young believers, particularly, that the character of the field might be understood.<a name=338:8></a> Not only that the Lord has acquired rights over you, and He has, through redemption, but that there should be the smell that is alluded to here-that is, the smell of fertility; that you are such an one as the Lord has blessed.<a name=338:9></a> "A field which the Lord hath blessed".<a name=338:10></a> It is potential here, of course, for as yet there is no crop in Jacob.<a name=338:11></a> But then it is set down for the young believer that he should understand that there is to be this smell, as it were, this evidence of fertility, not merely that you are a nominal christian.<a name=338:12></a> "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27:27">Genesis  27:27</a>.<a name=338:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And notice, it is a parent kissing his son.<a name=338:14></a> Whatever his own feelings are, he is now in the hand of God, and he is speaking as a man of faith.<a name=338:15></a> His smell is now right; his senses are under control; he is able to tell what the smell of fertility is, and he tells us, but it is as he kisses his son.<a name=338:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How God would call upon the young to draw near!<a name=338:17></a> "Come near, now, and kiss me, my son".<a name=338:18></a> Here it is not the nations kissing the Son, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>; it is rather the son kissing the vessel of the blessing, for Isaac represented God.<a name=338:19></a> That indeed, is what the patriarchs set out; they are representative of God.<a name=338:20></a>
	</div>

		comes out through Christ.<a name=339:1></a> What Abraham represented, what Isaac represented, and Jacob, as passing on the blessing, is all now in Christ.<a name=339:2></a> But the point I am making is, "Come near, now, and kiss me, my son".<a name=339:3></a> Were some young man in a theatre or cinema, or using those things that belong to and mark this world, how ashamed he would be if he were called upon to kiss.<a name=339:4></a> It is a challenge as to whether there is the odour of fertility, that is, the guarantee of a crop for God.<a name=339:5></a> That is what I had in mind, beloved, in this remarkable type.<a name=339:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, carrying on with the thought, the fertility is there, but there is the seed to be sown in the field, and the crop is to be according to the sowing.<a name=339:7></a> Fertility in itself will not suffice: there has to be the sowing, and I need not remind you, dear brethren, that the sowing is by Christ too.<a name=339:8></a> The sower is the Son of man, and He sows with a view to a crop.<a name=339:9></a> He knows well what He seeks.<a name=339:10></a> So the believer holds himself for Christ.<a name=339:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you find in the book of Hosea remarkable instructions in regard to sowing.<a name=339:12></a> The first son of the prophet, a symbolical son, is Jizreel, which signifies that God soweth.<a name=339:13></a> But in the meantime, in chapter 1, we have God's mind as to the state of Israel, and it is very different from the idea of a crop such as He sought.<a name=339:14></a> The meaning of Jizreel, 'God soweth', belongs to the gospel.<a name=339:15></a> It is an element of the gospel that whatever your present condition is, God soweth, and He will take you on.<a name=339:16></a> That is His mind.<a name=339:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in the verse I have read, we have, "I will sow her unto me in the land".<a name=339:18></a> Now it is not here a question of sowing the word of God in the person, as in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>.<a name=339:19></a> It is sowing the persons.<a name=339:20></a> It is important to maintain these two thoughts in regard of sowing.<a name=339:21></a> Firstly, what I am as a field, and the sowing in me by the Lord, with a view to the crop He seeks, and secondly, His sowing me personally.<a name=339:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what you get here.<a name=340:1></a> "I will sow her unto me in the land".<a name=340:2></a> Now this is a very important matter, for if God is sowing persons, He has in view a crop of persons.<a name=340:3></a> If he sows you or me to Himself in the land, He has in view a crop like me, like you; and this raises the question as to whether I am an Israel as indicated in this wonderful book of Hosea.<a name=340:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a book that we should read, dear brethren, because it is so full of affection.<a name=340:5></a> It is so full of faithfulness on the one hand, and so full of affection on the other hand, on the part of God.<a name=340:6></a> In one breath you have the severest rebukes, and in the next the tenderest expressions of affection.<a name=340:7></a> In one breath there is the pronouncement of judgment, and in the next breath there is the announcement of the divine purpose of love.<a name=340:8></a> So that the believer, placing himself before God in this way, is checked constantly.<a name=340:9></a> God is, as it were, saying to him constantly, 'There is that in you which I hate; I am a consuming fire in regard of that', and on the other hand, 'There is that in you which I am delighted with, and I wish it not to be impaired'.<a name=340:10></a> That is the book of Hosea; its issue is triumphant.<a name=340:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I speak here of this sowing of Israel to Himself.<a name=340:12></a> "I will sow her unto me", He says, "in the land".<a name=340:13></a> That is, He will have a crop like this.<a name=340:14></a> Israel is to fill the face of the world with fruit.<a name=340:15></a> If I am to be fruitful, as sown personally, another has to be begotten, as it were, through me.<a name=340:16></a> Not that it can be effected literally, but that is the divine thought.<a name=340:17></a> If God sets down a person in this town, He means to have another like him, and another, and another; that is the idea.<a name=340:18></a> You can see the greatness of it, and the importance of being like God, being representatives of God.<a name=340:19></a> The crop is like God; it is after His own thought.<a name=340:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second parable in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, the Son of man sows in His own field, meaning that there is a sphere that He regards as His own.<a name=340:21></a> The whole realm of christendom belongs to the Lord in one sense,

		Certainly at the beginning that was how the matter stood.<a name=341:1></a> He sowed and there was a crop, and where His name is professed, that person is by right acknowledged to be His, and so the myriads of believers increase the field.<a name=341:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the idea of the sowing in the second parable is to produce others like the person sown.<a name=341:3></a> And who is the person sown?<a name=341:4></a> A son of the kingdom.<a name=341:5></a> Now a son of the kingdom is not a child of the kingdom, meaning that the idea of the kingdom has taken hold of the person; he is a product of it; he has developed in it.<a name=341:6></a> God would have that extended and extended; he is a model; that is the idea, and Satan is against that.<a name=341:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As God sets a man or woman here in this town, formed by the kingdom, Satan is against it, and he counters it by imitation; it is worth imitating.<a name=341:8></a> Satan will never imitate what is not worth imitating.<a name=341:9></a> He imitates to nullify what he imitates.<a name=341:10></a> So that while men slept tares were sown; we are told that an enemy did it.<a name=341:11></a> Satan did it.<a name=341:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is the idea of the person, "I will sow her unto me in the land".<a name=341:13></a> God is looking on you in this town, and in many other towns; He says, as it were, 'I have sown you unto Myself; the crop is for Me.<a name=341:14></a> I am looking at you as I looked on My beloved Son when He was here, and I announced My pleasure in Him, and I want you multiplied; I want others like you'.<a name=341:15></a> They are to be like Christ, of course, but you are here under the eyes of men, and God bears testimony to you.<a name=341:16></a> Think of being here for Christ in such a way that God can call attention to you.<a name=341:17></a> He wants to have others like you.<a name=341:18></a> That, in truth, is how multiplication proceeds.<a name=341:19></a> God would have others like us as we are like Christ.<a name=341:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, passing on to the third scripture, I wanted to show how God provides for us under these circumstances.<a name=342:5></a> "Light is sown", we are told, "for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart".<a name=342:6></a> Now this is a remarkable scripture, and fits in with what I have been saying, by way of encouragement, by way of provision.<a name=342:7></a> God looks at you in this town, you are regarded as in the town, in God the Father's heart.<a name=342:8></a> He is pleased with you and He wants to fortify you.<a name=342:9></a> You may be faltering; difficulties may arise.<a name=342:10></a> God says, 'I have sown on your account; whatever your needs may be in the future, you are provided for; I have sown against them.<a name=342:11></a> When they arise the crop will be there'.<a name=342:12></a> How comforting the thought is!<a name=342:13></a> It is another way of God calling upon us to cast all our care upon Him.<a name=342:14></a> He cares for you, and in this wonderful way, He is actually sowing in view of your future needs.<a name=342:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say, 'Where does He sow?<a name=342:16></a>'.<a name=342:17></a> Leave that to Him.<a name=342:18></a> There is nothing about the field here; nothing about the land.<a name=342:19></a> It is God telling you, as sown unto Him yourself, that He is providing for all your future needs.<a name=342:20></a> You cannot but say you are provided for in the present, but what causes you anxiety is the future, and this crop is what you need.<a name=342:21></a>

		You look into next year; there may be no next year in the sense in which we speak, but suppose there will be, the crop will be there to meet it, and what a crop it will be, light!<a name=342:22></a> God says, as it were, 'When the need arises there will be light for you; you will know what to do'.<a name=342:23></a> How comforting that is!<a name=342:24></a> It conforms

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "light of life" conforms with this scripture.<a name=343:2></a> It is a question of sowing and the crop that is in view.<a name=343:3></a> In the future day, as the need arises, you will know what to do; you will not be doubtful; there will be provision; there will be light, and not only light, but joy, as the passage says, "Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart".<a name=343:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Did you ever see a crop of joy coming up out of the ground, or a crop of light?<a name=343:5></a> You say, 'Light comes down from heaven', but Scripture does not always say that.<a name=343:6></a> It speaks of light arising in the darkness (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#112:4">Psalm  112:4</a>) and of light springing up (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:16">Matthew  4:16</a>).<a name=343:7></a> It is a question of light, however it may come.<a name=343:8></a> It may be in the saints in the meeting, that God is sowing in them that there may be joy for you.<a name=343:9></a> Is it not His way, His wonderful resource?<a name=343:10></a> Light will spring up.<a name=343:11></a> What a wonderful time we are living in.<a name=343:12></a> A hundred or more years ago, there was very little in the way of light as life-very little of what the Lord speaks of as the light of life.<a name=343:13></a> There were the Scriptures, and there were christians who had light; christians who had the Spirit.<a name=343:14></a> But I mean christians walking according to divine principles, as set up here by God, as sown of God in His field, that have fight, but it is the light of life.<a name=343:15></a>

		Hence there is the importance of keeping with the brethren.<a name=343:16></a> Light is amongst them.<a name=343:17></a> Normally where brethren are following righteousness, faith, love and peace-where the Spirit has room, there is light, and that is fight as life.<a name=343:18></a> It springs up.<a name=343:19></a> And moreover there is joy too, and that also springs up, for the fruit of the Spirit is joy and you are to participate in that.<a name=343:20></a> All over the world one knows of these things.<a name=343:21></a> A crop of light, a crop of joy, sown of God for you and for me.<a name=343:22></a> What we are enjoying today was sown long since.<a name=343:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the last scripture is in keeping with all this, namely that the believer has responsibility in regard of sowing.<a name=344:3></a> He has a field, whether it be himself, as seen in Jacob, whether it be his household, or whether it be his meeting, to be very simple.<a name=344:4></a> He may regard any of these spheres as his field, and he is enjoined here not to sow diverse seeds.<a name=344:5></a>

		I take up Hebrews first, because it opens with those wondrous words that God has spoken unto us "in .<a name=347:5></a>.<a name=347:6></a>.<a name=347:7></a> Son".<a name=347:8></a> There is no thought of distance there, no thought of a medium of distance; it is God Himself speaking, but speaking "in .<a name=347:9></a>.<a name=347:10></a>.<a name=347:11></a> Son".<a name=347:12></a> It is not exactly in His Son, but "in .<a name=347:13></a>.<a name=347:14></a>.<a name=347:15></a> Son"; that is, God Himself is speaking in that relation, as a divine Person, but not as at Sinai when everything denoted distance, but "in .<a name=347:16></a>.<a name=347:17></a>.<a name=347:18></a> Son".<a name=347:19></a> That is surely a most attractive title, for it carries with it the affections that are proper to the relation, and the communications take character from the affections seen in One in the unclouded relation of the Son with His Father, but He no less than God, for it is God speaking.<a name=347:20></a> His personality is unchangeable, so that the speaking was God's speaking, but in Son; in One who could clothe every thought expressed with the affections proper to the relation in which He stood.<a name=347:21></a> That relation implied, not simply that He was sent, although that is also true, but that it was God Himself; it was God, but God come near.<a name=347:22></a> That is the thought, for the relation was well known among men, and God chose to draw near in it, that there might be nothing to terrorise, nothing to abash, nothing to disconcert, but that all

		You will observe that these scriptures all speak of the divine touch, the touch of Christ.<a name=371:1></a> I might have referred to other gospels for some of these incidents, but it occurred to me that what I have to say would be more applicable and forcible at the moment if I limited my reading to Mark.<a name=371:2></a> Mark has in mind the ministry and qualification for it, which extends not only to afflicted men and women, but to all who should serve, as seen in the mother-in-law of Simon being raised up.<a name=371:3></a> The saints are the means whereby what is of God is now expressed, the Lord Jesus having gone into heaven and being no longer here.<a name=371:4></a> He is in heaven, but His body is here, in which He is to be expressed, and this involves a touch, the laying on of His hands, or whatever other form may be needed, in order to convey something of Himself to men in this poor benighted world.<a name=371:5></a> Mark has in mind that those by whom the Lord comes into contact with the world should bear His own impress, so that those we have to do with may come within the range of Christ, that is, Christ mediatorially.<a name=371:6></a> With this in view we have in the epistles the idea of <i>the Christ</i> applying to the saints.<a name=371:7></a> The confession as to who Christ was by Peter is "Thou art the Christ".<a name=371:8></a> It is a matter of the Lord being representative of God as anointed, that God comes to man through such a One; He is expressed authoritatively and with power.<a name=371:9></a> Thus Mark in speaking of the transfiguration, would signify the kingdom of God come, not in word but in power.<a name=371:10></a> So in 1 Corinthians, the saints are called the 'Christ', "so also is the Christ" meaning the saints anointed (chapter 12: 12).<a name=371:11></a> The anointing extends to the

		hem or skirts of the garments, according to the beautiful and well-known verses in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>.<a name=372:1></a> It alludes to the saints, the anointing flowing down even to that limit, but not beyond it.<a name=372:2></a> It is not a loose end, the word is hem, "the hem of his garments"; which would imply that the saints are regulated, held by a bond, within limitations, so the anointing extends to that limit but not beyond it.<a name=372:3></a> The hem is a finished idea, compacted throughout.<a name=372:4></a> It is like Jerusalem, a city compacted together, no straggling over the country as with some of our cities, without any boundaries.<a name=372:5></a> In the city of God there is definiteness, we know where it ends.<a name=372:6></a> The state of Christendom today belies that, but God has brought us back to limitations and demarcations, to a finished thought: it is a very important matter that each saint should be seen in his place within the range of the anointing, and representative in his measure of God in Christ: "So also is the Christ".<a name=372:7></a> Would that we had sufficient appreciation of what is ours, of what we are brought into in this respect!<a name=372:8></a> "So also is the Christ"; one belongs to that; as having the Spirit of God, one is marked off as of that one body.<a name=372:9></a> We are not straggling abroad, or at any loose end; we are not free-lances as is often claimed, but are held by a bond beyond which we will not go, "sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints".<a name=372:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, Mark having this in mind, brings in these touches which I hope will be intelligible to each of us.<a name=372:11></a> The first touch is that in chapter 1, in regard of the leper, a well-known subject.<a name=372:12></a> I introduce it first, as properly at the beginning of this subject; for although it is not the beginning in the gospel, it is properly at the beginning morally.<a name=372:13></a> A man cannot serve rightly or take on the anointing, apart from being cleansed.<a name=372:14></a> The Lord touched the leper, and he was cleansed.<a name=372:15></a> Now as we have observed in these scriptures, the Lord enjoins secrecy as to these great works of His; He enjoins that they are not to be spoken about by word

		merely.<a name=373:1></a> This applies to the leper; he is to show himself to the priest.<a name=373:2></a> It is not what you can say, but what you are, that a change has come over you.<a name=373:3></a> The Lord enjoins secrecy in such cases.<a name=373:4></a> He means to convey that the thing that is shown is enough, that it is a question of power, and that power is its own testimony.<a name=373:5></a> The person himself is the greatest testimony to the power of cleansing.<a name=373:6></a> I believe the Lord would instruct us at the present time as to power, and that it is to do its own work.<a name=373:7></a> There is to be no suggestion of competition with what is current in christendom.<a name=373:8></a> The Lord never undertook to compete with what was at Jerusalem or in the synagogues around, it would have been beneath Him to do so; the power that was displayed was so overwhelming that there was no need of any other testimony, the power itself was enough.<a name=373:9></a> The Lord would not compete, nor would He have us to compete with what is current; to take pride in what conversions there may be, in what numbers we have in fellowship, or in the numbers attending the meetings, is beneath the testimony; it is a question of power, and of what God has effected in the persons, what they are.<a name=373:10></a> The number of them of course has its own significance, but we may have numbers without any change in persons.<a name=373:11></a> It is the change that is the testimony, the change in the person.<a name=373:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in this case, the Lord says, show yourself, do not speak about it, but show yourself to the priest.<a name=373:13></a> This principle might be enlarged upon as to showing oneself, but I am for the moment calling attention to the Lord's injunction to avoid any appearance of competition with what is current.<a name=373:14></a> For instance, He recognises the priesthood, there was no need to disregard its claims, He admitted them all; though the claims of the hierarchy are as nothing compared with what we have here, in the cleansing of the leper; they sink into oblivion alongside of this; it is the power that is the testimony, the power of God.<a name=373:15></a>

		Well, the first thought here is the cleansing, and I bring it in to apply the idea of being cleansed by the touch of Christ by His work on the cross.<a name=374:1></a> It involves the cross: there could be no cleansing of the leper aside from the cross.<a name=374:2></a> The cross is anticipated when it is a question of sin.<a name=374:3></a> Nothing could be done, and there would be no point in any miracles aside from the cross.<a name=374:4></a> The cross is intended to set aside what is here, and to build up another order of man, and all these miracles have their counterpart today, in the operations of the Spirit in the believer.<a name=374:5></a> We are made whole.<a name=374:6></a> You never get partial healing, for everything that Christ did is complete, that is the idea.<a name=374:7></a> God takes on the thing potentially in us now, although it may take years to complete the work in us.<a name=374:8></a> So with cleansing, if the man is cleansed it is a complete matter.<a name=374:9></a> The Lord would not show a partially cleansed person to the priest, he would very soon pick out the defects.<a name=374:10></a> The Lord would never present half-finished work for testimony.<a name=374:11></a> So the cleansing is complete; you cannot add to it; it can be shown as the finished work in the man.<a name=374:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next thing is whether we can be useful.<a name=374:13></a> The position in Simon's house was peculiarly difficult, for his wife's mother lay sick of a fever.<a name=374:14></a> We have been speaking today of difficulties in service; now this situation is peculiarly difficult to adjust.<a name=374:15></a> You will observe that it is not only Simon's house, in Mark, but "the house of Simon and Andrew".<a name=374:16></a> It belonged to two brothers, and one of them was married; a combination that would be particularly difficult.<a name=374:17></a> Household conditions are often peculiarly difficult, but not too hard for the Lord.<a name=374:18></a> He loves to do what seems to be impossible, and the impossible seems to be at times in households.<a name=374:19></a> Things are so near; the opposing elements, the contrary elements, are with us morning, noon and night in close quarters, and whilst they remain contrary there can be no right representation of God in the house.<a name=374:20></a>

		So the Lord is besought about this matter, they ask Him about her.<a name=375:1></a> Where difficulties exist, Mark would create in us a sympathetic state.<a name=375:2></a> It goes a long way in meeting any household difficulties if the brethren take them on.<a name=375:3></a> Very often they are not known, they are private and secret.<a name=375:4></a> People are secretive about household difficulties, and they rob themselves of the prayers and sympathies of the saints.<a name=375:5></a> It is important therefore to take the brethren into our confidence; christianity is nothing if it is not a system of confidence.<a name=375:6></a> If I cannot tell my brother my private difficulties, I am exposing my want of confidence in him.<a name=375:7></a> Maybe he is not worthy of my confidence-it is often so, but it goes a long way to the meeting of difficulties and healing diseases in households if we have the prayers of the brethren.<a name=375:8></a> God indeed has guaranteed the healing of our diseases, but He has got His own means of doing so.<a name=375:9></a> He has means of operation down here and those may be called into service.<a name=375:10></a> Why not call them into service?<a name=375:11></a> They had no difficulty here in calling the Lord into service.<a name=375:12></a> They told Him about her, and He acceded to their wishes at once, and took her by the hand.<a name=375:13></a> It is as if He were to say to Peter and Andrew, and Peter's wife, This is My matter now.<a name=375:14></a> Nothing is more comforting in the sense of great difficulty than for the Lord to say, 'It is My matter now, you have put it into My hands, and I have taken it on'.<a name=375:15></a> He took her hand and the matter was ended; she had no more fever.<a name=375:16></a> It is a finished thing; there is nothing partial in any of the miracles of Christ, they are always complete in themselves.<a name=375:17></a> She arose and served them; that is to say she is a sister now without partiality.<a name=375:18></a> "She served them", she included the Lord doubtless in her service, but she served <i>them</i>, that is, all the saints in the locality, as we speak.<a name=375:19></a> I suppose Phoebe is a type of this kind of christian.<a name=375:20></a> She was "minister of the assembly .<a name=375:21></a>.<a name=375:22></a>.<a name=375:23></a> in Cenchrea", we are told, a dignified office, but a servant
