		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak about widows as they are viewed in this gospel.<a name=1:1></a> They have a unique place in this gospel, and these four of whom I have read include all the widows spoken of in the sense of being examples, or as representing features of the truth.<a name=1:2></a> The Lord indeed alludes to a widow of whom I have not read, but not to one in current history then, but in past history -- the widow of Sarepta -- and His allusion shows that widowhood in itself need not be representative of what is of God, for He says, "There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias .<a name=1:3></a>.<a name=1:4></a>.<a name=1:5></a> and to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:26">Luke  4:26</a> -- that is outside the limits of Israel.<a name=1:6></a> He says, he was sent "to a woman that was a widow".<a name=1:7></a> She was singled out and honoured of God, but, as I said, she was not in current history and those of whom I have read were in current history.<a name=1:8></a> The Lord so regards them and they represent or include all the widows in current history at the time; such, I mean, as are used to illustrate the truth, and in what I have to say tonight, dear brethren, I am not intending at all to occupy you with past history merely, but with current history.<a name=1:9></a> There are those indeed who carry on what they regard as the service of the Lord and deal in past events and future events, but what the Spirit has to say to the churches at any given time alludes to what is current.<a name=1:10></a> Indeed, one has often remarked, and it is well to observe it, Scripture always speaks to the person who reads it -- it has him in mind -- or to the persons who may hear him read it.<a name=1:11></a> And so it is tonight as I have read these scriptures, they speak to me, and they speak to you, to all of us, so that we might learn something of

		Luke has in mind the women he presents to help us in regard to the assembly, more particularly its public aspect.<a name=2:2></a> John also has in mind to help us as to the assembly, but more as to its spiritual or inward aspect.<a name=2:3></a> Matthew, too, has the assembly in his mind in his gospel, but in its administrative capacity.<a name=2:4></a> Luke would occupy us with seemliness in our public relations, and ornamentation, too.<a name=2:5></a> These four scriptures afford considerable instruction as to the public position of the saints as moving or walking in relation to the assembly, as of it.<a name=2:6></a> What you get, dear brethren, in the first instance, is a very old widow.<a name=2:7></a> The book indeed occupies us at the outset with old persons, but concurrently with young persons and in the public history of the assembly, these two features always appear.<a name=2:8></a> One generation comes and passes away, as we are told, and another comes, but the coming one is concurrent to a point with the one passing away, and the function of the one passing away is, in a great measure, to carry forward substantially and in an exemplary way what existed in the immediate past, so that there is a consecutive history in the assembly -- the passing-away generation furnishing the coming one and so on, and hence the importance of old brothers and sisters maintaining freshness in their outlook and conversation, not occupying us unduly with their earlier days, although it is well to keep the earlier days in mind, and what they learnt from the generation that was passing away as they came in; but then also what they are themselves, for we are not historians, whether oral or in the sense of writing.<a name=2:9></a> A mere historian in Christianity is a bore and answerable to nobody, whereas one who is in the enjoyment of the things he has in his mind and who has added to them, not anything extremist, but what is in keeping with them, is a help; he can

		be listened to.<a name=3:1></a> He passes away in triumph and leaves something in the way of example as well as in the way of instruction and information with the coming generation.<a name=3:2></a> In Luke this is exactly how he presents the truth.<a name=3:3></a> He introduces to us two old people.<a name=3:4></a> No doubt, if one were enquiring as to the brethren in this city one would enquire about the older ones, and it is well to enquire, too.<a name=3:5></a> There are those who stretch back a long way and have had something to do, perhaps, with the recovery of the truth in this city.<a name=3:6></a> So Luke would just present to you that sort of thing.<a name=3:7></a> He introduces to us two old people -- exemplary people, too, outwardly.<a name=3:8></a> You could not find anything to complain of as to their way of doing, their movements and services.<a name=3:9></a> Indeed Zacharias is serving in the order of his priesthood, so that the casual eye would see nothing but what was right.<a name=3:10></a> Elizabeth, too, is highly commended, but we are immediately told that they were accustomed to pray for things which they did not expect to get.<a name=3:11></a> That is a very poor thing in old brothers and sisters, and indeed, so serious is it in the mind of heaven that the brother, the responsible person, Zacharias, is stricken with dumbness for a period.<a name=3:12></a> Elizabeth holds her ground and joins in with the work of God, the fresh work of God that was coming in Mary.<a name=3:13></a> She joins with that most happily.<a name=3:14></a> It is a very beautiful thing to see the older ones joining in with a fresh movement, for God delights in freshness and takes up young people, seemly people, suitable people, prepared people, in order to inaugurate something fresh; and how beautiful it is when the older ones join in that, are thoroughly in it -- and that is what you get in Elizabeth.<a name=3:15></a> She and Mary had a delightful time in the hill country of Judaea.<a name=3:16></a> Zacharias had to wait for nine months or so -- a very poor time he must have had in his dumbness.<a name=3:17></a> He could say nothing.<a name=3:18></a> It was judicial, and we must not assume that although

	<div class="paragraph">
		grace is reigning God is not acting judicially, because He is acting judicially.<a name=4:1></a> And so Zacharias has to suffer, but then he suffered profitably, for as soon as his tongue is loosed he praises God.<a name=4:2></a> They are his best days; he is entirely free from all personal and natural feelings, because instead of speaking of his son, glorifying his son, he glorifies Christ, that is, he has Christ in mind -- the dayspring -- this fresh glorious thought is in his mind.<a name=4:3></a>

		Then in chapter 2 we have two old people, that is, Simeon and Anna.<a name=4:4></a> I am speaking, of course, about widows, and I proceed to speak about Anna.<a name=4:5></a> She is said to be a very old person and that is what I have in mind in referring to her first in the midst of young people, in the midst of a great movement of God, the introduction of Jesus here on earth, a babe in the temple.<a name=4:6></a> Well, she is of great age, we are told, but she is thoroughly in the thing.<a name=4:7></a> It would perhaps be questionable in some of your minds to say she was a very, very old person, but actually she must have been more than one hundred, for I take it that she was actually in widowhood for eighty-four years.<a name=4:8></a> But how honourably and how beautifully she is mentioned in her earlier days.<a name=4:9></a> She lived with her husband for seven years.<a name=4:10></a> There is not a flaw, beloved friends, as far as the Spirit of God is concerned, in this person.<a name=4:11></a> She is of great age, knowing widowhood as perhaps no one in her times knew it, but she is completely above her circumstances.<a name=4:12></a> She is energetic.<a name=4:13></a> I need not enlarge on her because she is known so well amongst us, thank God.<a name=4:14></a> I am speaking of her now for one purpose.<a name=4:15></a> I am speaking to the older ones to begin with here.<a name=4:16></a> How she carried down -- how far back she must have gone.<a name=4:17></a> I believe the intent is to the spiritual mind that she carried down conditions depicted in Malachi to conditions in this great intervention of God, that is, the old dispensation in all that it was, spiritually, is embodied

		in this wonderful widow, showing that there was no hiatus, as it were, in the testimony of God.<a name=5:1></a> It was carried down in quality from the one dispensation to the other.<a name=5:2></a> Correspondingly in any communication of God in any city or country in the world, any fresh energy of the Spirit, there is no thought whatever of disregarding what preceded it.<a name=5:3></a> Whatever is of God is to be accumulated and carried down, not only by historic means, but in a substantial way by those who might otherwise be overwhelmed with their circumstances, that is Anna.<a name=5:4></a> She is in the temple night and day, as we are told, and she came in at that instant when Simeon was speaking so beautifully, so prophetically, of Jesus.<a name=5:5></a> She came in at that instant.<a name=5:6></a> She came in at the right moment.<a name=5:7></a> Here are two people who are thoroughly at one in regard of Christ, in regard of this new great intervention of God.<a name=5:8></a> They are thoroughly at one and she in a way exceeding Simeon in activities and in priestly feelings.<a name=5:9></a> She spoke of Jesus.<a name=5:10></a> She spoke of the Lord to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem; that is to say, with her there would be no question of occupying the disinterested ones.<a name=5:11></a> It is a question of the interested ones.<a name=5:12></a> There are interested ones today.<a name=5:13></a> It is delightful in moving about the world to see the interested ones, the interest in their faces and feelings, in their demeanour, in their attitude towards the truth.<a name=5:14></a> She is engaged with interested ones, and she is engaged with them energetically, night and day in the temple, maintaining relations with God in His temple.<a name=5:15></a> She spoke to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem, and that is all I had to say about her.<a name=5:16></a>

		Now I pass on to the second scripture -- a very different picture, still a widow; and Luke records the Lord Jesus as having to say to her, not she to Him, as in Anna's case.<a name=5:17></a> The Lord is still a babe in Anna's day, but now He is in active service and He is having

		What I have in mind dear brethren is to speak about 'newness' as it appears in these three scriptures: newness of life, newness of spirit, and newness of mind by the renewing of our mind.<a name=46:1></a> The thought appearing in this threefold way in this epistle shows that it is a fundamental one, and correspondingly involves what is different in a religious sense from anything that has preceded it.<a name=46:2></a> The prevalence of the word 'new' in the book of Revelation shows unmistakably that it is to mark the assembly at the end of the dispensation.<a name=46:3></a> We have it written in the term "new Jerusalem" to the overcomer in the assembly at Philadelphia, as if to remind us that the overcomer would know that the word 'new' fits at the end as it did at the beginning.<a name=46:4></a>

		Religion has become prevalent not in the heathen or Jewish sense but in the Christian sense, using common phraseology.<a name=46:5></a> When Romans was written religion was either Pagan or Jewish.<a name=46:6></a> Now we have the Pagan continuing, and the Jewish only in a little way.<a name=46:7></a> We have Mahometanism and we have about a quarter of the world's population nominally Christian, so that the idea of religion is extensive and varied, Christendom being subdivided as we know, alas, into many sects.<a name=46:8></a> But whilst there are many and whilst there is variety, yet there is nothing in the accepted Christianity of the day that is properly new, nothing new in the sense in which this verse speaks of newness.<a name=46:9></a> I should say a fourth of the world's population has become Christianised.<a name=46:10></a> The Lord had directed the apostles to make disciples of all the nations, and what has happened is Christianisation of them which really means no change of heart in the

		Christianity really is new, meaning that there was nothing like it before.<a name=47:7></a> There was nothing current like it before, neither when it was inaugurated, nor shall there be anything like it.<a name=47:8></a> And whilst public history shows that it returned to the ordinary, it took on the ordinary religious garb, the Lord has not lost sight of newness, and has wrought in our times to bring it to light.<a name=47:9></a> I mean newness in the sense in which it is spoken of in these verses.<a name=47:10></a>

		The first is newness of life which includes in its application, being elementary, every young Christian here as well as every old Christian.<a name=47:11></a> That is what the scripture requires of every believer baptised according to this chapter; and what is in view is not only life but newness of life.<a name=47:12></a> God had the thought of life in mind in coming in to order things as we have in the creation.<a name=47:13></a> He reached the thought on the third day.<a name=47:14></a> But the idea was not newness.<a name=47:15></a> It was simply the question of vegetable life, but there is remarkable correspondence in the passages in the record of the third day in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, that is the third day brought out the emerging of the dry ground from the envelopment of waters that had hitherto covered the earth.<a name=47:16></a> There is remarkable correspondence, for the believer in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>has come out similarly.<a name=47:17></a> He has been under the waters of baptism and it is not only that there is baptism to Christ but

		J.T.<a name=83:1></a> The proposal is in view of bringing out the position in the book of Revelation as to the general history of the assembly.<a name=83:2></a> The passage in Matthew is suggested because it will enable us to see how the assembly began to function, as one might say, officially, and Revelation shows how it broke down; at least it records the fact.<a name=83:3></a> It is thought it will help us all to see how the breakdown took place, and hence the necessity for this book -- what is called the Apocalypse.<a name=83:4></a> It is clearly distinct from ordinary assembly epistles and the gospels.<a name=83:5></a> It contemplates the breakdown of what the gospels and epistles present as inaugurated by the Lord Himself and by the Spirit.<a name=83:6></a> So that we have the Revelation given to the Lord Himself: "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a>.<a name=83:7></a>

		A dispensational idea comes in, for the third time alludes to the millennium, or what immediately precedes it; what is intended to make it up, that is to say, not only the Jews but the nations.<a name=108:10></a> The Jews will lead, have the first place, but the nations come in, too, for indeed, primarily the Jewish nation was intended to be in the very centre of the earth, of the circle of the nations.<a name=108:11></a> They are essential, therefore, to the divine scheme on the earth, and these one hundred and fifty-three great fishes are symbolical of the nations.<a name=108:12></a> They are viewed as great at the end.<a name=108:13></a> The Israelites, that is, the Jews as we speak of them now, come into chapter 20.<a name=108:14></a> That is, they are seen where Thomas appears, having been absent at the first great meeting of the disciples with the Lord after He rose.<a name=108:15></a> The first meeting is on the first day of the week.<a name=108:16></a> It has a great place in that chapter, and it is signalised

		J.T.<a name=169:1></a> These passages teach us of assembly administration, and the first is particularly in mind as to teaching.<a name=169:2></a> As we know, the word 'assembly' is not used in the passage, but it is in it; it is contemplated, and the thought is that we might look at the teaching that leads up to the instruction in this chapter, at least in this passage.<a name=169:3></a> The word 'Rabboni' is the one Mary uses in replying to the Lord.<a name=169:4></a> He says to her, "Mary", in verse 16.<a name=169:5></a> It is thought that she represents the receptive element.<a name=169:6></a> The gospel really begins with the same thought.<a name=169:7></a> The two disciples who followed Jesus said to him, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?<a name=169:8></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:38">John  1:38</a>.<a name=169:9></a> And it is thought that the teaching of the assembly, the instruction as to it is of prime importance at all times, but especially now, and John has this in mind.<a name=169:10></a> Not so much to occupy us with official terms but to accustom us to the circumstances of the assembly and the feminine side entering into it; the instruction coming in that connection through a feminine channel.<a name=169:11></a> The idea would be among other things that we should be softened in dealing with one another and get adjusted.<a name=169:12></a> For she needed adjustment, as did all the disciples at this time, but she represents ardent affection for Christ with certain dark thoughts, unintelligent thoughts, but she became adjusted.<a name=169:13></a> John undoubtedly is intended for this, for adjustment.<a name=169:14></a> So that she is addressed by her name, of course, which is Mary, but having a meaning somewhat involving suffering, leading to a feeling person.<a name=169:15></a> He called her Mary, which is to be noted, undoubtedly meaning that He had intended that her name should be there in this

		J.T.<a name=207:21></a> That is right.<a name=207:22></a> It is the report that they brought down, because it was a true one.<a name=207:23></a> All of them fell in with that, with the report that the spies brought down.<a name=207:24></a> They are all in it, and now the fault is that some fail in not hearkening to the report.<a name=207:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=207:28></a> Yes; it is a question of what is ministered; what God is saying; we get help in referring to the historical reference in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#13">Numbers  13</a>.<a name=207:29></a> The twelve spies had been sent up by Moses and they brought down a true report, but presently someone came in and added something that seemed to deny or set aside the general report.<a name=207:30></a>

		J.T.<a name=208:4></a> They were really witnesses of the land.<a name=208:5></a> They were witnesses of what they reported.<a name=208:6></a> It was not a matter of mere hearing, something they heard.<a name=208:7></a> They saw; they brought down the grapes.<a name=208:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=208:11></a> The primary commission, for it was a commission of twelve men, was sent out by Moses and authority was attached to it.<a name=208:12></a> "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed of it.<a name=208:13></a> For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard".<a name=208:14></a> It was mixed with faith in some but not generally.<a name=208:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=208:18></a> It really amounted to the authority of God, because that is what is in mind: the apostle and high priest of our profession who is Christ, and chapter 3 shows that the Speaker is God.<a name=208:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=208:20></a>T.<a name=208:21></a> Does that mean it is not only what is said but who says it?<a name=208:22></a>

		J.A.<a name=209:1></a>P.<a name=209:2></a> Is it interesting that there were two versions, but the Spirit of God calls the one that Caleb and Joshua gave "the report"?<a name=209:3></a> Would you say something about that?<a name=209:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=209:5></a> That is a good point, too.<a name=209:6></a> The report is, it says, well-accredited, accredited by witnesses who saw the things that they reported.<a name=209:7></a> Therefore, the whole matter turns on the authority behind Christianity, for Christianity is in mind, but Christianity over against Judaism.<a name=209:8></a> Through Judaism was the attack.<a name=209:9></a> The word came through the report, but there were those who denied it, or if they did not deny it they did not mix it with faith.<a name=209:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.E.<a name=209:11></a>H.<a name=209:12></a> Would the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews be a prince in that sense?<a name=209:13></a> Every one of the twelve that went up was a prince.<a name=209:14></a> I was wondering if the writer of the Hebrews would be like a prince in character.<a name=209:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=209:16></a> Just so.<a name=209:17></a> The characteristic one would be Joshua whose name was changed to a name that indicated 'Jehovah, the Saviour'.<a name=209:18></a> That is, it is really our Saviour we are dealing with; the One who is speaking is our Saviour.<a name=209:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=209:23></a> Yes; it is to bring out the humanity of the Lord, and that His deity is not altered by it.<a name=209:24></a> The addition of His humanity does not alter His deity, because the beginning of chapter 3 says, "For <i>he</i> has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house.<a name=209:25></a> For every house is built by someone; but he who has built all things is God.<a name=209:26></a> And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after; but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are we, if indeed we hold fast", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:3">Hebrews  3:3</a> - 6.<a name=209:27></a> So that the point is that the Speaker is God and the Builder is

		God.<a name=210:1></a> All that is to bring out what the Israelites were doing in refusing to hearken to the word, in failing to hearken.<a name=210:2></a> They were failing to enter into the rest of God, for that is what was involved.<a name=210:3></a> The rest was to be entered into, not on the ground of promise only but of hearkening to the word.<a name=210:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=210:8></a> I would think that.<a name=210:9></a> It is a question of who the speaker is, and there can be no question, therefore, of what he says.<a name=210:10></a> What they are up against is what has been said and who says it, not simply the spies but the apostle here.<a name=210:11></a> The beginning of the section is on the apostleship of Christ, and therefore it is that the One who says it is pointed out as having built all things, and of course God did that.<a name=210:12></a> God did that and, therefore, God is the Speaker, hence, the serious responsibility of not hearkening.<a name=210:13></a> It is not simply refusing it but not hearkening.<a name=210:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=210:15></a>P.<a name=210:16></a> The indication of lack of faith in those who heard the Lord in Nazareth is that they began to use human reasoning.<a name=210:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=210:18></a> Quite so.<a name=210:19></a> We can well discern, in looking back on the history, what was involved in the way that Christianity was spurned in the early days and hence the entire rejection of the Jewish system, because that is what really happened after this epistle.<a name=210:20></a> The epistle implied the word and the One who spoke it; hence, there is no forgiveness in Hebrews.<a name=210:21></a> Sin is wilful.<a name=210:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=210:23></a>M.<a name=210:24></a> It seems to be a very large matter, because in verse 4 it says in connection with God's rest on the seventh day, "from all his works".<a name=210:25></a> Faith seems to connect all that immense matter in the beginning that you alluded to in your prayer with these matters that we are speaking of now.<a name=210:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=211:1></a> The linking up of that with the book of Exodus is significant, because it is a question of Moses, and the Lord makes the issue between the Jews and himself, and between them and Moses, identical.<a name=211:2></a> The Lord says, "But if ye do not believe <i>his</i> writings, how shall ye believe my words?<a name=211:3></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:47">John  5:47</a>.<a name=211:4></a> That is, He links up His own authority, God's authority, with Moses, because it is a question of not only what is spoken but what is written.<a name=211:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=211:9></a> It is a manifest fact here that "we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also".<a name=211:10></a> Notice, it is not simply information or history but glad tidings, as if God were to couch His thoughts in that way, make them attractive, fitting in with the evangelical feature of the inauguration of Christianity.<a name=211:11></a> It was a question of glad tidings.<a name=211:12></a> This section is not simply the glad tidings of our salvation.<a name=211:13></a> That is mentioned earlier in the epistle, but the glad tidings about heaven, by those who witnessed the thing.<a name=211:14></a>

		C.N.<a name=212:2></a> Could the assembly in any way be regarded as God's rest?<a name=212:3></a> I was thinking of the revelation to Peter, and the Lord saying on that account, "On this rock I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>.<a name=212:4></a> I just wondered if, in thinking of God's rest, the assembly could be looked at in a typical way.<a name=212:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=212:6></a> The assembly is constituted in that way, as affording provisional shelter and conditions for the thoughts of God.<a name=212:7></a> What are hidden in the form of promise or purpose are now made provisional by the Spirit come down from heaven.<a name=212:8></a> The things are made provisionally available in the reality of them by the Spirit, for He is the earnest of the inheritance.<a name=212:9></a> The things are made substantially available in an order of things which we call the assembly.<a name=212:10></a> It is such, it is so constituted as to make available the promises and purposes of God in a tangible way to us.<a name=212:11></a> I think that is the way it works out -- the tangibility of the things that have been in promise or in purpose are now available to us in this institution called the assembly, because of what is said of it when the revelation was made to Peter, how intact it would be in carrying down these things in a provisional way until the time of the things being completed when the Lord comes.<a name=212:12></a>

		that divine things should ever be common or ordinary; they are not ordinary, they are extraordinary, and this extraordinary feature is intended to be enforced at times, not always but at times, by authority.<a name=229:1></a> Luke is selected for two great works.<a name=229:2></a> The first is his gospel, as we call it, this one that we have read from, and the second one is the book of Acts.<a name=229:3></a> He is the author of both.<a name=229:4></a> It is formally said by him that Acts is the second treatise; there is the first and the second one.<a name=229:5></a> The first one he said he had written to Theophilus.<a name=229:6></a> He had written that one so as to set out the order of the truth of the gospel as it came out in those that were not only with the Lord, but in those that were His companions or fellow-workers in the service.<a name=229:7></a> It pleased the Lord to associate certain ones with Him and Luke is among them.<a name=229:8></a> He wrote with method, which is important for us as students, but authority is more than that; it is more than method; authority is enforcement of the thing with power, and it is often very necessary.<a name=229:9></a>

		and much error, and I may add, alas, much blasphemy as attached to the Lord's supper; I mean attached to it by evil teaching, an evil system of teaching.<a name=230:1></a> One of them modernly is that the supper may be kept in a cupboard or in a box or in a desk so as to be handed around at will, carried to people's beds of sickness, which is a very dishonouring thing.<a name=230:2></a> I am just mentioning that on the way, and what is needed in regard of it is authority.<a name=230:3></a> There is no authority for anything like that.<a name=230:4></a> What is meant in that is that the saints would stay at home and expect the Lord's supper to be brought to them, which was never intended.<a name=230:5></a> It was never intended to be anywhere else than in the assembly.<a name=230:6></a> It belongs to the assembly, and if we stay away from the assembly we can never get it, and that shows how serious it is to stay away from it, to neglect the assembling of ourselves together.<a name=230:7></a>

		Now I wish to speak of these verses having the word 'way' in mind and love as entering into it.<a name=244:3></a> You will all know that the word 'way' is used to indicate Christianity.<a name=244:4></a> It is said to be '<i>the</i> way' which would mean really that there is no other, no other of value.<a name=244:5></a> And then, too, it is called the way of God, which would mean that it is of a moral character as exhibiting the divine way; the way God is in as in revelation, the way He takes, what marks Him.<a name=244:6></a> This is of extreme importance, I need not say, and it is found, and we have already dealt with it today -- the way of God.<a name=244:7></a> Then there is the way of the Lord, which we have already noted, involving not simply a way but a military way, and we are enjoined to be in that, too; to know how to be good soldiers of Jesus Christ, and properly armed and equipped with suitable weapons, or at least a weapon, which is the sword of the Spirit.<a name=244:8></a> The sword of the Spirit is not simply a defensive sword; it is an aggressive one and, therefore, the word 'Lord' is rightly connected with it: the way of the Lord.<a name=244:9></a> And then we have also 'the way' which, as I have said, indicates that

		Well now, these are all important suggestions and definitions and they lead us to what I have read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, namely, the more excellent way.<a name=245:3></a> The apostle says, "But desire earnestly the greater gifts", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:31">1 Corinthians  12:31</a>.<a name=245:4></a> That is, as having and rightly having desires to serve, we are entitled to desire gifts.<a name=245:5></a> Some have them.<a name=245:6></a> There is a very fair distribution, one may say by observation, of gifts among the brethren, and it is quite right and legal spiritually to desire them if we have not got them; not to make play toys out of them as, alas, the Corinthians were doing, but to use them with dignity.<a name=245:7></a> They are not greater than the persons who have them although they come from above.<a name=245:8></a> It is said that the Lord Jesus ascended and passed beyond all the heavens.<a name=245:9></a> Think of that elevation!<a name=245:10></a> And He has received gifts there.<a name=245:11></a> He has received them up there, received gifts, as the original of the old text would say, gifts in man, for men in man.<a name=245:12></a> The One who has received them is a Man Himself, and exercised them all and maintained them all; but He received them and has distributed them to men here below so as to use them.<a name=245:13></a> They are to be used, moderately and effectively, of course, but they are to be used in love.<a name=245:14></a> And the apostle in saying that proceeded to something: "yet".<a name=245:15></a> The word 'yet' would be somewhat suggestive that he wanted to say something else, and that there was something better, something to be coveted more, and it is to be shown and demonstrated how important it is.<a name=245:16></a> Hence he says, "a way of more surpassing excellence".<a name=245:17></a> Now that is what I would rest on for a moment.<a name=245:18></a> It is shown.<a name=245:19></a> The apostle is not saying he is giving it to the brethren.<a name=245:20></a> It is shown.<a name=245:21></a> He is showing it to the brethren, and it is for them to aspire to it if their

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, that way is enlarged on.<a name=246:7></a> It is as if the apostle, having touched it, proceeds in chapter 13 to define it.<a name=246:8></a> Someone has called it the picture on the wall in this book, and we are not just content with pictures on the wall.<a name=246:9></a> We want the things that are spoken of, not pictures on the wall but pictured in Christians, pictured in those who value what is excellent.<a name=246:10></a> No picture on the wall is excellent; it is the person that is depicted that is excellent.<a name=246:11></a> The way can only be in the person who is depicted, and that is the next chapter.<a name=246:12></a> The apostle brings in the abstract in a very full way and he speaks of love, which is the thing he is talking about in chapter 12:31, "a way of more surpassing excellence".<a name=246:13></a> In having come to this point I am reminded of Philippians.<a name=246:14></a> That is my next epistle, the only one I have read from besides the epistle to the Corinthians, but the epistle to the Philippians suggests other epistles, that is, others like itself; and I would name Hebrews.<a name=246:15></a> You get the idea of excellence there.<a name=246:16></a> It is a delivering epistle.<a name=246:17></a> If I may be simple, it is a 'get-out' epistle.<a name=246:18></a> If you are in anything unworthy of you, Christian brother or sister, if you are in anything unworthy of you, whatever it may be, whether it be social or business or educational -- if it is unworthy of you the thing is to get out of it; and the epistle to the Hebrews is a 'get-out-of' epistle.<a name=246:19></a> A great many Christians

		Well, I was saying that I was connecting Philippians with Hebrews, because Hebrews is so full just in that sense, full of contrast; some words denoting excellency brought by contrast over against what would defile them, so as to unsettle the persons who have read or who read the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=247:13></a> Then I was thinking of Peter.<a name=247:14></a> He is a great person, a great writer, a great servant called an apostle for better things, for greater things.<a name=247:15></a> One of the most striking words he uses is the word 'precious'.<a name=247:16></a> He speaks of the precious blood of Christ, <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:19">1 Peter  1:19</a> -- and other things that are precious.<a name=247:17></a> And when he comes to his

		He will make Him supreme, and hence it is, as I said, that the glory of the Son of God and Paul were bound up together in the last epistle of Peter before he put off his tabernacle.<a name=250:1></a> Therefore, I venture to link up these epistles, that is, the epistle to the Philippians besides the epistle to Corinth -- not that it is characteristically linked up.<a name=250:2></a> The epistle to the Corinthians is a low-down epistle, so to speak, although having the highest truth, but, as I said, like pictures on the wall, because they were so low-down in their souls.<a name=250:3></a> They had not advanced, and the apostle is afraid of them.<a name=250:4></a> After a short time, on his leaving them, he has to write this epistle to them in order to save them and he uses the strongest language but yet the most gracious language; but it was to save them.<a name=250:5></a> It was in love.<a name=250:6></a> And now he is saying, I want to show you; he is not saying, I am going to write you about the more excellent way.<a name=250:7></a> I am going to show it to you and no one on earth could do it as well as Paul.<a name=250:8></a> If anyone wished to see it, they only needed to go about with him, and if anyone talked to him about the Corinthians, he would say, They are wonderful.<a name=250:9></a> That is what he would say; known and read of all men.<a name=250:10></a> The Corinthians acquired a reputation that no others had, because Paul spoke of them everywhere he went.<a name=250:11></a> He extolled them.<a name=250:12></a> Let us learn, dear brethren, to extol the saints; let us learn to love them.<a name=250:13></a> Think of raising questions of years back to discredit the saints.<a name=250:14></a> It is not our business to do that.<a name=250:15></a> Our business is to exalt the brethren, and they are to be exalted.<a name=250:16></a> They <i>are</i> exalted.<a name=250:17></a> They are the greatest of all the families of God.<a name=250:18></a> They have the heavenly calling; that is what Philippians tells us: "the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:14">Philippians  3:14</a>.<a name=250:19></a> And that is why I have spoken at length as I have on this remarkable epistle of Paul to the Philippians.<a name=250:20></a> And then I have spoken of Peter's epistles, particularly the last one.<a name=250:21></a> I have spoken of the Hebrew epistle,

		And now I want to go on to Philippians just to enlarge on what I have said, because it is a matter of prayer.<a name=253:4></a> Paul prays in verse 9, "And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day, being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which is by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:9">Philippians  1:9</a> - 11.<a name=253:5></a> That is a prayer.<a name=253:6></a> Now notice, dear brethren, it is love he is talking about and love is to increase in all these characteristics; and he is praying about this.<a name=253:7></a> I have already pointed out he is not able to do that in the letter to Corinth.<a name=253:8></a> It was simply a picture on the wall although he said he would show it and did show it, but he could not pray about it like that at Corinth, the conditions did not warrant it.<a name=253:9></a> He had to take a rod, or at least the spirit of the rod in writing to them to correct them.<a name=253:10></a> But he did not have to do that in writing the epistle to the Philippians.<a name=253:11></a> And so as I said, it is love he is praying about in a certain sense.<a name=253:12></a> "And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day, being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which is by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise".<a name=253:13></a> Now in order to help further I will read the note on these verses.<a name=253:14></a> It is at the bottom of the page under the letter <i>h</i>.<a name=253:15></a> 'It is a question how far the abounding applies to the love itself; or,

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=282:1></a> The word in mind is: "Laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of what is really life", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:19">1 Timothy  6:19</a>.<a name=282:2></a> We are apt to be diverted now by what is in mind in the present situation, the establishment of 'peace' so-called, and as usual after conflict in the world, there is an era of physical prosperity and money-making, so it occurred to me that these scriptures would help to save us from any such inclinations.<a name=282:3></a> And Luke, beginning with chapters 15 and 16, contemplates the importance of money, and the parables involved show the folly of trusting to it or making much of it.<a name=282:4></a> The prodigal, as we know, thought of what came to him -- the portion of goods that fell to him from his father and his father's estate.<a name=282:5></a> Chapter 16 contemplates this incident of which we have read, and the following one, too -- the rich man and Lazarus, the former representing richness; and the latter, poverty.<a name=282:6></a> Here is opened, indeed, the door into the unseen world for us so that we might see how the two principles work out in the coming day.<a name=282:7></a> It seems as if we might be helped in looking at this section of Luke and seeing how material things may be turned into good account so that we might lay up a foundation for the future with them; hence the lord of the steward speaks of him as worthy of praise because he did prudently, for the Lord says, "For the sons of this world are, for their own generation, more prudent than the sons of light.<a name=282:8></a> And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles", and then He introduces a thought, saying, "He that is faithful in the least is

		faithful also in much", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16:10">Luke  16:10</a>, meaning that the "least" would be material things, and he that is faithful in the least will be faithful when God gives him spiritual wealth to distribute.<a name=283:1></a> And then He says, further, "And he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much.<a name=283:2></a> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who shall entrust to you the true?<a name=283:3></a> and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who shall give to you your own?<a name=283:4></a>" meaning what is our own that is spiritual, and that what we have of this world's goods does not really belong to us.<a name=283:5></a> So that if we are not faithful in the world, we are apt to be short of the spiritual, if not devoid of it altogether.<a name=283:6></a> I thought we might be helped in looking at these practical things at this time and linking them on with 1 Timothy in which we have much of that kind of instruction.<a name=283:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:9></a> Well, that is the point.<a name=284:10></a> The Lord when here connects prudence with the sons of this generation, and contrasts that with the prudence of the sons of light.<a name=284:11></a> He says, "For the sons of this world" -- notice, it is not 'children' of this world, but "sons", those that are grown up and mature -- "are, for their own generation, more prudent than the sons of light", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16:8">Luke  16:8</a>, whereas in John's gospel He says, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:36">John  12:36</a>, that is, he would meet the discrepancy in the sons of light here by believing, increasing our faith in light that we may become sons of it.<a name=284:12></a>

		I am thinking in reading these scriptures of the objective side of the truth.<a name=307:1></a> We often speak somewhat disparagingly of it, but chiefly because we have been neglecting what is called the subjective side of the truth.<a name=307:2></a> By observation I have come to see that objectivity is a word that expresses what covers much of the holy page, the holy teaching.<a name=307:3></a> It is said of the saints that they shall be all taught of God.<a name=307:4></a> That, of course, alludes to men, for it is hardly within our reach to speak of angels being the objects of teaching, although doubtless they are, but men are in mind.<a name=307:5></a> In all the realm of creation men are supreme in importance outside of divine Persons, of course.<a name=307:6></a> Angels, too, have a great place, but men are supreme.<a name=307:7></a> So that the Lord became Man, for He could hardly honour us more than becoming one of us; and when I say 'us' I do not forget the distinction that belongs to Him; but, nevertheless, He has become one of us.<a name=307:8></a> Hence, the human race has a dignity that no others have.<a name=307:9></a> When I say the human race I am not forgetting that many in it are reprobate and never will be saved, alas; but it is to stand.<a name=307:10></a> It is to remain.<a name=307:11></a> The Son having become one of us gives it a status and a standing and longevity that exceeds all others.<a name=307:12></a> We are eternal.<a name=307:13></a> In saying that I remind the brethren of the fact that life is in Him; it is said of Jesus, the Son, that in Him was life.<a name=307:14></a> Of course, in God is life, too; in the Spirit is life; the same could be said of each and all divine Persons; but of the Son it is said that in Him was life; that is, viewed as Man; and the life was the light of men.<a name=307:15></a> That is to say, the idea of it is made exclusive, that is, in a relative sense.<a name=307:16></a> Others, of course, have life; the angels live;

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we may say, Why see afar off?<a name=308:5></a> People are constantly looking up at the heavens, but the wonder is whether they really see; whether it is not more or less accidental that they do; whether they look at the heavens as if they were an object, an object to be studied and learned from is the question.<a name=308:6></a> So that men are so honoured and so blessed and so constituted, for it is said of us that we have the mind of Christ.<a name=308:7></a> I do not suppose that could be said of even the archangels, any of them or all of them if there are more than one.<a name=308:8></a> Men are the objects.<a name=308:9></a> "In him was life, and the life was the light of men", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>.<a name=308:10></a>

		I want to show now, as I said, how this matter of objectiveness enters into this great matter, and that we should become, if we have not now become, able to see things afar off.<a name=308:11></a> If we do not, there is a moral reason; is it that we are blind in any sense, or short-sighted.<a name=308:12></a> The point is we have forgotten that we are purged from our former sins.<a name=308:13></a> It is a moral matter.<a name=308:14></a> Whilst we remember much financially and the like, politically, historically, the moral side is largely overlooked; and, hence, the forgetting of our former sins; perhaps not the immediate ones, but the former ones.<a name=308:15></a> We forget this.<a name=308:16></a> There are many abroad in the profession of Christianity in which people used to be forgiven, used to be and knew they were but now they have forgotten.<a name=308:17></a> They have forgotten that they were purged from their former sins, and, hence, they cannot see afar off; because the matter of our former sins extends away back as to space and time.<a name=308:18></a> Centuries have elapsed since our sins, our former sins were dealt with, dealt with by God.<a name=308:19></a> But people

		Well now, as I said, I am speaking of objectivity, and the importance of it with God, and in a practical sense, and with the thought that no one should forget his former sins.<a name=310:9></a> And so here, what I am really thinking of in reading these few verses is, "looking stedfastly on Jesus".<a name=310:10></a> I always feel that I have to turn to the New Translation on certain points so as to clarify what may be there.<a name=310:11></a> Now, the word 'stedfastly' is rendered, 'It means, looking away from other things and fixing the eye exclusively on one'.<a name=310:12></a> Now, the authorised version, as you can see, hardly treats these words fairly.<a name=310:13></a> It says, "looking unto Jesus".<a name=310:14></a> It is not looking unto Him; it is looking on Him.<a name=310:15></a> It is not a question here of looking to Him for guidance, but looking on Him.<a name=310:16></a> God looks on Him.<a name=310:17></a> "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son", He said, when He was here on earth.<a name=310:18></a> He looked down on

	<div class="paragraph">
		Him, and He looked up to God, too.<a name=311:1></a> But He looked down on His beloved Son as He was here on earth, and said, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:5">Matthew  17:5</a>.<a name=311:2></a> He was looking on Him, and that is the sense in which I would hope that the dear brethren will follow what I am seeking to say: "looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.<a name=311:3></a> For consider well .<a name=311:4></a>.<a name=311:5></a>.<a name=311:6></a>" I want to read the translation of that word 'well' there, too.<a name=311:7></a> It says, '"weigh so as to judge its value", and sometimes in comparison with other things'.<a name=311:8></a> So that you see what our minds are to take in now is looking well: "For consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself".<a name=311:9></a> And what for?<a name=311:10></a> "That ye be not weary, fainting in your minds".<a name=311:11></a>

		Now, I hope the dear brethren, not that I wish to say much as to what I am able to say, but I hope the dear brethren will just be aroused as to these words, because we have come to a time of great anxiety.<a name=311:12></a> Of course, we have been in this time for five and one-half years, but it is peculiar now, because there are other ways to look.<a name=311:13></a> We do not have to look to the immediate east any more, to Europe.<a name=311:14></a> We look in the other direction, of course, but our minds are divided; men's minds are divided and rightly.<a name=311:15></a> But when you come to Christians, how is the division going to take place?<a name=311:16></a> We are creatures, of course, and not capable of very much, but what is bound to influence the world and nations and men in it is bound to influence us, too.<a name=311:17></a> But how?<a name=311:18></a> They have not any such words as these mentioned in these settings.<a name=311:19></a> They have not got them.<a name=311:20></a> We have them.<a name=311:21></a> We have these words, and we have them in a perfect setting.<a name=311:22></a> The Spirit of God has set them here in this book of Hebrews.<a name=311:23></a> The writer, I believe verily, as

		So, as I said, the heavenly side of the truth was another great feature -- that the brethren began to look up to heaven.<a name=314:1></a> In the early patriarchal days God took Abraham out and said, Look up to the heavens, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:5">Genesis  15:5</a>.<a name=314:2></a> He pointed him up to the heavens for a purpose.<a name=314:3></a> He pointed him to the heavens, and so God has done it in our day, and now the question is for you young people here as to where you are looking; as to whether you have learned to look up.<a name=314:4></a> The Psalmist says, as we have often remarked, "I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: whence shall my help come?<a name=314:5></a> My help cometh from Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#121:1">Psalm  121:1</a>,2.<a name=314:6></a> That is where he looked for the help, you see, and that is where we can, too.<a name=314:7></a> But then we must not forget, as I said before, that the Spirit of God is here.<a name=314:8></a> He is here.<a name=314:9></a> We do not have to look up for Him.<a name=314:10></a> Before Pentecost He was in heaven, of course.<a name=314:11></a> He was here in a sense, too.<a name=314:12></a> He was here in Jesus but not in others.<a name=314:13></a> It is when Jesus went up to heaven that the Spirit of God came down and indwelt others, and He is indwelling others now; and that is another thing I have to challenge myself about, as to whether I know I have the Holy Spirit.<a name=314:14></a> Let everyone challenge himself as to that.<a name=314:15></a> It becomes an objective thing in the sense of which I am speaking of it, that the Spirit is objective.<a name=314:16></a> If I have not got Him I cannot regard Him as in any sense objective in me.<a name=314:17></a> He is there in others.<a name=314:18></a> I can look out on others and in on myself, but I want to look into myself and prove.<a name=314:19></a> They did it at Ephesus.<a name=314:20></a> Paul says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=314:21></a>" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:2">Acts  19:2</a>.<a name=314:22></a> They had to inquire if they did and they soon got Him.<a name=314:23></a> You do not have to wait for it -- the blessed Spirit, if you find out you have not got Him and you turn to God about it.<a name=314:24></a> "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=314:25></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:13">Luke  11:13</a>.<a name=314:26></a> Think of that.<a name=314:27></a>

		Well now, to return to this matter of objective truth, as I said, "Looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.<a name=315:1></a> For consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds".<a name=315:2></a> I am shut out from others, you see.<a name=315:3></a> Think of what is happening on earth.<a name=315:4></a> At times I cannot even look at the papers in which they are spoken of -- the things that have happened, but turn away with sorrow and with grief that it is possible for human beings to treat one another in such a way.<a name=315:5></a> But I have to learn to look away even from that, and look stedfastly on Jesus.<a name=315:6></a> I shall never get any good from looking at these sorrows; not that I do not feel with men, but I am now speaking of the subjective matter and how I can steer my eyes that way, to look that way, so to speak, and no other way; no other way at all.<a name=315:7></a> That is the meaning of this passage.<a name=315:8></a> And then to see what is happening or what has happened in that precious Person; what has happened in Him.<a name=315:9></a> There is so much there as to exclude from my mind altogether everything: sorrows, whatever they may be; misery, without the words to speak of them.<a name=315:10></a> The point here is; see what happened in Him.<a name=315:11></a> We are to look stedfastly on Him, "Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God".<a name=315:12></a> I have to look at all that.<a name=315:13></a> Think of it, dear brethren.<a name=315:14></a> It is my privilege to look on all that in the objective sense; what has happened in that Person, and what has happened remains there in its effect for me to feed on for ever and for ever, what has happened there.<a name=315:15></a>

		I have in mind to speak about promise, dear brethren, and I have selected this passage as a very appropriate one as I hope to show, and one calculated to establish us in the subject; for the very thought of the subject by itself is establishing; and we need establishing, every one of us.<a name=342:1></a> The introduction of Abraham in this section is intended particularly to establish us in the matter in hand, because the matter in hand and the subject proposed were worked out peculiarly in Abraham.<a name=342:2></a> It is said here that after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise.<a name=342:3></a> That is, he had that experience.<a name=342:4></a> God is pleased to signalise His children and His servants, and it is because they have signalised themselves, in answering to the divine proposal that may be intended in them.<a name=342:5></a> The idea of promise is peculiarly linked up with Abraham and he signalised himself in the thought of promise.<a name=342:6></a> As we have read, he obtained it.<a name=342:7></a> This epistle is intended to set us up in the obtaining of things set out in our souls, that they are not mere academical things, but things of real value in the soul and to be sought after, stretched out for.<a name=342:8></a> This marked the history of Abraham; he obtained the promise.<a name=342:9></a> He obtained other things, too, but this is what is stressed here, and I bring it forward so that we may have in mind, if we have set out in any spiritual way, not to lag behind or give up in weariness but to stretch forward to secure the prize, so that we may not seem to come short.<a name=342:10></a> Many do appear in this way, and it is not, of course, in any sense in one's mind to criticise but rather to point out that we need to have ideals, and God has ideals and pursues them and follows them

		Well now, as I have said, these books are particularly marked by promise: the epistle to the Romans because it is a basic gospel epistle; the epistle to the Galatians because it is a recovering epistle; it is the Lord going after the saints that are going wrong as to doctrine; not exactly in worldliness although worldliness usually goes with bad doctrine, but the Galatians were getting bad doctrine.<a name=345:21></a> And then, the Hebrews were about to give up Christianity altogether, some of them, not all of them, but there was a general trend among the Hebrew Christians at that time to give up Christianity, and hence the thought of promise is so prevalent in the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=345:22></a> These are three outstanding epistles that we should all read and study and concern ourselves with, so that we may be established in the truth of God and not fall away.<a name=345:23></a> Hence, in Hebrews the writer says, "if he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:38">Hebrews  10:38</a>?<a name=345:24></a> You say.<a name=345:25></a> What does it matter?<a name=345:26></a> Who is speaking?<a name=345:27></a> Only Paul, maybe.<a name=345:28></a> But it is the voice of God; it is the voice of Jesus.<a name=345:29></a> He is representative of Jesus.<a name=345:30></a> As Paul says (I believe it is Paul who wrote the epistle) that we may be sure it is the mind of Christ.<a name=345:31></a>

		It came to me that a word on guidance would help us; first, outward guidance and then inward.<a name=359:1></a> Perhaps the word 'guidance' never applied more definitely both within and without than it does now and it behoves us as the children of God to have an eye to what is outward, to what affects men as of the nations, as forming the nations, so that our prayers may be intelligent and feeling; that the enemy may not succeed in bringing about a renewal of the disturbance that there has been of recent years.<a name=359:2></a> It is within our range to do this, for we are enjoined to pray for all men; for kings and such as are in authority; and it is to the end that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty; not simply that the nations should be in peace and prosper in the sense in which they regard prosperity, but that the saints should prosper and thus be saved from the enemy's machinations to hamper the work of God.<a name=359:3></a> Indeed, we know that there is that which hinders the elements of disturbance, so that we may be encouraged to pray to that end.<a name=359:4></a> God will put it upon us and give us to understand that He is paying attention to our intelligence.<a name=359:5></a> He will honour it.<a name=359:6></a> As was said in the prophets, "And we shall know, -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:3">Hosea  6:3</a>.<a name=359:7></a> The same prophet said that his people were destroyed for lack of knowledge; hence God prizes the knowledge that His people acquire and especially now in what I am remarking on, that we should know the conditions abroad and pray against what is sinister.<a name=359:8></a> Pray against what is sinister.<a name=359:9></a> God will hear us, because He knows what we mean by it, and He will promote in us, too, entire freedom from mere national sentiment which can only ruin us if we imbibe it.<a name=359:10></a>

		Well now, I have spoken of guidance; first, what is outward and then what is inward, but I have more in my mind as to what is outward than I have as to what is inward, although they act and react on one another.<a name=360:1></a> The outward stands, as I understand it, in relation to the tabernacle.<a name=360:2></a> The inward stands in relation to what is inward.<a name=360:3></a> That is what is suggested in the Psalm I read, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>.<a name=360:4></a> Asaph had a great disturbance but he turned inward.<a name=360:5></a> He said, "Until I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end".<a name=360:6></a> Only that should not be limited to the Psalms, but it is a remarkable passage as bearing on what has been said.<a name=360:7></a> The epistle to the Ephesians really enlarges on it, where we are spoken of as being affected by the Spirit of the Father in the inner man.<a name=360:8></a> But I am just touching on that now.<a name=360:9></a> I want to go back to the book of Numbers, because it is peculiarly apropos of the moment.<a name=360:10></a> The book of Numbers may be well designated the book of trouble; but before we have trouble we are well fortified in peace, and that is why I read the verses in chapter 9.<a name=360:11></a> The whole book up to chapter 9 may be regarded as prefatory in the sense in which I am speaking of it: that is, the establishment of an order of things that is according to God in military connections: persons of mature age in the military and men of mature age in the ministry.<a name=360:12></a> The military ensures a way for the ministry.<a name=360:13></a> And so, a state of things contemplated, which is the wilderness, is met in both branches of what we may call the divine service: that is, the military and the ministry and the ministers.<a name=360:14></a> This section that I am alluding to -- the early section enlarges on order based on what I have been saying; maturity in age and experience, and order, too, in the ministry; not only that, but energy in the ministry, remarkable terms being used for the service of the Levites, that service being provided for in the fact that the Levites were of not only mature age

		but as affording physical endurance, physical ability and endurance; because it is quite obvious from the outset that the duties imposed on the military and on the service, on the Levites, would be very onerous.<a name=361:1></a> Holiday-making is out of the question.<a name=361:2></a> It is a question of work, work, and work again.<a name=361:3></a> So that when we come to this section of the passage I read, we have an account of what proceeded, not simply at the outset but right through; as we may say, right through the dispensation; everything foreseen and seen active, too, actually active.<a name=361:4></a> So that there are no discrepancies to face, but then, as it were, God allowing the enemy to operate, in a sense letting him loose, we have the trouble.<a name=361:5></a> Chapter 11 brings in the trouble; chapter 12 brings it in; chapter 13, and right through.<a name=361:6></a> It is right that I should enlarge a little on this, dear brethren, because of the trouble that exists; that we might get back to the beginning.<a name=361:7></a> I allude to the verses read in chapter 9 as covering the whole dispensation, for really it is so; what happened.<a name=361:8></a> It might be written after, it might be written before, prophetically, but after it was written historically that certain things happened and wonderful things, there is a sense of order, thoughtfulness, so that it is God, I believe, fortifying His saints against what should come or telling them how wonderfully He had provided for them after it happened.<a name=361:9></a> What a book is the book of Numbers!<a name=361:10></a> Indeed, it may be well said, as it was in earlier days, that the name of the book was "In the wilderness".<a name=361:11></a> That is to say, in the scene of trouble.<a name=361:12></a> And so, we may well ask one another, Do we come peaceably to one another?<a name=361:13></a> If we approach each other at all, do we come peaceably?<a name=361:14></a> Or is there war in our hearts?<a name=361:15></a> It is an awful suggestion, but we may as well face it.<a name=361:16></a> War is abroad in the world and it is in the assembly.<a name=361:17></a>

		It is in mind to say something about the work of God, and I have selected three scriptures in order to speak of this, and to see the character of the persons in whom it is seen, and I begin with Luke having in mind that the work of God is seen in the military element, and I may say here that the thought of wonder appears.<a name=388:1></a> We have no reference to wonder at the end of the physical creation, although, of course, it was indeed wonderful, but as to what God had in His mind, the idea of man that He should work in him, we have, in the Lord, remarkable evidence of wonder.<a name=388:2></a> You can understand that in referring to the Lord in this way, it is only to bring out how the realm of God admits of the thought of wonder, and in Luke God is seen working -- it is grace.<a name=388:3></a> The word would not appear in relation to the physical creation.<a name=388:4></a> It appears in relation to man, and in this particular case in relation to the military, because it is a great military time, we might say, The world is filled with military renown, defeat, too, and it is not without significance that the Lord selected at this particular time of His service a military man, as I might say God ordered it in His operations, for it is a question of God, and in view of the great place the military has at the present time it certainly is worthy of our consideration that God is not making little of that of which man is making so much.<a name=388:5></a> But God is working among the military, and we are not unacquainted with the military, our sons and our daughters, our brothers and our sisters are having and have had to do with it, and to do with it not in a victorious way militarily, but morally, and that is a greater thing.<a name=388:6></a> Moral victories are the greatest.<a name=388:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have this centurion: "a certain centurion's bondman who was dear to him was ill", a certain centurion.<a name=389:1></a> I just comment on this to come to the point that is in mind, that he was in good favour with the religious class, and they represent him commendably, saying that he is worthy for whom He should do this "for he loves our nation, and himself has built the synagogue for us".<a name=389:2></a> The passage suggests to us gospel circumstances, circumstances available for gospel testimony.<a name=389:3></a> The religious element is there, but not adverse; the military element is there regarded with favour; the servant, or working class is there in the servant; and the Lord Jesus is there, and so it is that one believes that the present juncture affords great opportunities to the brethren.<a name=389:4></a> It is a time for evangelical feeling, and evangelical testimony and work; the opportunities are great, and the fact that a military man is in evidence is surely something to note.<a name=389:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not unacquainted with the military, they are near to us; we love them and think of them all, how God has prospered them, and how the work of God has proceeded in them, and how they have been under reproach, and how they stood in the reproach, and now it is a time they should be honoured, but honoured in a moral sense, and so the circumstances afford these elements.<a name=389:6></a> There is the military among ourselves, not militant, although the word 'military' applies to them, for they are not militant, they are followers of the Lord Jesus who said that His kingdom was not of this world; they have learned how to put the sword into its place and leave it.<a name=389:7></a> It will be needed again from their point of view, but for the moment they are not militant, they are conscientious, an element that belongs to the moment is conscience, not simply the abstract idea of conscience, but conscience in regard of God and of the brethren, conscience in regard of the government, and so they
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=390>[Page 390]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		afford an element of great advantage in the way of testimony at the present time.<a name=390:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I proceed to call attention now to the centurion, what a man he was, and that he should come in contact with the Lord Jesus in these circumstances is the more to be remarked on, and that he was commendable and commended by the Jews.<a name=390:2></a> But he comes in contact directly with the Lord Jesus, and becomes a great moral trophy in these circumstances -- notice that they represent him commendably.<a name=390:3></a> Then "Jesus went with them", ready to join in even with them, and "when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent to him friends, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.<a name=390:4></a> Wherefore neither did I count myself worthy to come to thee.<a name=390:5></a> But say by a word and my servant shall be healed.<a name=390:6></a> For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it".<a name=390:7></a> These are the words that fell on the ears of the Lord Jesus, the words of a military man, an officer, no ordinary soldier, a man having men under him, men who would obey him, and having depicted these circumstances to the Lord he uses the word 'also', as much as to say, Lord, that is your picture.<a name=390:8></a> He was respectful, he recognised that the Lord Jesus was here in authority, but in authority in the sense of being under it.<a name=390:9></a> It was graded authority beginning with God and coming right down to the Lord Jesus.<a name=390:10></a> I say, coming right down, for the Lord took a lowly place, and the centurion recognised that He was a Man under authority, and that all He had to do was to say the word, "Say by a word and my servant shall be healed".<a name=390:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=399:1></a> It came to me this morning that Paul's remarks in this fifteenth chapter of his first letter to the Corinthians are particularly significant just now, as showing how the Lord though in heaven maintains contact with His people, the contact being continuous according to this passage, continuous from the time of His resurrection.<a name=399:2></a> We cannot say it ever terminated, but evidently it alludes to the assembly and runs on down to Paul as he reports, and this fact shows that it is maintained after He went up to heaven.<a name=399:3></a> Events began with the appearance to Cephas, according to verse 5, then to the twelve, then to above five hundred brethren at once, then to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all as an abortion, the apostle says, He appeared to me also.<a name=399:4></a> We know that He appeared at other times to Paul, and obviously it was Himself, not merely in a spiritual sense, but actually Himself.<a name=399:5></a> Then <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>describes in a general way what enters into this dispensation, evidently dependent on the Spirit, as it is worked out from <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:15">John  14:15</a>, "If ye love me, keep my commandments.<a name=399:6></a> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you", and then, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a>.<a name=399:7></a> That is the point where we link on with 1 Corinthians, or 1 Corinthians links on with John.<a name=399:8></a> I was impressed at the breaking of bread this morning that the Lord maintains contact with us, actual contact with us in the assembly.<a name=399:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=400:3></a> I think these facts we have already spoken of would imply that the Lord intended in the earlier comings and goings to accustom His saints, as forming the assembly, to the thought of His visitations.<a name=400:4></a> We are told in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a> that a witness was to be chosen "of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us".<a name=400:5></a> He, therefore, accustomed them to that principle of coming in and going out amongst His own, apparently intending to carry it on after He died and rose and went to heaven.<a name=400:6></a> He could have effected the same thing in a certain sense in a mediatorial way coming through others, taking up servants and using them in a representative way, but He evidently desired to do the thing Himself.<a name=400:7></a> Of course, the Spirit would be here, and I think this thought is worked out from that fact -- that He would be here.<a name=400:8></a> At the same time the Lord is clearly saying He would act Himself, and Paul also said that He did come Himself, and he is a testimony to it.<a name=400:9></a>
