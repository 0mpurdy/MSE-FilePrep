	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> The early verses of <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21">Exodus  21</a>, which speak of the Hebrew servant, might be linked on with the early verses of chapter 28, which introduce the subject of the High Priest, the Hebrew servant, according to what is stated, being a type of Christ in the exercise of love in service, showing the attitude of mind that He took in becoming Man.<a name=1:3></a> Love would go to the utmost limit -- although itself unlimited -- to exercise the service of love, His love to God, and His love to the saints -- the church, then the saints being the children, but in self-abnegation, self-denial, all would be accepted that the service of love required.<a name=1:4></a> On the other hand <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>comes in and views the Lord -- the same Person -- in dignity, official dignity, so that He is rightly regarded in His service by the saints, by those He serves.<a name=1:5></a> That is why I read in connection with these passages the opening verses of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>, where the saints are addressed as "holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling".<a name=1:6></a> Then the passage shows that Christ is to be regarded in the light of the statement that He who builds the house is greater than the house.<a name=1:7></a> So that whilst He takes up the attitude of bondman in the service to show the lengths to which love will go, we are to regard Him in the house in His dignity as Son; His Person remains unchanged in the service.<a name=1:8></a> The garments in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>refer to Him in His service; what He was as Man in service is in mind in all these habiliments.<a name=1:9></a> The Person is really hidden, the cloak being the long covering garment; He has taken on these things as in service; they are to be known in part, each part representing some feature of Christ in His service.<a name=1:10></a>

		The next thing to note is that He is not on earth, He has gone into heaven, and the service is carried on in that setting, "minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man".<a name=2:1></a> So that the service He carries on is heavenly, and views the saints as heavenly, partakers of a heavenly calling.<a name=2:2></a> Chapters 8 and 9 show how He has become minister of a better covenant, the first being set aside to make room for the second.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:4></a> Then this service is Godward on our behalf?<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:6></a> That is the view we have to take of it here.<a name=2:7></a> In chapters 2 and 4, He serves us in the sanctuary, but the Minister of the sanctuary is clearly in the tabernacle; that is the setting.<a name=2:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:12></a> That is to call attention to the greatness of the Person who is high priest.<a name=2:13></a> The beginning of chapter 8 is a summary of what He has been, and that "we have such a one high priest" who has set Himself down "on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens".<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:15></a> Is it representation Godward?<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:17></a> The saints are so great -- it is a remarkable way to put it.<a name=2:18></a> He has made us great, because we are of Him: "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".<a name=2:19></a> Then at the beginning of chapter 8, "Such a one high priest" is the One "who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens".<a name=2:20></a> Who could do that but God?<a name=2:21></a> He has set Himself down.<a name=2:22></a> That is a very great position to get into our souls in regard to the Lord as the Minister of the sanctuary, and the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched and not man.<a name=2:23></a> He leads in the service Godward, I think.<a name=2:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:18></a> What answers to the holy places today?<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:20></a> We have to lay hold of the heavenly side of the thing.<a name=3:21></a> What is in mind is Israel's place and our place; all is worked out in the assembly in the light of the heavenly and the two merge in us.<a name=3:22></a> Israel is not in view yet.<a name=3:23></a> I think Israel's service will be outside the veil; ours is inside, that is "heaven itself".<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:27></a> We have to wait for the Minister; things must be regulated by Him.<a name=3:28></a> There are certain principles by which we are governed.<a name=3:29></a> To serve the living God there must be a living service, and we must wait for the Minister for He is in charge of the service.<a name=3:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I think before we get to the service actually we ought to consider these features of the holy garments or habiliments for the priest, because they are to bring out what the saints are as viewed in relation to counsel; the breastplate is in relation to counsel.<a name=3:31></a> It is not the tribes viewed according to their birth, but

		viewed according to the counsels of love.<a name=4:1></a> The order is not a mere automatic thing, according to birth, but it is according to the sovereignty of God, where He places His people.<a name=4:2></a> The two onyx stones on the shoulder mean the saints viewed as a family; we are sustained by the Lord as a family.<a name=4:3></a> But there is personal distinction on the breastplate, personal distinction of each one.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:5></a> Would it be right to introduce the breastplate into <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:24">Hebrews  9:24</a>, there "to appear in the presence of God for us"?<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> That is the idea of it.<a name=4:8></a> The priest was never to go into the holiest without these garments, and we are to be assured that we are never cut off.<a name=4:9></a> "He ever liveth to make intercession for them", as if He never did anything else.<a name=4:10></a> We know He does, of course, but it is to assure us of the place we have there.<a name=4:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:12></a> What is the significance of the breastplate being four-square?<a name=4:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:18></a> To bring out the importance of it.<a name=4:19></a> It is not going to wear out; it is going to stand; it was like a pocket really.<a name=4:20></a> The Urim and the Thummim, whatever they were, these two things were in the breastplate.<a name=4:21></a> You have to understand the principle of the thing is in those two things.<a name=4:22></a> It is first mentioned in the general list, "And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, .<a name=4:23></a>.<a name=4:24></a>.<a name=4:25></a>" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:4">Exodus  28:4</a>).<a name=4:26></a> It is the thing <i>par excellence</i> in the array of garments.<a name=4:27></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:30></a> Yes, it is something like <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:4">Colossians  1:4</a>, love "to all the saints".<a name=4:31></a> The breastplate shows the place we have before God; we need all the saints and we want to have them all in our hearts.<a name=4:32></a> These garments are very instructive and each part has its own

		J.T.<a name=6:18></a> The glory of the names is in the stones; it suggests great variety in the saints.<a name=6:19></a> We are the inheritance of God; that is, we shine on the breastplate of Christ.<a name=6:20></a> However little we may be in reality we are great in the divine thoughts; we have the most central place in the heart of Christ.<a name=6:21></a>

		"And Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah" (the meaning of the word 'Moriah' is said to be 'shewn by Jehovah' ), "where he appeared to David his father" (the words 'where he appeared' may be rendered 'which was shewn' ), "in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.<a name=13:1></a> And he began to build on the second of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign".<a name=13:2></a>

		There are other scriptures that I may allude to briefly but this one sets out more definitely than any other what I had in mind to call attention to, that divine things are to be shown.<a name=13:3></a> God has graciously provided the instrumentality for this, and young believers are to note that things have to be shown.<a name=13:4></a> The Holy Spirit indeed is here to that end; He takes of the things of Christ and shows them, or announces them, to us.<a name=13:5></a> That is what He is doing, one of the greatest acts that He is doing, showing the things of Christ, showing things to come to the saints.<a name=13:6></a> No saint or christian can afford to be neglectful of this, for the end is that we should become acquainted with eternal things, things that enter into our eternal state, and we should be conversant with these things as having had them announced to us.<a name=13:7></a>

		So that this is the end of a series of showings which I will call attention to briefly -- the foundation of the house.<a name=13:8></a> No one can be in the house save as seeing the foundation, no one can be in it intelligently save as understanding the foundation.<a name=13:9></a> The Lord says, "On this rock I will build my assembly" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>).<a name=13:10></a> And Paul says, "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus

		Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:11">1 Corinthians  3:11</a>).<a name=14:1></a> The foundation of the house -- of the assembly -- has to be understood, no christian should be ignorant as to it.<a name=14:2></a> Sometimes we think ignorance is almost a virtue, but it never can be.<a name=14:3></a> People speak of themselves as simple believers, but there is a certain shame attaching to ignorance.<a name=14:4></a> We have to admit, of course, we know nothing as we should know, but one says I will follow on to know, "And we shall know -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:3">Hosea  6:3</a>).<a name=14:5></a> That is the characteristic attitude of a christian, he is following on to know.<a name=14:6></a> There is so much to be known that we need to devote ourselves to it and follow it -- as the apostle says to Timothy, "Thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:10">2 Timothy  3:10</a>).<a name=14:7></a> Timothy gave himself to these things, he is enjoined to do it, "Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned" (verse 14).<a name=14:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first showing that I will call attention to is that to Abraham.<a name=14:9></a> I want to speak briefly of the great men of faith to whom things are shown as examples.<a name=14:10></a> The more spiritual you are the less you assume; you are always dependent, ready to be shown, ready to learn.<a name=14:11></a> As regards young christians the eunuch is an excellent example, doubtless a man of education according to this world, but he was reading the Scriptures as we know, and the Holy Spirit says to Philip, "Go near, and join thyself to this chariot".<a name=14:12></a> And he did, he joined himself to this man reading the Scriptures; he was enjoined to do it by the Spirit, and there was no doubt that it was the right thing to do.<a name=14:13></a> The first question is, "Understandest thou what thou readest?<a name=14:14></a>".<a name=14:15></a> And the man rightly and simply said, "How should I then be able unless someone guide me?<a name=14:16></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:31">Acts  8:31</a>).<a name=14:17></a> He had been up to Jerusalem where the scribes and Pharisees were, but they did not guide him.<a name=14:18></a> This guidance is by the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit says to Philip, "Approach and join

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Abraham was the first to be shown things, Moses the second and David the third.<a name=15:6></a> With Abraham it was the mount on which Isaac was to be offered up; that was not left to his choice.<a name=15:7></a> It was spiritually the greatest event you can conceive of, typically it was the offering up of Christ.<a name=15:8></a> It was no accident that the Lord Jesus was crucified just outside the gates, outside the wall.<a name=15:9></a> It was in Jerusalem though, in principle; it is spiritually "Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11:8">Revelation  11:8</a>).<a name=15:10></a> That was no accident, that is where the evil was, that is where the hatred of God and of Christ is.<a name=15:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I speak now of the showing, the gracious comment of God on His servant, that he should not hesitate.<a name=16:8></a> The death of Christ was plainly declared; not only the place of it but the kind of persons that were put with Him to death were recorded; the very grave in which they intended to put Him is mentioned beforehand; everything is accurately pointed out in the Scriptures, and when the time comes the Holy Spirit calls attention to that.<a name=16:9></a> How important to be definite in our apprehension of the place and time, the significance of the death of Christ.<a name=16:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=19:1></a> Lately some of us have been looking at the water of purification in John's gospel, which alludes to the death of Christ as cleansing us from the state effected in us by sin, not as dealing with our sins, but from the <i>state</i> caused by sin.<a name=19:2></a> In John's gospel there is also the drinking of water, which is another thing, water viewed in another way, as a type of the Holy Spirit, which is always refreshing and vivifying.<a name=19:3></a> It is from this standpoint of the water in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>and 7 that these scriptures in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>and <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>should be considered.<a name=19:4></a> The water for drinking is a subject that is specially calculated to help young christians, because we are apt to be so general in treating types, so that the water of purification is not distinguished in our minds from the water of refreshment and life.<a name=19:5></a> There are two features of water running through Scripture.<a name=19:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=47:1></a> The subject of ministers and ministry has a great place in the Scriptures; it occurred to me it would be profitable to dwell upon it as involving authority in the presentation of the truth.<a name=47:2></a> In the types it comes properly in Exodus -- which may be touched upon tomorrow -- but it comes in there as affording divine sanction to what was in the divine mind to present to men.<a name=47:3></a> Therefore Exodus gives us the history of Moses, the great minister, from his infancy, Leviticus the priesthood, and Numbers the levitical service; the latter bringing out how ministers of the truth as presented to God become acceptable to Him, so that He increases their number.<a name=47:4></a> He reduced their age from thirty years to twenty-five with this in view.<a name=47:5></a> Humanly speaking the number of ministers is great, but God would increase their number as based on acceptability as presented in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#8">Numbers  8</a>.<a name=47:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that has its place in the New Testament, which we may see later on; but I thought it might be suitable to look at John's presentation of the subject at this reading.<a name=47:7></a> He makes very little of christian apostles, of which he was one, as to their service, but makes a great deal of John the baptist.<a name=47:8></a> I suppose he had in mind that the assembly had failed -- indeed he records the failure in the last chapter -- so that he presents John the baptist to us as representative of the thought of ministry.<a name=47:9></a> He records no failure of John at all; he presents him as representative of the thought of ministry; that is, he is to be taken as an example.<a name=47:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=48:23></a> That is the force of the original.<a name=48:24></a> Luke says he was in the deserts until the time of showing to Israel; there is something to show, something to be seen; John does not allude to that, but says he was "sent from God".<a name=48:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=60:1></a> It was remarked yesterday that John's presentation of the subject of ministry, ignores or slights the apostles.<a name=60:2></a> Having the last days in view the Spirit anticipates the breakdown of ministers, those officially known as such; indeed, in the last chapter he records the sorrowful departure of seven of them, including the leading apostle, Peter, but records the recovery at the same time which points to the last days of the dispensation.<a name=60:3></a> So John brings in John the baptist, and enlarges upon him as minister, omitting any failure on his part; and pursues his remarks about Christ, until he reaches Him as the Bridegroom, John saying he is the friend of the Bridegroom, who stood and heard Him.<a name=60:4></a> That is a minister, who can stand when Christ is brought in, making room for Him.<a name=60:5></a> Ministry may shut Christ out; it may be so active and so official as to shut out Christ.<a name=60:6></a> So he records John standing twice; he stood as Jesus walked (chapter 1:36), and then, as the friend of the Bridegroom, he "stands and hears him" (chapter 3:29).<a name=60:7></a> He finishes by a most striking tribute to the Person of Christ as coming from above, linking all with heaven in that way.<a name=60:8></a> All that comes out for men is linked with heaven; it was thought that the link is established between his ministry and Paul's in the thought of the 'Bridegroom'.<a name=60:9></a>

		I have in mind to speak of liberty, in a spiritual sense.<a name=72:1></a> It will be observed that in the passage in Matthew a particular time is stressed, and ministry of the word has to take account of time; so, I apprehend the thought of liberty is needed to be stressed at the present time.<a name=72:2></a> The epistle to the Galatians was written in regard to the conditions of that particular time and particular place, in order to assert the principle of "the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free".<a name=72:3></a> The enemy endeavoured at that time to snatch it away from the saints, for the apostle tells us that certain had crept in unawares to spy out the liberty which we have in Christ Jesus.<a name=72:4></a> That persons should trouble themselves in that way to enter clandestinely amongst the brethren to spy out their liberty, is remarkable, for it was not a commodity which they could steal and use; they could not seize it; but their object was purely to rob others, as we may say, of their inheritance.<a name=72:5></a> As a thing it would be impossible for them to steal it, but they spy it out, in order to deprive the saints of it, and destroy it as their portion.<a name=72:6></a> Such are the malicious tactics of the enemy always, to destroy for the sake of destroying what love has effected.<a name=72:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are solemn suggestions as to what the enemy is constantly set for -- to destroy what we have, out of hatred; but against that the apostle stresses that Christ has set us "free in freedom" -- a remarkable expression -- and that we are to stand fast in the liberty.<a name=72:8></a>

		We read of "the revelation of the sons of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:19">Romans  8:19</a>), the whole creation looks for it; not perhaps with intelligence, but with instinct; it has been subjected to vanity, but it is to be released from the bondage of corruption "into the liberty of the glory of the children of God".<a name=73:19></a> You see how the saints of this dispensation are brought into the centre of things, in order that the whole realm of creation should be brought into liberty; that is, it awaits the revelation of the sons of God, and the liberty of the glory of the children of God -- a very touching thought!<a name=73:20></a> I believe that is bound up in sonship, in the peculiar way in which the saints are to be manifested by and

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to dwell a moment upon that: "What we shall be", the apostle says, "has not yet been manifested", but "we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him" -- that is enough.<a name=74:4></a> What He is <i>now</i> is the point.<a name=74:5></a> There is what He <i>was</i> in the days of His flesh; His flesh was a veil indeed; and there is that which He was from the morning of resurrection to the day of ascension -- that is, what He was in a <i>spiritual</i> way.<a name=74:6></a> He had taken on a new condition; it involved complete superiority to matter; the point is it was spiritual.<a name=74:7></a> He moved in and out amongst them, disregarding what was material, so that the stress is upon the spiritual; but there is more than that attaching to His position in heaven.<a name=74:8></a> His position <i>in heaven</i> transcends all that is approachable by the human eye; even transfiguration is not equal to what He is now.<a name=74:9></a> He was transfigured before them on the holy mount, and John saw that, and nevertheless says, it is not manifested "what we shall be".<a name=74:10></a> That is as conformed to Christ in glory.<a name=74:11></a> He is received up in glory, but then He is all glorious; there is infinite radiance and light from Himself; it is not what He takes on, but what He <i>is</i>.<a name=74:12></a> He is transfigured before them, but what He is is from Himself; the increasing display of glory and greatness is of Himself.<a name=74:13></a> When <i>He</i> is manifested we shall be like Him, "for we shall see him as he is", not as He <i>was</i>.<a name=74:14></a> There is no change in the Person but there is change in what we see.<a name=74:15></a> Think of the manifestation of the sons of God, and then the liberty of the glory of the children of God!<a name=74:16></a> Creation comes into "the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to show how this came about in the Lord.<a name=75:2></a> He moved through the corn; that was deliberate.<a name=75:3></a> The point is not what He said, but what He did.<a name=75:4></a> For young people here it is important to notice what spiritual persons <i>do</i>.<a name=75:5></a> In the gospels we have examples set by the Lord; in the Acts it is what the apostles and others who are spiritual do.<a name=75:6></a> The term 'Acts' is appropriate, because it describes what is visible, the inauguration of a state of liberty and glory in a moral sense.<a name=75:7></a> The apostle that was selected to replace Judas, was one that had companied with them the whole time from the baptism of John until He was received up; not a moment of that time was to be missed.<a name=75:8></a> The apostle to fill the place should be one of those; it is a question of what they were, not only of what they said.<a name=75:9></a> So in the gospels, it is not only a question of what the Lord said, but of what He was: He says, "Learn from me", that is, how He moved; these circumstances have their present force, and from them we learn how to move.<a name=75:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was inevitable but that this movement should cut across what was current in Judaea, and Galilee, and Jerusalem, what was generally accepted, the legal obligations that honour the flesh.<a name=75:11></a> The Lord selected the sabbath to set out the principle of liberty He enjoyed.<a name=75:12></a> He made the law honourable, yet it was the law given by Moses, not what they had made it.<a name=75:13></a> It had been added to and perverted and had lost its identity in other hands, and they would not lift a finger to carry the burdens.<a name=75:14></a> He brought in a principle from heaven that has more than magnified and made it honourable; He moved in the liberty and dignity of a Man out of heaven.<a name=75:15></a> It was a new thing, and He moved here for God, but in doing this He cut athwart what was current religiously.<a name=75:16></a>

		What I want to show is that it was a particular time when these instructions were necessary; He was leading His own on to the footing of the assembly.<a name=76:1></a> Aside from this teaching no one can be in the assembly according to God; he is in it in self-occupation unless he understands what the Lord had in mind in this action.<a name=76:2></a> He entered into the cornfields, that is all -- <i>He led the way</i>.<a name=76:3></a> That is what I would say to any who need liberty.<a name=76:4></a> The disciples did more than that, but He intended them to do it.<a name=76:5></a> The Lord gives you a lead in the corn on the sabbath day.<a name=76:6></a> You are transgressing the law in the eyes of the religious world; they will not overlook this.<a name=76:7></a> Never mind; you are being extricated; you are coming out of bondage and that can only be said of the christian as the whole person, including the spirit, is in liberty.<a name=76:8></a> You have not received the spirit of bondage but the spirit of adoption.<a name=76:9></a> The apostle says we cry, "Abba, Father" by that Spirit.<a name=76:10></a> Maybe you are not doing that?<a name=76:11></a> That is, He takes us out of the religious world and gives us access to God.<a name=76:12></a> He cries Himself in the saints; the Holy Spirit does not cry aside from the saints; but He is here, in relation exactly to what the Lord did in this chapter.<a name=76:13></a> He cries, "Abba, Father"; it is urgent -- and He makes you feel it is urgent; and He points out to you in the gospel of Mark that the Lord Jesus did that, He cried "Abba, Father" by the Spirit.<a name=76:14></a>

		I have in view, dear brethren, to speak of personality as entering into the testimony as that which opens up to us opportunities of testimony; firstly, in the young believer -- personality as it shows itself in the believer at the outset, as the effect of the work of the Lord in him, answering his needs as accruing from the working of sin in him; secondly, personality as in the servant of Christ or of God, the servant viewed as in John the baptist; and thirdly, personality in conflict.<a name=82:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Under these three heads I propose to speak of personality as the result of the work of God in believers.<a name=82:2></a> Personality must, as with all else, be understood first in Christ; and as in Him, we see how the unregenerate mind is unable to take account of or rightly estimate the personality in man that is according to the mind of God.<a name=82:3></a> "When we shall see him", say the unregenerate Jews, "there is no beauty that we should desire him" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:2">Isaiah  53:2</a>).<a name=82:4></a> In their view He was without form or lordliness such as the natural mind would esteem; whereas in the esteem of those who become subjects of the work of God amongst the Jews, he was regarded as "the chiefest among ten thousand" and "altogether lovely" (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#5:10">Song of Songs  5:10</a>,16).<a name=82:5></a> Such is the immeasurable difference between the estimate of personality according to God in the unregenerate, and in those who are the subjects of His gracious work by the Spirit.<a name=82:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David of old typifies Christ in this respect, above all others, and is especially presented to us according to his personality, including his appearance, not only in his moral traits, but physically.<a name=82:7></a> Over against him were such as Saul, a man of appearance according to

	<div class="paragraph">
		the flesh.<a name=83:1></a> He hid himself indeed, during the process of determination of the king which he was to be; Jehovah graciously performing this service for his people, and directing them to find him among the stuff.<a name=83:2></a> That is a very humiliating place to be found -- among the baggage!<a name=83:3></a> As found, he was an imposing man, but very much of Philistine character; head and shoulders above his brethren, a big man.<a name=83:4></a> So with the Philistines, they are those marked by this feature; whether it be physical or educational, the character of bigness was accorded current value then, as now.<a name=83:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Over against such personality we have David, of whom it is said he was a man that could play well, a valiant man, a man of war, and, according to the statement of the Spirit of God, a man with a ruddy countenance and a beautiful appearance.<a name=83:6></a> All this is noted over against Eliab, Saul and others, and as we have this description of his personal beauty and attractiveness, we have his name given; that is, his name covers all this.<a name=83:7></a> When the name David is given for the first time, it is said, "The Spirit of the Lord came upon David" -- meaning Beloved -- (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:13">1 Samuel  16:13</a>) that was his name; known already, even in obscurity, to heaven, and loved as worthy of love.<a name=83:8></a> That has always to be borne in mind; we are to be lovable if we are expecting to be loved.<a name=83:9></a> God, indeed, may love us otherwise, being God, but if we expect to be loved it is necessary that we shall be lovable; that is "David" as a name signifies the thought.<a name=83:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This thought, so presented, in such a distinct manner and with such detail by the Spirit, in David as a type of Christ in this respect as in others, is to begin with the believer as he comes in for the benefits of the work of Christ; as he becomes the subject of the touch, the identifying service of Christ; for that is the way we have to view this passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>; He identifies Himself with us in touching us.<a name=83:11></a> If He

		identifies Himself with us to relieve us from the result of sin, it is that the hideous results of sin should be replaced by His own beautiful traits.<a name=84:1></a> It is most logical that it should be so.<a name=84:2></a> That we should come into relief of conscience, and retain the ugly traits of sin, taking on the ways of the world's fashion, is a poor answer to the touch of Christ, for His touch implies that He has had to enter into the depths of death and judgment that we might be relieved of these awful features of sin.<a name=84:3></a> What can be more abhorrent in that sense than leprosy?<a name=84:4></a> The man was full of it.<a name=84:5></a> The Lord touches him, saying, "Go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing as Moses ordained, for a testimony to them", not to the priest alone, but to the whole system.<a name=84:6></a> You see, therefore, dear brethren, this passage brings the idea of personality and testimony within the range of every believer, old or young; that at least he has <i>himself</i> to present as testimony.<a name=84:7></a> 'Yes', you may say, 'but what about Christ?<a name=84:8></a>' That is true if I am speaking, but the Lord did not send him to speak, He told him to <i>show himself</i>.<a name=84:9></a> Let that have its own significance, to the priest and to his class; here is a changed person, hitherto leprous, full of it, in a certain town -- now he is cleansed.<a name=84:10></a>

		Romans contemplates that the young believer gets a mind, and that that mind becomes dominant in him; he says, "<i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law" (chapter 7:25) -- that is how the change comes about.<a name=85:7></a> It is intelligent, so that we present our bodies "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service" (chapter 12:1).<a name=85:8></a> If I present my body to God, it concludes that life, and I can turn round and present it before men, so that the word immediately is, "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (chapter 12:2).<a name=85:9></a> He says, "with the mind I myself serve the law of God"; the Holy Spirit enables me to retain that throughout my history here, and my personality according to God increases.<a name=85:10></a> You have in the last chapter of Romans a wonderful picture of men and women who had personality, as if the Spirit of God would give us examples.<a name=85:11></a> He begins with the sisters; there are many sisters in the list.<a name=85:12></a> They resided in Rome, the capital of the world, and they had the advantage of a testimony there; some were of Caesar's household, such is God's way.<a name=85:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=175:1></a> This scripture is perhaps more familiar to us than most.<a name=175:2></a> It should be read in view of its being the introduction of extended communications from the Lord on the eve of His death, and it is introductory to the service of God which was on the Lord's mind as He was about to die.<a name=175:3></a> His people should understand the desire of the Father, and enter into the service of God intelligently and in love to one another.<a name=175:4></a> One matter of importance in this chapter is the evident intent to lift the saints out of the ordinary religious settings and customs; so it has a peculiar application to this country because of the special observance of religious days and customs.<a name=175:5></a>

		I think the Spirit made the allusion to the passover here to denote what is in view -- what the Lord was going to say or do.<a name=175:6></a> We do not read, "When the hour was come" here, as in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:14">Luke  22:14</a>; it reads, "Now before the feast of the passover", without saying how long before.<a name=175:7></a> In chapter 12 it says, "Six days before", and in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26">Matthew  26</a>"after two days".<a name=175:8></a> In Matthew and in the other synoptic gospels the feast of the passover has a place -- the Lord was still recognising the old economy, but not so in John.<a name=175:9></a> There it says, "Now before the feast of the passover"; then the supper is mentioned in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:2">John  13:2</a>, without naming what supper it was.<a name=175:10></a> Verse 2 which says in the Authorised Version "Supper being ended" should read "during supper".<a name=175:11></a> What gave this supper such importance was that the Lord was partaking of it.<a name=175:12></a> No doubt it was the passover, but that is not the point; it was the supper He partook of with His own.<a name=175:13></a> The persons present were greater than what they partook of; this greatness was from

		I have one word to add, dear brethren, and that is in regard to <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#4:4">Malachi  4:4</a>, "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances".<a name=202:4></a> In our speakings one to another we are not to forget the law of Moses.<a name=202:5></a> We have been speaking about Aaron, but let us never forget Moses; I am not now speaking of him as a speaker but as a lawgiver.<a name=202:6></a> One of the most important things in our time is the principle of law, and this bears on us universally.<a name=202:7></a> It is not mount Sinai here, but "Which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances".<a name=202:8></a> In our speakings one to another there may be oftentimes irritability if law is brought in but a true priest always stands by the law, and he never allows the word 'non-essential' in his vocabulary in regard to what God has said.<a name=202:9></a> Everything that God has said is essential: "Which I commanded unto him in Horeb".<a name=202:10></a> How much there is in the book of Deuteronomy; the ground is gone over again, from the standpoint of Moses himself as a leader of the people.<a name=202:11></a> God never forgets one iota of the law that He gave His servant at Horeb.<a name=202:12></a> Jesus Himself says, "One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled".<a name=202:13></a> "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:17">Matthew  5:17</a>).<a name=202:14></a> I think this passage in Malachi is typical of 1 and 2 Corinthians; the Lord is bringing things in detail before us in these scriptures, and we should not shrink from going into these details.<a name=202:15></a> Let us not quibble and criticise and say these things are non-essential.<a name=202:16></a> This verse is

		I have selected the passage in John because it brings the thought down to one person.<a name=204:3></a> One person may provide such conditions; and if one person, of course five or ten persons, or however many may be in a locality.<a name=204:4></a> The bearing of Scripture is always on the present time, even although its primary application may be future.<a name=204:5></a> It has always a moral bearing, and that bearing is on the time and place of its being read.<a name=204:6></a> The place involves the persons in it.<a name=204:7></a> That is how God regards geographical positions; He regards them in relation to the persons in them.<a name=204:8></a> In the same sense He regards time according to the persons who lived in it.<a name=204:9></a> God reckons on that principle; we should not understand the chronicles of the Bible aside from that method which God has adopted.<a name=204:10></a> For whom?<a name=204:11></a> It is a question of the lives of His saints.<a name=204:12></a> <i>Any</i> given time is in His mind, in that way, and any given place.<a name=204:13></a> The Scriptures are calculated to affect us thus, for they always have a bearing on time and place.<a name=204:14></a> So what I may remark tonight will necessarily apply, if indeed it be the word of God, to this place and to this town.<a name=204:15></a> So John's writings, as we have often heard (and the more we hear the more we believe), refer to our time in the main.<a name=204:16></a> They refer, of course, also to the time in which they were written, and have always had an application, for no scripture is ever a dead letter.<a name=204:17></a> But there is such a thing as speciality with

		God, and John represents this as much as any other -- the principle of speciality.<a name=205:1></a> The Lord left him somewhat obscurely, in his remarks to Peter, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=205:2></a> Follow thou me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21:22">John  21:22</a>).<a name=205:3></a> John was following at that time; had he not been following, the Lord would have had something else to say about it, but he was following; he represents the trustworthiness that his gospel presents to us.<a name=205:4></a> He is said to have lived longer than any of the apostles, and his gospel was written late in his life.<a name=205:5></a> This would go to show that he was trustworthy; the Lord intended him to write his gospel.<a name=205:6></a> His gospel has a speciality peculiar to it, which commands the respect of men who read it, and the Lord is, I believe, giving it a place at the present time.<a name=205:7></a> It will increase in our minds as a speciality, and not the least in this, that it brings down the greatest privileges to one person, assuming as it does that one person can provide tabernacle conditions, conditions for the divine dwelling.<a name=205:8></a> When I speak of the divine dwelling on <i>earth</i>, whether it be the tabernacle of old, or the temple, or the assembly, the divine dwelling on earth is always provisional, never final.<a name=205:9></a> It is as if God would say, 'Notwithstanding the power of the enemy here, I will have a place to dwell in'.<a name=205:10></a> That puts it on us to see that He has a place to dwell in.<a name=205:11></a> It is within the range of every person -- every believer -- to provide the conditions necessary for this.<a name=205:12></a> I have in mind, as I said, a locality, and I would remark in view of what I have to say, that we have always, where actual conditions suitable to God are in mind, the potentiality of them contemplated, otherwise we could never have them.<a name=205:13></a> I refer to 1 Corinthians; it was written to a company of saints addressed as "the assembly of God" in that town or city.<a name=205:14></a> They were young converts; we have often spoken of the Corinthians as in a low condition, and they were when the apostle wrote, but they were

		So again, John tells us at the beginning of chapter 8, after the disciples went to their own homes, that Jesus went to the mount of Olives.<a name=209:2></a> That would confirm what Luke says, that He always did that; it was His habit.<a name=209:3></a> If one could but follow Him there adoringly as John presents it!<a name=209:4></a> No one did, no one was interested enough to do it; but oh!<a name=209:5></a> beloved brethren, think of it, if any one had taken it up and followed Jesus, as He wended His way to the base and then to the summit of Olivet!<a name=209:6></a> What happened?<a name=209:7></a> .<a name=209:8></a>.<a name=209:9></a>.<a name=209:10></a> John tells us, "We have contemplated his glory", possibly he had been with Him there; there is no doubt he was in a certain garden near by, to which the Lord often resorted with His disciples.<a name=209:11></a> I mention this now to show how John leads us to this thought of the divine abode; it is not a place like Olivet now, but with a person or persons -- "We will come to him and make our abode with him".<a name=209:12></a>

		That is the first thing, that sets you free from what is contrary.<a name=213:4></a> 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, 1 Timothy, Titus and Hebrews teach us as to the positive side of things; that is to say, tabernacle conditions are all bound up in the words of the Lord, "If any one love me, he will keep my word".<a name=213:5></a> What was His word?<a name=213:6></a> The next thing is, My words, "He that loves me not does not keep my words".<a name=213:7></a> How many there are who do not keep the words of Jesus, who do not love Jesus.<a name=213:8></a> What are His words?<a name=213:9></a> They are the Father's words; such is the importance of them, that not only are they the words of Christ, but they are the Father's words.<a name=213:10></a> The Father spoke in them, such is the wondrous fact about the revelation -- the Father was there in Jesus.<a name=213:11></a> There was not one Person, but there were two Persons, that is the fullest idea; there was not one Person but two Persons so united that the Father was actually there, doing and speaking the words.<a name=213:12></a> The Lord says this to enhance the importance of what He was doing.<a name=213:13></a> He says, "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:24">John  15:24</a>).<a name=213:14></a> So the Father had to do with these words; and a lover of Jesus cherishes them in his heart and keeps them.<a name=213:15></a> His word or words imply tabernacle conditions; the commandments of course enter into that too, but the commandments deliver us from all that is evil whilst the word brings us into what is positive or constructive.<a name=213:16></a> The word conveys what God has in His mind as to His dwelling, what He cherishes.<a name=213:17></a> It is as if He were to bring a pattern down.<a name=213:18></a> He says to Moses, See that the tabernacle you make is according to the pattern.<a name=213:19></a>

		Now in the chapter I read in John, dear brethren, verse 21 refers to the commandments, and I believe the Lord's supper enters into that.<a name=214:8></a> "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him"; the Lord Jesus loves the person who keeps His commandments, and the Father loves him, and the Lord Jesus manifests Himself to that person.<a name=214:9></a> This is a most precious suggestion; it is not yet the dwelling, but it is most precious to be loved by Jesus, singled out as keeping His commandments; as one of His lovers I am loved by the Father, and manifested to by Jesus.<a name=214:10></a> The Lord manifests Himself to you, and that enters into the Lord's supper, as I understand it.<a name=214:11></a> In John it does not speak of the Lord's supper, but it speaks of what goes with it, what is essential to it.<a name=214:12></a> That is the first thing; then the Supper comes.<a name=214:13></a> It speaks in verse 21 of the manifestation of Jesus, that is sure to set you in movement if you are a lover, that is the intent of it.<a name=214:14></a> He manifests Himself, and finishes with setting them in movement; how essential it is to be set in movement spiritually.<a name=214:15></a> "Judas, not the Iscariote, says to him, Lord, how

		So that the first thing we should notice in speaking of this great subject, as applying to us all severally -- for no true christian will claim exemption from service -- is that God has not got to put up with us as if He had no one else, and that He looks for pleasure in the servant, in the person himself: "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!<a name=218:5></a>".<a name=218:6></a> It enhances the service in our minds to see that this is the divine thought in it.<a name=218:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=223:10></a> God is the source of all, you know.<a name=223:11></a> "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:36">Romans  11:36</a>).<a name=223:12></a> But He says here, "I will put my Spirit upon him".<a name=223:13></a> All is carried on in the power of the Spirit, and that is the ground the Lord takes in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me".<a name=223:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=223:19></a> The gift was darkened to some extent, but the source of all things is God: "Of him, and through him, and for him are all things", and that applies to the servant.<a name=223:20></a> The servant is of God, and for God, and the service is carried on by God's power, as this chapter shows.<a name=223:21></a> So the third paragraph here brings out the result for God.<a name=223:22></a> It says, "Sing unto Jehovah a new song".<a name=223:23></a>

		From these scriptures I intend, by the Lord's help, to deduce certain instruction for us, as needed, I believe, amongst the saints of God at the present time.<a name=237:1></a> It relates to service.<a name=237:2></a> Service is obligatory on all; as one has light from God in any measure, one can use it and serve.<a name=237:3></a> The field, therefore, is wide, including all saints; the levitical family included, in principle, all saints.<a name=237:4></a> But whilst we are all thus obligated, dear brethren, to serve, Scripture also speaks of <i>trained</i> servants, and I have selected Timothy as representative of the saints who serve in this way, especially in our time.<a name=237:5></a> He represents service in the early days too, for he had to do with things in the assembly before its decline; but he also is in view as representing service in difficult times, the last days.<a name=237:6></a> So that he covers in his own person the idea of trained service extending on to our own times; for whilst we are living in a day of small things, broken conditions -- yet the thought of God remains; the need of training in the service, and the means for it too, remain, in measure at least.<a name=237:7></a> We are all familiar with the idea of trained service; how much training is needed in the medical and attendant professions, for instance.<a name=237:8></a> The apostle Paul alludes to this, when he speaks of himself as caring for the saints as a nurse cares for her own children; he alludes to training, withal not shutting out from the trained person the love that will greatly augment the service, and the touch -- "a nurse .<a name=237:9></a>.<a name=237:10></a>.<a name=237:11></a> her own children" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:7">1 Thessalonians  2:7</a>).<a name=237:12></a> Now Timothy is, I believe, representative of this, not indeed as Paul was -- and you may wonder why I do not select Paul, as pre-eminently the

		servant, but I have deliberately selected Timotheus because, as I said, his service extends to our own times, that is, the kind of service seen in him; as the apostle says, "As a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings".<a name=238:1></a> He "served with me" -- this is a suggestion for all young persons, brothers and sisters, who would serve, that they may learn to serve with others.<a name=238:2></a> If you are ever to serve according to God, you must learn to serve with others, and with others who have been serving before you in the testimony so that you may receive all the gain possible.<a name=238:3></a> So the apostle, finding Timotheus, would have him to go with him (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:3">Acts  16:3</a>), discerning, doubtless, what was in the young man; he was not yet to serve, but to go with him.<a name=238:4></a> Every one who is in the service, and in any way qualified and owned of the Lord in it, should have this in mind.<a name=238:5></a> If there are young persons with qualities that may thus be developed in service, let us have them to go with us.<a name=238:6></a> They will not detract from us in any way; they will encourage us.<a name=238:7></a> An interested person nearby is a great stimulus, whatever we are engaged in, whereas uninterested persons nearby are a hindrance; they create an atmosphere of hindrance and difficulty.<a name=238:8></a> But then there is the thought of these interested persons becoming servants themselves; and I may say here, dear brethren, that, whilst the number of Levites according to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4:48">Numbers  4:48</a>, from thirty years old and upward, was very considerable -- some eight thousand five hundred -- yet, as they were presented to God, as they were brought near, and prepared, and presented as a wave-offering to God, He says virtually, 'I would like the number increased', for He immediately says, as you will remember, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#8:24">Numbers  8:24</a>, that they are to enter on the service at the age of twenty-five instead of thirty.<a name=238:9></a> He had already said thirty; that was the primary thought, that the service should be carried on

		J.T.<a name=324:1></a> Yes.<a name=324:2></a> Many of us come together as people go to church, as we say, just dress and prepare for the meeting and walk along looking at what we see with unhallowed eyes, and, of course, when we get to the meeting we are not much above the level of ordinary religious persons, ordinary church-goers, whereas the thought is we should come out of the "dwellings of Jacob", that is, clean places where God has a place, and our movements on the way have in mind that we are material, so to speak, for the tabernacle, and our deportment should be in accord with that, so as entering into the room and taking our places there is dignity attached to us, and we are able to hold ourselves from the outset as linked together in one body.<a name=324:3></a> The organism ought to be in mind, because the Spirit operates according to the way we hold ourselves, according to the intelligence and faith we have.<a name=324:4></a>

		HEAVEN'S INTERVENTIONS

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is in mind, dear brethren, in these scriptures which have been read is to call attention to heaven's interventions in this book.<a name=338:1></a> The book of the Acts is, as you will all know, Luke's second treatise.<a name=338:2></a> The first treatise, setting out in the most touching manner the service of Christ from the evangelical point of view, culminates in the remnant of Israel seen in Bethany, or rather led by Him as far as Bethany; that was not the full end in view, but it was as far as He then in wisdom led them.<a name=338:3></a> Bethany is a very auspicious point, its history disclosing much that was precious to Christ; His leading always culminates in some advantage, even although it may not be finality.<a name=338:4></a> The patience of God requires lodging places for those who are in the way, and, as lovers of God, we do not complain if we are held at a point to fill out some wise, gracious, patient purpose; that is the end of Luke.<a name=338:5></a> Whilst they were led to Bethany, they, in the liberty wherewith Christ sets free, returned to Jerusalem and were in the temple "praising and blessing God".<a name=338:6></a> They were well occupied, for in these lodging places we are not to be idle but well occupied, and in no way can we be better occupied than in praising and blessing God.<a name=338:7></a> The book of Acts, the second treatise, on the other hand, has finality in mind, reflected for the moment in the assembly, not the remnant of Israel, although that is taken account of in the book as it is said, "Such as should be saved" -- the remnant are in mind in that.<a name=338:8></a> But finality is in view, for the assembly is final in the sense of affording a residence for God without reserve; God resides in it without reserve.<a name=338:9></a> It is a residence, too, for His glory and a residence for all His thoughts, for all His counsels
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=339>[Page 339]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and thoughts reside, find a place, in the assembly.<a name=339:1></a> The remnant of Israel was not great enough for that.<a name=339:2></a> According to Ephesians the assembly is the lesson book even for angels, the all-various wisdom of God is seen in it, and that even now.<a name=339:3></a> And then moreover in that same chapter in Ephesians (chapter 3) it is stated that God is to be glorified there -- glory to God "in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".<a name=339:4></a> You can see therefore, dear brethren, that finality in principle is in mind in the assembly; and so in this second treatise the writer speaks of the Lord presenting Himself to the saints -- to the apostles, of course, those whom He had chosen, but to the saints, to whom, as it is said, He presented Himself living.<a name=339:5></a> It would be enough for us, no doubt, if it said He appeared to them: it is also said in great detail by the apostle Paul that He did appear to them, He was seen of them in various circumstances.<a name=339:6></a> But the early verses of the book of the Acts say that He presented <i>Himself</i> living; a very remarkable statement and one to be well noted, because it is the Lord presenting Himself, taking up an attitude toward His own so that they may have every advantage in seeing Him in the sense in which He intended to be seen, that is, as living, but as living after He suffered.<a name=339:7></a> He is presented by Luke before He suffered and after; after He suffered He is presented living, but not in the sense of living as He was here in the flesh, but in a wholly new condition, a condition and a life which entered into the constitution of the assembly and the material to form it, for the tabernacle is to be a greater and more perfect one, not of this creation, as it is stated in Hebrews.<a name=339:8></a> It is of material that is not of this creation; it is a new creation; Christ is the pattern for that, He is the beginning of the creation of God; whether we look at it as it is materially or spiritually, He is the beginning of it.<a name=339:9></a> He is not part of it -- we must never admit the thought that He is

		part of the creation -- He is the beginning of it, for the new man is created "according to the image of him that has created him" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:10">Colossians  3:10</a>) -- created in full knowledge, and the Creator there is Christ.<a name=340:1></a> So that it is Christ presented as the pattern of the material that should form this great building, the assembly.<a name=340:2></a> And, in order to fill the thought out, Luke continues to say that the Lord was assembled with them, He assembled with them; He was not only the pattern of the material, for it is a question of persons who have suffered, but who live after having suffered.<a name=340:3></a> But He is not only the pattern of that, but He is the pattern of conduct in the assembly, of service in it, so that He was assembled with them -- not they with Him -- meaning that He would take part in the position with that great assembly, as I may say, the first one properly after the Lord rose -- being assembled with them.<a name=340:4></a> So that you can see that in the second treatise the outlook is the assembly -- other things come in, of course, the wonderful patience of God in waiting on Israel, for instance -- but that is the great end in view in this treatise.<a name=340:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, that being so, dear brethren, what we should spiritually expect is that the Lord Jesus having gone up into heaven, as we are told He did in chapter 1, there should be heavenly intervention.<a name=340:6></a> Surely there must be!<a name=340:7></a> The object of His heart is here on earth, that for which He gave Himself is here on earth, His eyes are on it; He "loved the assembly", we are told, "and has delivered himself up for it" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a>) There must, therefore, be interventions, and in these interventions, heavenly impressions, reminders that 'Your place is not down here; your place is up there' -- that would be the reminder.<a name=340:8></a> The Lord would say, 'I know where you are; you are in the world; you are where I have been; you are where I suffered, and I am not forgetting you; I know all about it' -- and hence these interventions.<a name=340:9></a> We are kept, as it were, on the

		qui vive of something to follow -- we should be, dear brethren; the movements of heaven come in to remind us that 'This is not your resting-place.<a name=341:1></a> You are there just for a moment for wise purposes; you have to suffer in that scene, to testify in it, but it is not your place'.<a name=341:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first great intervention is in chapter 2.<a name=341:3></a> Of course there is much more in it than I can undertake to speak of tonight.<a name=341:4></a> I have only one thought in what I am now presenting, and that is heavenly intervention, not as a mere historic matter, but as having a present bearing, that there is such a thing as heaven intervening, and, in doing so, it is to remind us that this is not our place, we belong elsewhere.<a name=341:5></a> "Where I am ye also may be" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:3">John  14:3</a>), ye must be, ye shall be -- that is what the Lord said.<a name=341:6></a> That would surely never be forgotten by those to whom it was said.<a name=341:7></a> He said, "In my Father's house there are many abodes" -- He would cover the extent of the Father's domain, the Father's house; but "I go", He says, "to prepare you a place".<a name=341:8></a> It seems to me that in His remarks to them in that passage, He assumes that they would expect something like this; He says, "Were it not so, I had told you", as much as to say, 'You have had such a thought in your mind and you are not to be disappointed'.<a name=341:9></a> No spiritual instincts will be disappointed; however vague, they will always be gratified.<a name=341:10></a> So He says, "Were it not so, I had told you" as if they had expected they would have a special place and that He said that was in His mind.<a name=341:11></a> Why, He says, "the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:27">John  16:27</a>) -- what a comforting thought that is.<a name=341:12></a> And so you will have a special place; there is a special place for you; and lest this should be forgotten or the thought disappear or weaken in any way, heaven is intervening.<a name=341:13></a> Now the first great intervention was when Jesus went up.<a name=341:14></a> As you will remember, there were two men at the ascension

		clothed in white, and the disciples were on Olivet beholding the Lord as He went up.<a name=342:1></a> A cloud had received Him out of their sight and they evidently kept looking up, but the men said, 'He is coming back; why do you stand looking up?<a name=342:2></a>' -- that is, they would be adjusted as to this -- "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven".<a name=342:3></a> Note the word 'manner' -- He went up, they beholding Him, they are not to lose anything.<a name=342:4></a> You say, 'Well, what does that matter?<a name=342:5></a> that is a mere trifle'.<a name=342:6></a> It is not a trifle -- "They beholding him" -- they saw the movement; it was the movement of ascension, a movement we are to understand, for we are to ascend too; that is, we are to be taken up; and the Lord is to come in like manner.<a name=342:7></a> And now that He is taken out of their sight, the faith period has begun, but <i>heaven is to come in</i>.<a name=342:8></a> I wonder if we understand these things; have we had any experience of heaven coming in either in sound, or in rushing mighty wind, or in the way of light, or in the way of a vessel?<a name=342:9></a> These things are to be apprehended spiritually, they are the great features I have in mind: first, the sound, the power; then the light; and then the substance.<a name=342:10></a> Veritable substance comes down from heaven.<a name=342:11></a> There can be no dwelling place of God here aside from this, it is a question of what is in heaven brought down.<a name=342:12></a> But the first thing, dear brethren, is the sound from heaven.<a name=342:13></a>

		The next thing -- and I suppose the order is right morally -- is an intervention in the way of light.<a name=345:3></a> What I have spoken of refers to the Spirit in the great general features of His presence here; but there is, added to that, the thought of a light out of heaven.<a name=345:4></a> We must always be ready for any movement from heaven in the way of additional light; not that the thing is not complete in one sense, but there is this constant intervention from heaven in the way of light, and it gradually becomes clearer, because in the third account we get there is increase in the quality of the light.<a name=345:5></a> Not that it was not the same light at the beginning; it is a question of our apprehension.<a name=345:6></a> How often it is some thought comes; it is not very clear, but it is there.<a name=345:7></a> Why is it not clear?<a name=345:8></a> Because <i>I</i> am not clear, because of some clouding principle in me that God has to remove; and I have to be brought to it.<a name=345:9></a> Let us be brought to it, let us not throw a thing aside because we do not understand it.<a name=345:10></a> Maybe the thing will become clear, and clearer and still clearer, until it shines round about us and we will call it "a light above the brightness of the sun".<a name=345:11></a> How affecting that is, when the thing becomes so clear and brilliant that we are able to describe it as above any natural light, above the brightness of the sun.<a name=345:12></a> That is going on, dear brethren, in a small way, of course, for we are not in such times as these, but the assembly is the same to the Lord as it was then, and He is constantly intervening and causing light to shine round about us.<a name=345:13></a> We may say, it shone round about Paul -- so it did, and that is the first thought of it -- but it shone round about all who were with him.<a name=345:14></a> I believe that is the thought.<a name=345:15></a> Some

		Then another thing, dear brethren, is that in this second intervention, we have the thought of the saints being something peculiar that had not been disclosed before, that is Christ's body.<a name=346:7></a> The light is progressive, and in this case the very saints who heard the sound in chapter 2 are now to be regarded as Christ's body, as Himself indeed -- "Me", He says.<a name=346:8></a> You can see how progressive this is, and how preparatory it is for chapter 10; it is the Lord Himself: the first intervention was in relation to what was there in the way of approval.<a name=346:9></a> The fire did not mean that the flesh was active; it meant that, if it were active, it would take care of it, it was a provision.<a name=346:10></a> There was no reproof in the presence of the fire, it was a provision; it was a question of deference to the one hundred and twenty, or whoever were there.<a name=346:11></a> Heaven is coming in in relation to them; the Spirit of God, a divine Person, can actually rest on them -- It sat on them, it says; it is the public position, it is God identifying Himself with them, but in such a way as to prevent anything that would disturb Him.<a name=346:12></a> But now, Saul was not pleasing to heaven -- he was a violent persecuting man -- it is no question of deference to him; what is in mind is prospective now, it is what is to be.<a name=346:13></a> So this second intervention should be taken in that way, that the Lord comes in from heaven

		I wish to speak this evening, dear brethren, about divine resources, connecting my remarks with the Spirit through whom those resources are available to us.<a name=392:1></a> To suggest briefly how divine resources are mentioned in Scripture, I would allude to such a passage as that in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:12">Romans  10:12</a>, which says, "the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him" -- He is <i>rich</i>.<a name=392:2></a> "He was rich", we are told elsewhere, "yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:9">2 Corinthians  8:9</a>).<a name=392:3></a> That has come about, and now He is "rich unto all that call upon him".<a name=392:4></a> Then we read in the same epistle of "the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:33">Romans  11:33</a>) -- the <i>depth</i> of the riches.<a name=392:5></a> The apostle in writing breaks out into poetic form, God coming into his mind through His relations and dealings and counsels as regards His earthly people, His ways with them as with ourselves, showing us incidentally that God's ways on earth, inclusive of His earthly people, become the occasion of worship.<a name=392:6></a> "O the depth of the riches", he says.<a name=392:7></a> Then we have His riches in mercy, "God", as we are told, "who is rich in mercy" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:4">Ephesians  2:4</a>), and again, "the unsearchable riches of Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>), these indeed being the theme of the glad tidings, showing that they are available in the fullest way, and are presented so that we should lack nothing.<a name=392:8></a> It is the Lord's intent that we should lack nothing: "perfect and complete, lacking in nothing" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:4">James  1:4</a>).<a name=392:9></a> Indeed, so great are these riches that in Colossians we are told that all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily; God is there so as to be available, and that we might exclude from our minds all else.<a name=392:10></a>

		For spiritual independency is what is in mind in that epistle, especially in regard to what appeals to a refined mind.<a name=393:1></a> Great appeal is made to the young at the present time in this respect, and there is considerable flattery in it; "philosophy and vain deceit" aims at flattery.<a name=393:2></a> Take away that side from the education of the world and it loses much that is attractive for the natural mind.<a name=393:3></a> God would impress us that we are independent as there is the depth of wisdom, as the apostle says, and then, that all the fulness of the Godhead dwells, as available to us, in Christ bodily.<a name=393:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to take the liberty of using the product of the seas as illustrative of divine resources, and that is why I have read these scriptures in John and Matthew and Luke.<a name=393:5></a> I believe that these scriptures support the thought, for the seas are symbolic in their fulness -- for we have that word in regard of them -- of the resources of God.<a name=393:6></a> As over against the fulness of the earth, or the creatures upon it which are countable, as we may say, which are known, we have the great sea, as it says in a psalm which is full of creatorial glories, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#104">Psalm  104</a>.<a name=393:7></a> The great sea is said to have "moving things innumerable, living creatures small and great" (verse 25).<a name=393:8></a> No one can make a census of them; indeed the word 'innumerable' would preclude that, but aside from that, the very nature of ocean conditions forbids man determining what is there.<a name=393:9></a> God knows.<a name=393:10></a> But, while the living creatures in the sea are innumerable, they are put under man, as are the land creatures, with a view to the incarnation; nothing is withheld from man s dominion.<a name=393:11></a> Hence we find that in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, man is to have dominion over the fish of the sea.<a name=393:12></a> There was no provision made for them in the ark, and directly the flood passed, God blessed Noah and his sons, and directed that the fear and dread of them should be upon the fish of the sea (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:2">Genesis  9:2</a>).<a name=393:13></a> We can thus

		Well now, I want to show how these resources come to light in these last days, first in regard to the breakdown in the ministry.<a name=395:2></a> The most sorrowful part of church history is the breakdown in the ministry.<a name=395:3></a> The type of it is in Numbers where certain favoured ones of the tribes were linked on with certain Levites, that is, it was a party matter.<a name=395:4></a> The daughters of Zelophehad said, as regards their father, that he had nothing to do with that, and one is thankful to find saints who can say that they avoid party affiliations.<a name=395:5></a> "Our father", they said, ".<a name=395:6></a>.<a name=395:7></a>.<a name=395:8></a> died in his own sin" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:3">Numbers  27:3</a>).<a name=395:9></a> That is, it was an individual matter.<a name=395:10></a> It was bad enough, for he died in it, but it was not as bad as that party matter; he did not die in that party matter extending to the whole camp of Israel, led by Korah, Dathan and Abiram, against Moses and Aaron.<a name=395:11></a> But what is so comforting is that the cloud covered the tent in the presence of all that; God looked after His own interests.<a name=395:12></a> The precious testimony is to be preserved at all costs, and it was.<a name=395:13></a> Whilst the sinners themselves were swallowed up, I only speak of that to show you the full extent of the breakdown of the ministry, and how important it is for those who are in the ministry to avoid party affiliations.<a name=395:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have Peter and John and some five others of the ministers, and Peter said, "I go a fishing".<a name=395:15></a> That is to say, it is a movement among the ministers, and leading ones too, in independency and disregard of what was needed amongst the people of God.<a name=395:16></a> Whilst not dwelling unduly on these great men -- for they were such and blessed of God subsequently -- we have the thing here in principle so as to find a place in John's ministry -- I wish to show how the ministers are recovered through the introduction of

		is understood and taken up in our minds and hearts as we draw together on the first day of the week, and whether too, as coming thus together there is the sense of being pleasing to the Lord in our footsteps and in the manner of the wending of our ways to the place of assembly.<a name=401:1></a> We believe but little in the delight with which heaven takes account of it, and all is in the power of the anointing.<a name=401:2></a> Think of those two, for instance, recorded in this chapter.<a name=401:3></a> They had gone to Emmaus.<a name=401:4></a> What their footsteps would be to the Lord and to heaven as they were going back!<a name=401:5></a> How different from what they were as they were going the other way!<a name=401:6></a> "What manner of communications", said the Lord, "are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<a name=401:7></a>".<a name=401:8></a> The Lord does not look for doleful countenances and hesitating steps as we draw to the place of assembly.<a name=401:9></a> "I was glad", said one, "when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#122:1">Psalm  122:1</a>).<a name=401:10></a> The steps are to be in the power of the anointing, and in the power of the incentive of what is before us -- to be "in assembly", the most august expression you can get in the Scriptures.<a name=401:11></a> It is going through to heaven.<a name=401:12></a> Hence, those two, we are told, "returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them".<a name=401:13></a> Every movement would be delightful to heaven as they moved back that day.<a name=401:14></a>

		Now, as in assembly, the Lord comes in.<a name=401:15></a> The doors are not shut to Him.<a name=401:16></a> It is His assembly, and He comes in, and He says, What have you got <i>here</i> to eat?<a name=401:17></a> It is not only, What have you got?<a name=401:18></a> but <i>here</i> -- in the assembly really.<a name=401:19></a> How He loves it!<a name=401:20></a> The Lord loves that thought of it.<a name=401:21></a> It is the joy of His heart to have part in it, and "they gave him", we are told, "a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb" -- the broiled fish first.<a name=401:22></a> Now, I think the Lord would say, as it were, They have got on to the thought.<a name=401:23></a> There are the resources of God available

		I think you will see in what I have said, that the resources of God are available for us by the Spirit, the Spirit being here, not to leave us, but to stay with us under the title of Comforter or Paraclete, who takes care of us and reminds us of what should be, and helps us to provide what should be, and brings in from these infinite resources of God what is needed in its living freshness, so that the Lord can come and have His part with us.<a name=402:18></a> May He grant it!<a name=402:19></a>
