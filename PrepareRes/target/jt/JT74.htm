		MATTHEW'S GOSPEL IN VIEW OF THE ASSEMBLY (1)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:5></a> It is hoped to make certain special selections from this gospel, covering broadly the whole book up to chapter 26, so that there may be a clear view by the help of the Lord as to the gospel itself, especially the place the assembly has in it and how the Lord's supper enters into it too.<a name=1:6></a> So that we need to give attention to what has been written and what has just been read, that as we proceed, the young may follow what is in mind and become instructed; because it is a time for the young; it is the learning time -- hence these early verses.<a name=1:7></a> One thing that comes to mind is the fact that the kingship of Christ comes into evidence at once; the word is, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham".<a name=1:8></a> That is, it is the King, "Son of David", first, and then "Son of Abraham".<a name=1:9></a> And so the prevalence of references to such matters as kingship and governorship will come into our minds in this book and we shall have to follow them to see why they should be there, especially the word 'governor'; that is, that the idea of rule is predominating.<a name=1:10></a> So that the king is in mind at once, that is, David; not Abraham first, but David the king.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=1:12></a> One able to give effect to the promises, would you say?<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:14></a> Just so, but to be authoritative too; one who can speak with authority.<a name=1:15></a>

		J.H.<a name=1:16></a>P.<a name=1:17></a> So that the angel refers even to Joseph as son of David.<a name=1:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:1></a> Just so; I think we shall do well to pay attention to that.<a name=2:2></a> In New York recently we have had the subject of manhood and we came on to David as part of the subject of manhood.<a name=2:3></a> David and Samuel were taken together as they represent a peculiar quality in manhood, and especially as David himself is a type of the Lord Jesus, a peculiar type of the Lord Jesus.<a name=2:4></a> God said, "I have found David .<a name=2:5></a>.<a name=2:6></a>.<a name=2:7></a> a man after my heart, who shall do all my will", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:22">Acts  13:22</a>).<a name=2:8></a>

		Ques.<a name=2:14></a> Would you tell us why the book starts with "the generation of Jesus Christ"?<a name=2:15></a> Would you say this has new creation in view?<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:17></a> It is the generation of Jesus Christ, and then as we said before, "Son of David, Son of Abraham".<a name=2:18></a> That is to say, the idea of generation has to be noted to start with, so that it begins with Christ Himself.<a name=2:19></a> The word 'generation' begins in the Old Testament in the second chapter of Genesis and it runs along to about twelve references.<a name=2:20></a> Now it appears here again, and it is Christ that is in mind; it is the generation of Jesus Christ.<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=2:22></a> Would it be right at this point to speak of Him as "the root and offspring of David"?<a name=2:23></a> (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>).<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:25></a> Quite so, the root is His deity, and the offspring is His manhood.<a name=2:26></a> The bright and morning star is the illuminating thought that runs throughout, the whole universe is illuminated with it, "the bright and morning star".<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=2:28></a>S.<a name=2:29></a> Along with the authority there is thought of severity, is there not, which would eliminate from our minds any thought of democracy in the assembly?<a name=2:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:31></a> That is a good word.<a name=2:32></a> The historical reference to all men being created equal is a fallacy; it is not true.<a name=2:33></a> They are not created equal at all.<a name=2:34></a> Therefore

		F.J.<a name=3:3></a>F.<a name=3:4></a> In the feudal system which governed England for a long time the king was supreme; he was the head of the system, and he was supreme.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> Well, the supremacy of a king in England is not very much; but when we are told to be subject "to the king as supreme", who is that (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:13">1 Peter  2:13</a>)?<a name=3:7></a> Peter is referring to someone that represents God in authority.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=3:9></a>W.<a name=3:10></a> Matthew speaks of the Lord's face on the mount, shining as the sun; that seems to be special to Him.<a name=3:11></a> It is supremacy.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=3:13></a>E.<a name=3:14></a> You are stressing the thought of kingship in this chapter.<a name=3:15></a> Are we to come under the authority of this King?<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:17></a> Surely; Matthew has that in mind, the authority that enters into the truth of the assembly; we must have authority to work out the truth of the assembly.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		V.C.<a name=3:19></a>L.<a name=3:20></a> Does kingship coming in so early in the book help us to have right assembly thoughts as seeing the pre-eminence of Christ?<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:22></a> I think the assembly is to support the idea set out in the Lord Jesus.<a name=3:23></a> The assembly is a feminine idea, but it is to support the masculine, the divine thought in manhood.<a name=3:24></a> The divine thought in Scripture is the masculine, and the assembly is the counterpart of it; divine thoughts could not work out without the idea of the feminine.<a name=3:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:26></a> So when Joseph is introduced the generations are immediately brought in: "These are the generations of Jacob.<a name=3:27></a> Joseph .<a name=3:28></a>.<a name=3:29></a>.<a name=3:30></a>" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37:2">Genesis  37:2</a>), linking the generations very prominently with Joseph.<a name=3:31></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		remarkable thing.<a name=4:1></a> Of course the other sons of Jacob were born earlier, most of them, but the generations of Jacob in the mind of the Spirit begin with Joseph, showing that God has His own right which He asserts in certain persons.<a name=4:2></a> He wants to make Joseph a leader in His thoughts in the Scripture, so that He speaks of Joseph and passes by the others.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=4:4></a>S.<a name=4:5></a> What you have just said is, I think, a very important remark as to the masculine side being seen in Christ and the feminine side in the assembly.<a name=4:6></a> Would you say that is the divine thought?<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> Quite so.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.J.<a name=4:10></a>F.<a name=4:11></a> Is that why it says that "Upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir", in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:9">Psalm  45:9</a>?<a name=4:12></a> Does that complete the thought?<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> It is what runs through the Old Testament as to femininity, as to queenship.<a name=4:15></a> Nehemiah says of the king that the queen was beside him and the book of Esther is full of the thought of the queen.<a name=4:16></a> Vashti is set aside to make way for Esther, that is, God's mind must come in, and that is the assembly.<a name=4:17></a> God has His own way of making way for things, and that removes mine; He has no hesitation in setting aside persons if they stand in His way.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=4:19></a>T.<a name=4:20></a> Is the assembly ever in the view of this earth as queen, in the millennium for instance?<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:22></a> I suppose she is; at His right hand, it says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>, "doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir".<a name=4:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=4:24></a>W.<a name=4:25></a> When Pharaoh gave Joseph the name of Zaphnath-paaneah the record is that at the same time he "gave him as wife Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:45">Genesis  41:45</a>).<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:27></a> There is much more made of Asnath than I used to think myself, and I believe many here if they will look into the facts will find that Asnath is much more really in the word and the mind of God than might be thought.<a name=4:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:4></a> Quite so, "the queen also sitting by him" (<a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#2:6">Nehemiah  2:6</a>); that is, she confirmed the whole position.<a name=5:5></a> She did not say anything though, but she was there.<a name=5:6></a>

		J.H.<a name=5:12></a>P.<a name=5:13></a> I was thinking of the three that are mentioned here, and then the fourth, although she only comes in in the name of her husband; but I wondered if the three would set forth suggestions of the assembly as supporting Christ?<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:15></a> And some of them are very questionable characters, outwardly, as you know, but we can take them as they stand.<a name=5:16></a> Why should they be mentioned as they are?<a name=5:17></a> For instance, it says "Thamar", and Thamar would be a questionable character.<a name=5:18></a> Then "Rachab", and "her that had been the wife of Urias".<a name=5:19></a> Will you quote them all, Mr.<a name=5:20></a> P.<a name=5:21></a>?<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=5:23></a>P.<a name=5:24></a> There is Thamar in verse three, and then Rachab and Ruth in verse five; and the fourth is not even given a name, it just says, "David begat Solomon, of her that had been the wife of Urias".<a name=5:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:26></a> She is distinguished in that she had such a husband, that is the idea.<a name=5:27></a> These women have a remarkable place in this genealogy, and why is it that God is disregarding human thoughts and setting them aside to bring in His own thoughts?<a name=5:28></a> This genealogy we might say is full of that sort of thing, that is to say, it is full of the rights of God where human rights or feelings or pretensions have to disappear.<a name=5:29></a> God will set them aside without question, and we may have to face all of this.<a name=5:30></a> We are dealing

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=6:12></a> When you use the word 'assembly', have you in mind what is feminine all the time?<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:14></a> Pretty much.<a name=6:15></a> Of course you might have unconverted people feminine, but we are thinking of what is of God, what God approves.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=6:17></a>T.<a name=6:18></a> In what aspect does the assembly really come in in Matthew?<a name=6:19></a> The Lord brings it in when Peter makes his confession, and He says, "On this rock I will build my assembly", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>).<a name=6:20></a> What aspect of the assembly would that be?<a name=6:21></a> It is not the bridal thought there, is it?<a name=6:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:23></a> Sometimes the neuter takes the place of the feminine, for instance, "hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=6:24></a> We have not 'she' or 'her' there, but "it".<a name=6:25></a> The 'it' is the assembly, but generally speaking the assembly is feminine.<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=6:27></a>W.<a name=6:28></a> So the 'my' in "my assembly", might very well allow the Lord to view it femininely.<a name=6:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:7></a> Yes, quite so; and how we need wisdom in regard of all these matters!<a name=7:8></a> Nathan the prophet intervened and took matters up, and God was so fully with him that he settled the whole matter as to Solomon.<a name=7:9></a> Adonijah said, "I will be king" (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#1:5">1 Kings  1:5</a>), but Nathan intervened and went to Bathsheba and gave her good counsel.<a name=7:10></a> She was not so wise as she might have been.<a name=7:11></a> She is mentioned here in this chapter in Matthew but Nathan had to put her right; he got her to go to the king and put the right man before him; and the whole point here would be that we should proceed as to the right Man, that the right Man may come in.<a name=7:12></a> Bathsheba was a good sort of person in a certain sense but she was mistaken, and foolish too.<a name=7:13></a> She was not a reliable person, but at the same time she is brought in here, and for a good reason undoubtedly, because she had to do with Solomon.<a name=7:14></a> And she was the wife of Urias, she had to do with that man, and he was a great warrior on Jehovah's side.<a name=7:15></a> But we get weakness even with women like Bathsheba, a peculiar kind of weakness.<a name=7:16></a> We have to be on our guard about such weakness, we want the peculiar qualities that are according to God, the qualities of manhood -- because the word 'man' covers woman as well as man.<a name=7:17></a> We want the right quality, the ability to stand for the right.<a name=7:18></a> Eve failed in that, because she listened to Satan; and so we may have the sisters failing seriously if they are not retaining the quality of manhood as

		E.A.<a name=8:11></a>L.<a name=8:12></a> Would you say it is a great lesson that the subjective element must take on the truth through the prophetic element?<a name=8:13></a> That is, Nathan was used to adjust Bathsheba so that Solomon had his right place.<a name=8:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=20:1></a> It is a feature of Matthew that mountains are brought forward in relation to the subjects of the book.<a name=20:2></a> There are seven of them.<a name=20:3></a> This in chapter 5 is the first one.<a name=20:4></a> They run on to the end of the book and the last one is where the Lord appears in Galilee to the disciples.<a name=20:5></a> In this chapter the Lord is said to have gone up into a mountain; it says, "But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain"; the article 'the' is characteristic there.<a name=20:6></a> "And having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them".<a name=20:7></a> What has been said will help us, I think, as to the objective in this chapter, namely the exhortation in the last verse, "Be <i>ye</i> therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect".<a name=20:8></a> It is as if there is available to us in the instruction the power of inwardness in which to develop in the truth and in what is acceptable to God and effective in the administration, because it is a question of administration in this chapter.<a name=20:9></a> It is said of David that he encouraged himself in the Lord his God, meaning that there was inward power to gather himself up in difficult times and adjust himself, adjust <i>himself</i>; not to wait for God to do it, but to do it himself.<a name=20:10></a> I thought therefore that what has been remarked should govern our consideration of this chapter.<a name=20:11></a> It is what we may call the mount of legislation.<a name=20:12></a> There is a mountain called the mount of transfiguration, but here it is the mount of legislation; not simply that we are transfigured but that there is power in us to adjust ourselves.<a name=20:13></a> In this mountain of legislation things are to be put right with authority.<a name=20:14></a> There is ability granted to us to put ourselves right.<a name=20:15></a> We are to be called the sons of

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=21:5></a> Just so, because everything has to go through; nothing has been written down in a haphazard or light way but in a true way; that is to say, the things have to happen.<a name=21:6></a> Nothing shall pass away; He says, "One tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled".<a name=21:7></a> Everything must go through that is in the divine mind.<a name=21:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=21:20></a> Exactly, that is just what you get here: "But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him".<a name=21:21></a> They came to Him, that is the principle of it.<a name=21:22></a> That is to say they are moved, they are governed by what He does.<a name=21:23></a> And of course that enters into assembly conduct on our part; because Matthew is the assembly book and as of the assembly we have to learn from it.<a name=21:24></a> This matter of coming to the Lord is on elevated ground; it is not, as we get in Luke, on the level where the Lord met His disciples, but here it is elevated ground for legislative purposes.<a name=21:25></a>

		A.N.<a name=24:4></a>W.<a name=24:5></a> Matthew's remark at the close of this series of chapters ending with chapter 7 is, "And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as having authority, and not as their scribes".<a name=24:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=24:7></a>S.<a name=24:8></a> The disciples do not say anything; it is not a two-way matter, is it?<a name=24:9></a> I was just looking through this section closing at the end of chapter 7, and I do not notice that the disciples say anything; they do not make any comments or ask any questions.<a name=24:10></a> Is there something in that?<a name=24:11></a> Our meetings today are more of a conversational character, but that does not mean that there is any less authority in the ministry because of it?<a name=24:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:13></a> So in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, although the apostle himself discoursed in service before the breaking of bread, yet at the end of that section you have him speaking conversationally, and that of course greatly adds to what we are talking about.<a name=24:14></a> There is conversational ministry in which we are engaged now, as well as discoursing ministry, which our brother will take on this evening when he gives an address.<a name=24:15></a> But now we are engaged conversationally, which is very important; I do not know of any other ministry in the last days that is so effective as conversational ministry.<a name=24:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=24:17></a>S.<a name=24:18></a> While we are free and happy to speak, we must not be so active as to hinder the Spirit from bringing out what He has in mind.<a name=24:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=25:1></a> Another thing we have to consider in this matter of ministry is that we have to take account of gift.<a name=25:2></a> It is said of the Lord that "having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:8">Ephesians  4:8</a>).<a name=25:3></a> Really the question of gifts has to come in; not that one would be occupied with any ability that any one of us may have, but there is such a thing as gift, and gift is a question of power, of gifts given unto men, the power descending from God to men.<a name=25:4></a> The wonderful fact is that the Lord Jesus is gone beyond all the heavens in order, that the gifts should come thence, which is one of the most remarkable statements that can be made, that He is beyond all the heavens, and the gifts are from there.<a name=25:5></a>

		L.W.<a name=29:3></a> Why does the Lord use the expression, 'the kingdom of the heavens' so often in this chapter, rather than 'the kingdom of God'?<a name=29:4></a> Later on He uses the latter but not here.<a name=29:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=29:6></a> The kingdom of God is in a sense what we call moral, just moral.<a name=29:7></a> The kingdom of the heavens is referring to elevation, to moral elevation.<a name=29:8></a> The significance of the term, the kingdom of God, is that it is the moral side of the kingdom, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is the elevated side, which is important too; we cannot say that the elevated side is not moral, but the point is not that, but that it is elevation.<a name=29:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=29:10></a>W.<a name=29:11></a> I thought perhaps Romans would help there, in that the kingdom of God is in relation to the Spirit, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is in relation to the King in heaven.<a name=29:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=29:13></a> That is true, too.<a name=29:14></a> I am sure that is good.<a name=29:15></a>

		L.W.<a name=29:16></a> And later on in chapter 6:33 of this same book the Lord says, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness", which stands in relation to what is moral too.<a name=29:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=29:18></a> The distinction between what is moral and what is elevated is perfectly clear to me; that the moral side is, as it were, the level of things here below, whereas the elevated side is what is upward, what is uplifted.<a name=29:19></a> The word 'heaven' has the significance of what is uplifted, it suggests lifted-up things; the kingdom of the heavens has that character, whereas the kingdom of God is on the level of the earth here, and it has therefore the moral idea.<a name=29:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=30:6></a> That is the idea running right through the book, the idea of mountains; the last one is at Galilee where the disciples are to meet the Lord.<a name=30:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=30:8></a> Why does the Lord bring in the idea of the heavenly Father so much in these few chapters in Matthew?<a name=30:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=30:20></a> It shows how nearly we come to the idea of sonship.<a name=30:21></a> We read in the epistle to the Hebrews of the Father bringing many sons to glory, and we can see the nearness to it here, the proximity to it in the makers of peace; they are very near to glory, they are making for glory, "Blessed the peace-makers".<a name=30:22></a>

		E.A.<a name=31:3></a>L.<a name=31:4></a> It says in verse 17 of chapter 4, "From that time began Jesus to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh".<a name=31:5></a> Repentance there is the prerequisite for taking on these blessings, is it not?<a name=31:6></a> It is progressive in that sense.<a name=31:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		V.C.<a name=31:10></a>L.<a name=31:11></a> Is this at all akin to the truth brought out in Romans?<a name=31:12></a> The book of Romans ends with the suggestion of the mystery; and here in chapter 5 there are suggestions of the wonderful truth of the whole assembly just hidden away, as it were, in what the Lord says.<a name=31:13></a> Is it therefore a question of educating personnel?<a name=31:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=37:11></a> We might as well touch on that a little now.<a name=37:12></a> The passage from verse 43 reads: "Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy.<a name=37:13></a> But <i>I</i> say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you, that ye may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust.<a name=37:14></a> For if ye should love those who love you, what reward have ye?<a name=37:15></a> Do not also the tax-gatherers the same?<a name=37:16></a> And if ye should salute your brethren only, what do ye extraordinary?<a name=37:17></a> Do not also the Gentiles the same?<a name=37:18></a> Be <i>ye</i> therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect".<a name=37:19></a>

		MATTHEW'S GOSPEL IN VIEW OF THE ASSEMBLY (4)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:13">Matthew  16:13</a> - 28
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=62:1></a> We have now come to the thought we had before us in taking up the gospel of Matthew, that is, the matter of the assembly.<a name=62:2></a> Many questions will arise in our minds as to the place that Peter has in this gospel, and the place he has in relation to the assembly, because it is unique in both.<a name=62:3></a> So that in verse 13 the Lord raises the whole question with His disciples as to His Person.<a name=62:4></a> We notice also the position -- Caesarea-Philippi; the very names indicate the gentile links, and yet the links are decidedly Jewish nevertheless.<a name=62:5></a> If the Lord would bring out the matter of the assembly, the Father has to say to it; the Lord would bring that out and also the additional thought of "<i>I</i> also", and then the Lord would bring out too the place that Peter has, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.<a name=62:6></a> And <i>I</i> also", the additional thought of "<i>I</i> also", "I say unto thee that <i>thou</i> art Peter".<a name=62:7></a> That is to say the Lord would bring out what Peter was; not <i>who</i> he was but <i>what</i> he was; he was "Peter", not simply a name but a condition, meaning stone, a stone of the building.<a name=62:8></a> This is, as I remarked, really the crux of the whole matter that is now before us, the matter of the assembly and who builds it, and what Peter is -- a stone, the material of which it is formed.<a name=62:9></a> It is not who he is, as I said, but what he is -- he is a stone.<a name=62:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=65:22></a> Quite so, the "also" means that.<a name=65:23></a> The Father had said something to Peter, and now the Lord would say something, and what the Lord says to Peter refers to what he is in quality; that is to say, he is a stone, a stone in the building.<a name=65:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=90:1></a> I think it is understood that we should look at the Lord's supper at this reading in the way in which it appears in the gospel of Matthew.<a name=90:2></a> There should be some regularity in approaching this subject, which has been much in mind during the morning as we partook of the Supper.<a name=90:3></a> It is hoped that these scriptures will yield what is needed as to the matter in hand, a subject found elsewhere of course in the gospels, but to be regarded here especially in the light of the fact that in Matthew we have no record of the ascension of the Lord Jesus to heaven.<a name=90:4></a> So that we need to take that into consideration -- as to why it is that there is no ascension, and yet there is so much about the assembly; as if the Lord would confine us to the earth, as it were, in our thoughts about the truth in the gospel of Matthew.<a name=90:5></a> Yesterday we had chapter 16, which we scarcely exhausted.<a name=90:6></a> It treats of the subject before us so that we might just look at it again for a moment, reading verses 13 to 20.<a name=90:7></a> "But when Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi, he demanded of his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am?<a name=90:8></a> And they said, Some, John the baptist; and others, Elias; and others again, Jeremias or one of the prophets.<a name=90:9></a> He says to them, But <i>ye</i>, who do ye say that I am?<a name=90:10></a> And Simon Peter answering said, <i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=90:11></a> And Jesus answering said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.<a name=90:12></a> And <i>I</i> also, I say unto thee that <i>thou</i> art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it.<a name=90:13></a> And I will give to thee

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought it worth while to revert again to chapter 16 because of the peculiar place that Peter holds in service in the ministry.<a name=91:3></a> That is to say, Peter answers the Lord's question in a way that shows how the Father had spoken to him; and then the Lord says, "<i>I</i> also", meaning that there were two divine Persons speaking.<a name=91:4></a> The first is the Father, and then the Lord Himself, "<i>I</i> also", and Peter is in mind.<a name=91:5></a> The hope is that what we have read in chapter 26 will enlarge on this.<a name=91:6></a> The Lord's supper implies fellowship, so that it is said "as they were eating".<a name=91:7></a> The word proceeds to say, "And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken the bread and blessed, broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<a name=91:8></a> And having taken the cup and given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.<a name=91:9></a> For this is my blood, that of the new covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins.<a name=91:10></a> But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new" -- that is in a new way -- "with you in the kingdom of my Father.<a name=91:11></a> And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives".<a name=91:12></a> That is a beautiful finish in linking all this up with the beginning of the Acts, and how the apostles are brought in there in view of all that is to come out in that book.<a name=91:13></a> But now the thought is to begin with Peter, and then to proceed with the Lord's supper itself, involving eating.<a name=91:14></a>

		GOD'S THOUGHT OF A CITY AS SEEN IN JERUSALEM (1)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:25">Luke  2:25</a> - 38
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=117:1></a> What is generally in mind is the idea of a city, and that thought as set out in Jerusalem.<a name=117:2></a> We may look at Jerusalem first as seen in the gospel of Luke, how it is presented there; and then as seen in the book of Revelation.<a name=117:3></a> The same name is used in both places, only in Luke it is 'Jerusalem' simply but in the book of Revelation it is 'new Jerusalem'.<a name=117:4></a> That is the thought one would like the brethren to get hold of at this time, the Spirit helping us, the thought of Jerusalem and how it is carried forward from the old to the new and into eternity: "new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>).<a name=117:5></a> There is no city mentioned more, perhaps, in the Scriptures than Jerusalem.<a name=117:6></a> But the thought is that we might get the idea of it as presented peculiarly in Luke, and then link it on with Revelation; so that the principal scriptures before us now are these two books.<a name=117:7></a> First we might see how Luke's references to Jerusalem are regarded by the Spirit of God, especially as seen here in this man who was in Jerusalem, as it says, "a man in Jerusalem".<a name=117:8></a> That is the thought that perhaps God would place in our minds; not simply the idea of Jerusalem, because that was very common; but of "a man in Jerusalem".<a name=117:9></a> And then what it says of him is the next thing: "whose name was Simeon; and this man was just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel" -- notice that, he is awaiting something, and it is not anything ordinary -- "and the Holy Spirit was upon him.<a name=117:10></a> And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit" (notice the place the Holy Spirit has with this man), "it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's

		Christ".<a name=118:1></a> And then again, "he came in the Spirit" -- notice that; it is a question of the Spirit -- "he came in the Spirit into the temple".<a name=118:2></a> Many had gone into the temple, but perhaps no one so far had gone in by the Spirit -- "and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law, <i>he</i> received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples; a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel".<a name=118:3></a> In this passage we get, I think, the two ideas combined, Jerusalem, and the Spirit as linked up with it; and that will carry us through to the book of Revelation where we shall see the holy city "coming down out of the heaven from God".<a name=118:4></a> I think the brethren will agree that in all this there will be food or material for us for this season to help us in the truth; and that is what we need -- to be helped in the truth.<a name=118:5></a> And as referring to what we said about man, I was thinking particularly of the Lord Jesus as gone into heaven; it is not simply that He has come down and accomplished redemption, but He is "gone into heaven", He is there now, "angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:22">1 Peter  3:22</a>).<a name=118:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=119:7></a> Great Babylon, the most terrible thing to be considered as to evil.<a name=119:8></a> We shall come to that in the book of Revelation; or rather, we shall come to the idea of the heavenly city, the heavenly Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, because we are going to centre our thoughts, not in the idea of a city merely, but in the idea of Jerusalem, because that is going through.<a name=119:9></a>

		C.A.<a name=119:10></a>M.<a name=119:11></a> You were stressing the thought of the Spirit in connection with Simeon, that it says "the Holy Spirit was upon him", and that "it was .<a name=119:12></a>.<a name=119:13></a>.<a name=119:14></a> communicated to him by the Holy Spirit", and then that "he came in the Spirit into the temple".<a name=119:15></a> Would you say something about the difference between the Holy Spirit being upon him and his coming in the Spirit into the temple?<a name=119:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=121:11></a> That brings up a great deal because the idea of man is a relatively recent thought with God.<a name=121:12></a> We can tell how old the being is historically, but as regards the angels we cannot tell, nor can we tell how many there are.<a name=121:13></a> God keeps things in mystery and He has a right to do it.<a name=121:14></a> He keeps the idea of angels in mystery, but He has them; as it says, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?<a name=121:15></a>" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:14">Hebrews  1:14</a>), showing how important man is.<a name=121:16></a> Then as to what has just been said, that God has not given up His idea about man, of course He has not.<a name=121:17></a> He has only just begun, you might say.<a name=121:18></a> Going back to Genesis, we might say that man was first mentioned by Moses: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>).<a name=121:19></a> The man is the masculine, he is mentioned first, but the woman is included; it is a plural idea because the same word covers both man and woman.<a name=121:20></a> There are several words used for 'man', God is not confined to simply one word to convey the thought.<a name=121:21></a> I am greatly hoping that we shall get something in Luke about Jerusalem.<a name=121:22></a> It is seen in a comely, holy way in Luke and I confine myself to

		GOD'S THOUGHT OF A CITY AS SEEN IN JERUSALEM (2)

		J.T.<a name=132:1></a> The theme of Jerusalem is still in mind in this section of Luke.<a name=132:2></a> As we had it already today, we are not concerned so much about the general idea of a city or the general idea of Jerusalem, but the view of Jerusalem in the Scriptures which reaches its culmination in the book of Revelation; we are considering the thought of Jerusalem as it is carried through into eternal conditions.<a name=132:3></a> There it is called <i>new</i> Jerusalem.<a name=132:4></a> This chapter has all that in mind, and the breaking of bread enters into it; also the matter of some of them going away from the city and the Lord following them up and directing them back.<a name=132:5></a> They come back, showing that the city was in their minds.<a name=132:6></a> We can see in our hymns already sung today how it is in the mind of the Spirit of God in the service of God.<a name=132:7></a> No other city has had such a place as Jerusalem.<a name=132:8></a> We have already been speaking of "Jerusalem above", and singing that 'Jerusalem's in view'; so that it is clearly a thought of the Spirit of God in relation to the service of God, and the brethren are using it to that end.<a name=132:9></a> The point now would be to confirm us more fully as to it; and then ultimately, if the Lord spare us, we shall have further thoughts as to it in the book of Revelation where it is viewed as a city coming down from God out of heaven.<a name=132:10></a> It is indigenous to heaven, it is not an earthly thought at all, it is a heavenly thought, which is remarkable.<a name=132:11></a> But the name is so frequently used in the world, very much especially in recent times, that among us it should be reserved for the greatest heavenly thoughts, and that <i>we</i> have to do with these heavenly thoughts, we belong to them.<a name=132:12></a> Indeed we belong to Jerusalem too in that

		J.T.<a name=134:10></a> That is what will eventually happen, and so the apostle speaks about apostasy.<a name=134:11></a> At Thessalonica there was a question as to whether the day of the Lord had come, but it had not come.<a name=134:12></a> That day shall not come, says the apostle, unless there come a falling away first, and the word 'falling away' really means apostasy.<a name=134:13></a> Falling away is apostasy.<a name=134:14></a> So it is very clear that the apostasy is still ahead of us, a most terrible thought, but the Lord has encouraged us as to it in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a> in regard of Philadelphia; "<i>I</i> also will keep thee", He says, "out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=134:15></a> Undoubtedly the Lord means the apostasy by the "hour of trial" that is coming.<a name=134:16></a> Unconverted people, people that are not interested in the truth, have a certain dread in thinking about those things; but we can face them, and if we have to suffer, let us suffer.<a name=134:17></a> The Lord says He will keep us out of the great tribulation, and we

		J.T.<a name=171:8></a> That is a very good suggestion; and God is providing wonderfully for us, as we have already pointed out, in the number of revisions there have been of the hymn book.<a name=171:9></a> The most recent one -- the 1932 revision -- has served well; but now the spiritual thought has come up to go further, and I believe the Lord will help us and make the service of song fuller than ever it has been with the addition of singing to the Spirit Himself, that the Spirit should be fully recognised.<a name=171:10></a> So that in all this there will be yield for God.<a name=171:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=199:1></a> The occurrence of the number twelve in this chapter is to be specially noted, as pointing to administrative power.<a name=199:2></a> The numeral implies the idea of administration, but in a peculiar manner as set out in this chapter.<a name=199:3></a> Perhaps in no part of Scripture is it set out more fully.<a name=199:4></a> It belongs to a series of symbols that prevail in the book of Revelation which is a book of symbols.<a name=199:5></a> Unless we understand symbols we cannot understand the book, but they are made very plain to us, the Spirit of God being here to help us.<a name=199:6></a> We have ears to hear and eyes to see; the eyes enter into it, but especially the ears, as the book of Revelation indicates; "He that hath an ear, let him hear".<a name=199:7></a> Therefore as the light comes to us at this time we should have our ears and eyes active, but especially our ears.<a name=199:8></a> The word 'see' is much used in the book, but the ears are especially stressed; as if God would leave no loophole for us in our natural way of thinking to indulge ourselves at a time like this; time is too precious to do that.<a name=199:9></a> There is no time for indulging our natural sight and feelings; it is a time for keeping our ears and eyes open to hear and see and get the truth.<a name=199:10></a> And first we should notice the remarkable word in verse 9, "And there came one of the seven angels which had had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife".<a name=199:11></a> One is peculiarly impressed with the great prevalence of marital touches, marital suggestions; they find a place in the relations of Christ and the assembly; the whole marital idea finally converges on Christ and the assembly; all else disappears.<a name=199:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=200:11></a> It is difficult to say that there is, at any rate in this book.<a name=200:12></a> We might go back to the Old Testament and carry forward some thoughts, but it looks to me as if the marital idea finally centres in Christ and the assembly.<a name=200:13></a> That is what I understand: Christ referring to the masculine side, and the assembly to the feminine side.<a name=200:14></a> I am not so sure that we can work out anything more than that in the whole Bible, because the assembly has the prime place in relation to Christ maritally.<a name=200:15></a> I am not so sure that Israel comes much into it; I think the Spirit of God is reserving it all for the assembly; that is the great thought of God, the great thought of the Lord, Christ and the assembly.<a name=200:16></a> We can of course refer to many references in the Old Testament, but then the question is whether these are not reserved finally for Christ and the assembly.<a name=200:17></a> Do you follow what I am saying?<a name=200:18></a>

		THE MINISTRY OF ELISHA IN ITS PRACTICAL VALUE (1)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#19:19">1 Kings  19:19</a> - 21; <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2:9">2 Kings  2:9</a> - 22
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=225:1></a> It is well to keep in mind in these public meetings that the ministry is cumulative, that is, all that proceeds from God takes form in others, maybe two, three or four being involved in it; and the point is that what next proceeds from God should be in accord in those involved with what has gone before.<a name=225:2></a> So these two prophets are taken up to show how everything proceeds from God; how the instrumentalities He may use are to be in accord with Himself in the sense of unity.<a name=225:3></a> There is to be unity and order in what a servant does.<a name=225:4></a> There has been encouragement in relation to the word in Great Britain recently, in the gospel of Matthew being divided into two parts; the first part being taken up in the meetings in Edinburgh, and the second part in London; the same subject divided into two parts.<a name=225:5></a> And God blessed the matter.<a name=225:6></a> So now we have these two servants, two great prophets.<a name=225:7></a> The first is Elijah and he has great distinction in the New Testament, and has been referred to often; and then Elisha, a counterpart, a continuation of Elijah, because it is so.<a name=225:8></a> Elijah is the more drastic and severe but Elisha is the more gracious, which is a great matter, that we should have a gracious minister and that we should take part in grace ourselves, every one of us, that we should have part in what is gracious.<a name=225:9></a> "The God of all grace" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:10">1 Peter  5:10</a>) is one title of God, and then He is the God of glory as well; but we are dealing now with grace.<a name=225:10></a> So the thought is to continue with Elisha and to see how God had ordered Elijah to select him, to select Elisha the prophet instead of himself; that is to say, Elijah has in this first passage given way to God and given way to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=226>[Page 226]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		another to take his place.<a name=226:1></a> Sometimes we may be displaced, those of us who are serving, but at the same time we are to accept in grace what is done; we are not to be jealous or envious of one another, but to do everything in humility and grace.<a name=226:2></a> So that Elijah is directed of God to choose Elisha to be prophet in his stead, and we can see there is unity in the affections of the two prophets, there is no rivalry whatever.<a name=226:3></a> This is a great point for the brethren to imbibe in our hearts and minds, that we are not to be disunited, but that there might be love amongst ourselves.<a name=226:4></a> God knows how to order these things, and He selects these two men and uses one of them to select and to anoint the other.<a name=226:5></a> In fact we are to get the idea that the anointing is connected with them.<a name=226:6></a> We are said to be anointed too; whatever we are as christians is in the power of the anointing or else it is nothing.<a name=226:7></a> It is nothing at all if not in the power of the anointing.<a name=226:8></a> We may think it is and assume to be something, but it is nothing unless in the power of the anointing.<a name=226:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=226:10></a> Does the numeral twelve mentioned in the passage amplify the thoughts of unity and love that you are referring to?<a name=226:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=226:12></a> A very good number; God selected it Himself because evidently it suits Him to effect certain things through it.<a name=226:13></a> Yet God may take away one of us, as the apostles had one taken away from them; and yet they continued in the power of the anointing.<a name=226:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=226:15></a> So that the number twelve is the most divisible of all numbers, and love enters into it in a particular way.<a name=226:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=226:17></a> Another number of equal importance is the number seven.<a name=226:18></a> It is a spiritual number, and carries spiritual thoughts.<a name=226:19></a> We have been around the circuit recently with these special meetings; we began at Detroit and we were recently at Chicago,

		and now we are here in Toronto; presently we expect to be in Council Bluffs.<a name=227:1></a> As we move from place to place God is carrying on in the ministry with these numbers; He has taken up what means He will to express His thoughts.<a name=227:2></a> Divine Persons have chosen the number three for Themselves, and it is important to notice that.<a name=227:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a> we have "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=227:4></a> They are all equal; we know that, but at the same time They have taken up places in the economy that They have ordained, which involves that two have taken relatively lower positions.<a name=227:5></a> Each has taken a place by Himself.<a name=227:6></a> It is wonderful that divine Persons should take this attitude!<a name=227:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=227:8></a> Would you say that in the economy these great thoughts of unity and love are set out in divine Persons?<a name=227:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=227:10></a> Just so, the Godhead is involved; but it is remarkable that there are three divine Persons.<a name=227:11></a> Of course we speak of Them with great reverence, as we ought to.<a name=227:12></a> There are three of Them, They have made this choice Themselves, this arrangement Themselves, because clearly divine Persons are equal.<a name=227:13></a> So They have come into time, and we see how Their operations in time are on the principle of these numbers.<a name=227:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=227:15></a>H.<a name=227:16></a> Would the apostle Paul in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26">Acts  26</a>have in mind this calculating in love when he says in verse 7, "to which our whole twelve tribes serving incessantly day and night hope to arrive"?<a name=227:17></a> Was that the calculation of love?<a name=227:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=228:7></a>S.<a name=228:8></a> I thought the mending was actually <i>after</i> He appeared to the apostles, that in the scripture quoted Matthias had not yet been selected; yet it does not say it was to the eleven He appeared, but to the twelve, as if He regarded them as complete.<a name=228:9></a> Subsequently they cast lots, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven.<a name=228:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.K.<a name=228:11></a>C.<a name=228:12></a> Why is it said that Elisha was with the twelfth yoke of oxen?<a name=228:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=228:14></a> I think he was there in heart.<a name=228:15></a> The place a man takes is very often God's way of showing what a man is.<a name=228:16></a> Here Elisha shows that he is lowly in heart; he did not put himself in the front; he did not choose a place to make himself great.<a name=228:17></a> He was with the twelfth yoke, so that there were eleven before him; but I would say he was morally the greatest because he was with the twelfth.<a name=228:18></a> He was with the divine number with which God was operating, and he is ready to be in that.<a name=228:19></a> Elijah helps him to get into it.<a name=228:20></a> Elijah had been in it but Elijah was displaced or replaced by Elisha, and Elisha has the same lowly spirit, qualifying him to take the place of Elijah.<a name=228:21></a> It is lowliness that counts, "meek and lowly in heart", the Lord says.<a name=228:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		A.R.<a name=229:11></a> What started at Pentecost was perfect, was it not?<a name=229:12></a> I was wondering if that is what you had in mind in carrying forward the idea of the assembly in our day, so that it is not a remnant at all, but we should keep in mind what is perfect.<a name=229:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=229:14></a> The assembly is held as complete.<a name=229:15></a> The word 'assembly' is used at the beginning of Acts.<a name=229:16></a> In Revelation the Lord writes to the seven assemblies; He selects them and He writes a letter to each of them, and then there is in addition what the Spirit says to them.<a name=229:17></a> But what the Spirit says goes right down through the dispensation; and His speaking is going on today.<a name=229:18></a> I would hope that this meeting today in Toronto is part of it, part of what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies, not what the Lord is writing to them but what the Spirit is saying to them, to the assemblies.<a name=229:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=229:20></a> So do you think the Lord had in mind what is perfect when He said to Philadelphia, "<i>I</i> .<a name=229:21></a>.<a name=229:22></a>.<a name=229:23></a> will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world"?<a name=229:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=230:4></a> I suppose it would; the idea would be there, and Elisha was with the twelfth; that is to say the lowly man was there with the twelfth, where he was needed.<a name=230:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=230:19></a> Just so; there is perfect unity here; they are working together.<a name=230:20></a> Elisha is brought in as following on Elijah and he is fit for the place.<a name=230:21></a> So it goes on to say, "And Elijah went over to him, and cast his mantle on him.<a name=230:22></a> And he left the oxen" -- that is to say, that was past history -- "be left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and I will follow thee".<a name=230:23></a> Now that is the next thing we have to consider, this matter of kissing the father and the mother; that is, with Elisha the claims of nature are the central matter; they are being fully allowed.<a name=230:24></a> We have to see if that is as it should be; that is to say he is putting the testimony last, so that he has to be

		E.A.<a name=233:9></a>L.<a name=233:10></a> You once said regarding this matter of trade unionism, if I recall rightly, that in Revelation, trade unionism is shown up as definitely bearing the mark of the beast; and that if any one would justify his stay in the union after that was pointed out to him, it would point to the fact that he probably did not have the Spirit.<a name=233:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:1></a> It may be well to call attention to the use of the term, 'man of God', in 1 and 2 Kings.<a name=269:2></a> It is not used much in the New Testament, though it is used of Timotheus; and the question arises as to what there is of this kind at the present time -- of the character of men of God.<a name=269:3></a> They are characterised by being identified with God Himself and with His interests.<a name=269:4></a> But now I think we should devote ourselves to the details of this chapter; they are very striking and full of instruction in the men and women brought before us.<a name=269:5></a> The first one mentioned in the passage read is this wealthy woman called the Shunammite.<a name=269:6></a> She is a wealthy person, which is remarkable.<a name=269:7></a> We had a sister before us yesterday who was the widow of one of the sons of the prophets, whose children were about to be taken away by the creditor; and she had to make way for the Spirit as typified in the pot of oil.<a name=269:8></a> That is, the idea is emphasised of the Spirit of God.<a name=269:9></a> But it is remarkable, the prevalence of the term 'man of God'; it strikes me in this chapter at this time, and I wonder if we should not fix our minds upon it to see how it should take on meaning for us.<a name=269:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=269:11></a> Does it appear to be a characteristic matter here, rather than a mere title?<a name=269:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:13></a> I think it is characteristic.<a name=269:14></a> It is applied to Elijah as well as to Elisha, but particularly now to Elisha.<a name=269:15></a> That is, he is characteristically a man who began in a very small way as a ploughman, illustrating what the Spirit of God says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:26">1 Corinthians  1:26</a>,30 as to "not many noble" and so on being called.<a name=269:16></a> We have persons mentioned who show that God has taken up ordinary people; but God makes the man.<a name=269:17></a> That is to be stressed in the idea of the man of God,

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=270:2></a> The woman herself calls Elisha this.<a name=270:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=270:4></a> Yes, she does; he is constantly called 'man of God', and she is one who does it.<a name=270:5></a> This woman of Shunem is called a great woman, but at the same time she has a right attitude about it; she would seem to be comely and humble about it all despite the wealth she has.<a name=270:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=270:7></a> She says to her husband, "I perceive that this is a holy man of God".<a name=270:8></a> Does that indicate that she got some gain from what was set out in the previous incident?<a name=270:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=270:10></a> It does.<a name=270:11></a> David said of Abigail, "Blessed be thy discernment" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25:33">1 Samuel  25:33</a>); this woman had discernment too.<a name=270:12></a> We now have the sisters specially before us and very much has been made of them, and we believe that God is helping us as to the whole matter.<a name=270:13></a> It is striking how they behave in these incidents, how simple they are and how comely.<a name=270:14></a> This woman is in keeping with the position, making no show of her wealth or of anything that she has as according to the flesh.<a name=270:15></a> She appealed to her husband as to Elisha, "this is a holy man of God", she says.<a name=270:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=270:17></a> Does the fact that women come so prominently into the early days of Elisha's ministry suggest to us the need of the subjective work of the Spirit to develop these features of the man of God in us?<a name=270:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=270:19></a> Surely, the subjective work of the Spirit.<a name=270:20></a> I was thinking how it would appear: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<a name=270:21></a>" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:1">Psalm  133:1</a>) and so forth.<a name=270:22></a> So it is not a question of what is in heaven, it is what there is to be seen down here, how good and pleasant the brethren appear as seen in unity.<a name=270:23></a>

		S.J.<a name=271:2></a>H.<a name=271:3></a> Would not expressions found in the early service of Elijah and Elisha bear on this term, 'man of God'?<a name=271:4></a> Elijah could say, "Jehovah the God of Israel .<a name=271:5></a>.<a name=271:6></a>.<a name=271:7></a> before whom I stand"; and Elisha also says, "Jehovah of hosts .<a name=271:8></a>.<a name=271:9></a>.<a name=271:10></a> before whom I stand".<a name=271:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=271:12></a> I suppose the idea would be that the servant is just before God.<a name=271:13></a> He is not thinking of anyone else, but just of pleasing God.<a name=271:14></a> So it was said of an earlier saint, Enoch, that he had this testimony that he pleased God.<a name=271:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=271:16></a>H.<a name=271:17></a> That would be the moral basis of the term.<a name=271:18></a>

		R.A.<a name=271:19></a> Is this woman of wealth in power in the place where she dwells?<a name=271:20></a> I understand the meaning of the word 'Shunem' is quietness.<a name=271:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=271:22></a> You say quietness?<a name=271:23></a> Very good, it is just what should be seen in the sisters to be quiet and restful; not to make a fuss about things, but to be restful and subject.<a name=271:24></a>

		A.P.<a name=271:25></a> Does the thought of the man of God suggest the provision for the assembly to the end of the dispensation as following on the apostolic days, as being what is characteristic in our day?<a name=271:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=271:27></a> Why do you say that, because it is hardly mentioned except in Timothy?<a name=271:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=271:29></a> I thought in connection with the scripture before us that the idea of widowhood and such circumstances as are set out in the widow bring to light the provision that is found in men like Elisha, who is termed the man of God.<a name=271:30></a> I thought it would help us as to the understanding and appropriation of the Holy Spirit's service with us to the end.<a name=271:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		time when we have great men as in earlier days, like the apostle Paul and others such as Luther and Mr.<a name=272:1></a> Darby.<a name=272:2></a> It is not a time for these.<a name=272:3></a> They came up and God made them what was needed; they filled the gap as it were, and they were content to be without any distinction.<a name=272:4></a> I think that is the idea, because the Spirit of God is jealous as to what His rights are, as He is in charge of everything.<a name=272:5></a> He is here as sent from heaven and He is in complete charge of everything.<a name=272:6></a> And so let us continue until the end, for that is what I believe will characterise the end.<a name=272:7></a> The Spirit of God is on earth as in us and here with us.<a name=272:8></a> This morning, at this very moment, the Spirit is ready to help us and we are conscious of it.<a name=272:9></a> As we begin our meeting we are conscious that the Spirit is here; we have the idea of the minstrel.<a name=272:10></a> But the Spirit of God is the minstrel really, Himself; He is the power of everything.<a name=272:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=272:12></a> I thought that that fits in with the idea that Elisha does not provide the oil himself; it was there already.<a name=272:13></a> That is to say attention is called to what is there, suggestively the Holy Spirit, and the dignity that is proper to Him.<a name=272:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=272:15></a> People are very prone to say, 'Our brother, Mr.<a name=272:16></a> So-and-So, the Lord's servant', when we are not always so sure whether we can designate a man as the Lord's servant.<a name=272:17></a> The servant himself is not assuming that title, so we had better just be simple about what a man is, and designate him accordingly.<a name=272:18></a> What we want is the power, that is the point.<a name=272:19></a> We want to see where the Spirit of God is and what He is doing, and that the assembly is in mind.<a name=272:20></a> But the subjects of this chapter are very remarkable, and we should confine ourselves largely to them to get the full gain of them beginning with this one about the Shunammite.<a name=272:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=273:2></a> That is good; but there is another thing, Why is she said to be a great woman?<a name=273:3></a> Her husband is not said to be a great man.<a name=273:4></a> She is distinguished from her husband in that sense, that she must have had means, and why is her husband not in it as well?<a name=273:5></a> Or does she control her own money and spend it?<a name=273:6></a> As we consider the matter, perhaps she is not such a simple person as we had thought.<a name=273:7></a> She should be distinguished as a wife, as having a husband and recognising him, which indeed she does, but perhaps she does not recognise him enough, because she is the one who is doing things.<a name=273:8></a> She is the one that is in the lead, which is hardly right.<a name=273:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=273:10></a>S.<a name=273:11></a> Is he not rather poor himself from what comes out later?<a name=273:12></a> He questioned her going to the prophet, saying, "It is neither new moon nor sabbath".<a name=273:13></a> He is not very spiritual, is he?<a name=273:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=273:15></a> Clearly not; he is more or less kindly and subject.<a name=273:16></a> He feels what has to be done, you might say, but why should the wife be so distinguished and called a great woman, as she is by the Spirit of God?<a name=273:17></a> The word 'wealthy' means 'great'; but why should she be made so much of?<a name=273:18></a> Why should there not be just the ordinary thought of man and wife, so that things are according to God?<a name=273:19></a> I was just wondering why we cannot get something out of it as to husbands and wives, because here the wife comes so much into prominence, whereas God's thought is to have husbands and wives moving together and not one predominating above the other.<a name=273:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=283:1></a> As has already been remarked, these incidents in 2 Kings are evidently intended to bring out certain features amongst us, particularly as to the household.<a name=283:2></a> Here we have the case of the little maid who is to be used in this remarkable way, and undoubtedly it is to remind us how children and young people may be used; and on the other hand how certain grown-up persons may be affected on the lines of deceit and covetousness.<a name=283:3></a> These are the great facts that enter into the present reading, especially how young people may be used in the households.<a name=283:4></a> Naaman is the leading figure in this incident but perhaps we have not noticed the little maid so much and what affected her, how she is influenced in a good direction.<a name=283:5></a> She was just a maid to a certain mistress but she was full of the good that she should do at this particular time.<a name=283:6></a>

		C.H.<a name=283:7></a>H.<a name=283:8></a> It is remarkable that there is no resentment shown by her.<a name=283:9></a> She might have resented the fact that she had been carried away captive, but there must have been a work of God in her.<a name=283:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=283:11></a> Just so, she accepts her circumstances; it is a question of the government of God.<a name=283:12></a> Although a young person, she is ready to do things and she is affected by what affected her master.<a name=283:13></a> Her exclamation in verse 3, "Oh, would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria!<a name=283:14></a>" would show that.<a name=283:15></a> She is not simply a maid, but a little maid, affected by what affected her master, the one above her; showing that young people are to learn to be subject and appreciate conditions, and to do the best they can in any given circumstances in subjection to God.<a name=283:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:18></a> We have to infer that for she certainly knew that he had this power.<a name=284:19></a> Another thing that comes up is the pride of Naaman; he expected the prophet to do so and so and recognise his importance.<a name=284:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=285:13></a>P.<a name=285:14></a> Is it not striking that the Lord may use any agency in order to make His work manifest?<a name=285:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>the Spirit of God calls attention to this passage we have read today.<a name=285:16></a> These persons were singled out so that the work of God might be manifest.<a name=285:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=285:18></a> Quite so; it is a time of the sovereignty of God, and we cannot say things must be done because of the circumstances; we must count on the sovereignty of God in doing things.<a name=285:19></a> The Lord Jesus Himself uses these incidents to bring out the sovereignty of God, that God acts as He pleases.<a name=285:20></a> We must not expect Him to do as <i>we</i> please, He does as <i>He</i> pleases.<a name=285:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=286:2></a> Just so.<a name=286:3></a> We can only speak typically; the Old Testament contains types but the type is a type of something, and the thing is to see what the something means.<a name=286:4></a> Undoubtedly here it is the sovereignty of God to which the Lord is calling attention: that there are things to be done and God would do them as He pleases.<a name=286:5></a> It is for us to count on God.<a name=286:6></a> So the little maid is to be noticed first and the next thing would be the pride of Naaman.<a name=286:7></a> He expects that the prophet would do so and so for him, but Elisha does not do it; instead he humbles him; he says, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times" and he went and plunged in and was cleansed.<a name=286:8></a> But he would not do it at first.<a name=286:9></a> His servants enjoined him however; they said that if the prophet had told him to do some great thing would he not have done it?<a name=286:10></a> So he humbled himself, and the thing for us older people to do is to humble ourselves and not expect great things to be done for us; but to humble ourselves and do what we are told to do.<a name=286:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=286:12></a>L.<a name=286:13></a> The little maid gives a great example to us; she had faith that something could happen that had never happened before; she had no knowledge of anyone ever before being cured of leprosy.<a name=286:14></a> Do you think it fits in with what the Lord said to Nathanael, "Thou shalt see greater things than these" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:50">John  1:50</a>)?<a name=286:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=286:16></a> We have been enlarging on that quite recently, the idea of greater things.<a name=286:17></a> It is a question of having great expectations, but on right lines.<a name=286:18></a> So the Lord enlarges on what was said, and He says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these".<a name=286:19></a>

		I propose to speak of God's rights on the earth, and to show how they are asserted.<a name=308:1></a> In our first scripture these rights are only asserted in a limited way; it was simply in the dispersion or scattering of the human race over the face of the earth.<a name=308:2></a> The earth was God's, and He could use it in this way to decentralise the whole race.<a name=308:3></a> Their centralisation in Shinar was against God; their thought was to be independent.<a name=308:4></a> They said: "Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth".<a name=308:5></a> They were thinking of their own name, and not of God's, showing they were eliminating Him from their calculations.<a name=308:6></a> And what they sought to prevent, God caused; they said, "Lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth", and the passage says, "Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth".<a name=308:7></a>

		"These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth".<a name=309:5></a> These four spirits of the heavens, spoken of in the second scripture, refer to the four empires that we have alluded to.<a name=309:6></a> They are not viewed as against God; on the contrary, they are said to be "the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth".<a name=309:7></a> The apostle Paul recognises this in saying that "the powers that be are ordained of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:1">Romans  13:1</a>).<a name=309:8></a> They are to be so regarded by us and prayed for; they are a provision of God in view of His testimony.<a name=309:9></a> He did not set up these monarchies because He wished the gentiles to be glorified.<a name=309:10></a> They are purely provisional and will pass away.<a name=309:11></a> They existed one after another in view, as has been remarked, of God's testimony.<a name=309:12></a> Apart from them there could only be chaos politically, and such chaos would naturally hinder the testimony going forth.<a name=309:13></a> Their office therefore was to maintain order on the earth.<a name=309:14></a>

		The first monarch was evidently converted, Nebuchadnezzar; hence, these four spirits of the heavens had an excellent start from God, and, under the ordering of God, Nebuchadnezzar's great minister, Daniel, was a prophet of God, and through him in a peculiar way we get light from God as to these monarchies and the service they were to have.<a name=309:15></a> They were to serve Him as the four spirits of the heavens, Jehovah being viewed as "the Lord of all the earth".<a name=309:16></a>

		The book of Daniel therefore becomes of immense importance to us; it outlines the history of these monarchies, giving their character generally as beasts, some of them of peculiar ferocity.<a name=310:1></a> But however ferocious or cruel any of them might have been, they still retain the character of the spirits of the heavens.<a name=310:2></a> The Roman system was recognised by the Lord Himself, for He said to Pilate: "Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#19:11">John  19:11</a>).<a name=310:3></a> Pilate himself was a man of the meanest character, and he executed the authority of Rome in Jerusalem, that is the authority of the worst of the four monarchies.<a name=310:4></a> The Roman system is that under which we are now; it is broken up into kingdoms, but it is about to take its primary character as an empire.<a name=310:5></a>.<a name=310:6></a> But whatever its history and the character of its Caesars from time to time, it is still one of the spirits of the heavens, and, such as it is, it affords, in a general way, liberty for the gospel to go forth.<a name=310:7></a> Hence, we are, as christians, to be subject to these powers, viewing them not as against us, but as for us.<a name=310:8></a> God overrules in all they do, for the furtherance of the testimony.<a name=310:9></a> What has been remarked as to these four monarchies ought to be observed by all christians, for we are enjoined to pray for them "that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:2">1 Timothy  2:2</a>).<a name=310:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Joshua we have typically what was presented in testimony, that is, "the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth".<a name=311:5></a> It is in this character that Paul presented the testimony of God.<a name=311:6></a> The ark of the covenant passing over Jordan is a type of Christ.<a name=311:7></a> As risen from among the dead, Christ was the great subject of the testimony of the gospel, as we see in the Acts.<a name=311:8></a> He was not only risen, but had ascended to heaven, and the Spirit having been sent down from heaven, the testimony as to Christ was carried on to the whole world.<a name=311:9></a> This was God's way of testifying to His kindness and love to man.<a name=311:10></a> In scattering the race at Shinar, He had this in mind, to show His love to man according to what is stated in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>,6: "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own times".<a name=311:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Before they were sent out, they had been engaged together in the assembly for a whole year, teaching the saints at Antioch: "And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly, and taught a large crowd" (chapter 11:26).<a name=315:7></a> In the word, "gathered together in assembly", the word 'assembly' refers to the saints being formed as the assembly of God.<a name=315:8></a> The large crowd would gradually become reduced, and formed into an assembly; so that we read in chapter 13 of "the assembly which was there"; that is, it had been formed.<a name=315:9></a> In it there were certain prophets and teachers, the names of whom are given; and it says, "they were ministering to the Lord and fasting"; that is, in the assembly at Antioch the service of God was proceeding, so that the Holy Spirit is free to ask for two servants.<a name=315:10></a> The Holy Spirit was operating there; conditions in the assembly at Antioch afforded Him this particular liberty, for where the Holy Spirit acts in this way, the conditions are suitable.<a name=315:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Evidently the Spirit had in mind to form other assemblies like Antioch; hence the facts relative to the service of Saul and Barnabas relate to assembly formation.<a name=316:4></a> There would be many assemblies like Antioch, so the word is often in the plural from this point onwards.<a name=316:5></a> It is said in chapter 16:5, "The assemblies therefore were confirmed in the faith, and increased in number every day".<a name=316:6></a> This is what was in mind in the selection of the elders spoken of in chapter 14; verse 23 says, "And having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed"; so that whilst general unity is implied between these assemblies, each one is self-contained, and this implies obviously that each person in the assembly takes up his part and responsibility in the assembly.<a name=316:7></a> The choice of elders has in view that, as each is in his place, there is authority to maintain divine principles governing the assembly.<a name=316:8></a> Elders represent the authority of Christ in the local company.<a name=316:9></a> There are no <i>officially</i> appointed elders today; yet the authority of Christ must be maintained in each local assembly.<a name=316:10></a> I wanted to make clear what is in mind here.<a name=316:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=361:1></a> Our subject at this time, according to the arrangement with the brethren here, is prophetic ministry, a subject which has become of great interest among the brethren universally, and as these meetings for prophetic ministry are not generally held in this country, it is thought the Lord would help at this time as to this matter.<a name=361:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our first scripture is the formal injunction or commandment, as we might say, as to it.<a name=361:3></a> Verse 37 shows, that this epistle is, as it were, a commandment by itself: "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment".<a name=361:4></a> Therefore in this passage, "If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place .<a name=361:5></a>.<a name=361:6></a>.<a name=361:7></a>" the 'if' does not mean that the matter is optional.<a name=361:8></a> The verse implies that brethren have meetings of this kind, and the instruction is that the whole assembly in a city or town should come together in one place for the purpose.<a name=361:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=361:12></a> The wording is different from chapter 11:18: "When ye come together in assembly".<a name=361:13></a> The wording is different in that the article is found in chapter 14:23, meaning that <i>all</i> the saints are there, and are viewed as the whole assembly.<a name=361:14></a> Thus in a city where there are some subdivisions of the assembly (more than one meeting), the meeting for prophetic ministry is not limited to one of the subdivisions.<a name=361:15></a> A subdivision may come together "in assembly" to partake of the Lord's supper.<a name=361:16></a> But here it is "the whole assembly come together in one place".<a name=361:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=363:5></a> Whenever we give God an opportunity according to His direction, He never fails to come in; as we give Him the opportunity for speaking prophetically, He certainly will come in for us.<a name=363:6></a> Thus in the beginning of the chapter we have: "Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual manifestations, but rather that ye may prophesy".<a name=363:7></a> As brethren in a locality become sensible of the need of prophecy, they will desire to have ability to prophesy.<a name=363:8></a> Thus God will have vessels for the purpose.<a name=363:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=363:12></a> The first and second epistles to the Corinthians contemplate the public service of the assembly.<a name=363:13></a> To use an illustration, you might find in the city of Corinth on a certain street a Jewish synagogue, a heathen temple, and a christian assembly.<a name=363:14></a> We can see therefore the great advantage for God, as well as for men, of the public assembly as contemplated in our chapter.<a name=363:15></a> So that in view of securing our brethren and others, we can see the wisdom of having suitable meeting-rooms such as any christian or any person would feel liberty to enter.<a name=363:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two blind men spoken of in chapter 20 introduced a special feature of the testimony at that time.<a name=410:4></a> They were evidently not educated in the ordinary religious way.<a name=410:5></a> They had heard that "Jesus was passing by", and they addressed Him as "Lord, Son of David".<a name=410:6></a> This title particularly entered into that moment.<a name=410:7></a> The Lord had come over the Jordan, and He was approaching Jerusalem, the city of the great King, and it was especially right that He should be acknowledged as "Lord, Son of David".<a name=410:8></a> So these blind men address Him in that way.<a name=410:9></a> It is taken up in the next chapter, verse 9, "And the crowds who went before him and who followed cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; blessed be he who comes in the name of the Lord; hosanna in the highest".<a name=410:10></a> The crowd takes up the note introduced by the blind men in chapter 20, but prefix it by the word "Hosanna", which means, 'Save, I beseech thee'; so that Christ is acknowledged as having present power to save.<a name=410:11></a> Later in the chapter the children say the same thing in the temple.<a name=410:12></a> These are the facts related to the appearance of the colt in this section, so that he has a particular importance.<a name=410:13></a> In fact it is the ass and the colt in this gospel; the ass is not mentioned in the other gospels, but she is present here, and as we had it yesterday at Beauvoisin, attention is called to the need of the younger and older brethren moving together.<a name=410:14></a> It is to be noted that the Lord Himself

		Elijah is not to be regarded only as a prophet; he is also a man of God, and, by extension, he represents the testimony.<a name=429:3></a> He appears suddenly, no mention being made of his forefathers or of his genealogy, but speaking at once in power, saying to king Ahab: "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except by my word".<a name=429:4></a> These were not mere words; these utterances were marked by moral authority, as coming from a man who had a history with God, if not with men.<a name=429:5></a> He is alone as he faces the monarch, and, what is more serious still, in confronting Jezebel.<a name=429:6></a> What exposure!<a name=429:7></a> The enemy would seize every opportunity of attacking him.<a name=429:8></a> And so, dear brethren, if any one of us in his measure, or all of us, represent God, we are correspondingly the objects of the attacks of the wicked one.<a name=429:9></a> Hence, Jehovah comes in at once; His words concern the prophet himself, his maintenance.<a name=429:10></a> Thus, as in the divine service, we must understand that God has spoken as to us, and He will speak about us to others, but He will speak to <i>us</i> also about <i>ourselves</i>, for we must know ourselves, and above all we must know that God cares for us, as we are told: "Casting all your care upon him; for he careth
