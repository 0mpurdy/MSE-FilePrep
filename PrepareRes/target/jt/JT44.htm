		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> It will be well to say that our subject is to be priesthood -- continuing in it as seen in David.<a name=1:3></a> He was marked by the exercise of priesthood when the ark was brought to Zion, and it is said that he was clad with a linen ephod, and danced before it, (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6">2 Samuel  6</a>).<a name=1:4></a> Linen suggests balance and sobriety in this connection -- it naturally absorbs heat.<a name=1:5></a> There are two words used in regard to the fabrics employed in the priestly garments and the tabernacle furnishings.<a name=1:6></a> One seems to convey whiteness and fineness, whatever the basic material; the word generally in Exodus is that.<a name=1:7></a> But then we have a word that conveys the idea of linen worn particularly by the high priest on the day of atonement; that is, typically, as Christ entered into death: there is a suggestion in it of holy sobriety and balance.<a name=1:8></a> The same thought would apply to David as wearing the linen ephod; he was very energetic in his service; he danced "with all his might;" and this might seem to be undue exuberance, but the linen would point to the opposite of that.<a name=1:9></a> There was sufficient to move him, and yet it was in holy solemnity and balance, so that there was no allowance of fleshly feeling which is always ready to show itself in our service before God.<a name=1:10></a> When it does show itself -- that is, natural exuberance or excitement -- it is just strange fire.<a name=1:11></a>

		What is before us in these two passages in Chronicles is priesthood, <i>based on sonship;</i> so far we have not had this side, although priesthood is properly based on sonship, however we look at it, for it is Christ as Son who is the Priest, the Son, constituted a Priest forever, after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=1:12></a>

		We have not had this so far, and it appears first in chapter 17, the passage that corresponds with <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>.<a name=2:1></a> What it says here in Chronicles, as in 2 Samuel 7, is that David is forbidden to build the house, that is, he is not qualified.<a name=2:2></a> Viewed as a warrior, even although he had exercised priesthood, he is not qualified to build the house.<a name=2:3></a> It was to be built by the son and the message sent to him through Nathan, according to what we read, calls attention to the son, saying, "And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.<a name=2:4></a> It is he who shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.<a name=2:5></a> I will be his father, and he shall be my son; and I will not take away my mercy from him".<a name=2:6></a> As this message is received, the passage says, "And king David went in and sat before Jehovah".<a name=2:7></a> He accepts the mind of God unqualifiedly, and understands that sonship is now henceforth to be the basis of God's relations with Israel; he moves himself as in that light.<a name=2:8></a> "And king David went in and sat before Jehovah, and said .<a name=2:9></a>.<a name=2:10></a>.<a name=2:11></a>" He is acting still as a priest; he is taking the liberties that belong to a priest, but he is also taking the ground of sonship; he sat before Jehovah, or tarried, it may be rendered, meaning that he had full liberty to be there.<a name=2:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:15></a> Yes, the idea of Abiathar does not enter into this part; he really stands in connection with the first book of Samuel.<a name=2:16></a> The office of high priest is more to encourage the young believer.<a name=2:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:14">Hebrews  4:14</a>, for instance, we read: "Having therefore a great high priest", and then in chapter 10 it is, "having a great priest", the word "high" is dropped in chapter 10, and I suppose sonship enters into

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Well, it is to bring out that side, that we may see how the priesthood developed in David to the full thought of it in sonship.<a name=3:5></a> We do not get the thought of son in this sense spoken of earlier, I think; as sonship is introduced David went in and sat before the Lord.<a name=3:6></a> He had full liberty; the usual posture for a priest in this respect is to <i>stand</i> before Jehovah.<a name=3:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:17></a> It continues when priesthood is no longer needed.<a name=3:18></a> Sonship is an abiding thought, it is a primary thought with God.<a name=3:19></a> All primary thoughts are abiding ones.<a name=3:20></a> Priesthood is a provisional thought, the necessity for it arises from the results of sin in the world, or ignorance -- all these things are dealt with, then the thought of priesthood necessarily drops; it is not needed when there is no evil and no ignorance.<a name=3:21></a> Sonship is a great eternal thought, but it comes into the provisional state of things, and as sons the priests have liberty before God.<a name=3:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> The mention of it set him free, it shows how receptive he was of divine thoughts.<a name=4:14></a> The more spiritual one is, the more receptive he is of divine thoughts.<a name=4:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> I think that is how it seems in Scripture.<a name=5:7></a> He was not <i>publicly</i> owned as Son until He was thirty years of age.<a name=5:8></a> He was Son, of course, from the outset -- "<i>Thou</i> art my Son: this day have <i>I</i> begotten thee" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:5">Hebrews  1:5</a>).<a name=5:9></a> He was God's Son from the outset, but it awaited His full manhood for heaven to proclaim Him as Son, and then the heavens were opened to Him.<a name=5:10></a> That is a very important matter.<a name=5:11></a> John's gospel takes up this great thought.<a name=5:12></a> John the baptist is employed by the Spirit there to enlarge on Christ's Person.<a name=5:13></a> It was said to him, "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:33">John  1:33</a>).<a name=5:14></a> And then John says, "And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God".<a name=5:15></a> That is the One upon whom the Spirit descended, and He abode upon Him.<a name=5:16></a> The next day John saw Him <i>walking</i>.<a name=5:17></a> His movements are enhanced in the eyes of John the baptist by the knowledge he had of His Person.<a name=5:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:8></a> I think so.<a name=7:9></a> You can see that all the things mentioned denoted his dignity.<a name=7:10></a> He is called "my son".<a name=7:11></a> All that follows in Luke 15 -- the jubilance, the music, and the dancing inside -- is in the light of that relation.<a name=7:12></a> The most glorious presentation of christianity, the most glorious result of the gospel is in that chapter, but the elder brother would not come in.<a name=7:13></a> If you appeal to a true christian according to what is there, he will be affected.<a name=7:14></a>

		Ques.<a name=7:15></a> David said, "O God; and thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#17:17">1 Chronicles  17:17</a>).<a name=7:16></a> Do you think he saw beyond the temple?<a name=7:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:18></a> Well, the words go further than he could have explained to you.<a name=7:19></a> If you had asked David to give you an explanation of this verse, he could not do it as well as you could.<a name=7:20></a>

		Ques.<a name=7:21></a> The Lord said, "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a>).<a name=7:22></a> Do you think David saw Christ here?<a name=7:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:24></a> Yes, in the same sense in which Abraham saw Him.<a name=7:25></a> It is always well to remember that these men of faith are clothed with the Lord's own view of the matter.<a name=7:26></a> The New Testament takes up Old Testament scriptures and clothes them with New Testament thoughts.<a name=7:27></a> I was thinking, for instance, of the writer of the Hebrews, undoubtedly Paul, he

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		alludes to the deluge, saying, Noah made an ark for the saving of his house.<a name=8:1></a> You can understand how Paul clothed Noah's act with the truth of the believer's household which he was bringing out.<a name=8:2></a> The Lord says, "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced".<a name=8:3></a> You might think that Abraham could give an address on Christ's day, but you would be mistaken in that.<a name=8:4></a> The Lord clothes what the patriarch saw with His own point of view.<a name=8:5></a> We cannot say that Abraham could have named what was then seen by him as Christ names it.<a name=8:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:9></a> That is right.<a name=8:10></a> Moses could not have elaborated on that if you asked him.<a name=8:11></a> What is referred to there is that he called the <i>Hebrews</i> his brethren; it was "the reproach of the Christ" from the New Testament point of view.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is beautiful here to see David's movement.<a name=8:13></a> Instead of being indignant (for indeed he knew how to be indignant even in regard of what God did, <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#13:11">1 Chronicles  13:11</a>), he is enlarged as the truth comes out; he is receptive of it; a very fine example for us.<a name=8:14></a> That he should be prohibited from building the house reduced him personally, but he is entirely above resentfulness, he is in the light of sonship.<a name=8:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=9:14></a> That is what we should see here, that the light of sonship is conveyed to him, and he moves in it, and enters in before Jehovah and sits down.<a name=9:15></a> Sitting down means, I think, that it is a permanent thought.<a name=9:16></a> Sonship is a fixed relationship into which we are brought.<a name=9:17></a> This should encourage young christians to take up that ground, and to note the word "crying" in Galatians 4 and in Romans 8.<a name=9:18></a> You get the Lord Jesus crying in His ministry on earth.<a name=9:19></a> He cried, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a>).<a name=9:20></a> It is that the matter is urgent, most important, and it seems to me that <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a> implies that young christians should take up this great thought of sonship at once; it is urgent.<a name=9:21></a> The Spirit cries in the christian, "Abba, Father", according to Galatians 4.<a name=9:22></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:15">Romans  8:15</a> the believer cries, "Abba, Father" by the Spirit; he takes the thing up and responds to God, according to this blessed relationship into which he is brought.<a name=9:23></a> Romans 8 is more advanced because we come down to the thought of

		As we go on to chapter 29 we get a fuller exhibition, a fuller testimony to David's worshipful condition; his priestly power.<a name=12:13></a> "And David blessed Jehovah in the sight of all the congregation; and David said, Blessed be thou, Jehovah, the God of our father Israel, for ever and ever.<a name=12:14></a> Thine, Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the splendour, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is thine: thine, Jehovah, is the kingdom, and thou art exalted as Head above all; and riches and glory are of thee, and thou rulest over everything; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make all great and strong.<a name=12:15></a> And now, our God, we thank thee,

		J.T.<a name=18:1></a> Those of us who are at all conversant with the book of Ezekiel will know that the thought of <i>man</i> is stamped upon it; the scriptures read illustrate this.<a name=18:2></a> The term "son of man" runs through it, appearing even more often than in all the gospels.<a name=18:3></a> I thought it would be helpful to look at it from this point of view, not from a prophetic standpoint exactly, but as to the bearing of the thought morally on ourselves.<a name=18:4></a> Although the angels were the most exalted of His creatures hitherto, evidently God's primary thought was that they should be subservient to man.<a name=18:5></a> The Lord becoming Man, having man in His mind, takes a place "by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:4">Hebrews  1:4</a>).<a name=18:6></a> Man being in God's mind and counsels, Hebrews tells us that Jesus, although "made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death", is now "crowned with glory and honour" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:7">Hebrews  2:7</a> - 9), and "thou hast subjected all things under his feet", whereas the angels are "sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:14">Hebrews  1:14</a>).<a name=18:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=21:7></a> Well, that is a great part in the formation of man.<a name=21:8></a> It is in having a mind and spirit that man differs from the animal creation.<a name=21:9></a> We can see that from the very outset; he is the last to be formed in the creation and he receives life by the breath of God, so that God was there morally; not only in His love and compassion, but in His intelligence, what God is.<a name=21:10></a> Therefore man was to be His image.<a name=21:11></a> He could not be His image save as in intelligence, as superior to the animal.<a name=21:12></a> He has the element of supremacy, all his features denote superiority by intelligence; he is superior, he is able to rule, to have dominion -- which could only be through his superior intelligence.<a name=21:13></a> So that in Romans there is the renewing of the mind that we might "prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:2">Romans  12:2</a>).<a name=21:14></a> Not only that, but the mind is said to have dominion in chapter 7.<a name=21:15></a> "So then <i>I myself</i> with the mind serve the God's law" -- the mind is allowed, as it were, through the analysis, to have a dominant place.<a name=21:16></a> Because its superiority is discerned, one allows his mind to rule.<a name=21:17></a> The renewing of it, of course, is by the Spirit.<a name=21:18></a>

		What is in mind for this meeting, and what one would specially desire to dwell upon is <i>instinct</i>.<a name=59:7></a> We have already spoken of it in Hannah, but here we find it in the milch kine, and we see how in the absence of intelligent priesthood, as indeed is the case in the major part of christendom today, God is taking care of His interests, and it is through spiritual instinct in His people.<a name=59:8></a> Although unintelligent in a large measure, still it is there.<a name=59:9></a> The milch kine, of course, belong to the lower creation, but they are brought in here to show that divine instinct was symbolised in them.<a name=59:10></a> They are moving, not according to their natural feelings, but supernatural; which are divinely produced for the moment; they acted contrary to nature, and that is a sure evidence of the work of God.<a name=59:11></a> They moved according to His will because they "went by the one high way".<a name=59:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=67:3></a> I think wherever you get the female in this way it means the subjective side, not necessarily the intelligent side, but the instinct that is true.<a name=67:4></a> There is something in Israel now; God began to work in Israel after the terrible disaster in chapter 4, and there is, so far, recovery.<a name=67:5></a> Hence chapter 7 is based on this.<a name=67:6></a> Samuel says, "Gather all Israel" -- <i>gather</i>, that is what he proposes.<a name=67:7></a> There is no gathering at Beth-shemesh; it is just the culmination of a movement characterised by right instinct.<a name=67:8></a> It culminates in the Levites; they were ordained to take care of what was of God, and especially the ark, which they alone, as under the ordering of the priests, were to handle.<a name=67:9></a> The next thing is, the intelligent priest says in chapter 7: 5, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray Jehovah for you.<a name=67:10></a> And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah.<a name=67:11></a> And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah".<a name=67:12></a> Now you have a gathering, there is a completely new start under an intelligent priest.<a name=67:13></a> So that the next thing, after a believer moves out of Philistine circumstances, is that God claims him.<a name=67:14></a> He says, You belong to Me, you are Mine.<a name=67:15></a> Then the "great stone" and the sacrifice offered up in chapter 6, form the basis for gathering.<a name=67:16></a> The foundation of God is there and thus, as on sure ground, we may proceed.<a name=67:17></a> In <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a> the firm foundation of God is said to stand, and then "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".<a name=67:18></a> The principle of gathering follows on this.<a name=67:19></a>

		Moreover, He says to His Father, "thou hast hid these things from wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes".<a name=130:4></a> God is doing that today; the truth has been hidden; a sorrowful thing, for it is judicial; man has despised it, and God is resentful.<a name=130:5></a> He bears long, but He is resentful and He hides from certain ones and reveals to others.<a name=130:6></a> That is what He is doing every day.<a name=130:7></a> It shows what the public official christendom is losing, but, on the other hand, those who have things spiritually are being added to every day.<a name=130:8></a> "To him that hath shall be given".<a name=130:9></a> That is going on, and is causing joy to Jesus.<a name=130:10></a> He says, God is doing that -- "thou hast hid these things from wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: yea, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in thy sight".<a name=130:11></a> The history of the assembly here, however sorrowful and dark at times, always yields something to Christ, I am sure of that.<a name=130:12></a> There has always been something to cause Him joy, and I want to be in that, I want to cause joy to Christ.<a name=130:13></a> He is making known some things to me that He is hiding from others; that is going on, beloved brethren, and we want to be in it, for it brings joy to Christ.<a name=130:14></a> Our meetings of this kind remind us of what is going on.<a name=130:15></a>

		In Mark and Luke the voice was directly to the Lord Himself; saying, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=137:10></a> That was for Himself in view of His service; an important pattern, that those who serve are to serve in the sense of divine complacency -- even delight.<a name=137:11></a> Thus the service is not only beneficial to those who hear, but

		Now I want to go on to Genesis, first to show how in those early days God calls attention to what He had.<a name=142:2></a> All, of course, is anticipative of what I have been saying.<a name=142:3></a> There could be no Genesis, there could be no Exodus, there could be no Old Testament without the prospective coming of the Son of God, the Incarnation; so that He is before all things, He is first in everything.<a name=142:4></a> The historical coming of the Lord cannot weaken the fact that He is "the beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that <i>he</i> might have the first place in all things" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:18">Colossians  1:18</a>).<a name=142:5></a> So what we get in this chapter is founded on what I have been saying.<a name=142:6></a> It is God here calling attention to one saint in obscurity and indeed in suffering; his position so weak that his wife is taken away from him and he cannot overcome the situation himself, but God can.<a name=142:7></a> What this chapter shows is God's protection of His saints, and how He calls the attention of the representatives of the world to them.<a name=142:8></a> Here God calls the Philistine king's attention to this man whose wife he had taken, He says "he is a prophet".<a name=142:9></a> I am speaking, dear brethren, not merely to interest you in a historical matter of hundreds of years ago.<a name=142:10></a> The Scriptures are not written on that line at all; the Scriptures always speak to the persons who read them, or hear them read.<a name=142:11></a> That is, it is their present voice that God would impress upon us.<a name=142:12></a> We know that, above all persons, Abraham represents that, because we are told in Galatians that the Scriptures "announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham".<a name=142:13></a>

		Now I go on to the well-known scripture in Exodus 4, to show you what is here for God; <i>His</i> portion.<a name=145:11></a> He says to Moses, "say to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah: Israel is my son, my firstborn".<a name=145:12></a> It is a different message from the word to Abimelech, and it is not direct, it is through Moses, because in Exodus you have what is ministerial; it is now Moses and Aaron.<a name=145:13></a> The message comes through Moses, but it is plain, and it is about <i>Israel</i>.<a name=145:14></a> He says, "Israel is my son, my firstborn .<a name=145:15></a>.<a name=145:16></a>.<a name=145:17></a> Let my son go, that he may serve me".<a name=145:18></a> That is the position in Exodus, and you can see how it is the counterpart of what I have been speaking of.<a name=145:19></a> Abraham was serving men, but Israel, as a son, was to <i>serve God</i>.<a name=145:20></a> You may say, serving man is serving God, because you carry out God's wishes, but this use of the word 'service' refers, as indeed in the New Testament, too, to our attitude towards God; something that is very much omitted in christendom.<a name=145:21></a> There is the idea of serving man, but very little service Godward, which is based

		Now that is what this passage in Exodus teaches, and if you will look, at your leisure, at the chapters that follow, you will be impressed with how God keeps this thought before Pharaoh in all His messages to Pharaoh until the people are free.<a name=147:6></a> He keeps calling attention to it, nor does Moses ever fail to stress it -- all resulting in this, that the very last word Pharaoh said to Moses in this book, was: "go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said".<a name=147:7></a> God brought the world round to it, and they were compelled to let Israel go.<a name=147:8></a> This is very encouraging.<a name=147:9></a> "Go", Pharaoh says, "serve Jehovah as ye have said.<a name=147:10></a> Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and go; and bless me also".<a name=147:11></a> The service began at Sinai.<a name=147:12></a> Pharaoh said earlier, "Go, serve Jehovah; only, let your flocks and your herds remain".<a name=147:13></a> But Moses said, "Our cattle also must go with us: there shall not a hoof be left behind; for we must take thereof to serve Jehovah our God".<a name=147:14></a> Today we must have the children and cattle -- everything we have is subservient to this great thought.<a name=147:15></a> Israel's deliverance from Egypt is a wonderful testimony to the power of God on our behalf as we get on to right lines; as we see

		These scriptures, as will have been observed, refer to sticks.<a name=149:1></a> That is why they have been read at this time, as it is believed that the Spirit of God in writing or inditing these passages was providing material for ministry, which He, in due time, would use for the instruction of God's people.<a name=149:2></a> They suggest indeed what a variety of material Scripture contains, deposited as it were with a view to subsequent need and use.<a name=149:3></a> As in the earth, the Creator with wonderful forethought and consideration places such material as should be needed as the human race proceeded on its way.<a name=149:4></a> There are marvellous deposits which are regarded as riches, whether potentially or actually, in the various continents, besides what is called the fulness of the earth, which latter expression signifies what comes out of it by the energy of life.<a name=149:5></a>

		Gold does not come out of the earth on that principle; it is taken out by human strength and the like.<a name=149:6></a> As early as the days of Job, which would probably be patriarchal days, corresponding with the book of Genesis, we have reference to such deposits and the means of securing them, as witnesses of the bounty and forethought of our Creator.<a name=149:7></a> So these scriptures correspondingly contain rich deposits, as I may call them, in view of subsequent needs and exigencies, and it is for those who recognise the Spirit, who has placed them there, to depend on Him under the Lord to bring them out, so that saints should be enriched.<a name=149:8></a>

		in the book of Ezekiel, the book which treats among many other things peculiarly of life.<a name=150:1></a> In chapter 37, which deals with this very matter, and which also treats of the valley of dry bones, you have reference to two sticks.<a name=150:2></a> The woman of Zarephath had in her mind two sticks, but Ezekiel, by the Spirit, speaks of two sticks in a very different way.<a name=150:3></a> The woman had two sticks in her mind in order that she might cook a morsel of food and die.<a name=150:4></a> Ezekiel is directed to have two sticks in his hand, one representing the kingdom of Judah, and the other representing Joseph or the ten tribes.<a name=150:5></a> These two sticks were to be in the prophet's hand and become <i>one</i> there, as a type that all Israel shall be in perfect unity in the end.<a name=150:6></a> And, as applied today, that the saints once divided, once at rivalry, once envious of each other, should now become one.<a name=150:7></a> The opening up of that is in the epistle to the Ephesians and applies to every gathering of the Lord's people, that as in the hand of Christ we should be in the unity of life.<a name=150:8></a> I make those remarks, dear brethren, so that you may see the place this idea of the stick has in the Scripture, and how used, in order that we might put ourselves under that insignificant heading and see what a place gathering has in mind according to God.<a name=150:9></a> The Lord says, "he that gathers not with me scatters", and the idea of gathering runs through these passages.<a name=150:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is in the book of Numbers in a chapter that is speaking about the land of Canaan.<a name=150:11></a> Later the idea of stick arises in regard to a borrowed piece of iron that fell into the Jordan.<a name=150:12></a> The prophet Elisha cuts down a stick and casts it into the water where the axe-head fell, and the axe-head swam; referring to the virtue of the stick.<a name=150:13></a> This is a type, insignificant though it appears, of none less than Christ entering into death; so that we who would have sunk for ever into it are caused to live, and not only to live, but in principle to swim, as superior

	<div class="paragraph">
		Numbers 15 is full of the richest thoughts, as you will see if you look into it.<a name=151:3></a> It begins with most important references typically to christians as to <i>balance</i>, that every main offering, whether a lamb or a larger creature, was to be accompanied by other proportionate offerings.<a name=151:4></a> The larger the creature the larger the accompanying oblations and drink-offerings.<a name=151:5></a> So brothers in assembly should be balanced, their minds should not travel ahead of their hearts, or their affections, and that all should be in power in suitable intelligence.<a name=151:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The worship or service of God is to be conducted in suitable feeling and in balance, as it says, "I will sing with the spirit", meaning that my feelings or affections are in the singing.<a name=151:7></a> But it also says, "I will sing with the understanding also;" meaning that I am not using words that are inappropriate.<a name=151:8></a> Now that is how the chapter begins, and it ends with calling attention to the riband of blue often referred to amongst us, as indicating that we, as believers in Christ, are to shine here as heavenly; that we are to understand that we belong to heaven.<a name=151:9></a> The lace of blue was to be on the corners of their garments, meaning that in a difficult critical moment in our relations with one another, or with others, we maintain a heavenly spirit, and do not give way to the naughty contentions of the flesh.<a name=151:10></a>

		That is how this chapter is encased, as I might say; other beautiful things are also seen.<a name=151:11></a> But now we have this terrible action of a certain person while Israel was in the wilderness.<a name=151:12></a> We are not told just what part of the time this occurred, for they were forty years in the wilderness, and this happened while they were in it.<a name=151:13></a> Inasmuch as the time of this action is not specified, it is to be viewed

		as characteristic, such as was likely to take place at any time, the wilderness being the scene of contrariety; provocative in that way.<a name=152:1></a> But whatever the provocation, dear brethren, the supply to meet it is abundant, and we get it in this very book.<a name=152:2></a> Indeed, in all the wilderness books, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, we get this supply so that there need be no defeat by circumstances.<a name=152:3></a> One of the most difficult things is to keep above our circumstances.<a name=152:4></a> If we get under them, we are pretty sure to do something high-handed, or to say some lawless thing.<a name=152:5></a> If we are above our circumstances we know where to draw from, so that there is nothing of this kind.<a name=152:6></a> In a few verses immediately preceding, there is an allusion to high-handed conduct; a most common thing in christendom.<a name=152:7></a> It began in a general way, sorrowfully near the time of the apostles, indeed, it began in their own times.<a name=152:8></a> Paul speaks of the mystery of iniquity, and while that is a secret thing, high-handed actions soon began to grow out of it, and they have continued ever since; and they are increasing.<a name=152:9></a> There never was a day of boldness such as this; bold opposition to God; to the truth; to Christ, to the assembly; to the Spirit.<a name=152:10></a> Indeed, it culminates in speaking blasphemously against the Spirit of God, a sin which is never to be forgiven.<a name=152:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So this man in the wilderness goes out on the sabbath and gathers sticks.<a name=152:12></a> You might say he was doing no one any harm, but he was doing harm to God; he was calling in question the whole dispensation of God.<a name=152:13></a> The sabbath in the types represents what God has found in Christ and what man finds in Christ by the Spirit.<a name=152:14></a> In these two thoughts christianity essentially is embodied; Christ is the centre for God, and the centre for us.<a name=152:15></a> That is to say, for contemplation, for <i>rest</i>.<a name=152:16></a> God can rest in the midst of a troubled scene, and men can rest in the midst of

		a troubled scene.<a name=153:1></a> That is what the sabbath signifies; it was expressly called the sign of the covenant.<a name=153:2></a> God had on the mount opened up His mind to Moses in the pattern of the tabernacle; in all these chapters, from Exodus 25 to 31, unfolding what He had in mind in a variety of features in the pattern of the tabernacle.<a name=153:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In truth He was occupied all that time with Christ in type; Christ as Man.<a name=153:4></a> What a time God had in unfolding all this to Moses!<a name=153:5></a> Moses did not fully understand, of course, it is for us as having the Spirit to understand.<a name=153:6></a> Moses sought to see the glory of God, but God said, No, only My back parts.<a name=153:7></a> The tabernacle signifies more than His back parts.<a name=153:8></a> The antitype implies the glory of God shining in the face of Jesus.<a name=153:9></a> That is christianity.<a name=153:10></a> But God had Christ before Him in all that He was saying, and He was delighted, and so in the end He refers to the sabbath.<a name=153:11></a> If you will look at the end of chapter 31 you will be impressed by the recurrence of the word there, reminding us of the place it has in the divine thoughts.<a name=153:12></a> You get a statement there that you get nowhere else: "on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed".<a name=153:13></a> We do not get that in Genesis, yet the allusion is to Genesis, but God reserved this precious thought for the particular occasion, when for forty days He had been unfolding the glories of Christ and the universe that centres in Christ; when He finishes He reverts to that, He was refreshed.<a name=153:14></a> Think of the blessed God speaking in that way and embodying His everlasting covenant in it: and He announces His judgment against anyone that disregards the sabbath.<a name=153:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first mention of the sabbath by name is in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16">Exodus  16</a>, and that was in relation to the manna, as no doubt most of you know.<a name=153:16></a> The occasion is very affecting, because it alludes to Christ humbled here; that is, what He was here as Man and how God

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this man has disregarded all this.<a name=154:8></a> In this action of gathering sticks on the sabbath he is setting aside the dispensation.<a name=154:9></a> He is giving a lead typically that has been taken up in christendom and spread abroad, and is seen today in the hierarchy and paraphernalia that belongs to what is called the public worship of God.<a name=154:10></a> There is a disregard of what God had in mind as characterising the whole dispensation.<a name=154:11></a> You can see from the sequence of this conduct how it behoves us, if in any way we are linked up with high-handed conduct such as this, to abandon it for ever; not to stay a moment in it.<a name=154:12></a> It is under the judgment of God; there is no forgiveness for it.<a name=154:13></a> I am not speaking of individuals now, but of the principle of this evil, and we do well to follow the example of Moses and Aaron here, and of Israel.<a name=154:14></a> They put the man under custody; they did not know just what to do; it was a new thing; it was a bold action; he gathered sticks on the sabbath.<a name=154:15></a> It is not said what he was going to do with them.<a name=154:16></a> Satan does not divulge his mind at the outset, it is sometimes in mystery.<a name=154:17></a> He has formulated his opposition to God systematically.<a name=154:18></a>

		That is the position, and, as I say, we do well to put this matter "in custody", as it were, if we do not understand it, and there are thousands and thousands of our brethren who do not.<a name=155:4></a> If we do not quite understand it, put it in custody, that is to say, give it that place in your mind, give it consideration.<a name=155:5></a> Let your language be, I want to judge this thing, I want to consider what you are saying, and I want to arrive at a right judgment about it.<a name=155:6></a> If you do you will get it.<a name=155:7></a> You will be sure to get it, they got it here, and it was summary: "The man shall certainly be put to death", says Jehovah.<a name=155:8></a> Putting to death in this sense today is not to be understood literally.<a name=155:9></a> We read of Jezebel's children being killed with death: that is not literal death -- it is moral death.<a name=155:10></a> There is such a thing as that, the judgment of God executed in a moral way.<a name=155:11></a> As soon as I put the thing in custody, I mark it off as something that requires the mind of God, God will give me His mind about it, and the next thing is to execute it.<a name=155:12></a> What God reveals to you, put into effect.<a name=155:13></a>

		Let no one think that the mere judgment of a thing is of any moral worth, unless it is put into effect.<a name=155:14></a> Holding a thing as wrong and following it, continuing in it, is to damage your soul.<a name=155:15></a> That is the trend of it, to weaken you, to disqualify you for any testimony.<a name=155:16></a> Here God made His mind plain to them, and they carried it out, "as Jehovah commanded Moses".<a name=155:17></a> That is one of the finest statements you get, and God loves that very thing; it is those who have His commandments, and do them, who

		Well, I proceed to the second passage, that in Kings.<a name=156:8></a> It is a well-known chapter, a chapter that introduces to us one of the most notable men in Scripture -- Elijah the prophet.<a name=156:9></a> He was, as you know, maintained by ravens by the brook Cherith, near the Jordan, and the brook dried up, and then God says to him, I have commanded a woman to <i>maintain</i> thee.<a name=156:10></a> Elijah represents the testimony that God has at the moment, and what God has in our day needs to be maintained.<a name=156:11></a> It is obligatory on every one of us to see that we are maintaining it in so far as we are able.<a name=156:12></a> So the prophet wended his way across the country to Zarephath, which is near Zidon, the gentile regions -- the Lord Jesus alludes to this Himself -- and as he arrives at the place he finds this woman gathering sticks, a very suitable occupation under the circumstances so far as it appears.<a name=156:13></a> What is she going to do with them?<a name=156:14></a> That is the point, we may be doing what is apparently right with a wrong thought in our minds.<a name=156:15></a> She gives an account of her work to the prophet; and this raises the whole question as to what we are doing; what each one here has in mind as to <i>his</i> gathering.<a name=156:16></a>

		Now I come on to the last scripture to show how the gathering of sticks works out in the hands of the greatest of servants, for there is no greater than Paul, save the Lord Jesus.<a name=159:1></a> He is in very trying circumstances, he has just had a terrible voyage, a voyage under the government of God which no one felt more than he, he knew the secret of it.<a name=159:2></a> It is a type of the whole voyage, of the testimony.<a name=159:3></a> The breaking up of the ship is a type of the history of the public assembly in its decline and break up -- no one felt it more than Paul, and now he is on land on the island of Melita or Malta in the Mediterranean, a well-known place nowadays.<a name=159:4></a> This remarkable incident took place there, the great servant and those with him reached there in wintertime.<a name=159:5></a> It is always a trying time -- I am speaking now spiritually; winter spiritually is a very trying time.<a name=159:6></a> It comes in the cycle of the year as God says, "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>).<a name=159:7></a> Here it was cold, it says expressly, that it was cold, but the inhabitants of the place received the company.<a name=159:8></a> They are called barbarians, the word of course you know was relative.<a name=159:9></a> It did not mean that they were barbarians in the sense that we speak.<a name=159:10></a> They were not Greeks, but they were a very kindly people, and what a comfort it was to come into a district such as this, especially to find <i>warmth</i>.<a name=159:11></a> The writer says, they showed us no little kindness, it is not said that they were converted, the point was that they were <i>friendly</i>.<a name=159:12></a> You know, fellowship has become a technical thing amongst us.<a name=159:13></a> It may be as cold as ice!<a name=159:14></a> I have been in meetings nominally in fellowship, but cold.<a name=159:15></a> Hence the importance of friendliness, kindly feeling towards visitors, is stressed here.<a name=159:16></a> The "chief man of the island" is mentioned.<a name=159:17></a> Let us not be disrespectful, in these

		So we have the chief man of the island here; he is kindly disposed towards Paul and the others.<a name=160:3></a> It is not simply that people are nominal christians, but it is a question of their kindness, their hospitality, their friendship.<a name=160:4></a> John uses the word "friends".<a name=160:5></a> "Brethren" has become a hackneyed word, not that it has lost its power spiritually.<a name=160:6></a> God would dissipate all unspiritual use of words and bring in the power attaching to them, and what belongs to the term brethren is friendship; friendship <i>must</i> be there.<a name=160:7></a> These were friendly, and so they treated us kindly, the writer tells us, and one of the best things they did at the outset was to light a fire, because it was cold.<a name=160:8></a> How the apostle Paul would cherish that fire; coming up out of the sea, and the terrible time over, when for weeks neither sun nor stars appeared!<a name=160:9></a> Now he is in the midst of friendliness, love, consideration, and the testimony to it in this fire.<a name=160:10></a> Then Paul comes out as a true servant as Jesus was: "I am among you as he that serves", He said.<a name=160:11></a> No true servant today would wear a clerical garb, nor regard himself as one to be set upon a throne and ministered to by all.<a name=160:12></a> Paul becomes the servant of all: he goes out and gathers sticks in that place.<a name=160:13></a> Put him alongside that widow in Zarephath, or that man in the wilderness, and you see the difference.<a name=160:14></a> He gathers "a certain quantity of sticks together in a bundle and laid it on the fire".<a name=160:15></a> He did it all himself, he is like his Master.<a name=160:16></a> The Lord Jesus said, "I am among you as he that serves".<a name=160:17></a> Mark "I am <i>among you</i>".<a name=160:18></a> I believe the Lord Jesus as here with them, would do anything that was to be done for His people.<a name=160:19></a> So with Paul as to those that were with him -- he gathered the sticks and placed them on the fire -- how beautiful that is!<a name=160:20></a> He would keep up the volume of heat

		J.T.<a name=186:1></a> What is in mind is to speak of <i>sanctification</i> as seen in this epistle.<a name=186:2></a> The word appears in each of these scriptures, and the thought advances from the end of the book towards the beginning, where we have the highest thought of sanctification, that is, in chapter 2.<a name=186:3></a> Chapter 13 refers to the sin-offering: "those beasts whose blood is carried as sacrifices for sin into the holy of holies by the high priest, of these the bodies are burned outside the camp.<a name=186:4></a> Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate: therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach".<a name=186:5></a> We have sanctification in this passage in a basic sense.<a name=186:6></a> The Lord suffered outside the gate as a sacrifice for sin, and the believer is to go correspondingly outside the camp to Him, bearing His reproach.<a name=186:7></a> Sanctification thus implies separation from the world, from the religious world particularly.<a name=186:8></a> Then we have in chapter 10 sanctification by the will of God, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all; which enters into our position as partaking of the Lord's supper.<a name=186:9></a>

		Then the Sanctifier and the sanctified are seen as "all of one" in chapter 2, showing how the saints come to Christ's sanctification and correspondence with Christ as the Sanctifier.<a name=186:10></a> If we compare this verse with <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, we shall see that He is the measure of our sanctification, as glorified in heaven, but this verse in chapter 2 brings us into what corresponds with Him in the sense of order or character of humanity.<a name=186:11></a> That is "as <i>he</i> is, <i>we</i> also are in this world" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>), and hence He is not ashamed to call us brethren.<a name=186:12></a>

		These scriptures speak of certain things shown, or told of, divinely and hence they are read; also to link up with what is divinely shown to God's people in the thought of pressure.<a name=250:1></a> Pressure is evident in these scriptures, not indeed in the actual verse in 2 Chronicles but in the section in 1 Chronicles to which they allude we have the pressure.<a name=250:2></a> Pressure is a means employed by God in His formative operations, and hence we are to know something of it, if we are to be formed according to the divine design for us.<a name=250:3></a> This applies to each of us and to all of us viewed as a whole.<a name=250:4></a> Pressure, from heat or from weight, in solid matter or water, is the means used.<a name=250:5></a> In the creation and in many other instances it serves to symbolise what God is doing in His people; for in truth He is operating on the line of new creation.<a name=250:6></a> The idea of the first and second applies.<a name=250:7></a> He takes away the first that He may establish the second; the second is what He has in mind; it is what is to remain, what is being established.<a name=250:8></a> The idea of pressure is seen in it just as it appears in the first.<a name=250:9></a> And so, dear brethren, I bring it forward that we may think of it, and not take ourselves out of the way of it, as God may see necessary to apply it, for in it He intends to carry on His great work of the second creation, or new creation.<a name=250:10></a> By pressure He effects formation, as I said; it may be seen constantly throughout the whole realm of the physical system, and in it as God places us and brings it upon us He would seize opportunities to show us what we may need in the pressure.<a name=250:11></a> Whilst He allows and causes the pressure, He also operates through our minds, for we are not inanimate material; we are

		J.T.<a name=280:1></a> Brethren will understand that our object in these readings is not only to call attention to the fact of the Spirit's presence here in a doctrinal way, but to speak of Him as here in a substantial, spiritually tangible way, so that each christian may be able to determine how much he proves and realises the presence of the Spirit, so that our christianity may not be merely a matter of doctrine or theory, but in reality, enjoyment and power.<a name=280:2></a> We have already considered chapter 4, which, with chapter 7, treats of the Spirit as typified by water.<a name=280:3></a> We noted first of all the symbol of a dove as suggestive of the totality of the Spirit here coming on Jesus (chapter 1) and then as wind effecting the new birth (chapter 3); and then in chapter 4, as we said we had water, another tangible suggestion.<a name=280:4></a> What came before us, among many other things, as to chapter 4 was that it was the Spirit from the standpoint of satisfaction.<a name=280:5></a> Water as being drunk suggests satisfaction.<a name=280:6></a> We have in chapter 6 the idea of food, the bread that came down from heaven, which is for building up our constitution, for support; but water symbolises refreshment or satisfaction.<a name=280:7></a> The effect and bearing of chapter 4 is towards God, or at least upward, in the believer.<a name=280:8></a> It is said to be a fountain springing up into everlasting life, a fountain of water.<a name=280:9></a> That is, it is the Spirit affecting us so that He acts in us automatically, not necessarily through our intelligence.<a name=280:10></a> He operates in the automatic organs so to speak in the sense that there is a springing up into everlasting life, into the realm of unending satisfaction.<a name=280:11></a> In chapter 7 He is seen in the converse way of flowing out in testimony.<a name=280:12></a> It is formally stated, in this passage, that the Lord in the use of the figure

		J.T.<a name=297:11></a> Firstly, that the Spirit is a divine Person, another Comforter.<a name=297:12></a> The Lord Himself was here as a Comforter, in that character with the disciples, and the Spirit would also be here as a Comforter, another Comforter.<a name=297:13></a> The original word denotes that the Spirit would be here beside, or alongside us to look after our affairs, to take full charge of our affairs.<a name=297:14></a> So the truth of His presence enters peculiarly into meetings like this, assembly meetings.<a name=297:15></a> The bearing of the word is towards us in a collective sense.<a name=297:16></a> The earlier teaching which we have already had bears on the individual; it is one born anew, or one drinking, asking for living water.<a name=297:17></a> It is individual

		J.T.<a name=306:10></a> Quite so, and that would open up a good deal of what is called ministry meetings, a new appellation as to meetings.<a name=306:11></a> What is in mind is the meeting contemplated in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>, where the whole assembly is said to come together in one place, where a brother has something, and another brother, and another.<a name=306:12></a> All these 'somethings' may be a word for the moment, a given word, what the Spirit is saying.<a name=306:13></a> It shows how important these meetings are, that the brethren come together in dependence on the Lord so that the Spirit has scope to speak.<a name=306:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=306:17></a> That is what is required.<a name=306:18></a> The apostle urges on prophecy, and, indeed, instruction comes into it, "And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:29">1 Corinthians  14:29</a>).<a name=306:19></a> That is the point, it is for prophetic ministry, not to announce coming events, but to bring God in.<a name=306:20></a>

		The subject in mind is walking with God.<a name=317:1></a> It has a very great place in the Scriptures, and it appears in the first scripture significantly as addressed to young christians.<a name=317:2></a> The Thessalonians had been converted only a short time; they had "turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and to await his Son from the heavens"(<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:9">1 Thessalonians  1:9</a>, 10).<a name=317:3></a> Their conversion was thus very genuine and definite.<a name=317:4></a> But they had not long been converted in this way when the Spirit of God saw it needful that they should be addressed in an epistle.<a name=317:5></a> In chapter 4 the apostle Paul, seems to have come to the end of what he had in mind, and in his usual way he says, "For the rest", that is, whatever remained to be said.<a name=317:6></a> He had said what he mainly had in mind.<a name=317:7></a> He urges on them this matter of 'walk', how they should walk and please God.<a name=317:8></a> He had already touched on the matter, and not without effect, for, as in all else, they were proving themselves genuine, a great matter.<a name=317:9></a> As weeks elapse after conversion what marks converts is a matter of great interest, for the mere conversion or turning to God may be regarded as a historical thing, and what normally should flow from it may be neglected.<a name=317:10></a> The apostle had not overlooked this, and as he said, had spoken to them.<a name=317:11></a> He says, "Ye have received from us how ye ought to walk and please God".<a name=317:12></a> Not only had he put it before them, but they had received what he put before them.<a name=317:13></a> It is a matter of urgent importance for young christians not only to listen but to receive the ministry and to receive it honestly.<a name=317:14></a> They had done this, but the writer, the great apostle Paul, was concerned that the work of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before touching further on this scripture, I would remark on the great fact that God is the first to be spoken of as having walked, and it was concurrent with the temptings of the serpent which led to the alienation of the heart of Adam and Eve from God.<a name=318:4></a> That is the first record we have of walking, and the allusion is not so much to the walk as to the voice that accompanied the walk.<a name=318:5></a> Adam had heard the voice of the Lord God walking; the voice is what he heard, not the footsteps.<a name=318:6></a> That is to say, a voice, conveying God in His feelings, what He is; and what feelings, dear brethren, must have filled Him at this juncture.<a name=318:7></a> Whilst God knows everything from beginning to end, He is a feeling God, and nothing occurs in regard to His people, but is felt by Him.<a name=318:8></a> We are told later that man's conduct was a grief to him every day.<a name=318:9></a> What a new experience it was to God, speaking reverently, as on this eventful occasion the garden was occupied (indeed one could hardly call it occupied, for they were hiding) by alienated hearts, by hearts that had proved untrue, disloyal.<a name=318:10></a> God feels that; there is nothing God feels more than disloyalty.<a name=318:11></a> His voice, we may be sure, would be changed, if indeed it could be discerned with these feelings.<a name=318:12></a> But He was walking, and He has been walking ever since.<a name=318:13></a> As the matter of sin, the matter of the disloyalty between His creatures and Himself was gone into, He continued on.<a name=318:14></a> That is His way was before Him; it necessarily took on different features, but it was the way of God; one of the most interesting epithets or phrases you can get is the way of God.<a name=318:15></a> A great believer, Apollos,

		I am not going into detail, but to remind you, dear brethren, that what we are enjoying, here tonight and what is enjoyed throughout the world is, under God, due to the devotedness of certain men and women about one hundred years ago, who as they were guided by the Spirit of God, made enquiries into the prophets.<a name=332:6></a> Those who know bear witness to the fact that prophecy was the chief enquiry at the beginning of this wonderful revival that we now are sharing in; and hence the importance of Peter's word as to it.<a name=332:7></a> In the first letter he says that the prophets enquired into the salvation which the saints were at that time enjoying.<a name=332:8></a> They, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the others, enquired as to the application of their prophecies, and it was revealed to them, Peter tells us, that the things they ministered were not unto themselves but unto us.<a name=332:9></a> They searched "what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:11">1 Peter  1:11</a>).<a name=332:10></a> And it says that it was revealed to them that these ministrations were not to themselves, but unto us, looking on to the things ministered in the gospel by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.<a name=332:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		So he says, "Until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts", that is the point, the dawning of the day.<a name=335:2></a> The world, the christian world, has assumed a shroud of darkness as the ancient heathen world had, but there is light in the holy scriptures, inclusive of the prophets, and the Spirit of God remains here, a wonderful fact.<a name=335:3></a> As indeed is said in the prophet Haggai, "The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit, remain among you" (<a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:5">Haggai  2:5</a>).<a name=335:4></a> Think of that fact as we sit here tonight; it is not a mere theoretical position, but the word of the covenant and the Spirit of God remain here.<a name=335:5></a> Think of this marvellous fact that we as believers are indwelt by the Holy Spirit as the Comforter, and we have the word of the covenant.<a name=335:6></a> Well, now, Peter says, in regard of this certainty, this confirmation of the prophets, that it is until the day dawn.<a name=335:7></a> And, dear brethren, one would enquire as to this dawn: "Until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts".<a name=335:8></a> The dawn is a great general thought.<a name=335:9></a> Many of us have seen it; as the sun begins to rise, or to be more accurate, as the earth revolves and the glimmerings of the great orb appear above the horizon, how full of hope it is; it has a peculiar effect on the observant mind.<a name=335:10></a> Peter alludes to it here, the dawn of the day of the glory of Christ is to be observed already, the sufferings stood in relation to the glory, the glory that is to follow.<a name=335:11></a> The rays of the rising sun are to be observed already, not indeed in the political sky.<a name=335:12></a> Let no one be deceived by the political sky.<a name=335:13></a> God is not operating there yet.<a name=335:14></a> Things are happening in the world, but Peter is alluding to what is happening in the believer's heart, in our hearts.<a name=335:15></a> There are those who scan Europe, and we know from the prophets what

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=358:1></a> It was remarked in the previous reading that what was in mind was the bearing of this typical book on the service of God.<a name=358:2></a> It implies the saints entering on <i>their</i> inheritance -- taking possession with a view to God having <i>His</i> inheritance.<a name=358:3></a> His inheritance is the saints -- the saints as He would have them; that is, clothed and enriched with their heavenly portion, so as to serve Him.<a name=358:4></a> We enlarged this morning on the dominical side of the service of God, which is really introductory to what we are speaking of now.<a name=358:5></a> It has reference to the wilderness side of our position; that is, for the individual as in Romans; and for the assembly as in Corinthians.<a name=358:6></a> This stands in relation to the Lord's supper; not in the gospels, but in the first epistle to the Corinthians, which gives us the doctrine of it.<a name=358:7></a> It is not God's supper, or the Father's supper; it is the <i>Lord's</i> supper; therefore, it involves subjection.<a name=358:8></a> The importance of this side of the position is seen in the types, in that the glory enters the tabernacle in relation to the service of Moses.<a name=358:9></a> As the glory enters, it is significantly intimated that the service of Moses is no longer needed.<a name=358:10></a> Moses could not enter, we are told; as if God took charge of the saints viewed there typically as pleasing to Him.<a name=358:11></a> It is to show the result reached as the brethren are in subjection; each is in his place, and functioning in his place.<a name=358:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Following the dominical side as set forth in Moses' ministry, it is emphatically stated, in the first chapter of this book, that "Moses my servant is dead".<a name=358:13></a> Yet the service is to go on, the service of God.<a name=358:14></a> There is to be no void.<a name=358:15></a> Joshua, who had been Moses' attendant during all the period, we may say of his service, is here; one upon whom Moses

		had laid his hands.<a name=359:1></a> It is said, in the end of Deuteronomy, that the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses; so that the allegiance went on.<a name=359:2></a> Hence the new position is to be taken up on the same principle, namely obedience.<a name=359:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joshua represents another view of Christ.<a name=359:4></a> As seen in Joshua, Christ is presented in Romans and Corinthians; for whilst the authority of Moses runs into the book of Joshua, what Joshua represents extends back to the beginning of Moses' ministerial history.<a name=359:5></a> Joshua is just another side, or feature, of Christ -- the hidden side -- connected with our exercises.<a name=359:6></a> In chapter 1 obedience to what Moses had said is enjoined, and Joshua brings forward the two and a half tribes as completing the idea of administrative unity in the twelve.<a name=359:7></a> The administrative idea, involving love, runs right through.<a name=359:8></a> In Joshua 1, 2, and 3 the tentative side of the position is seen; but we must never lose sight of the unity -- the saints as one body; otherwise we shall be partisan or sectarian.<a name=359:9></a> On these lines of subjection and unity there is no possibility of defeat -- we go right through; so that there is every encouragement given to Joshua that God will be with him.<a name=359:10></a> Thus as to chapter 2, it was pointed out that the work of God is seen by itself.<a name=359:11></a> Rahab as the subject of it does not mention any minister; she mentions what God did for Israel in the overthrow of death in the Red Sea, and subsequently, what Israel did themselves in the overthrow of Sihon and Og, the latter the big man; that is done by themselves.<a name=359:12></a> It is obvious therefore, that we have to do that in a spiritual sense, to make room for one new man; for our old man has been crucified with Christ.<a name=359:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=361:8></a> It seems important instruction.<a name=361:9></a> In the first chapter it includes the idea of victuals; the food is not specified, as it is left to us to determine what we need to eat.<a name=361:10></a> It would seem that the three days in chapter 2 would establish the teaching of the chapter in linking what is in Canaan with what is still the other side of Jordan.<a name=361:11></a> That is, the spies go back greater men than they were, for they go back <i>another way</i>, I suppose the idea is that we do not enter Canaan as strangers; there are those there with whom we are linked.<a name=361:12></a> The link would be in this <i>other way:</i> their remarks and hers mingle beautifully; they are all in line with what is subjective and continuous.<a name=361:13></a> It would be one of the sure signs of the truth; things would be on a sure footing; and the spies, instead of using the word "cord", refer to "scarlet thread" (verse 18) -- what is distinctive.<a name=361:14></a> What is of God is distinctive; the work of God in us makes us definite.<a name=361:15></a> The line of scarlet thread would allude, I think, to what is constitutional.<a name=361:16></a> The cord

		J.T.<a name=418:1></a> What is in mind for the two readings ahead of us, in the main, is conflict, but I believe the Lord would have us to take a cursory view of the subject we have been engaged with, namely, qualification for the service of God, as it is pursued throughout the remainder of this book.<a name=418:2></a> Nothing is more evident than that these books one after the other are cumulative, and that the service of God is in view throughout, until we reach David.<a name=418:3></a> We read, in Stephen's address, that Moses had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, and that it was carried over with Joshua into the land; and so it is in view in Joshua, Judges, and Samuel.<a name=418:4></a> Stephen says, until the days of David, "who found favour before God", who had desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob; but Solomon built him a house.<a name=418:5></a> The thread culminates in that way in the types, in David and Solomon.<a name=418:6></a>

		In order to have a clear outlook as to this book, it may be observed that Joshua himself worships, according to the first passage read from chapter 5, and that he sets up an altar, chapter 8, and offers up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.<a name=418:7></a> According to chapter 8, the direction of Moses in Deuteronomy is carried out as to the altar at mount Ebal, and the stones on which the law was written.<a name=418:8></a> The altar is not only set up, but there are offerings.<a name=418:9></a> Then we have the tabernacle again as seen in Shiloh; and Joshua carries on the thought of service in finally asserting, as to himself and his house, that they would serve the Lord.<a name=418:10></a> He denounces idolatry, and enjoins the people against it; and gives them an example, carrying down the great thought in Abraham as to the house -- as to him and his house, they

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we have the provision for and the great subject of the Levites in this book, who are seen generally in Deuteronomy and Joshua as priests.<a name=419:3></a> The distinction between Levites and priests is small, for what is in mind is the heavenly calling of the saints, as over against the earthly calling of God.<a name=419:4></a> The service of God is, in that way, amply provided for in this book, as carrying it forward.<a name=419:5></a> It is a transitional state of things, until <i>He</i> came, who had been in the mind of God, who would do all God's will; that is, Christ seen typically in David.<a name=419:6></a> The Levites are provided for, as marked off, and as having no inheritance on earth; so that the heavenly calling is peculiarly stressed in relation to the service of God in this book.<a name=419:7></a> So the Lord, in Luke, as the levites returned from their successful labours, reminded them of their heavenly calling; their names being written in heaven.<a name=419:8></a> They are to rejoice in that connection, the Lord introducing the whole matter into the realm of the Father in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>.<a name=419:9></a> I thought it well to sketch the service of God, so as to show that the levites, the heavenly family, are linked up with the Father in Luke.<a name=419:10></a> That is the great culmination of the service of God.<a name=419:11></a>

		The thought now is to proceed, as the Lord may help us, to see how the military side contributes to this as <i>securing the inheritance;</i> and what may be observed is -- so as to have a clear outline before us -- that the result is attained through bitter experiences amongst the saints, occasioned by failure.<a name=419:12></a> The end is reached, but in a most humiliating way.<a name=419:13></a> The result reached in Joshua 8 should have been reached as Israel entered into the land, for what was done according to that chapter was enjoined to take place as they reached the land -- the rearing of the altar

		These scriptures speak of the power of God -- that is why I have read them, wishing to consider this great matter from the point of view of the first scripture, which says, "the power that worketh in us".<a name=459:1></a> There is power operative otherwise, creatorial power involving all the kingdoms, as we may speak of them, of creation, especially those involving life; the power of God is operative every day in giving life.<a name=459:2></a> In Him, it is said, indeed, that we all live and move and have our being; a great matter that is surely to be included in our faith.<a name=459:3></a> Indeed, the wide creation, far beyond, not merely our comprehension, but our apprehension, is dependent on the power of the Creator.<a name=459:4></a> "By faith we apprehend", we are told, "that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>).<a name=459:5></a> They are poised and kept going, not as left to themselves, but by the power of God.<a name=459:6></a> Then there is governmental power operative all the time, especially since the placing of the cherubim in Eden, and, coming down to our own times, it is a matter of great consequence as holding the power of evil in check.<a name=459:7></a> We could not be here tonight, dear brethren, otherwise, and surely it is a matter to be held in our minds, in our believing minds.<a name=459:8></a> There is the good side to it; the powers are appointed for good, as it is said, "it is God's minister to thee for good" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:4">Romans  13:4</a>).<a name=459:9></a> This could scarcely be so, aside from the discriminative adjusting power of God in government.<a name=459:10></a> The powers are forced to be good, for God is with government, in whomsoever's hands it may be.<a name=459:11></a> Our Lord will presently sit as a priest on His throne, and all will be regulated by Him according to His own heart.<a name=459:12></a> Today God has to operate through the bit and bridle, but nevertheless effectively, for the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am thinking, however, as I said, of the power that worketh in us, the power that normally marks a believer from the very outset of his being, even before his birth, as seen in some.<a name=460:2></a> We have this inherent power, as I may call it, only in a relative sense in us, but nevertheless really so.<a name=460:3></a> We have it illustrated in a most remarkable way in unborn children -- the power of supplanting, for instance; in Jacob we have a striking illustration of what I am saying of the power of God.<a name=460:4></a> It may begin in a small way, but its potentialities are marked at the beginning.<a name=460:5></a> Here is an unborn child that will supplant one whom God will ultimately hate; he is doing something -- struggling -- and as they were born he took his brother by the heel to supplant him.<a name=460:6></a> So that we have in Jacob in result, one whom God loves; it is the operation of God's power.<a name=460:7></a>

		So with another, whose name indeed gave me my text, who is spoken of as breaking forth, a great principle in the living kingdom, the kingdom of life, whether it be plant, animal, or saint -- the power of breaking forth, breaking through, so as to excel.<a name=460:8></a> In Pharez, (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#38">Genesis  38</a>) to whom I allude, we have one who broke forth, one who acquired his name thus, and who became famous in Israel.<a name=460:9></a> He is the progenitor of Boaz, of Obed, and of David.<a name=460:10></a> We have to look, dear brethren, at these initial movements.<a name=460:11></a> We have these examples, and they are examples of more than themselves.<a name=460:12></a> The creation as a testimony from God is full of those things, for it is a question of God; God working in us, working subjectively to accomplish results.<a name=460:13></a> So much is it so in the case of Pharez, that in the book of Ruth the genealogy begins with <i>him</i> instead of with Judah (<a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#4">Ruth  4</a>).<a name=460:14></a> He is owned to be Judah's son, but if God wishes to bring forth a worshipper, and the sweet psalmist of Israel,

		He begins with Pharez.<a name=461:1></a> It is a question of potentialities in these initial movements of God.<a name=461:2></a> We see the power of life operating.<a name=461:3></a> On the one hand we have a man whom Jehovah loves -- "Jacob have I loved" -- his very name denoting that he had displaced somebody, and <i>that</i> somebody was hated of God; surely that is an exploit.<a name=461:4></a> To be in the mind of God in this way from one's beginning is surely something to be thought of, and to be nurtured and encouraged.<a name=461:5></a> So that we have, as I said, in Pharez, the progenitor of Obed, a worshipper -- the thought developed in David, the leader of the praises of Israel.<a name=461:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak of all this, dear brethren, that we might be on the look-out for these things; what God is doing according to the power that worketh in us.<a name=461:7></a> We have again in John the baptist a signal exemplification of what I am saying; as unborn he was capable of joy as the sound of the voice of the mother of Jesus fell upon his mother's ear.<a name=461:8></a> How great a thing that is, as suggesting how we are bound up together in the wonderful organism into which we are brought.<a name=461:9></a> With Jacob it was to supplant what God hated; with Pharez, to excel, and how could he excel more than in the development of the praises of Israel, the worship of God?<a name=461:10></a> It is the great thought for the moment that God is stressing amongst His people -- His service; and then the permeating joy as seen in the baptist.<a name=461:11></a> Its fulness was experienced as he heard the Bridegroom's voice.<a name=461:12></a> It is a question of Christ in relation to the object of His affection, and, dear brethren, we want to be sympathetic with Him in that; what He has secured at such infinite cost.<a name=461:13></a> John was the friend of the Bridegroom and rejoiced as he heard His voice.<a name=461:14></a> He had heard another voice, the voice of Mary coming to him through his mother; now he hears directly the voice of the Bridegroom and his

		Well now, this passage in Ephesians 3 -- confirmatory of all I have been saying, as I believe you will agree -- is the outcome of a prayer.<a name=462:8></a> It is one of the two prayers of Paul recorded in this epistle.<a name=462:9></a> The first, in chapter 1, related to the intelligence of the saints; that we might have the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God, and that we might know, among other things, "the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead".<a name=462:10></a> In this second prayer, what is in mind is the Father's Spirit; the apostle is thinking of the Father, not now exactly as representing the dispensation of grace, but as naming the families; that there are families and that He names them all.<a name=462:11></a> Then that the Father would operate in the brethren; in the Ephesians, and of course in ourselves now, by His Spirit, and that it should be according to the riches of His glory.<a name=462:12></a> Think of the beautiful ornamentation surrounding this point that the apostle has in mind; the wealth of thought in which it is encased!<a name=462:13></a> It is like a jewel in a proper setting.<a name=462:14></a> The passage ends with a doxology.<a name=462:15></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now wish to go on to show how practically this power bursts forth, first in Isaiah.<a name=464:4></a> Isaiah is full, I may say, of this sort of thing.<a name=464:5></a> He contemplates the work of God in God's people, and the ultimate results according to it; not simply that the counsels of God will be fulfilled, but that the power that works in us will go through, and carry us through to finality.<a name=464:6></a> This verse in chapter 14 contemplates the fall of Babylon, a very significant fact of which Isaiah speaks exultingly.<a name=464:7></a> He is a prophet of great feeling, and feeling with God about things; so he puts into the mouth of the people of God a proverb against Babylon, now that she is doomed.<a name=464:8></a> The whole world had suffered from the king of Babylon, as he is spoken of here, and so the proverb runs, "The whole earth is at rest, is quiet: they break forth into singing".<a name=464:9></a> In our own times this is a very significant matter, one of the most significant of the public occurrences in the history of the assembly is the fall of Babylon.<a name=464:10></a> She will never be revived to what she was -- Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and has become the cage of every foul and hateful bird.<a name=464:11></a> But presently a greater calamity is coming -- her complete destruction; never to be revived.<a name=464:12></a> As a millstone is cast into the sea, so shall she be; not indeed lost to the judgment of God, but ever present to it, as it is said, "her smoke goes up to the ages of ages".<a name=464:13></a> Such has been her guilt that her judgment remains, stands out, as it were, eternally, and God would bring us to a judgment about all this.<a name=464:14></a> God says by

		the Spirit, that He judges our judgment upon her; that is, the judgment of heaven and of the apostles <i>and</i> of the saints.<a name=465:1></a> If we work with God in our judgment, He works with us, He loves to do it.<a name=465:2></a> The judicial glories of God are very great, it is one of the features of His glory, and He calls us into it; to be with Him in what He does.<a name=465:3></a> As Babylon falls and is destroyed, heaven is called upon to praise, to rejoice -- and so it does; the mighty multitude of voices join in harmony, that God has executed His wrath on that great harlot, the corruptress of the earth.<a name=465:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the result of all this, as you will see, is the release of what God seeks, namely, praise.<a name=465:5></a> Babylon has shackled the saints and she continues to do so; indeed all that is of her kind, in the religious world, also does so; it is intended by Satan to do it -- to prevent the praises; but they break forth; it is a question of power -- the power that works in us.<a name=465:6></a> It can be employed in no greater way than the breaking forth of divine praises.<a name=465:7></a> Will not God release His people?<a name=465:8></a> He <i>is</i> doing it.<a name=465:9></a> It is our business, too, to help Him, that God should have His praises.<a name=465:10></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, the great sorrow psalm, that which depicts the sufferings of Christ as none other does, exceeds in this matter.<a name=465:11></a> The cry of Christ there, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=465:12></a>" shows how He went to those depths in relation to the praises of Israel, the praises of God; as He says, "Thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel".<a name=465:13></a> As come forth in resurrection, His word, as given to us by the Spirit in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>, is, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".<a name=465:14></a> There will be a universe of praise to God, through Christ, but it is now going on in the assembly; we are having part in it now; let everyone take it to heart, God is calling us into this great matter.<a name=465:15></a> So here, as Babylon is overthrown, the word is, "the whole earth is at rest, is quiet: they break forth into singing;" and

	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, I wish to dwell on these three mighty men of David.<a name=466:2></a> We are brought back to John the baptist in his beautiful regard for Christ; how his joy was full at hearing the Bridegroom's voice.<a name=466:3></a> He was near enough to know what that voice meant; it is not simply the words, it is the voice of the Bridegroom.<a name=466:4></a> Let us understand, dear brethren, such a sound as that -- the voice of the Bridegroom, and how John is affected by it.<a name=466:5></a> He says, "my joy is fulfilled".<a name=466:6></a> A perfectly satisfied man, he disappears more than satisfied, his joy is fulfilled.<a name=466:7></a> Will not every one of us, as lovers of Christ, have a fulfilled joy in what we see in Him and in what He has in His <i>heart;</i> what He has in His bride; what the assembly is to Christ?<a name=466:8></a> I would like to come into that now, just to know what He thinks about the assembly, what He feels about it, what His affections are as to it.<a name=466:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it is no question here with David of the bride, but something that his heart longed for, and the enemy stood between him and it.<a name=466:10></a> There are many such things, dear brethren -- the well at the gate of Bethlehem is well known; the Lord knows those that are His.<a name=466:11></a> He knows what joys He has had from some of them, but has no longer, alas!<a name=466:12></a> I often picture the Lord looking down on Palestine, Asia Minor, Greece and Italy, and North Africa, and countries nearer to us; what He must feel as He reflects on what He once had in those countries.<a name=466:13></a> He has not forgotten anything -- what Ephesus was and what joys He had there.<a name=466:14></a> He says later, "thou hast left thy first love" -- He missed that.<a name=466:15></a> There are many, living today, who yielded to Christ in times past, but the enemy has come in between Him and them.<a name=466:16></a> He is longing for the springing well -- for it is really the same thought -- springing up in affection to Him.<a name=466:17></a> "The water which I shall give him", says

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My point here is that these three mighties broke through.<a name=467:16></a> They knew what David longed for.<a name=467:17></a> The assembly is the great thought of Christ for the moment, the one predominating thought throughout the dispensation.<a name=467:18></a> The gospel is subservient to it.<a name=467:19></a> The Lord has lost much through Satan's work, the enemy has come in, and it is a question now of breaking forth, laying down our lives, taking our lives in our hands, to get for Christ what He longs for.<a name=467:20></a> What does He long for?<a name=467:21></a> For the assembly; what He is robbed of in its members.<a name=467:22></a> So that certainly one might say to the brethren, our work is well defined; let nobody mistake it.<a name=467:23></a> The gospel, of course, is the work of the evangelist -- preach the word instant in season and out of season -- but it is all to get what Christ's heart is set for.<a name=467:24></a> We <i>know</i> what He wants -

		Now I need not remind you how often this thought of "twelve" appears in Exodus, and really it is always a question of the saints -- the shew bread, the twelve names on the breastplate of the high priest, and it is all founded on obedience.<a name=476:14></a> What pleasure could there be for God in having the loaves, "the bread of the presence", save as the underlying principle of obedience is there?<a name=476:15></a> What place has anyone morally in the breastplate of Jesus, save as the principle of obedience is there?<a name=476:16></a> Inside that breastplate, in His heart, is the law of God.<a name=476:17></a> He magnified the law, He made it honourable.<a name=476:18></a> Can He make it honourable by putting disobedient persons on that breastplate?<a name=476:19></a> No, dear brethren, the underlying principle in Exodus is obedience; the number

		J.T.<a name=485:1></a> What is in mind is that we might dwell a little on the relation of the servants of the Lord to those ministered to.<a name=485:2></a> The first two scriptures are expressions of the apostle Paul, the leading minister of Christ, showing how he regarded the saints, even when they were in a low condition.<a name=485:3></a> In the second epistle he was a servant to the Corinthians "for Jesus' sake".<a name=485:4></a> It seems that in view of what is about to be unveiled -- that is, the saints in their millennial and eternal relations -- the Lord would lay it upon us that they should be rightly regarded as we serve them.<a name=485:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:9">Revelation  3:9</a> the Lord intimates that the saints, as in His mind (inclusive of all regarded as of the assembly, whilst, of course, it is remnant times) are to be done homage to in whatever manner He may bring it about.<a name=485:6></a> He says, "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that <i>I</i> have loved thee".<a name=485:7></a> It is evidently in view of what the Revelation opens up to us in chapter 21, the assembly in its eternal and millennial relations, that the Spirit greatly stresses its greatness.<a name=485:8></a> I thought also that it would augment the truth to bring forward what the two great ministers of the Old Testament -- Moses and David -- say of the saints, in the passages read.<a name=485:9></a>

		THE SERVICE OF WOMEN IN LUKE'S GOSPEL

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=503:1></a> Other scriptures in Luke entering into our subject are more familiar to us perhaps than these, and we shall need to touch on them.<a name=503:2></a> The first is in chapter 4; Peter's wife's mother who "served them" after she was healed.<a name=503:3></a> Then the woman in chapter 7, well known to us, who loved much and served accordingly.<a name=503:4></a> Then Martha, in chapter 10, who also served, but was herself in a complaining critical state; and then the women at the sepulchre, mentioned in chapter 24, who would serve the Lord, but as thinking He was dead when He was already alive.<a name=503:5></a> They were serving ignorantly, and hence to no purpose.<a name=503:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We should see to begin with what is mentioned in chapter 8, namely, that service in women is seen as related to <i>the new system of things</i> which the Lord had inaugurated in principle, so that we may see that, in whatever way we serve in detail, we are serving to one purpose, serving in relation to the administrative system that has been set up.<a name=503:7></a> We are not to be independent or isolated in our thoughts, but having one end in view; all is to be done in relation to the Lord <i>and</i> those representing His authority -- the twelve.<a name=503:8></a> The passage says that the twelve were with Him; alluding to this official system into which His authority entered; authority which must extend to all service.<a name=503:9></a> So it says that the twelve were with Him, and the passage shows that the "certain women" were related to them in principle -- "certain women who had been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities, Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna

		and many others, who ministered to him of their substance" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:2">Luke  8:2</a>, 3).<a name=504:1></a> They were with Him; not seen here as serving in their houses or in any isolated way, but in relation to Him and the twelve.<a name=504:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another thing to be noticed is what Zacharias says, speaking by the Spirit, in chapter 1: ".<a name=504:3></a>.<a name=504:4></a>.<a name=504:5></a> that, saved out of the hand of our enemies, we should serve him without fear .<a name=504:6></a>.<a name=504:7></a>.<a name=504:8></a>" These remarks by Zacharias, I think, govern what we are speaking of in regard to the state in which we serve, that is, ".<a name=504:9></a>.<a name=504:10></a>.<a name=504:11></a> to give us, that, saved out of the hand of our enemies, we should serve him without fear in piety and righteousness before him all our days" (verses 74, 75).<a name=504:12></a> The object in view, therefore, is to see how Luke links up the service seen in the women in his gospel with the system of things Christ has inaugurated.<a name=504:13></a> Of course it refers to men, too, but the thought is to bring out the subjective conditions which women usually represent.<a name=504:14></a> This system seems to fit in after the wonderful appreciation of grace shown in chapter 7; the great grace chapter, as we might say -- not only of grace shown, but grace <i>valued</i>, grace <i>received</i>.<a name=504:15></a> She is forgiven much, hence serves much; loves much, and serves accordingly, as if that sort of result of the gospel must immediately be connected with the systematised order of things which God has set up, for it must not be linked with man's organisations, it must be linked with God's.<a name=504:16></a> It is too great for anything else, and every true believer in the gospel is in this position.<a name=504:17></a> It speaks of Mary, from whom seven demons had gone out.<a name=504:18></a> It would seem that it is not the act of power that is stressed here, but rather the condition that had arisen.<a name=504:19></a> So that the position of the demons was untenable -- they had <i>gone</i> out.<a name=504:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=505:2></a> That is what I thought; that chapter 8 is spiritually needed; the system is needed for such a result of the gospel.<a name=505:3></a> The Lord turns to the woman in speaking to Simon, as if to rebuke, on the one hand, the wretched attitude of the natural religious man, and on the other to extol the result of grace in the believer.<a name=505:4></a> He turns to the woman, as if <i>she</i> is the person of importance now.<a name=505:5></a> The legal system which Simon represented is left; is turned away from; the woman is now the material; the kind of personnel that belongs to the new system, and it must be provided; nothing less will do.<a name=505:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.W.<a name=505:7></a>B.<a name=505:8></a> Does the fact that the divine system is necessarily connected with the service imply that, though begun individually, in its normal development, the service of God must be collective?<a name=505:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=505:10></a> That is exactly what I had in mind as seen in the beginning of chapter 8.<a name=505:11></a> Notice it is "the glad tidings of the kingdom of God", that is the appellation by which the gospel is described here, involving system, too -- the kingdom of God.<a name=505:12></a> Then the twelve were with Him, and certain women who ministered to Him <i>of their substance</i>.<a name=505:13></a> Of course it would be material things, but substance, from the point of view of which we are speaking, would be spiritual.<a name=505:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=505:15></a> It says, they were healed of wicked spirits, and of infirmities, as though these two conditions had been met, the power of evil on the one hand, and also the matter of infirmities.<a name=505:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=505:17></a> Well, that is salvation in a double way, from the power of evil and from illnesses or infirmities.<a name=505:18></a> The latter would hinder, too; we may be delivered from the demons and yet not from the infirmities.<a name=505:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=506:2></a> Yes, it shows, I suppose, the energy in the service.<a name=506:3></a> Later on we are told that the women by the cross had followed Him from Galilee -- it shows the energy of affection.<a name=506:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=506:5></a>U.<a name=506:6></a> Is the securing of these women for service in any way connected with the activities of the anointed Man?<a name=506:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=506:8></a> You mean beginning with chapter 4, where He is seen as anointed.<a name=506:9></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=506:10></a> That brings us to the first case we have noted, namely, the mother-in-law of Simon.<a name=506:11></a> That was household service, as you might say.<a name=506:12></a> She was sick of a fever, and she is one of those who are healed.<a name=506:13></a> Demon power is not noted there, but the bodily disease is -- the fever.<a name=506:14></a> It was evidently a case of insubjection, which, of course, prevents effective service.<a name=506:15></a> So it is said, the Lord stood over her -- "Standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her; and forthwith standing up she served them".<a name=506:16></a> There were immediate results, showing how the beneficiaries of grace immediately join in in spreading the thought -- "She served them".<a name=506:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=506:18></a>M.<a name=506:19></a> Would the standing over her imply <i>authority</i>, particularly over the origin of the disease or weakness?<a name=506:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=506:21></a> I think it does.<a name=506:22></a> Of course authority might be expressed in a mere official, but here it is a question of the Person who exercised it; the moral power or authority in the Lord Jesus standing over her -- such an One as He.<a name=506:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=506:24></a>R.<a name=506:25></a> Is that suggested in the way Luke presents Him at the outset, "thou shalt call his name Jesus .<a name=506:26></a>.<a name=506:27></a>.<a name=506:28></a> and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father"?<a name=506:29></a> -- it is His moral worth and beauty that give Him ascendency over us.<a name=506:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=506:31></a> I think so; in this particular case it is in

		the house, and He is there on friendly terms of course, in Simon's house.<a name=507:1></a> Arbitrary authority may be seen in any one, even an unconverted man, but there is no moral authority in it at all; that is, the person does not convey the thing, but here the Person is in mind, such a person as is described, and anointed in the previous chapter.<a name=507:2></a> They took notice of Him, too; His demeanour in the synagogue and the kind of words that were coming out of His mouth; it is the Man Himself that is in mind; so that the woman is evidently impressed spiritually.<a name=507:3></a> We can understand that feverish conditions need this moral power in those who are seeking to serve.<a name=507:4></a> Immediate results follow -- she served <i>them;</i> it is a general thought -- she served all that were there.<a name=507:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=507:6></a>T.<a name=507:7></a> Is this the public side of the truth?<a name=507:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=507:9></a> I think so; it is what might be in any household.<a name=507:10></a> There are many causes of irritation in a household, which the fever would suggest, and what is needed is to bring moral weight, in the husband or in any one -- particularly the husband, into the house, that would subdue it and make it felt to be wrong in the insubject person.<a name=507:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=507:12></a>H.<a name=507:13></a> In chapter 7 there is a man who said, "I also am a man placed under authority".<a name=507:14></a> Had he taken character from Christ, observing Him as a Man here subject to the blessed God, and he has his household in accord with that?<a name=507:15></a> Does that enter into the thought in chapter 8 that you have brought before us?<a name=507:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=507:17></a> I think that is right.<a name=507:18></a> It is a remarkable illustration of light in a man's soul; he discerned, not only that the Lord had authority, but that it was delegated authority, tracing it back to God, even as his own authority would be traced back to the emperor.<a name=507:19></a> It shows how great a thought authority is, but authority expressed in a <i>word</i> -- not necessarily within the hearing of the person to be affected;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.W.<a name=508:3></a>B.<a name=508:4></a> Is obedience the first feature, resulting from the recognition of authority?<a name=508:5></a> I was thinking of your reference to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>, where, as you were saying, the thought of obedience, as seen in the twelve pillars, is essential.<a name=508:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=508:7></a> Quite so; the Lord, I suppose, as standing over the woman, would represent the thought.<a name=508:8></a> He is here as the sent One; He could say, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me .<a name=508:9></a>.<a name=508:10></a>.<a name=508:11></a>" He is here in subjection Himself and conveying it palpably as standing over the woman.<a name=508:12></a> Hence the husband is not exercising his authority arbitrarily, but with Christ as his Head; all is traced back to God; God is Christ's Head.<a name=508:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=508:14></a>W.<a name=508:15></a> Would this woman, Peter's wife's mother, be illustrative of one who has accepted the glad tidings of the kingdom of God?<a name=508:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=508:17></a> Yes.<a name=508:18></a> So in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>the word "authority" is used; the woman is to have "authority on her head".<a name=508:19></a> This would evidently allude to the thing itself -- the symbol of the authority being in another.<a name=508:20></a> She is fully recognising the authority that comes down from God through Christ to the man.<a name=508:21></a>

		I have in mind to speak of <i>teaching;</i> to speak indeed of what has been rightly called the divine economy, into which many features of divine administration enter, but I wish to speak of teaching as one of the great features of the economy.<a name=521:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John enlarges on the divine administrative system more than the other evangelists, and in a peculiar way, making it evident that it is the outcome of love, that it is a matter between divine Persons, the Father being the source of all.<a name=521:2></a> John's ministry, particularly his gospel, has in mind the family side.<a name=521:3></a> The saints are being prepared, and indeed have been for many years, from the beginning of what we might rightly call the latter-day revival, for the family side and have been nourished in it.<a name=521:4></a> John goes to the root of things in his gospel in centring everything, or rather rooting everything, in the Father, not only the Father in power and wisdom, but in love.<a name=521:5></a> John tells us that "the Father loves the Son".<a name=521:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There can be no doubt that it was divinely anticipated that the idea of "father" would enter into the great hierarchical systems which began to take root from an early period in our dispensation; the word "father" has had great place in these systems.<a name=521:7></a> Indeed, the expression 'the fathers', regarded as authorities, has a great place in the vocabulary of the order of things I have alluded to, and the title father is taken on by a large proportion of its priests.<a name=521:8></a> This assumption of the title is over against our Lord's direct word: "Call no man your father upon the earth", and that commandment is being ignored.<a name=521:9></a> The idea of father has thus laid hold of, and given character to, this great development now extending back seventeen hundred years or more.<a name=521:10></a>

		One can discern that the Spirit of God had in mind in John's gospel the overthrow of all this in the last days, indeed from the beginning, but particularly that the saints, as having been deflected for centuries, should be recovered to the feature of the divine economy conveyed in the expression "Father and Son", and to what develops from it -- Father and sons and Father and children.<a name=522:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what I have in mind, and particularly in relation, as I said, to teaching, to show how teaching emanates from the Father, that is what the Lord Himself says in the verse read in John 8.<a name=522:2></a> If there are those here who are in any way held by the development I have alluded to, one would refer for their sakes, and for the sake of all of us, to Jonathan; for in teaching, as in all other respects of the work entering into this dispensation, it is a question of the Father.<a name=522:3></a> The Lord says, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:17">John  5:17</a>); and again, "The Son can do nothing of himself" -- a marvellous statement!<a name=522:4></a> -- and "whatever he sees the Father doing .<a name=522:5></a>.<a name=522:6></a>.<a name=522:7></a> these things also the Son does in like manner".<a name=522:8></a> That is, all emanates from the Father, whether it be direct injunction and teaching or example.<a name=522:9></a>

		Jonathan's was a dark day in Israel's history, a day made dark by his incorrigible father, Saul, even as our days are made dark by the incorrigibleness of the element I have alluded to; the whole position was darkened, and spiritually made desperate.<a name=522:10></a> Israel was beset on every hand by the Philistine armies issuing forth as they would, the soldiers of Saul even wanting in the ordinary implements of war and having to go to their enemies for what they could get.<a name=522:11></a> In the midst of such a state of things Jonathan represents those who work with God, and that, dear brethren, is the point: that we are workers with God whatever our service, whether preaching, or teaching, exercising eldership, or any

		form of service, whatever it be, the prime thought surely is to be workers with God.<a name=523:1></a> Our work will not be effective otherwise, it will be worse than none, as the Lord says, "he that gathers not with me scatters".<a name=523:2></a> So Jonathan understood fighting in an individual sense, being a man of faith, and the sequel brought out that it was a movement of faith and that he was a worker with God, and, he <i>told not his father</i>.<a name=523:3></a> This means that the development I have spoken of is not to be consulted as regards any work of God, it is to be ignored -- Jonathan told not his father.<a name=523:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not say that he had to say to God; he worked with God, and if we are to work with God we must have to say to Him, to pray to our Father really in secret.<a name=523:5></a> We shall learn there who the real Father is.<a name=523:6></a> A word for anyone of us, especially young ones, is, "enter into thy chamber", as we are told by the Lord.<a name=523:7></a> The Lord Himself says, "and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render it to thee" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:6">Matthew  6:6</a>).<a name=523:8></a> Here in John 8, as you will observe, His remarks to the Jews were not understood.<a name=523:9></a> "They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father".<a name=523:10></a> The Father, I need not say, was always nearest to His heart and uppermost in His mind, but they do not understand, as the Lord presses the point, that the economy is a question of the Father and the Son, and that all emanates from the Father, the Son's place in the economy being one of entire subjection and infinitely real, including even His being taught of the Father.<a name=523:11></a> In chapter 5 He tells us that "The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing".<a name=523:12></a> How marvellous that this should be said!<a name=523:13></a> And why is it said?<a name=523:14></a> Is it not to impress us with the reality of the Lord's position as the sent One, as taking the place of learning everything, and hearing everything,

		This in no way, I need not add, beclouds His holy, divine Personality; that is always intact, remaining in its inscrutability, so that here in chapter 5, He asserts that all must honour the Son as they honour the Father -- a remarkable combination of facts!<a name=524:2></a> On the one hand, He asserts that He could do nothing Himself, and on the other that all must honour the Son as they honour the Father.<a name=524:3></a> Let us not be afraid of these statements, dear brethren, but let us look at them in a holy, subject, intelligent way, for without the understanding of them we shall be weak as regards our position in the economy.<a name=524:4></a> We are all brought into it as believers, but we are brought into it according to what we are, each in his little measure -- the economy includes the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the apostles, and then others of us according to our measure.<a name=524:5></a> It is a question of graded authority -- delegated authority all emanating from the Father, and as real as delegated to Christ, and as real as delegated to the Spirit, to the apostles, or to any of us according to our measure.<a name=524:6></a>

		Then as regards teaching, our passage says, verse 28, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things".<a name=525:2></a> I am speaking now of teaching: "I do nothing of myself", the Lord says.<a name=525:3></a> You may say, I cannot take it in!<a name=525:4></a> Well, believe it any way; face it.<a name=525:5></a> The understanding of the economy necessitates that we take in these wonderful words in regard of Himself; the reality of the stoop He took; His obedience as the sent One, so that there should be no question in our minds as to how real the matter is.<a name=525:6></a> It implies delegated authority, as seen in the centurion's remarks in Luke 7.<a name=525:7></a> The Lord, he said, did not need to go to his servant, but only to speak the word, and he should be healed; "For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers", he said.<a name=525:8></a> The centurion being in a position of authority as a Roman official, understood the idea of delegated authority, for the Roman system was externally very like the divine system in that way, and it is about to be developed again -- the trinity of evil in which everything shall be centred in a head, under a father.<a name=525:9></a> The cry was, Release unto us Barabbas -- the son of the father -- that is coming into evidence again in christendom; there is an imitation, and all will emanate from the idea of a father.<a name=525:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking now of teaching and how the Lord took that place, and in taking it He established what I am speaking of, a state and attitude of absolute subjection and dependence.<a name=526:3></a> That all comes down from the Father, and so He goes on to say, "he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him".<a name=526:4></a> That is all an example for us, showing that in subjection and dependence, we shall not be without divine support, nor companionship either; the Lord will ever be found alongside of us; we shall never be alone in our service, as learning from Him, and then what flows out from that is that we do those things that please the Father.<a name=526:5></a> Each one is making history in heaven as he serves on these lines; the Father has pleasure in every one of us as we do.<a name=526:6></a>

		I now go on to the Spirit in chapter 14: 26: "the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, <i>he</i> shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you".<a name=528:4></a> The Lord, as I have said, takes the ground of being taught of the Father, and then He teaches the apostles, which I will refer to in a moment.<a name=528:5></a> All the gospels are full of the Lord's teaching, and in this gospel His service in this respect has a peculiar charm.<a name=528:6></a> In Matthew it is more authoritative, chapter 5: 1, 2, involving also more exercise on the part of the disciples, a side of the truth which is important, although we learn also in restfulness.<a name=528:7></a> There is that sort of learning, indeed; perhaps more of it is needed; that is, to lie fallow, absorbing things that the Lord teaches us, taking them in with our faculties all active.<a name=528:8></a> There can be no doubt that those who serve are hampered at times because of physical inability.<a name=528:9></a> The idea of a vessel that God uses is one in which the faculties are all available, unhampered by physical weakness; and hence those who serve do well to take it into account and not to fail to keep their sabbaths.<a name=528:10></a> One takes that home to oneself, it is an important matter to keep our sabbaths.<a name=528:11></a>

		authoritative teaching is most essential to our place in the assembly, but John's side is more the home, the family thought: that I am taught where there is affection.<a name=530:1></a> Going up to the mountain does not suggest the place of affection, or the home; it suggests authority and it requires exercise.<a name=530:2></a> I see that I really need the teaching and go in for it, and in so doing I am taught that I am blessed.<a name=530:3></a> John would show us that Christ's teaching is very attractive, and so he tells us about two persons who followed Jesus -- the first two followers that Jesus had, and they called Him "Rabbi".<a name=530:4></a> The Spirit of God stops to tell us what the word means, so that there should be no doubt as to what these two followers of Jesus had in their minds.<a name=530:5></a> Then they said, "Where abidest thou?<a name=530:6></a>" and the Lord answered, "Come and see".<a name=530:7></a>

		It is thus not a question of going up a mountain, but of coming to where He abides, and abiding with Him; that is the principle.<a name=530:8></a> That is an initial idea in John, to prepare us; and then follows what I have been speaking of, namely, the Father teaching the Son, and the Son teaching us directly and then through the Spirit.<a name=530:9></a> So that in John the Lord says to His enemies as they arrest Him, "I taught always in the synagogue and in the temple .<a name=530:10></a>.<a name=530:11></a>.<a name=530:12></a> and in secret I have spoken nothing".<a name=530:13></a> He said, in effect, further, If that is so, why do you ask Me to convict myself?<a name=530:14></a> "Demand of those who have heard, what I have spoken" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#18:21">John  18:21</a>).<a name=530:15></a>

		These three thousand people that were affected by Peter's preaching asked for help, not only from him, but from the eleven; they recognised the authority of the eleven, they all had authority and power, and now it is not simply that they persevere in Peter's teaching, but in the teaching of the <i>apostles;</i> showing that Peter, James, John, Bartholomew, Matthew, Judas, and the others of the twelve, all had power; all these men worked; all these men were recognised by those in whom God was working, as having authority.<a name=535:3></a> What I am saying is verified in the fact that all their names are in the foundations of the heavenly city; and that is the testimony that each one of these men had authority and work given to him by Christ; the position that each has in the heavenly city is an unquestionable testimony that he did his work.<a name=535:4></a> We have no detailed account of the work of some of them, but what is in the heavenly city is unquestionable; there is the record, whatever silence there may be in history or in the Scriptures.<a name=535:5></a> The record is there indelibly, that these men did their work, and as the work of God began in Jerusalem, those who were of God recognised them.<a name=535:6></a>

		My purpose is to speak about uprightness amongst the people of God.<a name=537:1></a> I have thus ventured to read the scriptures in 2 Samuel and in Joshua, relating to the book of Jasher, which word is said to denote uprightness, and, inasmuch as it is evidently a book of poetic productions to be conserved, the thought seems to be to teach us uprightness in an attractive manner, to make it attractive to us, to make it worth while.<a name=537:2></a> It leads to the collective thought in Jeshurun, which carries the thought not only of uprightness, according to its meaning given, but peculiar attractiveness, the word 'darling' being, as some think, suggested in its meaning.<a name=537:3></a> It is an upright people, not only an upright person, but an aggregation of such, and thus peculiarly attractive to Christ, He being also attractive to them.<a name=537:4></a> The more upright we are, the more we shall appreciate this feature in Jesus, who is the embodiment of it, as He is of every divine grace; hence He is in type King, we are told, amongst them -- "king in Jeshurun" -- but not simply amongst so many persons, but "When the heads of the people And the tribes of Israel were gathered together".<a name=537:5></a>

		The chapter from which I have read shows them together, first in council at Jerusalem in regard to a work of the enemy which had in view to introduce legality, involving indeed apostasy in which it reaches its full consummation; for the effort of the enemy was to add to the Galatian christians something that God did <i>not</i> add to them, but what He would subtract from them -- namely, legality.<a name=538:3></a> This epistle shows how even the great personality of Paul has to be thrown into the scale against this vicious doctrine which the apostle calls, "another gospel", and he said that any one who preached it should be accursed.<a name=538:4></a> There was no mincing of matters with him, so that he throws his whole personal weight into the scale against it, not only was there what he said against it -- most forceful words and epithets -- but his own personality is thrown into the scale against it; so that he says, in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:2">Galatians  5:2</a>, "I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing".<a name=538:5></a> Think of that in view of modern public christianity!<a name=538:6></a> How the legalists, those who have returned to Judaism, and, alas!<a name=538:7></a> paganism, too, have cut themselves off, in principle at least, from "all profit from the Christ".<a name=538:8></a> In keeping with that remark, he says, "I, Paul" -- it is a question of his personality, what he was in the testimony, what he was personally, for he says, "by the grace of God I am what I am".<a name=538:9></a> He throws his weight, as I said, into the scale against this wicked doctrine

		It began early, by Satan employing what had been once accredited, to set aside the current thing that God had introduced, namely, christianity.<a name=539:2></a> It was a successful weapon of the devil to bring in <i>what had been</i> to set aside <i>what is</i>.<a name=539:3></a> We have to begin with <i>what is</i>, what is of God; hold to that whatever <i>has been</i>.<a name=539:4></a> We shall never understand what has been unless we understand what <i>is</i>.<a name=539:5></a> The apostle was contending for what was in his day, that is, christianity, as over against what had been, which was now polluted, adulterated, and used by the devil to set aside what then was, especially the ministry of the apostle Paul.<a name=539:6></a> We have to speak with feeling, in subdued tone, as to the great servant Peter being brought under the influence of this evil, if it were but for a little while.<a name=539:7></a> It surely is not written to discredit the great servant in our minds, it would be hidden for ever in oblivion were it not that the Lord intends that we shall gain by what happened; that the most spiritual of us should see how he is in danger of coming under an adverse influence, even if it be only for a while.<a name=539:8></a>

		among them".<a name=540:1></a> We have to be on our guard as to what we say as to the Lord's servants; so the apostle spoke about those with distinction, but he says "to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing".<a name=540:2></a> Yet there were Peter and James and John who seemed to be pillars -- they were outstanding even then.<a name=540:3></a> The apostle Paul, I am sure, had great satisfaction in discerning them at that time, and then he says, they discerned us too -- they recognised "the grace given to me".<a name=540:4></a> Happy indeed that brethren are so free from prejudice as to see what is of God in each other!<a name=540:5></a> for the gifts are varied and no gift can detract from another, in the abstract, anyway; it can only add to another.<a name=540:6></a> Increased gift rightly used is increased wealth, and we can only rejoice in every bit of ability the Lord gives.<a name=540:7></a> So Paul discerned that these three great servants were pillars.<a name=540:8></a> The word "pillar" carries its own meaning according to the use made of it in the testimony.<a name=540:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says that "James, Cephas and John, [who were conspicuous as being pillars] recognising the grace given to me, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship" -- a very happy situation, boding well for the work of God among the Gentiles; but, alas!<a name=540:10></a> subsequent influences diverted from this -- interfered with it.<a name=540:11></a> So far it was a happy state of things, and Peter came to Antioch evidently clear of these influences -- a great servant, as he was.<a name=540:12></a> As soon as Paul is on the scene, according to the historic account (Acts 9), Peter goes everywhere -- he went "through all quarters", meaning that he was instinctively in accord with this new great instrument that the Lord had introduced -- "an elect vessel", as He says of him, "to me", through whom He would establish the principle of local assemblies.<a name=540:13></a> Peter went through all quarters, he was free in spirit.<a name=540:14></a> In the end of

		Acts 9 we see how he moved in support, anticipatively, of what God was about to introduce through the great servant He had just brought into view at Damascus, who preached the Son of God in the synagogue.<a name=541:1></a> The great economy we are brought into as amongst the gentiles, set up in assemblies -- not simply in one assembly as at Jerusalem, but in assemblies; that was already in view and the apostle anticipated it.<a name=541:2></a> Hence he goes down to Joppa and says to Aeneas, "rise up, and make thy couch for thyself" -- that was the sort of thing that was coming in -- Aeneas was to be ready for it.<a name=541:3></a> Then he raises Tabitha and presents her to the saints and widows alive -- another thought; that means that the new economy should be marked by a sense of local responsibility and by a living state of things in each locality.<a name=541:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, that is Peter, and chapter 10 opens up to us how nobly he comes under the direction of heaven, for no servant is worthy of the name who is not amenable to the influence of heaven; the great bodies up there are emblematic of the power that is there spiritually for good, especially guidance.<a name=541:5></a> So Peter is amenable, and by his mouth, he says, the gentiles -- that is, we ourselves in our forefathers -- heard the gospel.<a name=541:6></a> Surely we can but speak well of one through whom such light is given to us!<a name=541:7></a> He justified the whole matter, too, in Jerusalem, and then, as I said, in Jerusalem, according to chapter 15, Peter with James and John gave to Paul and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship -- a very unifying thought.<a name=541:8></a> The work of God is now to move on in unity and happy sympathy; the great leaders being of one mind.<a name=541:9></a> So he came down to Antioch, apparently in this frame of mind, but as certain came from James; that is, the influence of Jerusalem was transmitted through some sinister agency, for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what is in mind in these verses, so that an issue arose in regard to straightforwardness or uprightness; the Spirit of God introducing it at this juncture, in relation to the issue at Galatia which is constantly occurring amongst the people of God, to warn us against any element other than uprightness, any opaqueness, any want of transparency, any want of brotherly simplicity and confidence between those who serve, and between the brethren generally.<a name=542:2></a> The apostle says, "when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly .<a name=542:3></a>.<a name=542:4></a>.<a name=542:5></a>".<a name=542:6></a> It was a very real issue, the truth of the gospel was involved, but it was a moral issue, too, this matter of uprightness.<a name=542:7></a> For a man to come out and say something wrong, is one thing, but to be underhanded about it, to be inconsistent in it, to be manifestly darkened by some adverse influence in it, is another thing -- that involves what is moral, a state of soul.<a name=542:8></a> So it is introduced, as I said, in this great issue, by the apostle Paul, and he contends with Peter "before them all".<a name=542:9></a> It is an open matter now, he had already said things privately at Jerusalem, lest he might "run or had run in vain", for it is not of God to bring great servants into discredit publicly -- surely not; but when there is a doctrinal issue of this kind, we had better speak publicly, we had better speak out -- and that is what he did.<a name=542:10></a> He did not take Peter aside at this time -- he did at Jerusalem under other circumstances, and so did Aquila and Priscilla in regard of Apollos, they "took him to them" -- but this time it is a public matter; all the saints are involved, and all the saints are to understand what is at issue and are to judge the whole matter.<a name=542:11></a> For, after all, christianity is not only in the leaders, let that be understood.<a name=542:12></a> Christianity is in the saints, it lies in the assembly; it is what

		we are in relation to one another that affords opportunity for God to work out the great thoughts that He has in mind in christianity; it involves every one of us, and so the saints are to understand.<a name=543:1></a> If there be an issue so serious, it is well the saints should understand; and so the apostle does not shrink from speaking to Peter before them all, from rebuking before all, his distinguished fellow-servant, his elder brother, as I might say -- "he was to be condemned".<a name=543:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, as in the case of David, the more distinguished a man is, the more serious is any defect or any sin in him; here Peter was to be blamed, there was no doubt about it.<a name=543:3></a> Whatever people might say in regard of the apparent indiscretion of a younger man rebuking an older one, the matter was too serious to admit of anything else; it was a matter of the want of uprightness; for Peter at heart knew the truth and ultimately stood by it; as the sequel shows, he loved and valued Paul, but for the moment he came under the influence of others.<a name=543:4></a> The most spiritual of us is exposed to that, and there is nothing more subtle than influence of this kind coming from another.<a name=543:5></a> With the very best intent I just listen to a brother: why should I not believe what he says?<a name=543:6></a> Well, why should I, if it involves another brother?<a name=543:7></a> why should I, if it is a question of the truth?<a name=543:8></a> Even in Paul's own case, the Bereans, we are told, "searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so".<a name=543:9></a> So that the point is to be <i>sure</i> about things, not just to take them for granted; because one witness is not enough in any matter, it is in the mouth of two or three witnesses that every word is established.<a name=543:10></a> However distinguished a brother may be, his word is not enough if it involves another brother or brothers, and in this case it involved the truth, and so strong was the influence from Jerusalem that even Barnabas, Paul's fellow-worker

		The facts show what one man can do even against odds.<a name=544:4></a> The combination against the apostle Paul was strong at that time, but eventually his faithfulness gained the day.<a name=544:5></a> How the apostle Peter came back to Paul is very beautiful; I suppose he never spoke so well about him as he did when he was about to put off his tabernacle.<a name=544:6></a> It is well for us who are older in the service to remember that the time is drawing nearer when we must put off our tabernacles, unless the Lord comes.<a name=544:7></a> It is well to have our eyes on the younger men, and not to discredit them in any way.<a name=544:8></a> If we are about to breathe our last we shall be glad surely to look around and see that the ground will be held.<a name=544:9></a> The best is said about the apostle Paul when Peter is about to put off his tabernacle, and he places his writings on the level of the Holy Scriptures; he could hardly honour him more.<a name=544:10></a> That suffices in regard of Peter.<a name=544:11></a> One would like to leave with the brethren, especially the young ones here, a right impression of the great apostle, and how the work of God brought out in him at the end perfect consonance with the testimony of the apostle Paul.<a name=544:12></a>

		Now I go on to David to show how this matter of Jasher, of uprightness, appeared in him.<a name=544:13></a> I have read from a section in his history which was transitional, and it is these transitional periods that are most testing, for in regard of a brother today there may be still a question as to whether he is ready

		to come forward into prominence, and he is apt to take short cuts which will always be against him in time.<a name=545:1></a> The whole road to the desired result has to be travelled from this point of view; distinction in the service of God is reached by a road which has to be travelled.<a name=545:2></a> Not that this should ever be a goal in the eyes of a servant, but it is apt to be, in young men particularly, and in transitional periods, that is, when their position in the testimony is still uncertain.<a name=545:3></a> Things, in the government of God, have happened and may cause us elation, if they are in our favour; they may cause us to make unseemly remarks seeing that the circumstances may involve humiliation in others, disaster in others.<a name=545:4></a> Indeed, it may be in those who have served, but now have ceased to do so, and we are so likely, in these transitional periods, to make statements and take up attitudes that are unseemly, and indeed to overlook what the persons have been in the service of God; namely, that they have been really anointed.<a name=545:5></a> If a man has ever been anointed and served well, that is to be remembered and never to be forgotten whatever his subsequent history, whatever his end; what he has been as anointed of God can never be forgotten, nor will any one who is upright, whose name or composition is worthy of the book of Jasher, make little of one whom God has used.<a name=545:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is how matters stand in the passages I have read.<a name=545:7></a> Saul had been slain on the mountains of Gilboa -- one of the most sorrowful parts of Israel's history!<a name=545:8></a> How will David take the news?<a name=545:9></a> He is the ostensible king now, but then, you never can be sure in such circumstances; our calculations often fail us.<a name=545:10></a> Not that it could be so in this case, for David was king according to divine choice, but I am making a <i>present</i> application, for our calculations do not always mature.<a name=545:11></a> Now as the tidings come of Saul's disaster, David is rightly affected.<a name=545:12></a> I want every one

		here -- including myself -- to drink into this lesson how <i>rightly</i> affected he is.<a name=546:1></a> It meant a change for the better in his whole life, it meant unquestionably the kingdom for him; but he is not thinking of that, he is thinking of God's servant that had been.<a name=546:2></a> Think of such a man as Jonathan slain in his high places!<a name=546:3></a> "The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places".<a name=546:4></a> "Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their lives, Even in their death were not divided".<a name=546:5></a> In truth David must have had real enjoyment with these men in earlier days; we know he had with Jonathan -- his love surpassed all human loves to him, and he associated him with his father.<a name=546:6></a> How could he be complacent in such circumstances?<a name=546:7></a> How could any true lover of Christ be complacent in such a disaster?<a name=546:8></a> For in truth the enemy has had a hand in it, and it has brought a once-valued man, a once-distinguished man, once anointed with oil as king over God's people, into a disaster -- slain by uncircumcised hands.<a name=546:9></a> The very messenger who brought the news has to die!<a name=546:10></a> Such is David's feeling, and he is a real man; no feigned feelings with David, he was genuine, he felt the thing, and hence this lament of his.<a name=546:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak thus, just to bring out what is becoming in us, as, it may be, on the road to distinction in the service of God, or, I should say, perhaps, more correctly, on the road to more usefulness -- for that was exactly the case here -- on the road to serving the people of God better than they had been served.<a name=546:12></a> So it may be that many of us are in such a transitional state of things, and the outlook is that the saints need help, they need leaders, they need service and rule.<a name=546:13></a> David is brought in to show his feelings here in song; "the song of the bow", I suppose, is the proper title of it -- and all that accompanied it, both in this chapter and later, in regard to Ishbosheth and Abner.<a name=546:14></a> In these three

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have this lamentation, and it is in poetic form, and that is a point I wish just to mention, because we have the thing put thus into the best form for us, in this song of the bow.<a name=547:3></a> The Authorised Version, as you will observe, has "the use of the bow", and no doubt David had that in mind, because Saul had fallen by the archers.<a name=547:4></a> It was no doubt a weapon, formed perhaps secretly, which gave them an advantage, I have no doubt it was a transitional period in the use of weapons.<a name=547:5></a> David's history shows that there was no lack of skill in him, and he certainly could not fail to excel in anything the Philistines might have.<a name=547:6></a> So this song had a known place in the annals of Israel, disclosing dexterity in the great warrior king, and not only the great warrior king, but "the sweet psalmist of Israel", the charming leader God had introduced.<a name=547:7></a> Surely every such production must be cherished in the hearts of all Israel.<a name=547:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is to "teach the children of Judah the song of the bow", and, according to the way it is translated in the best translation, we have the song of the bow in the words that follow right down to the end of the chapter.<a name=547:9></a> Let us look into it.<a name=547:10></a> It is not simply the <i>use</i> of the bow, it is really better to read it in the sense of the <i>song</i> of the bow, for the song of the bow will keep the thing in our minds, as the very weapon of warfare involved in sorrow.<a name=547:11></a> Paul speaks of the weapons of his warfare -- they were spiritual, he says -- and every spiritual item may be put into poetry.<a name=547:12></a> It is a question of uprightness, of how matters are in the warfare of God.<a name=547:13></a> Let

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to say a word briefly about Joshua.<a name=548:6></a> What I have said about David will help us as to influence with men.<a name=548:7></a> David speaks about one that ruleth among men, what he must be, and what I have been speaking of enters much into the kind of man that is to rule amongst men.<a name=548:8></a> He must be just, he must be upright, he must be as the dawn.<a name=548:9></a> In "the last words of David" he tells us what a man should be who rules amongst men, and in truth, it is a very important matter; for, after all, it is not a question of the service of any one of us, but what one <i>is</i> -- personality is an immense thing.<a name=548:10></a> Gift is out of place in any who is out of accord with it in his own qualities and spirit.<a name=548:11></a> "The ruler among men shall be just, Ruling in the fear of God" (2 Samuel 23: 3).<a name=548:12></a> In <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#3:1">2 Samuel  3:1</a> we are told that "David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker".<a name=548:13></a> It does not say the <i>house</i> of David grew stronger, it was David himself.<a name=548:14></a> He had to say, it is not so with my house, but as to himself, what a man he was!<a name=548:15></a> What a spirit he had as a ruler among men!<a name=548:16></a> So after all David's experiences, to which I have alluded, in

	<div class="paragraph">
		relation to those men, all Israel came and made him king -- all Israel, we are told earlier, loved David.<a name=549:1></a> So it is a question of what one is among men in his service, what influence one has, whether one leads the saints aright.<a name=549:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in this part of Joshua, it is not one's influence among men, but what influence I have up in <i>heaven</i>.<a name=549:3></a> You may think that a peculiar thing to say: but it is a fine thought, and there is not anyone of us, who <i>prays</i>, who has not some influence in heaven.<a name=549:4></a> You will notice what is said in the passage; it is not exactly a prayer, it is more like a familiar request -- as of one having personal liberty with God.<a name=549:5></a> The Lord uses two words, as you will remember, in the New Testament, <i>begging</i> and <i>demanding</i>, the latter alluding to what He was entitled to, the former is simply supplication, begging things, asking for things in that sense.<a name=549:6></a> Now Joshua here, we are told, "spoke .<a name=549:7></a>.<a name=549:8></a>.<a name=549:9></a> to Jehovah", as much as to say, Do this for me.<a name=549:10></a> In speaking thus, I am seeking simply to urge that the saints should get into the idea of their greatness in heaven -- these qualities having developed, and hence to understand what liberty they may have with God.<a name=549:11></a> David, as I was saying, developed the spirit of a man who should rule among men, but then, he was a man who went <i>up</i> too; he says, immediately after what we have been dwelling upon, Shall I go up?<a name=549:12></a> And God says, Yes, as much as to say, 'You are the kind of man that should go up'.<a name=549:13></a> "Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?<a name=549:14></a>" Well, the upright man, the pure in heart, he is the man that can go up.<a name=549:15></a> So David goes up, Jehovah telling him where to go; he asks Him and Jehovah tells him -- he went to Hebron and then to Jerusalem.<a name=549:16></a> Now, as I said, the point in our chapter in Joshua is what influence I have above.<a name=549:17></a> I believe it is commensurate with what influence I have below, that is, as I take on the heavenly

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, with this in mind, I want just to follow out what this matter of uprightness means here, to show that it involves power with God; that is, I can say to Him, Such and such a thing is needed.<a name=550:3></a> God likes that in an upright man, a man who knows what is needed, whose boldness of access He would encourage.<a name=550:4></a> There are many short prayers in the Bible; long ones are rare.<a name=550:5></a> The word here was, "Then spoke Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah gave up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand still upon Gibeon; And thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!<a name=550:6></a> And the sun stood still, and the moon remained where it was, until the nation had avenged themselves upon their enemies".<a name=550:7></a> The necessities of the case required this, it was an intelligent word; it was as if Joshua said to Jehovah, This is needed.<a name=550:8></a> You are doing a great service to us, You are giving victory over the Amorites; but I want to <i>complete</i> the matter.<a name=550:9></a> Unfinished matters are very frequent.<a name=550:10></a> An illustration of a finished matter is seen in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7">1 Samuel  7</a>, where Samuel offers up a sucking lamb to Jehovah, a whole burnt-offering -- beautiful thought!<a name=550:11></a> Christ dependent here in type -- and whilst he did it, whilst the offering went on God thundered on the Philistines.<a name=550:12></a> You say that is enough -- but it is not, the passage goes on to say, "the men of Israel went out" -- they finished the matter; they "pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car".<a name=550:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if we take the present dispensation; we say to the Lord, Come.<a name=550:14></a> Many of us may say it in the most sentimental way, without having <i>faith</i> about it, but then I am to consider what is in the mind of God about this dispensation.<a name=550:15></a> Is it to be finished?<a name=550:16></a> Do I want it to be finished?<a name=550:17></a> I may ask God to

		interfere with the powers that be; for if they go on as they are going on, and God does not interfere, we shall have the antichrist presently, we shall have the finish -- but what do I say as to that?<a name=551:1></a> The Spirit is here, the assembly is here, and Scripture abounds with the idea of long-suffering, of patience, and that all the elect are to be saved.<a name=551:2></a> What do you think of that?<a name=551:3></a> Is the day to be lengthened out?<a name=551:4></a> May be it is necessary for it to be lengthened out.<a name=551:5></a> God is pleased with a man who thinks like that, who says, It is needed that You should interfere with the powers that be.<a name=551:6></a> The first mention of these heavenly bodies in Scripture is that they were to rule -- well, they are to rule, and God has set up rulers on earth and they are going forward, but the night of complete apostasy is coming very quickly if they have their way unhinderedly.<a name=551:7></a> Hence God may stay the current trend, and the upright man says, It is right that they should be stayed -- God is pleased with that; He likes us to be in accord with the principle governing the dispensation -- "the acceptable year of the Lord" -- I want to be imbued with the spirit of it.<a name=551:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Joshua spoke to Jehovah, and he spoke to the sun, and he spoke to the moon.<a name=551:9></a> Think of a man being able to do that; and then we have the poetic words in the sight of Israel: "Sun, stand still upon Gibeon; And thou moon, in the valley of Ajalon!<a name=551:10></a>" Is not such an exploit worthy of a place in the annals of the people of God?<a name=551:11></a> It is indeed.<a name=551:12></a> It is enshrined in the book of Jasher, and if, so to speak, I open that book, it challenges me.<a name=551:13></a> You will understand that I am speaking in a figurative way; this book is not extant now, but the thing it represents is, carried down in living power by the Spirit.<a name=551:14></a> It is a question of uprightness in the things of God, and what power the upright man has.<a name=551:15></a> He speaks to God, and then he speaks to the governing powers,

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as I said at the beginning, there is the collective idea in which all this culminates, namely, the saints viewed as Jeshurun.<a name=552:4></a> I need not add much to what I have said, but you can see that if each of us takes this in, in his local situation, we shall be upright with one another; not simply that we break bread together, and have a meeting room and set meetings, including all the meetings we have -- these may proceed and yet we may not have Jeshurun.<a name=552:5></a> Jeshurun is a great collective thought involving delight to the heart of Christ, for I believe that is what is meant.<a name=552:6></a> It is to be reached in every company of saints represented here moving on these lines, moving with God.<a name=552:7></a> The Lord sees them together, "the heads of the people", the heads meaning those who have wisdom, who are there in the wisdom they have derived from God, or now, from Christ as Head; as such are available, there is control and leadership.<a name=552:8></a> Then "the tribes of Israel", meaning all those that are available to the Lord, set in relation to one another in love.<a name=552:9></a> The Lord says, in effect, that is delightful to Me, and He comes there.<a name=552:10></a> Moses, typical of Christ, was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.<a name=552:11></a>

		I have in mind to show how much may be accomplished by <i>one man</i> whom God fits for any given service.<a name=553:1></a> God thinks long ahead in view of vessels.<a name=553:2></a> Having a great variety of ends in detail to reach in His work, He necessarily requires a great variety of workmen, and the word that governs the service in this respect is "to every man his work".<a name=553:3></a> It is not that any workman is to be in his own mind a specialist; if he confines himself to a speciality, he is liable to be out of employment very often.<a name=553:4></a> The principle governing the work is that what one's hand finds to do is done, and our Lord, as in all matters, is our Leader.<a name=553:5></a> He is our Leader in workmanship, He speaks of Himself as among the disciples, as He who serves.<a name=553:6></a> His greatest follower, Paul, most faithful and imitative, is marked by the same feature, he was among the brethren as he who served, even to the putting of sticks on the fire.<a name=553:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But still, each man has his work, and it is divinely intended that each having his own work should know what he is most efficient in; yet love is the motive principle and no one should withhold his hand under the mere plea that a certain task is not his work.<a name=553:8></a> Samuel was a prophet and a judge and a priest; it became known that he could serve in a variety of ways, particularly in prayer, so that in a crisis the saints asked him to pray.<a name=553:9></a> Not that it is spoken of as a speciality with him, but he took advantage of the privilege of approach to God and made the most use of it, and the people understood.<a name=553:10></a> When they indicated their preference for another ruler, he said, "Far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in

	<div class="paragraph">
		No one has much definiteness or effectiveness in his service who has not a secret understanding with God as to his commission, because a divine stamp must be upon the work and the workman, and in his work he understands what is to be done, and that he is to "receive full wages".<a name=554:4></a> You will understand that I am not suggesting anyone working on account of wages in a literal sense, but it is due to God that we should think of that side, that there is such a thing as that in a spiritual sense.<a name=554:5></a> He will doubtless leave it with us as to what we regard as wages, but still we are to have full wages, and if one is to claim this, and the apostle John had it in mind, he cannot be negligent or trifling; his work has to be done.<a name=554:6></a> The time will come when matters will be entered into and we shall have to give an account.<a name=554:7></a> I speak thus because a great field has opened up to us -- it has been always open to those who love God -- and what the Lord is looking for is definiteness amongst many other things, a definite aim in what we are engaged in.<a name=554:8></a>

		Then, as I said, there has to be formation.<a name=554:9></a> I am not now speaking of formation leading to the assembly, that is, to what is collective, but of what is in itself individual, for each one is formed in view of his work -- in view, of course, of his place in the assembly, that is another side to the position, but each one is formed in view of his work.<a name=554:10></a> In Jeremiah's case, Jehovah told him that He took account of him before he was born; He thought of his parentage, his forefathers, his environment as born, his

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in view of this, what is basic in all of us is to arrive at the point of self-consciousness -- conscious individuality is a better way to put it.<a name=555:3></a> It is arrived at through a moral process of the most remarkable kind, for it is, as it were, by the occupant of the house -- the believer being regarded as a house -- grappling with inward conditions so as to have things right.<a name=555:4></a> No unconverted man is troubled on these lines, it is the outcome of the work of God, for God must take the initiative in each case, and He does.<a name=555:5></a> The individual has no active part in new birth, it is altogether a sovereign matter.<a name=555:6></a> Later matters are joint ones, that is, God works in us, taking account of us in our moral conditions and intelligence, for the willing and the doing for His good pleasure.<a name=555:7></a> He takes us into the matter in our faculties, <i>after</i> He has done His sovereign fundamental work.<a name=555:8></a> There is no hint that the believer has anything to do with this work, the very figure used would show that it is a sovereign matter, but as it is once accomplished, an element is introduced which begins to work and produces a sense of responsibility to God: it is instinctive.<a name=555:9></a> So that, as the light comes to the believer he finds conditions within impossible in a moral sense; they must be adjusted, there must be an analysis of what is going on, and right must prevail.<a name=555:10></a>

		Now I go on to Jeremiah to show how much God can do with one, as having known him beforehand, and in view of conditions that should arise amongst God's people.<a name=556:9></a> Jeremiah came in, as you know, under declining circumstances in Israel; God foresaw everything; he came in in favourable circumstances too, however, for it was under the reign of the good king Josiah.<a name=556:10></a> He had a good start, which is an important matter, and no one in Israel valued Josiah more than Jeremiah.<a name=556:11></a> We can usually tell what a man is as he dies, what place he has in the hearts of the saints, and especially in the hearts of the spiritual, such as Jeremiah; he lamented for Josiah.<a name=556:12></a> I suppose no one in his day could lament as Jeremiah did, it is one of his characteristics, and it is an important one, in such circumstances as we are in now, to know how to lament spiritually.<a name=556:13></a> Others lamented with

		him, as you will see, Judah and Jerusalem and all the people were in it, but Jeremiah lamented, and we know from his writing how he <i>could</i> lament; what a spiritual touch there would be to his lamentation.<a name=557:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have spoken of succeeds what I have before me in this first chapter.<a name=557:2></a> I want to show how God formed Jeremiah, how He foresaw what was needed and prepared him beforehand and in due course worked in his soul; and, in working in his soul and touching his mouth -- even putting words into it -- He gave him a commission to Israel and to the nations "to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant".<a name=557:3></a> No one, one may say, has had such a commission as that, it is remarkable -- all put on one man, but I confine myself now to the remarks made by Jehovah to him in these verses.<a name=557:4></a> He says, "Gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I shall command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them.<a name=557:5></a> And I, behold, I appoint thee this day as a strong city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land".<a name=557:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish just briefly to point out the magnitude of this formation in one man, making him what Jehovah says here -- first a strong city.<a name=557:7></a> It may be that we have not thought much of a man being a city; it would be hard maybe to get such a thought elsewhere, but anyway we get it in the most definite way here.<a name=557:8></a> Jehovah says, "I appoint thee this day a strong city".<a name=557:9></a> And then, "an iron pillar", and then "brazen walls" -- not merely in a passive sense, standing out pre-eminently passively, but <i>against</i> certain people -- against the rebellious land, against its kings, against its princes, against its priests,

		against all the people, the whole land.<a name=558:1></a> What a commission!<a name=558:2></a> and let us not think that it is simply Jeremiah.<a name=558:3></a> It would not be written if it were only for Jeremiah, he had gone through the thing, but it is written for us to show what one man can be as God may fit him for a particular exigency in the testimony -- for instance, when everything may be in disorder in the locality in which he is.<a name=558:4></a> It often happens; indeed it is a feature, alas!<a name=558:5></a> of these very days in which we are; certain localities have been invaded by the devil working independency in certain persons, so as to obliterate, if possible, the testimony that may be in each locality, rendering the conditions so bad that the Lord cannot be with the saints.<a name=558:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not remind the brethren of this; the history of recent years furnishes much of what I am saying, and what is said here, the commission to Jeremiah is, I believe, intended to help us as to what one man can do, that is, as taken up by God.<a name=558:7></a> Why should I not be taken up by God if an exigency of this kind arises?<a name=558:8></a> If I am in the locality, or if it extend to the whole field of testimony, why should I not be taken up of God?<a name=558:9></a> Why should not any one of us be taken up?<a name=558:10></a> Let no one assume it is not his matter; there is nothing, I am sure, that God hates more than for any one of His people to say, in such a case, It is not my matter.<a name=558:11></a> It <i>is</i> your matter, whatever happens is your matter.<a name=558:12></a> There are other principles of course that enter into it; God will not pass by the locality if there are available persons.<a name=558:13></a> One who has the character of a strong city is what is needed, a man standing out as definitely committed to the law of God; whatever other principles govern the matter, the law of God is involved.<a name=558:14></a> Basically I am prepared for it by the conflict, by the victory, indicated in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>-- the law of God is in question now, let there be no compromise.<a name=558:15></a>

		A city has a variety of features; think of them all being in one man -- a strong city -- one that is not to be overcome!<a name=559:1></a> I cannot stay to enlarge on this, though one could do so, many of us could enlarge on this, but I just want to suggest how independent God may be if He has His people in this way ready, by His formation, for any eventuality in the history of His testimony, either in a locality or generally.<a name=559:2></a> "He that dwelleth in the heavens", we are told, "shall laugh, the Lord shall have them in derision" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:4">Psalm  2:4</a>).<a name=559:3></a> How can He laugh derisively at evil down here?<a name=559:4></a> Because He has His anointed -- "And <i>I</i> have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness".<a name=559:5></a> That is the idea, dear brethren; it is God setting up a man in any given circumstances who is ready to devote his life, to lay it down if necessary, for the law of God; for the idea of a city must involve the working out of the law of God.<a name=559:6></a> A city, of course, has a council, it has authority, it has laws, it has a constabulary, it has means to carry out its designs and orders.<a name=559:7></a> A variety of things enter into the idea of a strong city, and it is in having here that which answers to the city, that He that dwelleth in the heavens can laugh at the enemy.<a name=559:8></a> Let it not seem that this is fanciful, it is not indeed; it is God putting on an individual, in whom He has wrought and whom he has fitted, that which will meet the emergency; and victory is already assured in such a strong city as is contemplated here.<a name=559:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next thing is an "iron pillar".<a name=559:10></a> Jeremiah represents this thought throughout his whole book and his Lamentations.<a name=559:11></a> He is seen standing for God right through, even with a rebellious remnant to contend with, and suffering with them.<a name=559:12></a> The idea of an iron pillar is that it is strong, iron is suggestive of strength.<a name=559:13></a> We have many pillars spoken of in Scripture; the idea, I think, is sometimes, especially here and in Philadelphia, that the pillar represents

		Now I go on to Samson, to show how in one man the world is brought down.<a name=561:4></a> You will understand that it is not literal, it is typically in a moral sense here, and it is that feature of the world that affects the people of God at any given time.<a name=561:5></a> "Woe to the world because of offences!<a name=561:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:7">Matthew  18:7</a>).<a name=561:7></a> God has it in mind; He has every offence of the world in mind -- "offence" means a fall-trap, what decoys the saints, damaging them, bringing them under its influence.<a name=561:8></a> God has all that in mind, He is going to deal with it.<a name=561:9></a> For us it is a moral question, how we deal with it as it affects us: each of us has to learn how the world affects <i>him</i>.<a name=561:10></a> Samson makes a point of how it affected him.<a name=561:11></a> The history of Samson is well known, and it is a wider thought really than what belongs to one man; he is a type of public christianity, I believe.<a name=561:12></a> There is the flagrant conduct of the world, on the one hand, and nazariteship on the other -- nazariteship in some sense continuing down, not given up, not surrendered; here it quickly returns and is seen in the growth of Samson's hair.<a name=561:13></a> A very important point to observe if there be failure with any of us; the real evidence of recovery is in the element of life -- "the hair of his head began to grow".<a name=561:14></a> It does not say that the seven locks grew, but the principle of life was there and afforded Jehovah the opportunity of dealing a death-blow to the world as it had affected Samson.<a name=561:15></a>

		I believe the apostles' testimony at the beginning brought down the pillars, but now the world is set up again, and we have to understand what its pillars are.<a name=564:2></a> God understands, and He has placed us where, in regard of them, He knows we can serve Him best.<a name=564:3></a> Let us not forget that the matter is God's.<a name=564:4></a> Whatever it be, in which He would use us, God has set the saints where He wants them; it is a sovereign matter, and each is to be in his place, as we learn from Josiah.<a name=564:5></a> If each is in his place, God will do His work, the world will come down.<a name=564:6></a> It is not a literal matter now, the point is that the world is brought down so that saints are delivered out of it.<a name=564:7></a> One might think this lad is leading Samson to the pillars, but it is not a question of the lad's leadership here -- it is too great a matter for a lad.<a name=564:8></a> In fact Samson, the servant of God now recovered in measure, says, "Let loose of me, and suffer me to feel the pillars" -- release me -- that is really what the word <i>suffer</i> means.<a name=564:9></a> Now this is an important word, I believe, for us, that the servant is to do the work <i>himself</i>.<a name=564:10></a> God is going to use him, blind though he be -- it is a question of <i>God</i>.<a name=564:11></a>

		Well, dear brethren, I am sure you will see that what I have said about Samson is enough for our consideration as to the whole matter of what each is doing to bring down the world.<a name=565:10></a> We are suffering from it, and the Lord Jesus says, "Woe to the world because of offences" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:7">Matthew  18:7</a>).<a name=565:11></a> We are to have a right attitude towards it in the sense in which it affects us, to turn our faces steadily against it, to see how it affects us and face it in that way, and it will be brought down.<a name=565:12></a> Samson dies with the world, but it is a remarkable thing that he has not a burial by the Philistines or with them.<a name=565:13></a> God has great regard for the burials of His saints, whatsoever their history may have been.<a name=565:14></a> Supremely in the case of the Lord Jesus: "men appointed his grave with the wicked, but he was with the rich in his death" -- that was the divine decree.<a name=565:15></a> Samson too was with his brethren.<a name=565:16></a> It is a very precious thing to me that it should be so, that a man who brings down the world is amongst his brethren in his death, buried by them.<a name=565:17></a> And it is significantly stated that he "had judged Israel twenty years".<a name=565:18></a>

		So His word is kept; it is not simply that one <i>should</i> keep it, but he <i>will</i> keep it.<a name=567:2></a> It is a question of love for Christ in any locality.<a name=567:3></a> One hears complaint about the weakness in some locality and the possibility of things being discontinued, but where is love in such a circumstance?<a name=567:4></a> Love <i>never</i> fails.<a name=567:5></a> Hence why should what is divinely needed be discontinued?<a name=567:6></a> Why should I not make tabernacle conditions?<a name=567:7></a> If I love Christ, I shall lay myself out to be a strong city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls; I shall lay myself out for tabernacle conditions for God.<a name=567:8></a> There the Lord says, "my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him".<a name=567:9></a> How beautiful that is, and how independent it makes us, dear brethren, even of numbers!<a name=567:10></a> The real commodity needed in this particular case is love for Christ; one who loves Him will keep His word, as He accredits to Philadelphia; He says, thou "hast kept my word;" one of the greatest features of the last times is the saints keeping the word of Christ.<a name=567:11></a> It affords tabernacle conditions, because, if I keep the word of Christ, I must have everything removed from myself and my surroundings that is contrary to God and to Christ.<a name=567:12></a> This makes way for individual holiness, and all that is suitable for God, and hence the Lord says, "we will come to him and make our abode with him".<a name=567:13></a>
