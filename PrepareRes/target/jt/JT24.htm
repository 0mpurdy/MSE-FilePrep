		What I have before me on this occasion is the subject of growth.<a name=1:3></a> I am thinking of spiritual growth, assuming that this is expressed in the idea of a son as in contrast to a child or babe; and I have selected these passages which I have read in order to develop, by the Lord's help, the idea of sonship.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish first to enlarge a little on the idea of a son of the light.<a name=1:5></a> Around us we have developments of a similar nature to that which I hope to speak of, but in a bad or a worldly sense.<a name=1:6></a> We have, as an example, the expression from the Lord's own lips, "a son of hell".<a name=1:7></a> Speaking to the Jews He says, "Ye compass the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and when he is become such, ye make him twofold more the son of hell than yourselves", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:15">Matthew  23:15</a>.<a name=1:8></a> Again we have from the Lord's lips, when speaking to His Father, the expression, "the son of perdition".<a name=1:9></a> These expressions refer to maturity in what is evil; a very serious consideration for those who are in the world, for such developments are proceeding, and young people entering into the world are exposed to the influences which are at work in maturing such persons as the Lord refers to.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have over against that the expression, "sons of light".<a name=1:11></a> John in his gospel uses the word "light" probably more frequently than any other of the evangelical writers.<a name=1:12></a> He contemplates darkness, darkness intensified, and so he records more of the Lord's service in Jerusalem than any of the others, having in view our own times, when the service
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of God has to be carried on in the midst of intensified religious darkness.<a name=2:1></a> The apostles had to do with such darkness as the Lord Himself did in Jerusalem.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we are called upon to serve in corresponding darkness, a darkness which is augmented by religious claims, claims of apostolic succession, claims of superior intelligence and investigation, and these darkening influences are no longer confined to the few, they are permeating the masses.<a name=2:3></a> They are not only found in the centres of learning, they are found in the workshops, in the minds, in the homes of men and women.<a name=2:4></a> It is becoming fashionable to believe in a lie.<a name=2:5></a> We are, therefore, to serve Christ in the face of the most intensified darkness that has ever existed.<a name=2:6></a> Hence it behoves us, not simply to take up the truth in its initial features, and to clothe ourselves with the armour of light, but to develop in our souls in the apprehension of the light, so that we become sons of the light, and as sons of the light not deceived by any of the darkening influences that are presented to us.<a name=2:7></a> We can see that they are of the darkness; they emerge from their own source and author, and a son of the light is not deceived.<a name=2:8></a> So John prepares us, as we understand his gospel, to shine in our day and to confront the darkness as sons of the light.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that in this gospel we have no wholesale cures or miracles accomplished.<a name=2:10></a> The other evangelists speak of the Lord curing every one who came to Him, and there were many; the number is not given.<a name=2:11></a> In Mark the Lord cured at sunset all who came to Him from every quarter, whereas John gives us but a few instances, and those are isolated ones; they are not in groups.<a name=2:12></a> We can understand that, because of the sterility of the soil in which He had to sow, for darkened religionists afford the most sterile soil there is, but nevertheless He wrought, and not without results.<a name=2:13></a> We find Him content to speak to one, and He was successful in securing that one

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(I refer to the woman of Samaria), so that she became a son of the light.<a name=3:1></a> She discerned by what He said to her that her body -- even a body such as hers -- could become so purified and energised by the Spirit of God that light could shine out of it in the darkness.<a name=3:2></a> She left her waterpot, we are told, and went into the city.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to this woman in a practical way, because she illustrates the feature of the work of Christ as seen in John.<a name=3:4></a> She immediately moves in service and in successful service; she was in accord with John the baptist, who pointed to Jesus.<a name=3:5></a> The Samaritans came to Him; they did not flock about her and make her an oracle after modern fashion; they said, "We have heard him ourselves".<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in a man like Peter we have another son of the light.<a name=3:7></a> He was "one of the twelve", we read; for John never uses official titles in referring to the servants of God.<a name=3:8></a> We have to be content to serve without a title; he who makes least of his titles is likely to be the most successful.<a name=3:9></a> Peter says, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=3:10></a> thou hast words of life eternal".<a name=3:11></a> Would he turn to those we hear spoken of as the great leaders of modern thought?<a name=3:12></a> Would he listen to the man that speaks "froward things", as many of the people of God, alas!<a name=3:13></a> do, in reading their books?<a name=3:14></a> He says, "Thou hast words".<a name=3:15></a> How many?<a name=3:16></a> Think of the treasury of words, words of eternal life.<a name=3:17></a> A son of the light knows where these are; his soul seeks after these words, his mind craves for them, and he knows to whom to go.<a name=3:18></a> As the Samaritans went to Christ, so would he, for Christ alone had them.<a name=3:19></a> Some of us may be able to speak a word or convey a thought, but all the words of eternal life are stored up in Christ.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so again in chapter 9 another son of the light is true to the light, and we see what it cost him.<a name=3:21></a> Honoured man indeed!<a name=3:22></a> How few of us have been so
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		honoured; and why?<a name=4:1></a> For want of being sons of the light.<a name=4:2></a> "That which makes all things manifest is light", and as our bodies are full of light, we are not wanted in the circles of this world.<a name=4:3></a> "They cast him out".<a name=4:4></a> One of the finest spectacles morally is seen in the Son of God and an outcast from the religious world being together; how perfectly they agreed; for He was an outcast Himself from the very outset according to this narrative.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I think of the Son of God, I think of One who takes account of everything in relation to God, but I think of One, too, who can associate me with Himself; as He says to Peter elsewhere, "That take, and give it unto them for me and thee", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:27">Matthew  17:27</a>.<a name=4:6></a> Peter was a son.<a name=4:7></a> How wonderful, as an outcast in this world, to hear His voice, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=4:8></a>" A true son of the light will believe on the Son of God, and so he says, "I believe, Lord: and did him homage".<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention these instances, but there are many such in this gospel, in whom this principle of matured spiritual apprehension is set forth, and I may say, dear brethren, that nothing else will stand by you in the presence of the darkness.<a name=4:10></a> A son of the light knows what to do; he is never at any disadvantage or inconvenience by the actings of the darkness; his path is plain and clear.<a name=4:11></a> So in chapter 12, from which I have read, you have sons of light acting for Christ in Bethany; "There they made him a supper".<a name=4:12></a> You see in that incident what the Lord has at the present time in the sons of light moving locally.<a name=4:13></a> They know what to do, and they think for Christ; they are concerned for Christ -- they made Him a supper.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel I cannot be too emphatic in commending to you on this occasion the importance of this gospel, not only from the standpoint of which I am speaking, but from other standpoints, but I especially commend

		it to you as presenting to us sons of light.<a name=5:1></a> "While ye have the light", He says, "believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light".<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the Gospel of Luke we have a son of Abraham, and a son of Abraham is one of the most interesting personages that we can consider.<a name=5:3></a> His ancestry is very old, and it is very honourable.<a name=5:4></a> I speak of it thus because the apostle Paul says that Abraham is the father of us all, so that you can understand how the idea connects itself with every Gentile believer as well as with every Jewish or Israelitish believer.<a name=5:5></a> A son of Abraham takes character from his great progenitor, and perhaps it may not be amiss to be reminded of what is patriarchal in Scripture.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The patriarchal idea has a very prominent place in Scripture.<a name=5:7></a> You will remember that in Peter's address on the day of Pentecost he refers to David as a patriarch.<a name=5:8></a> You can understand the spiritual connection of David as a patriarch and his Son by whom now as exalted in the heavens all the wealth of heaven is being administered to men.<a name=5:9></a> Surely the blessing of Abraham had come down and the administration of David had taken effect in Him of whom Peter spoke.<a name=5:10></a> And so with Zacchaeus, he is here called by the Lord a son of Abraham.<a name=5:11></a> A son of Abraham has inherited things; the patriarchal principle is to pass on an inheritance.<a name=5:12></a> Let us take care of the wonderful inheritance that has come to us; let us not be like Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.<a name=5:13></a> No true son of Abraham will relinquish the least part of the inheritance -- he values it.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I want to dwell for a moment on Abraham's patriarchal care and affection.<a name=5:15></a> He began with the glory of God.<a name=5:16></a> He is the first person in Scripture to whom it is said that God appeared; and He appeared to him as the God of glory.<a name=5:17></a> Think of what it is to be

	<div class="paragraph">
		a son of such a father, for the great principle in a patriarch is to transmit things.<a name=6:1></a> Much has come to ourselves in this way, hence the great importance that has to be attached to what we have received, to what has come down to us by way of inheritance.<a name=6:2></a> How are we to pass it on?<a name=6:3></a> Abraham was concerned in regard to those who should come after him.<a name=6:4></a> God said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?<a name=6:5></a> .<a name=6:6></a>.<a name=6:7></a>.<a name=6:8></a> For I know him", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:17">Genesis  18:17</a>, 19.<a name=6:9></a> How blessed it is to be conscious that God knows our hearts; He knows that we love Him, and that we love Christ, that we love the truth, and that we desire to see all the testimony transmitted into safe hands.<a name=6:10></a> Hence it says of Abraham that "He dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:9">Hebrews  11:9</a>.<a name=6:11></a> Were they not worthy sons?<a name=6:12></a> They were, and so was Joseph.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Genesis closes with a threefold testimony to the effectiveness of Abraham's patriarchal care and affection.<a name=6:14></a> We have in Isaac one who transmitted the blessing; we are told that he "blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come".<a name=6:15></a> Abraham looked on to the future, and so did Isaac; every son of Abraham looks on to the future.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we have in Jacob a worthy son of a worthy progenitor.<a name=6:17></a> True enough he was the product of discipline, but nevertheless he was a true son of Abraham.<a name=6:18></a> In Jacob we have the discernment that passes by the firstborn; no son of Abraham will put his family before the saints.<a name=6:19></a> I say that considerately, beloved friends.<a name=6:20></a> Jacob crossed his hands wittingly; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#48:14">Genesis  48:14</a>.<a name=6:21></a> What a son of Abraham he was!<a name=6:22></a> He discerned and recognised sovereign choice; every son of Abraham recognises the sovereignty of God.<a name=6:23></a> What a man he was!<a name=6:24></a> How he shines, beloved!<a name=6:25></a> When he heard that Joseph was coming he strengthened himself and sat upon his bed.<a name=6:26></a> He was not there a perishing Syrian; he was in the energy of

	<div class="paragraph">
		life.<a name=7:1></a> As he had begun at his birth to reject Esau in taking him by the heel to supplant him, so now he supplanted Manasseh, who was the firstborn.<a name=7:2></a> We have to learn how to supplant, how to set up what is of God in preference to what is of the flesh; that marks a son of Abraham.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And Genesis closes with Joseph, also a true son of Abraham.<a name=7:4></a> We see what a patriarch Joseph was; he had learnt it from his forefather.<a name=7:5></a> The great patriarchal principle was set up in Abraham, it was transmitted to Isaac and to Jacob, and now to Joseph.<a name=7:6></a> Joseph brought the children, when they were to be blessed, out from between his knees; they were not running on the streets; they were not allowed to go hither and thither as they pleased; they were kept within the bounds of affection by that patriarch.<a name=7:7></a> Then, again, we find those same knees occupied in nursing his posterity to the third generation.<a name=7:8></a> What a son of Abraham was Joseph!<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So with Zacchaeus -- despised as he was by the religionists about him -- a publican, the Lord discerned in him, beneath his publican's garb, a son of Abraham.<a name=7:10></a> Was he not like Abraham?<a name=7:11></a> You say, Very little.<a name=7:12></a> But there was something there; it says, "he sought to see Jesus who he was".<a name=7:13></a> Would that every one here with our Bibles in our hands, were exercised in the same way!<a name=7:14></a> "Abraham rejoiced to see my day", the Lord said, "and he saw it", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a>.<a name=7:15></a> He whom Abraham saw in his prophetic vision is now under the eye of Zacchaeus and he wants to know who He is, and the Lord says to him, "Make haste and come down, for today I must abide at thy house".<a name=7:16></a> It was the house of a son of Abraham, and he in whom all the light of Abraham was centred and deposited was in his house.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Zacchaeus was honoured more than Abraham, for it does not say that the Lord entered into Abraham's tent as He drew near to him.<a name=7:18></a> We see what is available

		to us as sons of Abraham today.<a name=8:1></a> He says, "I must remain in thy house".<a name=8:2></a> How needful it is that He should come into our houses so as to impart to us the great patriarchal principle in order that our houses might be according to God.<a name=8:3></a> Of Abraham it is said that he "will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment".<a name=8:4></a> Are these things, beloved, in our houses?<a name=8:5></a> These are the things that mark every son of Abraham.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Today", the Lord says, "I must abide at thy house", and he received Him gladly -- so did Abraham.<a name=8:7></a> Abraham received the Lord gladly at his tent door, but He did not go in; but now, the <i>Lord Himself</i> comes into the house of this publican and he received Him gladly.<a name=8:8></a> What a moment for him!<a name=8:9></a> Have you any doubt that he was a son of Abraham?<a name=8:10></a> You need not have; you have it from the Lord's own lips.<a name=8:11></a> Is there no other evidence?<a name=8:12></a> Yes, there is; He sought to see Jesus who He was, and he called Him "Lord".<a name=8:13></a> He says, "Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I return him fourfold".<a name=8:14></a> See the righteousness that was there!<a name=8:15></a> And the Lord immediately pronounced him a son of Abraham.<a name=8:16></a> How He dignified him in the presence of his traducers!<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the last thought.<a name=8:18></a> I think you will see that what we have been considering is constructive, that is, if we are sons of light we shall be sons of Abraham; we shall cherish the inheritance and we shall aim to pass it on unencumbered.<a name=8:19></a> We shall aim at being like our great spiritual progenitor, Abraham -- the believer.<a name=8:20></a> There is more said of Abraham's faith in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>than there is said of the faith of any other.<a name=8:21></a> And as we lay hold of the idea of a son of Abraham, we readily enter into the idea of a son of God.<a name=8:22></a> One hesitates in drawing near to this great subject.<a name=8:23></a> It is truly wonderful that it

	<div class="paragraph">
		should be said of us, "Because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=9:1></a> A son of God thinks for God, and hence the great end of all ministry is that we are to arrive at the knowledge of the Son of God, for how are we to be sons save as we understand sonship as set forth in Him?<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are to be brought to speak the truth in love.<a name=9:3></a> What a word that is!<a name=9:4></a> How easily we slip into the idea of studying Scripture in order to shine in ministry, but that is not "holding the truth in love".<a name=9:5></a> If I hold the truth in love, I hold it in relation to every saint on earth, and I regard what I may have of it as the property of every saint on earth, for that is what it is.<a name=9:6></a> "Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas .<a name=9:7></a>.<a name=9:8></a>.<a name=9:9></a> all are yours", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:22">1 Corinthians  3:22</a>.<a name=9:10></a> And so a son of God values his ability, values his intelligence, in the measure in which these are effective to the help of the people of God, and only that.<a name=9:11></a> He belongs to the people of God, and he holds the truth in relation to them, and so, as I said, a son thinks for God.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first evidence of the consciousness of sonship is in the expression, "Abba, Father".<a name=9:13></a> What a great result for God as we arrive at sonship in the true bearing of it.<a name=9:14></a> He has sent out the Spirit of His Son into our hearts crying, Abba, Father.<a name=9:15></a> The movements of the Spirit in our hearts as sons have reference to the Father.<a name=9:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful thing, indeed, to know the Father.<a name=9:17></a> The Holy Spirit, I believe, is working at the present time to bring about results for the Father, and as the Father is apprehended the Son is apprehended.<a name=9:18></a> John says, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth".<a name=9:19></a> It is thus that we apprehend Christ in His relation to the Father, and we see that all His affections are set on bringing about results for the Father, and hence, what an immense thought is

		I have in mind to speak a word about the house of God, and particularly to seek to show how believers are put there suitably to God and to His house; and what occurs to me in approaching a subject so familiar to us, is that entrance into the house of God stands in relation to discipline.<a name=11:1></a> No one is in it according to God apart from discipline.<a name=11:2></a> Discipline is not incidental; it is a fixed part of the curriculum, as I may say, of God's teaching; and it is quite obvious to us all that no one can be in His house apart from His teaching, and no one teaches like Him.<a name=11:3></a> "Who teacheth like him?<a name=11:4></a>" Elihu says.<a name=11:5></a> The apostle reminded the Thessalonians that they were taught of God, and the Lord, speaking to the Jews, says, "It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.<a name=11:6></a> Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me".<a name=11:7></a> Those who are divinely taught come to Christ.<a name=11:8></a> He is over the house, and He gives us our place in the house, and He is concerned that in occupying that place we should do so as divinely taught, for if we do not know how to behave ourselves now in the house of God, how should we in the future?<a name=11:9></a> All our education enters into the present time, and a great feature of it is discipline.<a name=11:10></a>

		In counting after man, we would be disposed to include some whose names may not be written in heaven, and then, when the time of translation comes, we should have the shame of seeing those left behind; so it were better to leave the numbering with God.<a name=12:7></a> David found to his bitter cost that he had better have done so, and that he had but indulged his pride.<a name=12:8></a> But now he humbles himself, and thinks of the people, saying, "These sheep, what have they done?<a name=12:9></a>" Worthy words indeed, penitent words!<a name=12:10></a> He invited the stroke on himself, and on his father's house, and, in result, he is directed to go to the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, and to rear up an altar there, and the Lord answered from heaven by fire, and the sword of Jehovah, stretched over the beloved city, is sheathed.<a name=12:11></a> Discipline has had its effect.<a name=12:12></a> David has learned through it, and so he says, "This is the house of the Lord God", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#22:1">1 Chronicles  22:1</a>.<a name=12:13></a>

		No one can read the closing chapters of 1 Chronicles without being profoundly affected by the intelligence and affections of David, and the way they centred in the house.<a name=13:2></a> Even Solomon's greatness was subservient to David's, as David had had the house in view from the outset, and now arrives at it, as was said, through discipline.<a name=13:3></a> So Solomon was to devote all his resources, intelligence, and energy to the building of a house in keeping with Him who would dwell there.<a name=13:4></a> David said, We heard of the ark at Ephratah, but where did they find it?<a name=13:5></a> In the fields of the wood.<a name=13:6></a> That was no place for Jehovah; he had found it in circumstances wholly unsuitable to it.<a name=13:7></a> God should have something more from a people whom He had brought out of Egypt, a people whom He had enriched and taught, whom He had beautified and exalted to a kingdom, than that He should be in the fields of the wood.<a name=13:8></a> So David's great purpose and service of love was to find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob; an habitation in keeping with the One who was to dwell there and that was to be "exceeding magnifical".<a name=13:9></a> But as I remarked -- and that is why I referred to David -- he arrived at the site of it by way of discipline.<a name=13:10></a>

		Now in the Epistle to the Romans we get the fundamental principles of everything; the germ of all that follows as superstructure is found in this letter.<a name=13:11></a> It begins with the Son of God, "The gospel of God concerning his Son .<a name=13:12></a>.<a name=13:13></a>.<a name=13:14></a> and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead".<a name=13:15></a> He is marked out Son of God in power by resurrection of the dead.<a name=13:16></a> It is in the apprehension of the declaration that we lay hold of what follows.<a name=13:17></a> The declaration is

		Then hope follows, for surely my experience is not in view of my adornment and exaltation in this world.<a name=15:13></a> If my object is to be something among the people of God, I have my reward, and I have no need of hope; but if I am living in hope I am not living in this scene; "and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us".<a name=15:14></a> That is what I am to live in; if not living in that, I am enclosed in my own fat, so to speak, I am living in what I may be, or think I may be, here, whereas the divine

		But there is more than that.<a name=16:9></a> The Holy Spirit occupies us also with Christ, and that is why I read the passages in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#30">Genesis  30</a>and 33.<a name=16:10></a> You find that in Padan-aram, when Joseph is born, Jacob begins to move.<a name=16:11></a> No doubt he already knew something of God, for he had faith.<a name=16:12></a> Jacob was one of the most remarkable children ever born, indeed there was no babe like him recorded in Scripture, for even before he was born he was actuated by divine instinct, and immediately he is born, he takes his brother by the heel.<a name=16:13></a> The prophet Hosea comments on this later (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#12:3">Hosea  12:3</a>), and he does not refer to it as anything blameworthy.<a name=16:14></a> The circumstance is introduced rather as a rebuke to Jacob's posterity who had turned to idols.<a name=16:15></a> Hosea said in effect to those of his day, Jacob did not do this.<a name=16:16></a> He took his brother by the heel; he had supplanted Esau, the man after the flesh whom they were indulging.<a name=16:17></a> Jacob was marked from the outset by spiritual instincts, and by his strength he had power with God.<a name=16:18></a> When he became a man he

		wrestled with God; "Yea, he had power over the angel and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him".<a name=17:1></a> What a man he was!<a name=17:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to all this so that you might see what a man Jacob was, how that in the very beginning -- from the womb -- spiritual instincts were there, and how greatly they developed as he proceeded.<a name=17:3></a> And so we find him at Bethel (chapter 35) -- the culminating result of all his history.<a name=17:4></a> He had, as I said, some knowledge of God at Padan-aram, but there are those who have a measure of light as to God who do not know Christ.<a name=17:5></a> So it was when Joseph was born -- Christ typically -- that Jacob moves; and though he lingered, God kept him to it, and says to him in the next chapter, "Return unto the land of thy fathers".<a name=17:6></a> Christ in figure had come into his vision.<a name=17:7></a> That stage in Christians is set forth in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>; the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, and we must know who made that love possible.<a name=17:8></a> Christ made it possible.<a name=17:9></a> Is He then to be left out?<a name=17:10></a> No.<a name=17:11></a> He is to stand out in our souls in holy dignity as dying for us; so "when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly", and in dying He commends the love of God to us.<a name=17:12></a> So we see how the covenant is bound up with Him who is the Mediator of it.<a name=17:13></a> Christ died; that was His part; God gave Him, but Christ died, and so, "if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life".<a name=17:14></a> So that Christ makes God stand out in His blessed distinctiveness and love.<a name=17:15></a> In the symbol of the Lord's supper, "this cup is the new covenant in my blood", He would make God known, so that He might be in our hearts accordingly.<a name=17:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, as I was saying, Joseph comes into Jacob's horizon, and he moved; it may be in a small way, nevertheless it caused Jacob to move.<a name=17:17></a>

		typically, and in chapter 33 Joseph comes definitely into view in a most striking manner, in a manner that points to his personal distinctiveness in a peculiar way.<a name=18:1></a> Leah with her children passed before Esau, she is first; then it says, "and after came Joseph near and Rachel" -- not Rachel and Joseph, but Joseph and Rachel.<a name=18:2></a> Joseph is first.<a name=18:3></a> The point is, we are getting nearer to the house, and it is meet that Christ should be acquiring a greater place with us.<a name=18:4></a> That is what is going on at the present time.<a name=18:5></a> What the Holy Spirit is labouring at is to establish in our souls Christ's distinctive place as the One who died in order to make the love of God known, so that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.<a name=18:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we are speaking of is on the line of experience, and it is very remarkable that the facts cited in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>to establish the Deity and greatness of Christ are all taken from that part of scripture (the Psalms) which is full of the experience of the saints; God thus uses these scriptures to testify to the greatness of Christ.<a name=18:7></a> We are in a position as knowing Christ as the One who died for us, to be called in to bear witness to His greatness; that is <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>.<a name=18:8></a> We can understand how this leads to the house, and I would remark that the book of Psalms speaks more of the house of God than any part of the Old Testament.<a name=18:9></a> One can understand, too, that those who, by experience, arrive at a knowledge of Christ would value the house.<a name=18:10></a> To have Christ in one's heart soon dissipates nature.<a name=18:11></a>

		I will now refer to another incident in the Acts in which we see the Spirit acting personally.<a name=24:7></a> While Peter was at Joppa he had a vision, and while he thought on it the Spirit told him to go to Cornelius, and then as Peter is preaching at Caesarea, the Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.<a name=24:8></a> Peter was not actually the one to receive the returning Gentile; he had an intimate part in the wonderful transaction, for he announced the mind of God -- the glad tidings -- a most honoured part, surely, and one in keeping with his commission, for unto him had been given the keys of the kingdom.<a name=24:9></a> But one may use the keys to open the door without embracing the incomer.<a name=24:10></a> It was God Himself, by the Spirit, who received the returning Gentile.<a name=24:11></a> May we not learn thus from God how to receive?<a name=24:12></a> As Peter spoke, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.<a name=24:13></a> It was important that they should hear the word; the mind of God was opened up to them in the word, they were enlightened by it, and as having heard it they were embraced divinely.<a name=24:14></a> The Holy Spirit <i>fell</i>, it says, upon them.<a name=24:15></a> "Fell" is the same word, as we have often remarked, as is used in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>; the father fell on the prodigal's neck and kissed him.<a name=24:16></a> So here, the Holy Spirit acts

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus God would show us how to receive.<a name=25:6></a> We see in Ananias and in Peter a certain unreadiness for this great service; honoured disciples, indeed, honoured servants!<a name=25:7></a> nevertheless, wanting in ability to reflect fully the mind and spirit of heaven.<a name=25:8></a> Hence this disciple in Damascus is taken in hand by the Lord, for His great vessel is not to be received into the assembly unbecomingly; he is not to come in by the window or by the back door, so to speak.<a name=25:9></a> He is to be received into the bosom of the assembly, and that means into the bosom of heaven, for the assembly, as I remarked, is to be the reflection, and thus the representation, of heaven upon earth.<a name=25:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord, therefore, having met this potentially great servant on the way, and having brought him down, would have him received here into the assembly according to heaven, and to this end the Lord appears to Ananias in a vision and says, "Go into the street which is called Straight".<a name=25:11></a> It is very touching that the Lord Jesus, the Creator, He who has gone into heaven, angels and principalities and powers being subjected to Him, should know the names of the streets.<a name=25:12></a> May we not be assured that He knows the limitations of the cities as well as their streets?<a name=25:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This street, called Straight, was doubtless humanly named and well known in Damascus, but it was known to Jesus, and He knew that a convert was there.<a name=25:14></a> Ananias did not know, and even being told of the

		There is no such thought in the house of God as patronage.<a name=26:13></a> In the government of God there may be different stations, but when we enter the house of God we must leave out our patronage.<a name=26:14></a> We do not condescend to any one; we cannot.<a name=26:15></a> Ananias laid his hands on him, signifying identification with him, and said, "Saul!<a name=26:16></a>" The last time Saul had heard that name, as far as the scripture narrative indicates, it had come from the lips of the Lord.<a name=26:17></a> May I not suggest that the accents were similar from the lips of Ananias: "Saul, brother", he says, "the Lord has sent me, Jesus that appeared to thee in the way in which thou camest, that thou mightest see, and be filled with the Holy Spirit".<a name=26:18></a> You see the perfect

		But I must proceed to the other scriptures, although one would fain linger longer on this fine scripture.<a name=27:8></a> It wears wonderfully; like other similar scriptures, the more you press it, the more it yields.<a name=27:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 10 we see the Gentiles were to be received, and there is therefore deliberation.<a name=27:10></a> Peter has to be hungry, an initial preparation, and then heaven is brought down to him, as it were, in the sheet -- the mind of heaven.<a name=27:11></a> It is not that he is caught up into heaven, like Paul was later, to see what is there, but heaven is brought down, the mind of heaven is brought down to him.<a name=27:12></a> As he said, "It came even to me"; for if he is to have part in the reception of the Gentiles, he must reflect heaven, he must move in correspondence to heaven.<a name=27:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This reception is a very great transaction, one of the most interesting transactions in the whole of Scripture, and Peter is privileged to have part in it; but what we learn is that if he is to have part in it, it must be as being in accordance with the mind of heaven.<a name=27:14></a> So the sheet comes down thrice, and there is the voice from heaven a second time, and then Peter continued pondering.<a name=27:15></a> It is a matter of deliberation.<a name=27:16></a>

		In Philemon we have another picture of reception, and here again this dear brother Philemon seems to be remiss on the point.<a name=29:10></a> He is called a beloved brother, and others with him are addressed in terms of affection by the apostle (verses 1, 2).<a name=29:11></a> He had an assembly in his house too.<a name=29:12></a> He was an honoured servant, surely, one who had a most prominent place in his locality, and yet he has to be taught how to receive the result of the work of God; and is it not, dear brethren, in order that <i>we</i> also may be taught this that these things are recorded?<a name=29:13></a> Surely it is.<a name=29:14></a> Is it not that we should be taught to be prepared to preach that the book of Jonah is written?<a name=29:15></a> Surely it is.<a name=29:16></a> We have to be prepared.<a name=29:17></a> What I may call the key-word of that prophet is the word 'prepared', and this preparing process is proceeding constantly; and happy it is for those who are the subjects of it,

		Now Philemon, honoured and beloved brother as he was, was evidently remiss on this point; he had to be instructed how to receive Onesimus as a brother beloved; "That thou shouldest receive him for ever; not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved".<a name=30:11></a> Evidently what stood in the way, specially in his case, was that the person in question had been his slave; that had to be overcome.<a name=30:12></a> How one who, in the government of God, had a station much higher, should be able to receive the one in the lower grades of society, even into his own house, as a brother beloved, is the problem no doubt in the writing of this epistle, and with the skill of heaven the beloved apostle writes.<a name=30:13></a>

		The testimony is to proceed, and it is thus that it proceeds.<a name=31:6></a> The same sun shines on every generation, as it says in <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#1:5">Ecclesiastes  1:5</a>, "The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose", so that it should shine again, and the same sun shines on every generation; nevertheless the sun is one thing and the experience that you get under it is another thing.<a name=31:7></a> The experience that we get under the sun may be passed on, and should be passed on, to the coming generation.<a name=31:8></a> So the apostle here, being such an one as Paul the aged, has got a child, and he values him.<a name=31:9></a> He says, "my child Onesimus".<a name=31:10></a> It was his particular child that he had begotten in his bonds; he would carry on to the coming generation something of his father; but he was already a brother beloved.<a name=31:11></a>

		But more than that, if a brother beloved, the receiver of him would have him for ever.<a name=31:12></a> The idea of the family is continued; we never lose our brethren.<a name=31:13></a> The matter of time is of no account in that respect, because we shall all join presently; and what a reception!<a name=31:14></a> I suppose, perhaps, the most touching of all receptions will be that accorded to us by the Lord when He says, "And if I go .<a name=31:15></a>.<a name=31:16></a>.<a name=31:17></a> I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also".<a name=31:18></a> So I think the apostle

		I want to make that clear, and to make clear too how we come into this power, for without it our testimony cannot be effective.<a name=37:6></a> So the first feature -- the lion -- should, I believe, appear in the youngest believer who has the Spirit, and who confesses the Lord Jesus.<a name=37:7></a> Many are in soul difficulties because they do not confess, but in confessing the Lord you raise your standard, you are not afraid of the face of man, you have come into the light of the Lord Jesus in heaven, you have come into the light of the great fact that the Holy Spirit has been sent down by Him, and that the Holy Spirit is greater than the world power, "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:4">1 John  4:4</a>), and thus you confess the Lord Jesus, and that is the act of a lion.<a name=37:8></a> You are not to underrate what that may involve; it will involve conflict, but no one is of any value until he faces the enemy.<a name=37:9></a> As you face him and confess the Lord Jesus, you realise that you have got more power than the enemy; he flees from you; he has no power against you as you confess boldly the Lord

		Then the next thing which has a stately step is the war-horse.<a name=38:4></a> He represents aggressiveness.<a name=38:5></a> The lion stands his ground, he turns not away from any, but the horse according to Job is aggressive: "He .<a name=38:6></a>.<a name=38:7></a>.<a name=38:8></a> cannot contain himself at the sound of the trumpet .<a name=38:9></a>.<a name=38:10></a>.<a name=38:11></a> and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#39:24">Job  39:24</a>, 25); he is not deterred.<a name=38:12></a> He goes forward notwithstanding the sword and the spear; "he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted".<a name=38:13></a> He knows the issue, and he is present whenever a conflict is on for the truth; he is never away in the background; he discerns that the issue is the truth, and he comes forward: "He paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength".<a name=38:14></a> It is the believer consciously possessed of the Spirit.<a name=38:15></a> He knows the power he has, he knows what he has received it for, and he is not afraid to use it; so he is present in power for the maintenance of the truth of God, for that is the issue -- there is no other.<a name=38:16></a> The world may have its issues, but for him there is no issue other than the truth; it is a question of the truth, and no one who loves Christ will fail to use every bit of power that he has for the maintenance of what belongs to Him.<a name=38:17></a>

		The next is the he-goat.<a name=38:18></a> The goat is a creature that can isolate himself, and does.<a name=38:19></a> I have no doubt he represents the believer here as able to retire into the presence of God.<a name=38:20></a> Many of us began well, we made

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses, I suppose, is one of the best illustrations of what is set forth in the he-goat; he was on the mount with God; Aaron was with the people; Moses came down from the mount from being with God.<a name=39:4></a> What an experience was his!<a name=39:5></a> He was forty days with God, and he neither ate nor drank; what room there was in him for God!<a name=39:6></a> Down in the valley the people were eating, and drinking, and playing, and making the golden calf -- all these things go together.<a name=39:7></a> Moses neither ate nor drank, he lived by God.<a name=39:8></a> "Man shall not live by bread alone", the Lord said, "but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God".<a name=39:9></a> And what words were proceeding out of the mouth of God as Moses was with Him there upon the mount!<a name=39:10></a> never had a man heard such words.<a name=39:11></a> There were portrayed before him by the words of God Himself all the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; all were opened up to him; he lived upon them.<a name=39:12></a> And as he was with God his very being, as I may say, was saturated with the thoughts of God.<a name=39:13></a> How wonderful!<a name=39:14></a> What a man he was as he descended that mount!<a name=39:15></a> How he besought the Lord his God for the people!<a name=39:16></a> He interceded for them with God before he entered the camp; but when he did enter no one could stand before him.<a name=39:17></a> There were possibly two millions of people there, but there was not one that could rise up in the presence of Moses; he is the king, for the goat culminates in the king --

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the beginning of what we have developed in Balaam's prophecy; from that point Moses advances and goes forward until it is said that he is king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together; <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:5">Deuteronomy  33:5</a>.<a name=40:4></a> It was not a question of his being made or crowned king; he was never made a king; he was a king morally by being with God, and the shout of a king was with him.<a name=40:5></a> How we need that, dear friends.<a name=40:6></a> The Holy Spirit is brought in figuratively in chapter 21, and Balaam looks at the people, and note that in his prophecies it is of the people he is speaking.<a name=40:7></a> As one thinks of the companies of the Lord's people, one is entitled to look at them from the standpoint of the possession of the Spirit.<a name=40:8></a> We can only look at them according to God as we look at them from that standpoint -- from the top of the rocks.<a name=40:9></a> We must dismiss from our minds for the moment what they may be according to the flesh, and look at them from the standpoint of the Spirit.<a name=40:10></a> And so as one thinks of the Lord's people, moving about among them, as one has the privilege to do, one thinks of what there is there.<a name=40:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First we have the <i>shout</i> of a king: "The shout of a king is among them".<a name=40:12></a> A shout expresses victory.<a name=40:13></a> We all know how it was said at Jericho, "Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city".<a name=40:14></a> They had only to shout, all the rest was done by God.<a name=40:15></a> So Balaam here sees the people from the standpoint of the Spirit and the shout of a king is among them.<a name=40:16></a> It is for us to consider, dear brethren, whether in our several localities there is the shout of a king among us.<a name=40:17></a> What I have said indicates how such a thing is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		reached.<a name=41:1></a> It is a question of the Spirit, the Spirit being recognised.<a name=41:2></a> But more than that, for the first prophecy of Balaam refers to the separation of the people -- "The people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations".<a name=41:3></a> The admission of worldly influences deadens the power of the Spirit.<a name=41:4></a> If we are to have the shout of a king, there must be the rigid refusal of worldly principles and associations.<a name=41:5></a> Severe isolation from the world is the secret of this of which I speak.<a name=41:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the second prophecy contemplates the power which is the result of this: The shout of a king is among them ".<a name=41:7></a>.<a name=41:8></a>.<a name=41:9></a> he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn".<a name=41:10></a> So as one has part in any local meeting where there is separation, where the Spirit is recognised, where the flesh is refused, you find the strength of a unicorn -- you find power; whereas where worldly principles are admitted, where separation is not maintained, where the Spirit is not recognised, you will find things limited and hampered, and no results.<a name=41:11></a> So that it is a question for us in our localities as to whether there are the evidences of power among us.<a name=41:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the third prophecy we have, "His king shall be higher than Agag", that is to say, the power that is amongst us is not built up after the flesh.<a name=41:13></a> Agag represents the flesh.<a name=41:14></a> I have no doubt that the systems around us are marked by their Agags -- their men of power, for it is undeniable they have men of great power, as it is said elsewhere, "There were giants .<a name=41:15></a>.<a name=41:16></a>.<a name=41:17></a> in those days".<a name=41:18></a> These mighty men, men of renown, sprang from an unholy alliance -- from the sons of God and the daughters of men.<a name=41:19></a> We cannot deny the power that exists around us from such alliances; but the power of the Spirit is greater.<a name=41:20></a> Not one of them can hold his ground in the presence of Israel's king -- "His king shall be higher than Agag".<a name=41:21></a> We see the superiority the Holy Spirit gives us as we recognise Him.<a name=41:22></a> The apostle Paul fought with

	<div class="paragraph">
		beasts at Ephesus; he <i>fought</i> with them, but he was not overcome by them.<a name=42:1></a> No one could stand in the presence of Paul; he had power by him to bring down strongholds and everything that exalted itself against Christ; he was higher than Agag.<a name=42:2></a> He had weapons of warfare, mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, and the casting down of every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God.<a name=42:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the fourth prophecy we have a Star and Sceptre spoken of.<a name=42:4></a> I need not remind you of the progress thus made.<a name=42:5></a> As the Spirit is recognised there is the shout of a king, then there is superiority over men of this world, however great -- higher than Agag; and then there is the Star and Sceptre.<a name=42:6></a> "There shall come a Star out of Jacob".<a name=42:7></a> The Star suggests much to us.<a name=42:8></a> It suggests the reflection of light.<a name=42:9></a> There is not only power, there is the radiation of light.<a name=42:10></a> The light that is radiating at this present time is the light of the coming day -- a day we are on the very threshold of.<a name=42:11></a> This is a development that every servant, every Christian should have before him -- that there should be the radiation of light, the light of a star.<a name=42:12></a> It is the reflection of Christ thrown in on the present darkness, the harbinger of a day that is nearing.<a name=42:13></a> How important to see what God is leading up to, what great thoughts He has, and how they are worked out in the recognition of the Spirit!<a name=42:14></a> We see what is before us, what we may reach under the hand of God as we are content to let the flesh go.<a name=42:15></a> There is the Star; we see things in the light, the light of Christ is brought in on everything.<a name=42:16></a> It is now a question of Christ; everything must be regulated by Him.<a name=42:17></a> It is a question of the light of Christ being brought in in the star.<a name=42:18></a> That light which is about to burst on this world is already radiating in those who recognise the Spirit.<a name=42:19></a> It is a wonderful thing the idea of the Star, and then there is the

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sceptre.<a name=43:1></a> "A Sceptre shall rise out of Israel".<a name=43:2></a> The sceptre suggests the principle of the rule of Christ; it is not simply that we have His commandments; it is that He is influencing us, so that all is dominated by Him.<a name=43:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then He disposes of the corners of Moab "shall smite the corners of Moab".<a name=43:4></a> It is not now a question of defence, but of aggression.<a name=43:5></a> He deals with the pride of this world, and again with the children of Sheth, or the sons of tumult of which the world is full; but we are in the light of Him who is to dispose of all that.<a name=43:6></a> He "shall destroy all the sons of tumult".<a name=43:7></a> As a matter of fact, this fourth prophecy is the solution of what is called the Eastern question.<a name=43:8></a> Taking it prophetically, it refers to what the Lord will do in the latter days.<a name=43:9></a> He will dispose of Moab and Edom and all these ancient enemies of Israel, until we see the ships of Chittim afflicting Asshur and Eber for their destruction.<a name=43:10></a> It is the solution of the Eastern question.<a name=43:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not, however, wish to speak of prophecy, but it is well to see how the Lord Himself will come in through Israel, for it is Israel's king that is in view, and the exploits of Israel as having the Spirit.<a name=43:12></a> Through Israel He will deal with all the ancient enemies of Israel which were in immediate proximity to them.<a name=43:13></a> The Western powers are dealt with otherwise, and so is the Northern power, but the Star and the Sceptre dispose of all the immediate surroundings of Israel, so that Israel will triumph.<a name=43:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With ourselves, the star is the light of Christ being reflected at the present time.<a name=43:15></a> I wish I could make this point clear.<a name=43:16></a> It is a Colossian suggestion.<a name=43:17></a> Romans and Corinthians synchronise as unfolding the authority, the commandments of Christ, but Colossians is Christ Himself; it is being in the light of Christ; "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord", it says, "so walk ye in him".<a name=43:18></a> It is Himself --

	<div class="paragraph">
		it involves headship.<a name=44:1></a> So in this fourth prophecy, I apprehend, the Star contemplates the light of Christ radiating in His people, and the Sceptre is His own direct influence; it may be through His people, nevertheless, it is Christ, and the more we advance in the truth, the more we look for the direct influence of the Lord.<a name=44:2></a> We come back, therefore, to the assembly as it was set up by Paul; we have come back to our Head and we His members, so that the light of Christ is reflected in His body.<a name=44:3></a> In the sceptre there is the rule of Christ, but I would very much prefer to be ruled by His influence, than by His commandments.<a name=44:4></a> I begin with His commandments, but I want to come under His influence -- the influence of Christ.<a name=44:5></a> "In his shadow have I rapture and sit down", <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#2:3">Song of Songs  2:3</a>.<a name=44:6></a> It is the direct influence of Christ.<a name=44:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How important it is to learn to be restful under that influence.<a name=44:8></a> Perhaps one of the greatest needs amongst us is the keeping of the Sabbath, so to speak, the coming under the influence of Christ, so that we are restful in His presence.<a name=44:9></a> "In his shadow have I rapture and <i>sit down</i>".<a name=44:10></a> I am not to live in my service, however successful; I am to live under the immediate influence of Christ -- His left hand under my head, and His right hand embracing me.<a name=44:11></a> How immediate it all is, and so there is the Star and the Sceptre, the reflection of Christ and the rule of His influence.<a name=44:12></a> Thus, I believe the Lord would set out what is before us, what is attainable as we proceed on the line of the Spirit and disallow the flesh.<a name=44:13></a> We arrive at kingly power and the light of Christ radiating as from the star in these dark days.<a name=44:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=45:1></a> The Lord may help us to see how the work of God, as indicated in this prophet, corresponds with the writings of John.<a name=45:2></a> Here we see that work culminating in unity -- Judah and Israel are brought together in life.<a name=45:3></a> John's gospel corresponds very much with this prophet, indeed the reference, I suppose, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>by the Lord is to this very passage (chapter 36), and there are many other corresponding features, particularly in signs, that we get throughout Ezekiel.<a name=45:4></a> As we all know, John's gospel, and indeed the book of Revelation, are on the same principle -- "He sent and <i>signified</i>"; so that John's testimony is largely based on signs with, of course -- a spiritual import.<a name=45:5></a> Ezekiel, as we know doubtless, signifies the strength of God, and it opens with the prophet among the captives, sharing with his brethren their afflictions, but he sees the heavens opened and an array of power in certain symbolical features, whereby the will of God is enforced, and maintained in this world.<a name=45:6></a> But the government of God can only subserve His purpose, and His purpose is that His people should live, and that they should live in unity, and that that unity should mark them: "I will make them one nation in the land".<a name=45:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as following this teaching (chapters 36 and 37), the prophet is brought in the visions of God into the land of Israel in chapter 40, and the man whose appearance was like that of brass with a flax-cord in his hand and a measuring reed, takes him to the gate by which Jehovah was to enter into His house, and the measurements all correspond -- one reed.<a name=45:8></a> Thus we have in John's ministry life developed, and then unity, so that conditions may exist for God to

		J.T.<a name=47:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>the work of God affects the whole man; chapter 36 contemplates that there should be a new heart and a new spirit.<a name=47:10></a> It does not say exactly a new soul, but there is a new heart and a new spirit; then He says, "I will put my spirit within you".<a name=47:11></a> Now I think we have in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>the work of God as it <i>begins</i>, its initial stages, and it may be very aptly illustrated in Jacob who, according to Hosea, acted on divine instinct in taking his brother by the heel; that is, the work of God in its initial features in the believer leads to the instinctive displacement of the man after the flesh.<a name=47:12></a> It begins that way, and Jacob began that way, and he ends that way.<a name=47:13></a> He began with taking hold of Esau by the heel and he ended with putting Ephraim before Manasseh; so there was perfect correspondence between the beginning of his spiritual life and the end of it.<a name=47:14></a> In between there was much discipline; but the great weakness amongst the people of God is largely due to the want of that instinct, the instinct that sets the natural man aside to make room for the spiritual.<a name=47:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=48:15></a> We see in the after history how accurate Jacob's instinct was; he knew nothing about the prophecies obviously, or that it had been foretold that the elder should serve the younger and that he should replace Esau, but his later history shows the accuracy of his instinct.<a name=48:16></a> All along the line Esau's conduct proves that Jacob is right.<a name=48:17></a> Hosea says nothing about the buying of the birthright, the purchase of the inheritance, nor about his deception, but it does speak of his wrestling with God, following upon his taking his brother by the heel.<a name=48:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=55:3></a> I think the water the Lord referred to in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>is the water that came from His own side "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit"; there can be no cleansing apart from that.<a name=55:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=58:12></a> The term is found more frequently in Ezekiel than in all the rest of Scripture combined, and that must mean something.<a name=58:13></a> Now in John you have it in chapter 1; after the truth of the Lord's Person is outlined.<a name=58:14></a> He says to Nathanael, "Thou shalt see greater things than these .<a name=58:15></a>.<a name=58:16></a>.<a name=58:17></a> .<a name=58:18></a> Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man".<a name=58:19></a> That was something for an Israelite to think over, and it was an Israelite to whom it was said.<a name=58:20></a> A godly Israelite would sit down and ponder the thought, and refer to the scriptures which speak of the Son of man.<a name=58:21></a> He would refer to Ezekiel, he would refer to Daniel, and, as a spiritual man, he would begin to see that God was going to operate on wider lines than those He had hitherto been operating on.<a name=58:22></a> And Israel has to learn that now, before they come into their portion.<a name=58:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=58:26></a> Yes, just so.<a name=58:27></a> An "Israelite indeed" has to accept that the thoughts of God about the race take precedence now of His thoughts about Israel; that is a very serious matter.<a name=58:28></a> One of the signs to Ezekiel is that he is to lose his wife, the delight of his eyes,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=59:12></a> They would not have that; it was a definite stumbling-stone to them.<a name=59:13></a> Stephen sees Jesus in heaven and testified, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man", and Jesus announces Himself to Paul.<a name=59:14></a> These are the lines on which the testimony moved.<a name=59:15></a> Take Saul himself, an Israelite indeed, he had to learn that it was a question not of the promises to Israel first now, but the thoughts of God about the race of men.<a name=59:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=61:5></a> And just for the same reason we have here; prophesying brings in the mind of God.<a name=61:6></a> If a simple person comes in and there is one prophesying, he will fall down and say, "God is in you of a truth".<a name=61:7></a> Every brother who ministers should aim at there being some authority with what he says, not a mere recitation of doctrine, but the oracles of God; for, as I understand gift, it involves a commission, and that, as we know from military matters, involves the authority of the king.<a name=61:8></a> Therefore, a man's uniform represents something, so the ministry of any brother ought to have certain authority with it -- the mind of God should be there.<a name=61:9></a>

		In what I have to say on this occasion I want to show how the epistle to the Romans lays the basis for priesthood.<a name=82:1></a> I wish to speak about priesthood, and to show how it applies to young believers.<a name=82:2></a> The Scriptures speak about the sons of Levi being priests, and they also speak more expressly about the sons of Aaron, and Aaron and his sons.<a name=82:3></a> The latter are more prominent in the wilderness, the former appear in connection with the land.<a name=82:4></a> The wilderness journey required more spiritual power, for the strain was greater, and so the priesthood, in the books that have reference to the wilderness, is generally confined to Aaron and his sons, whereas in Deuteronomy and Joshua the thought is generally extended, although not always, to the whole tribe of Levi.<a name=82:5></a> We can understand that special occasions and circumstances require the priestly element as expressive of what is wholly spiritual, as it is said, "Ye which are spiritual, restore such an one" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:1">Galatians  6:1</a>), but it was an entire mistake to restrict priesthood to those only who are spiritual.<a name=82:6></a> It has to be extended to all who have the Spirit, and therefore it includes every true Christian, a true Christian being one who has the Spirit.<a name=82:7></a>

		It is to be noted how even the epistle to the Romans, which is the most elementary and fundamental of all the epistles, lays down the basis for priesthood, so that the youngest believer may apprehend how he has part in it.<a name=82:8></a> In that connection, it is necessary to call attention to the manner in which the Son of God is presented in the epistle, for the idea of priesthood necessarily hangs on sonship.<a name=82:9></a>

		The epistle to the Hebrews shows us that priesthood now is in the Son, as it is said, "A Son perfected for ever" (chapter 7: 28); and so in the beginning of Romans the apostle refers to the theme of his gospel as no less than the Son of God.<a name=83:1></a> As moving out in his service, we find that his first preaching was that Jesus is the Son of God, and he tells us later in explaining his commission that God revealed His Son in him that he might announce Him as glad tidings among the nations; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:16">Galatians  1:16</a>.<a name=83:2></a> He says to the Corinthians in his second epistle, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea".<a name=83:3></a> We are not told in the Acts that he preached the Son of God in Corinth, but he tells us himself that he did so, and not only he, but two others as well who were qualified preachers, and a threefold cord is not easily broken.<a name=83:4></a> There was a threefold testimony in that city to the Son of God, and we learn from the body of this epistle to the Romans that the intent of the preaching was to bring believers in it into correspondence with the Son.<a name=83:5></a>

		So you find in chapter 1 that He is declared to be the Son of God with power, not by the announcement of the Father from heaven, as the evangelists record, but by resurrection of the dead; that is to say, the testimony of the Son of God among the Gentiles was that He was "<i>declared</i>" to be such; not announced simply as such, but He was <i>declared</i> to be the Son of God.<a name=83:6></a> A declaration is something that is undeniable.<a name=83:7></a> He was declared to be the Son of God with power, it says.<a name=83:8></a> We are reminded in that word 'power' as to what marks Christianity; it is a system marked by power.<a name=83:9></a> Paul insists that his preaching was in power, and the declaration of the Son of God was in power.<a name=83:10></a> The announcement from heaven was not that, blessed as it was, but obviously the declaration of the Son of God must be in power, for it was by resurrection of

		the dead.<a name=84:1></a> Most of you will know that here it is not exactly His own resurrection that is in view, although He rose Himself from the dead, but includes that of others; but whether it be others or His own.<a name=84:2></a> He is "declared to be the Son of God with power .<a name=84:3></a>.<a name=84:4></a>.<a name=84:5></a> by the resurrection from [of] the dead".<a name=84:6></a> And then, not only so, but it is "according to the spirit of holiness".<a name=84:7></a> Now I want to say a word about that, because priesthood involves holiness, and so the idea of holiness is embedded in the soul of the believer from the outset, as he believes the gospel -- the <i>idea</i>, I repeat, not yet the <i>thing</i>.<a name=84:8></a> Things are presented to us in testimony that are to become effective in our souls by the Spirit; that is how God works in us.<a name=84:9></a> He presents an idea in the way of light, then He brings the soul to it by the Spirit.<a name=84:10></a> And so the gospel that Paul preached among the nations, polluted as they were, involved holiness.<a name=84:11></a> His preaching was the Son of God declared to be such by resurrection of the dead, and then it was according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=84:12></a> Now, that idea received into the soul (and unless it is received, the <i>gospel is</i> not received) is taken up by the Spirit, and so it is said in chapter 5 that the love of God is shed abroad in the heart by the <i>Holy</i> Spirit.<a name=84:13></a> The Holy Spirit!<a name=84:14></a> In chapter 1 He is the Spirit of holiness; in chapter 5 He is the Holy Spirit who sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts, following on the light of the gospel.<a name=84:15></a> Morally the heart is prepared for such a transaction by the reception of the light of the Son of God.<a name=84:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now to proceed.<a name=84:17></a> I want you to see how the Son of God is introduced in this epistle.<a name=84:18></a> We read in chapter 5: 10 that we have been reconciled to God by the death of His Son.<a name=84:19></a> The element of holiness received is a fundamental thought, and the next thing is the reconciliation; that is, that the very light which has come to me in regard to the Son of God involves that I am to be made as suitable and as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is a matter of light.<a name=85:6></a> And then again (chapter 5: 6) the apostle says, "When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly", and in chapter 8: 3 he says, "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=85:7></a> Now I see that by the Son coming in the likeness of flesh of sin He has dealt with that which would hamper me in the presence of God.<a name=85:8></a> The existence of sin is a most serious matter, and God foreseeing how it would act in the believer against the Spirit, and against the development of priesthood in him, sends His <i>own</i> Son.<a name=85:9></a> I want you to note the expression.<a name=85:10></a> Such was the urgency of what was in hand.<a name=85:11></a> God sent His <i>own</i> Son in the likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, and so He has effectively condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=85:12></a> Need I say it is in the flesh <i>of the believer</i>?<a name=85:13></a> Sin is surely condemned in every sense, but the point here is, that it is condemned in the flesh of the believer, so that it should have no place or voice there whatsoever.<a name=85:14></a> I am as free of it before God as Christ is; God has dealt with it effectively by the sending of His own Son, and why should I not condemn it?<a name=85:15></a> It is simply a matter of light.<a name=85:16></a> I shall come to the power in a moment, but this is a matter of light as to what God has done.<a name=85:17></a> He has reconciled us by the death of His Son, and condemned sin in the flesh by sending His own Son in the likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin.<a name=85:18></a> One would hesitate to use the expression were it not that the Holy Spirit uses it: "in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh", so that I am entirely unhampered now.<a name=85:19></a> It is a matter

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see how God has wrought in His Son to liberate us.<a name=86:3></a> We have the idea of power and of holiness, we have the idea of acceptance in the presence of God in reconciliation, and of the complete condemnation of sin in the flesh, and now parallel with that we have the operations of the Spirit.<a name=86:4></a> The Spirit of holiness in which Christ rose has shed abroad in the heart of the believer the love of God.<a name=86:5></a> What can be a greater conception than that the love of God should be brought into the believer's heart?<a name=86:6></a> The very first service of the Spirit in the believer in this book is to bring in the love of God, to bring into my heart the very greatest thing in the whole universe -- the love of God.<a name=86:7></a> That is His first service.<a name=86:8></a> It is not new birth.<a name=86:9></a> The Spirit does not come into the believer merely to reside because he is a believer; He comes in consequent upon redemption, and consequent upon the believer receiving the gospel.<a name=86:10></a> It says, "After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>), but in coming in, He sheds abroad the love of God in the heart.<a name=86:11></a> Now, see what a vessel God has!<a name=86:12></a> It is not now that I have light simply; I have more than light; I have the love of God placed in my heart by the Holy Spirit, and what follows upon that, in the doctrine in regard to the Spirit, is that my members begin to act in relation to God.<a name=86:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I am saying is within the range of the simplest and youngest believer.<a name=86:14></a> As the love of God touches you, you begin to recognise His rights over every member you possess, and you yield them to God as instruments of righteousness.<a name=86:15></a> I am afraid we mystify that word 'righteousness' sometimes.<a name=86:16></a> It is simply what is right, and it is surely right, as the

		Now in chapter 8, consequent upon the condemnation of sin in the flesh, we have room made for the Spirit to operate, so that all this that I have gathered up in my experience in the most initial way, as I said, enters into the use I make of the Spirit, in speaking to God.<a name=87:14></a> The believer in chapter 8 develops

		Well, that is Romans, where we get, as we have seen, the soul history in faith and by the Spirit which constitutes the basis of priesthood, but now in Deuteronomy we see how the priesthood, thus understood, is to be sustained.<a name=89:8></a> You will have observed that Moses here speaks to "the priests, the Levites"; the whole tribe of Levi is now in view, and so we have food provided that the young particularly should take notice of.<a name=89:9></a> I speak thus because one often hears expressions of dissatisfaction from the young, that they do not understand and they assume that priesthood is beyond them, and that it refers to others.<a name=89:10></a> There is no doubt that in a certain connection it does refer to those who are spiritual, not only those who have the Spirit, but to those who are spiritual.<a name=89:11></a> And priesthood, I believe, under the hand of Aaron and his sons has this largely in view; but in Deuteronomy all saints are in view; it includes the whole tribe of Levi; and so the food involves what is initial.<a name=89:12></a> As Peter says, leading up to the same subject, "Desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation".<a name=89:13></a> He has in view that the system, the constitution, should be built up by the word of God.<a name=89:14></a> That is the

		I think that John would prepare us for enlargement, because as a matter of fact, historically the light of God had been restricted, and up to the present time is restricted, and those who thus have come into advantage through the sovereignty of God are apt to assume that it is their property, their right; whereas the very advantages that they have enjoyed become the occasion of their judgment, especially, as I say, of Tyre, which represents the great commercial system that has been built up, enhanced as it has been by the light of the gospel, for it is a well-known fact that the light of the gospel carried into the dark heathen world was simply followed by the merchant, and God does not overlook that.<a name=95:2></a> Things seemed to prosper and go well, but in pronouncing the judgment on Tyre in Ezekiel the king of Tyre is likened to Satan himself; chapter 28: 14.<a name=95:3></a> It is a very serious reminder of the danger of assuming that what comes to us through the sovereignty of God is a matter of right.<a name=95:4></a> It is not a right; it is God's sovereign way, and what comes to man thus sovereignly becomes in the end the occasion of judgment.<a name=95:5></a> I think that the Lord prepares us for this in bringing in, in connection with one who is an Israelite indeed, and who belonged to the favoured nation, the great truth that heaven would take account, not of the king of Israel, but of the Son of man.<a name=95:6></a> That was what I had in mind.<a name=95:7></a>

		I want to speak a word about the love of God.<a name=123:1></a> The subject is much more difficult to speak of effectively and intelligently than most of us are aware of; for it is indeed the greatest of all subjects, and one understands that the apostle had this in mind when he said that <i>God</i> had made him and others competent ministers of the new covenant.<a name=123:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The love of God has to be known, and one is reminded of the evidence of the knowledge of it in the various writers of Scripture.<a name=123:3></a> I do not suppose God employed any to write, save those who had some knowledge of it; and what you find with the first great Scripture writer, that is, Moses, is that at the end of his ministry, after forty years' experience of the people in the wilderness, when he was nigh one hundred and twenty years old, he says of Jehovah, "Yea, he loved the people".<a name=123:4></a> He had opportunities of witnessing the love of Jehovah for the people, and one of his last testimonies before his death begins with it, "Yea, he loved the people".<a name=123:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He himself in that same section is spoken of as king in Jeshurun.<a name=123:6></a> He had not been wanting in love for the people; and it moves one as one contemplates how he reflected the great Mediator of the new covenant as he came down from mount Sinai with the tables of the law in his hands.<a name=123:7></a> The law was written, not now exactly in his heart, but it was written on the tables, and as he drew near to the camp he is made acquainted with the solemn fact that idolatry had replaced Jehovah there.<a name=123:8></a> There was no evidence of love for Jehovah in the camp.<a name=123:9></a> He had been replaced by the work of their own hands in the golden calf; so He says to Moses, "Let me

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So he was king in Jeshurun, and had acquired that place.<a name=124:5></a> No one acquires a place in the affections of the saints save he who loves the saints.<a name=124:6></a> He was king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together, when they were all there in their responsibility and order.<a name=124:7></a> They were there, and Moses was king amongst them.<a name=124:8></a> He was king in Jeshurun, that is, amongst an upright people, as the word 'Jeshurun' signifies.<a name=124:9></a> Every upright person in Israel would recognise the moral worth of Moses; he had proved himself a king against whom there was no rising up, and they came to value him, so that he was king in Jeshurun.<a name=124:10></a> And Moses, as such, is not occupied with <i>his</i> love for the people, but with <i>God's</i> love for the people, and so he says, "Yea, <i>he</i> loved the people".<a name=124:11></a> So, throughout Scripture we get testimony to the love of God in all the writers.<a name=124:12></a> Jeremiah testifies to Jehovah's love to Israel, "Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee".<a name=124:13></a> And so, in the last prophet, God says, "Yet I loved Jacob".<a name=124:14></a> The love of God remained; and alongside of that, the commandments of God remained; for as there was a witness to His love in chapter 1, so in the last chapter there is a witness to His rights.<a name=124:15></a> "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel".<a name=124:16></a> These two things go together; they are allied in Scripture.<a name=124:17></a> Where the love of God is known.<a name=124:18></a> His commandments are in evidence.<a name=124:19></a>

		those who wrote; for you find in such a writer as Jude, the use of the word 'beloved'.<a name=125:1></a> What a place the saints had in his heart!<a name=125:2></a> Read down the chapter and note how he addresses them, and what they were to him.<a name=125:3></a> He had been revelling in the full light of the love of Christ; he had sat at the table on that last night when the light of His love shone, and he knew what the saints were to Christ, and so in writing to them he uses these terms of endearment, "But, beloved, remember ye the words"; "But ye, beloved, building up yourselves".<a name=125:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So with the apostle John.<a name=125:5></a> As you run through his epistle you will be impressed with the frequent usage of this same term of endearment.<a name=125:6></a> And so, too, with Paul -- our own beloved apostle -- as we say, one who stands out prominently in this respect; he speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ -- the Son of God -- as having loved him personally.<a name=125:7></a> He says, "Who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=125:8></a> No one speaks thus save Paul.<a name=125:9></a> He had, I apprehend, a greater sense of love than any; for it will be noticed that the scripture does not say of John, "the disciple who loved Jesus", but, "the disciple whom Jesus loved"; because we cannot assume a prominent place with the Lord.<a name=125:10></a> So Paul, as having such a profound sense of that love, is the one who speaks of himself with others as the competent ministers of the new covenant.<a name=125:11></a> How could he be a competent minister of that which brings in the love of God, save as one who knows it?<a name=125:12></a> I doubt whether anything is less known amongst us than love; and I am speaking of myself as well as of others.<a name=125:13></a> "If a man", says Solomon, "would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned".<a name=125:14></a> Such is the estimate of it in the spiritual line.<a name=125:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now I want to dwell on it for a moment as set forth typically in Ezekiel.<a name=125:16></a> Ezekiel stands out in a peculiar way among the prophets.<a name=125:17></a> He was one

		who took his place with the people in captivity; he was among the captives by the river of Chebar.<a name=126:1></a> In other words, his love to the people led him to identify himself with them in their dire extremity, as they were away from their own land -- from Jerusalem and Palestine.<a name=126:2></a> They were away in the land of the Chaldeans.<a name=126:3></a> He says, "I sat where they sat".<a name=126:4></a> Complete identification with the people of God is one great mark of love; you go the whole length with them.<a name=126:5></a> And so in that position the prophet sees visions of God.<a name=126:6></a> The heavens are opened, for heaven deems such an one worthy of notice.<a name=126:7></a> He had a unique place throughout among the prophets, for he is in touch with heaven.<a name=126:8></a> What you find in him is, that he is entirely under the influence of Jehovah; and thus God signified in His servant His thoughts for His people.<a name=126:9></a> One of the greatest evidences of the prophet's entire resignation to the will of God is, that he lies for three hundred and ninety days on his side to bear the iniquity of the house of Israel, in order to witness to the people.<a name=126:10></a> He foreshadows the great Mediator of the new covenant, who lay in death and bore the iniquity of the people so that their sins and their iniquities should be remembered no more.<a name=126:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of lying and being penned down to it, for three hundred and ninety days!<a name=126:12></a> What a witness of devotion to God and to His will!<a name=126:13></a> And then he gets all his beauty removed.<a name=126:14></a> His head is shaven, and his beard; the hair is subjected to the action of fire, and the knife, and the remainder is dispersed to the winds.<a name=126:15></a> He is entirely in the hand of God, so that God might witness to the people livingly in him what was in His mind.<a name=126:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so love would lead us thus into correspondence with Christ.<a name=126:17></a> We see in the great apostle, before he wrote his second epistle to the Corinthians, how he had been brought down to death, insomuch that he despaired even of living!<a name=126:18></a> Was that an accident?<a name=126:19></a>

		No.<a name=127:1></a> It was designed; it was God helping His servant to witness effectively to His love in the death of Christ -- the One who Himself had been down to death, but whom God had raised from the dead.<a name=127:2></a> "But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead; who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver".<a name=127:3></a> Beautiful witness to the way God raised up Christ!<a name=127:4></a> We trust in God who has delivered us from so great a death.<a name=127:5></a> It was a great death, and undoubtedly it yielded great love.<a name=127:6></a> All this helps to affect us, to make us competent to speak of His love; and so the apostle can speak of his own competency.<a name=127:7></a> Of course God had done more than that; for He had caused the light of His glory in the face of Jesus to shine into Paul's heart for its shining forth, but the minister accepts the breaking of the vessel.<a name=127:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, Ezekiel lost all his comeliness.<a name=127:9></a> But then in chapter 8 we read that he is taken up by a lock of his head, by the Spirit, and lifted up between the earth and the heavens.<a name=127:10></a> He is now in the position to witness effectively, not only to the love of God, but to the power of God; for the locks had grown -- the hair had grown.<a name=127:11></a> It is as we accept the cutting off of what marks us naturally that we come into new clothes; that we are made to live in the life of Christ -- the evidence of the power of God.<a name=127:12></a> On the third day He was raised up, and we read, "In the third day he will raise <i>us</i> up, and we shall live in his sight"; so we are made to live before Him by resurrection power.<a name=127:13></a> So that now Ezekiel in figure is in the power of the life of Christ.<a name=127:14></a> He has a lock of hair by which he can be lifted up.<a name=127:15></a> The Lord Jesus, although raised, as we read, by the glory of the Father, yet raised Himself up too.<a name=127:16></a> There was life inherent in Him.<a name=127:17></a>

		competent Ezekiel was to speak of the covenant.<a name=128:1></a> He had gone through, in his experience -- not in the same measure, of course -- what the great Mediator had to go through later.<a name=128:2></a> The fourth chapter points to the death of Christ -- the prophet was to lie on his side for three hundred and ninety days; the eighth chapter indicates the resurrection of Christ -- Ezekiel was lifted up between earth and heaven.<a name=128:3></a> In chapter 20 he comes to the covenant; Jehovah says, "I will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered .<a name=128:4></a>.<a name=128:5></a>.<a name=128:6></a> and I will bring you into the wilderness of the people".<a name=128:7></a> It is in the wilderness that God teaches us His love, and there are times when things have to be removed from us.<a name=128:8></a> Indeed, Ezekiel had himself to experience the most dreadful bereavement; the desire of his eyes was taken away with a stroke, and the most bitter part was, he was forbidden to mourn!<a name=128:9></a> "Yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down".<a name=128:10></a> Think of that!<a name=128:11></a> The light of his eyes -- the object of his affections -- taken away with a stroke!<a name=128:12></a> He says, "So I spake unto the people in the morning, and at even my wife died".<a name=128:13></a> And he did as he had been commanded.<a name=128:14></a> You see what excruciating exercises he was to go through, so that he was competent to speak thus.<a name=128:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So Jehovah says, "I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.<a name=128:16></a> Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you".<a name=128:17></a> Note the words "face to face".<a name=128:18></a> It recalls what John wrote to Gaius: "I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: but I trust I shall shortly see thee and we shall speak face to face".<a name=128:19></a> When you come to love, it is a face to face matter; it is a personal matter; it is a question of having to do with persons.<a name=128:20></a> So even in our baptism, we are baptised to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit -- the three Persons of the Deity

		John, I believe, represents this feature, and brings the Persons to us as none of the other writers do.<a name=129:8></a> It is face to face God would come near to us.<a name=129:9></a> So, I apprehend, the Spirit alluded to in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>has this in view.<a name=129:10></a> You will remember how intimate the transaction was when the Lord breathed into the disciples in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>-- how His very life, His very nature, as you might say -- knowing all that it meant in the way of affection -- was breathed into them.<a name=129:11></a> Thus we see how intimate this matter is.<a name=129:12></a> So in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>the first mention we have of the Spirit is as bringing in the love of God.<a name=129:13></a> It is like the kiss of the prodigal; the father kissed him caressingly, as I understand it is.<a name=129:14></a> So, as we read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>, while Peter was speaking to the Gentiles -- Cornelius and his company -- the Holy Spirit <i>fell</i> upon all those who were hearing the word.<a name=129:15></a> It is not simply a question of falling; the word 'fell' signifies an energetic action of the Spirit.<a name=129:16></a> So the Holy Spirit fell on those who heard the word.<a name=129:17></a> It was an energetic action of the Spirit laying hold of them with affection.<a name=129:18></a> It is the same word as used -- as many know -- of the father and the prodigal.<a name=129:19></a> It means that God is embracing the Gentiles.<a name=129:20></a> It is a personal matter; He did not leave it with Peter to receive the Gentiles; it was not a matter of administration there; it was a question of affection that God would embrace the Gentiles.<a name=129:21></a>

		It is a wonderful thing, really, to know the love of God in that way.<a name=130:1></a> Paul in Romans refers to the Spirit as bringing in the love of God; and, mark you, it is no less than the Holy Spirit who brings the love of God into our hearts and sheds it abroad there.<a name=130:2></a> He brings it in personally.<a name=130:3></a> And He would not leave a crevice in our hearts unfilled by the love of God.<a name=130:4></a> We may have reserved chambers, but the Holy Spirit, coming into the heart, claims it.<a name=130:5></a> "My son, give me thine heart".<a name=130:6></a> He claims it, and fills it with the love of God.<a name=130:7></a> Think of that!<a name=130:8></a> His function is to fill the heart of the believer with the love of God.<a name=130:9></a>

		Referring again to Ezekiel's prophecy, God says, "There will I plead with you face to face".<a name=130:10></a> Then it goes on to say, "I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant".<a name=130:11></a> Love is what God Himself is, beloved, not a mere attribute of His character.<a name=130:12></a> Love is His nature, it is what He is; and He wants us to know it, and so He passes His people under the rod.<a name=130:13></a> Now I believe that rod refers to discipline, involving also that account is taken of us as restored.<a name=130:14></a> Discipline is one of the things designed by God for our blessing.<a name=130:15></a> It is part of His education for us, so He causes us to pass under the rod.<a name=130:16></a> What rod is it?<a name=130:17></a> What can it be but the rod of the covenant?<a name=130:18></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>we read of Moses being charged of God to take his rod in his hand and go.<a name=130:19></a> "Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb, and thou shalt smite the rock".<a name=130:20></a> That is another matter; the smiting of the rock with the rod of Moses has reference to Jesus having died, when all that God was against sin was there.<a name=130:21></a> There was the rod of Moses, but there was too the rod of Aaron.<a name=130:22></a>

		These passages of scripture remind us that God intends us to be in a present known relationship with Him, and that there should be affections in keeping with this relationship.<a name=133:1></a> I refer to these scriptures because there is so much indefiniteness amongst us as the Lord's people; there is so little understanding and realisation of the relationship or relationships into which we are brought.<a name=133:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read from Revelation first before I come to the types, because it bears directly upon us.<a name=133:3></a> It is light for us, especially in these days.<a name=133:4></a> It enlightens us in regard to the history of the assembly, so that we need not go outside of Scripture for that history; and, moreover, it enlightens us in regard to the history of the world in which we are called to move.<a name=133:5></a> We get instruction as to the history of Europe and its outgoings, and incidentally, too, as regards the heathen world, so that the believer understanding Revelation is instructed in everything.<a name=133:6></a> He has understanding of the times and he knows what Israel ought to do.<a name=133:7></a> What Israel ought to do is disclosed in the message to the assembly.<a name=133:8></a> There we have outlined the history of the assembly as it is under the eye of Christ, and we cannot have anything more accurately presented than what is presented thus.<a name=133:9></a> It is presented as under the eye of Christ, not as at a distance in heaven, but as walking "in the midst of the seven golden lamps".<a name=133:10></a> He is not indeed seen in heaven; for John turns round to see the voice, as he says, and he sees the Lord in the midst of the seven golden lamps.<a name=133:11></a>

		The Lord in His seven messages to the assemblies conveys His thought of them.<a name=134:1></a> The Holy Spirit, being the One whose word we are especially called upon to hear, is also here upon earth, and is active, amplifying, and, as I may say, particularising, and applying what the Lord says authoritatively.<a name=134:2></a> So the attentive reader and listener is not at a loss as to the history of the assembly, nor is he at a loss as to the particular period in which his lot is cast.<a name=134:3></a> He knows where to begin his dates; like Ezekiel of old, he dates from the captivity; he humbly accepts the captivity, a solemn fact!<a name=134:4></a> and dates from it.<a name=134:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so when we come to the church in Philadelphia we are able to see that certain assembly affections, as I may call them, have been brought about.<a name=134:6></a> You may say, It does not say that Philadelphia loves Christ, but it does say that Christ loves Philadelphia, and that surely is a greater thing; and although we are not told in so many words that Philadelphia loves Christ, yet it says so in unmistakable facts, and thus He says to her, "and hast kept my word".<a name=134:7></a> It is a stronger way, indeed, to put the fact that she loves Him, because the Lord says, or said to the disciples before He left them, "If any one love me, he will keep my word".<a name=134:8></a> So that the fact is undeniable that she loves Him.<a name=134:9></a> She has come back to a knowledge of known relationship, and to the affections that belong to it.<a name=134:10></a> And so the wife -- another important feature of this book -- "His wife has made herself ready".<a name=134:11></a> Is not that a proof of known relationship?<a name=134:12></a> Thus we see that the book of Revelation takes account of recovery, not only of the light in Romans -- the light of the gospel as in earlier days -- but also of the light of Ephesians.<a name=134:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is that epistle that brings out the known assembly relationship.<a name=134:14></a> Romans lays the basis for it, as it does of everything -- as the apostle says, "That ye should be married to another, even to him who is

		raised from the dead".<a name=135:1></a> And so in Corinthians, the second letter, Paul says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ".<a name=135:2></a> These epistles lay the basis for the relationship, but Ephesians gives it to us in its fulness.<a name=135:3></a> He loved the assembly, we are told there, and gave Himself for it.<a name=135:4></a> He prepares it by "the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing".<a name=135:5></a> That was said to Christians who not only knew the love of Christ, but who loved Christ.<a name=135:6></a> The Lord, referring to that later, says, "Thou hast left <i>thy</i> first love", not <i>My</i> first love.<a name=135:7></a> The most wonderful work of God appeared in that company.<a name=135:8></a> The testimony was presented in such power in their midst that the saints collectively were brought into direct relation to Christ.<a name=135:9></a> They loved Him with first or fresh love.<a name=135:10></a> If you were to ask me for the proof of it, I know of no better evidence than what is recorded in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, for Scripture loves to illustrate.<a name=135:11></a> We have direct statements in Scripture upon which we may hang our faith with certainty, but we also have the most perfect illustrations, and so that chapter in the Acts brings out that the Ephesians loved Paul.<a name=135:12></a> They wept when he left them.<a name=135:13></a> "They all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him".<a name=135:14></a> He was the representative of Christ to them; he had brought the testimony of Christ to them; he was, as I may say, the personal representative of Christ.<a name=135:15></a> He represented Christ personally in regard to the assembly.<a name=135:16></a> He had the greatest possible trust committed to him, and that was the administration of the assembly.<a name=135:17></a> He brought the assembly to Christ by his ministry, and the saints loved him.<a name=135:18></a> The Ephesians loved him.<a name=135:19></a> The chapter abounds with expressions and evidences of love.<a name=135:20></a>

		say, in quality.<a name=136:1></a> I want to show from the types in the prophets how this has come about, for, as I said, the prophets of the Old Testament illustrate things for us; they bring in details that we do not get in the New.<a name=136:2></a> If we read them in the light of the New Testament they amplify the New, and bring them out, but if we approach the New from the Old, we shall subvert the New, and that is what Christendom has done.<a name=136:3></a> If you take up any thought in the Old Testament and carry it through into the New, it will subvert in the New what it typifies.<a name=136:4></a> If you take up the Old Testament in the light of the New Testament, you have details of what is definitely intended for our instruction in righteousness.<a name=136:5></a> So I refer to Ezekiel.<a name=136:6></a> I take him to represent in the Old Testament what corresponds to John in the New.<a name=136:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As I have already said, Ezekiel almost habitually gives dates from the captivity.<a name=136:8></a> He in no wise sought to hide the shame of the captivity; and so it is our wisdom to recognise at every turn the captivity of the assembly, so to speak.<a name=136:9></a> Ezekiel throughout his book, as you may see if you look into it, gives date after date from the captivity.<a name=136:10></a> The last date referred to is the twenty-fifth year of the captivity (see chapter 40: 1), and in that year the prophet is brought by the Spirit in the visions of God into the land of Israel, and set upon a very high mountain.<a name=136:11></a> He is brought into the full light of divine thoughts.<a name=136:12></a> How very fitting that he should connect the captivity with that!<a name=136:13></a> It is as we humbly bow to the discipline of God in His governmental dealings that we are in a position to get light as to the purposes of His love.<a name=136:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer now to chapter 16 of this prophet, and wish to show how he speaks of the beginnings of Jehovah's relations with His people; how that He entered into a definite relation with them, but He did so on His own terms.<a name=136:15></a> "Yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee .<a name=136:16></a>.<a name=136:17></a>.<a name=136:18></a> and thou becamest

		mine".<a name=137:1></a> Let us never forget that He entered into covenant with her.<a name=137:2></a> He made her to live, He beautified and ornamented her, and it was the time of love; like Ephesians, there was affection, as He says in Jeremiah, "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals".<a name=137:3></a> There was love there, and so He took her up and entered into covenant with her and she became His.<a name=137:4></a> How precious is that!<a name=137:5></a> For I need not say that it was written for us, to remind us of what the assembly was to Christ at the beginning; how she was made to live, how she was decked with ornaments and was "exceeding beautiful", so that she was suitable to be united to Him.<a name=137:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to be reminded that the Lord is not satisfied with any appearances that we may put on.<a name=137:7></a> One is humbled at times in contemplating what is presented to Christ.<a name=137:8></a> The Lord's supper is that which is specially designed to lead us to take up these covenant relations.<a name=137:9></a> The Lord is not prepared to be satisfied with anything.<a name=137:10></a> We see in this passage in Ezekiel how particular Jehovah was.<a name=137:11></a> If He entered into a covenant with her, it was as having a beauty which was perfect, through His comeliness which He had put upon her.<a name=137:12></a> The Lord looks for that in us, and so one desires to sit down and partake of the Lord's supper as being of the assembly -- of that which He has made to live, which He has washed, and anointed, and clothed, and decked with every ornament of beauty, so that it is befitting, and moreover that it should be the time of love, for that is what He looks for.<a name=137:13></a> That is what marked the beginning when the Lord appeared to above five hundred brethren at once.<a name=137:14></a> What a moment it was for Him as for them!<a name=137:15></a> They were brethren.<a name=137:16></a> They were brethren in His account.<a name=137:17></a> They were brethren in Paul's account, for it is Paul who tells us of that appearing.<a name=137:18></a> What a moment, I repeat, it was for Him and for them!<a name=137:19></a> May I not say that it is the time of love?<a name=137:20></a>

		Now I want to show you for a moment how recovery is brought about.<a name=138:5></a> Hosea contemplates recovery.<a name=138:6></a> Jehovah says, "Behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart", and Israel shall say, "I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now".<a name=138:7></a> How many of the Lord's dear people on earth at the present time, if they only had the light of the assembly's pristine relation with Christ, would truthfully be able to say this?<a name=138:8></a> One feels for the poverty that marks many of the people of God, and so the ministry of the moment is, I believe, outlined in these verses.<a name=138:9></a> He says, "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness .<a name=138:10></a>.<a name=138:11></a>.<a name=138:12></a> .<a name=138:13></a> And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope".<a name=138:14></a> That is His proposal.<a name=138:15></a> The ministry that is proceeding, dear brethren, is on this line.<a name=138:16></a> God is leading His beloved people into the light of known relationship with Him, and into the light of the assembly in relation to Christ.<a name=138:17></a> That is what the ministry is leading us to, if we have not yet arrived at it.<a name=138:18></a> "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness"; that is to say, we are separated from the world.<a name=138:19></a> It is not geographically so, as of old; it refers to the change in our souls.<a name=138:20></a> The things that interested us in the world interest us no more.<a name=138:21></a> The testimony of Christ has come to us, and the allurement of Christ, and the compelling power of God, would bring us outside the world as to the state of our souls so as to be brought consciously into a known relationship with Christ -- a present, known relationship.<a name=138:22></a> She is united to Him -- union is known as a present reality.<a name=138:23></a> And so He says, "I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth".<a name=138:24></a>

		people referring to God and referring to Christ that might with equal force be used in heathendom; corresponding terms, indeed, are employed in heathendom for their deities.<a name=139:1></a> It is simply that the world has changed its deity, carrying over the same terms without any real understanding or knowledge of God or Christ, and that is truly nauseous to Him.<a name=139:2></a> So He says, I do not want that, I want terms indicating a known relationship.<a name=139:3></a> The Lord looks for that, for expressions disclosing what is in our hearts, not borrowed ones, not terms that can be used in the current legal systems around, but expressions which are from the heart.<a name=139:4></a> Hence He says, "Thou shalt call me Ishi", meaning my husband!<a name=139:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the address to Philadelphia you will note how the overcomer is promised things that belong to Christ.<a name=139:6></a> The terms, "the temple of my God", "the name of my God", "the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God", are all a question of what belongs to Christ, and the Lord looks for expressions that come from the heart that express a known relationship with Him.<a name=139:7></a> Any others are objectionable to Him.<a name=139:8></a> Take an expression like 'The Lord Jesus'; the apostle says, "No man can say that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Spirit".<a name=139:9></a> It is not, of course, that the words may not be employed, but it cannot be said in the sense in which the Lord accepts it, except by the Spirit.<a name=139:10></a> How often do we speak to Him consciously by the Spirit?<a name=139:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what we find in Romans is the action of the Spirit to bring the love of God into the heart.<a name=139:12></a> That is the first great service of the Spirit in Romans, and that is the basis of all further operations.<a name=139:13></a> The love of God is brought into the heart, because God intends to be in known relationship with us on His own terms.<a name=139:14></a> So the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit and in chapter 8 we cry, "Abba, Father",

		by the Spirit.<a name=140:1></a> We thus see that God would have us in conscious relationship to Himself, and that the terms expressing the responsive affections that belong to it are by the Spirit.<a name=140:2></a> How living, therefore, everything is!<a name=140:3></a> Christ's relation to the assembly, and as between the Father and us.<a name=140:4></a> We say "Lord Jesus" by the Spirit, and we say "Abba, Father", by the Spirit.<a name=140:5></a> So He says; I will remove all else, "I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth".<a name=140:6></a> You are to say Ishi, my husband.<a name=140:7></a> Then He says that the relationship is to be fixed, that is, it is to be unassailable.<a name=140:8></a> The passage shows that the relationship is to be unassailable in the sense that a marriage bond is celebrated and no one present is to forbid it.<a name=140:9></a> He says, "I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies", even also in faithfulness; He says, "I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness".<a name=140:10></a> You see how impregnable the position is.<a name=140:11></a> Do we not need to be purified in our souls by these unassailable things?<a name=140:12></a> God Himself has done it.<a name=140:13></a> He has betrothed us to Himself, as He says, in righteousness and in judgment and in loving-kindness and in mercy and in faithfulness.<a name=140:14></a> Can any one forbid it?<a name=140:15></a> No!<a name=140:16></a> Just as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>no one can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, so no one can forbid the holy bonds into which we are brought.<a name=140:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will thus see that what God is aiming at is to give assurance of soul in the relations in which we are set, and that in these relations the Holy Spirit is the power so that there may be response in intelligent expressions, respectful surely, reverent surely, but terms that express affection and loving response to the Father and to the Son.<a name=140:18></a> In order to fortify us still further God makes a covenant for them, as He says, "with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very suitable to turn to the book of Ezekiel at this juncture in the history of God's testimony, because it contemplates pending judgment -- a feature equally true now -- but the judgment is associated with One called throughout Son of man.<a name=143:1></a> As Son of man Christ is on the side of men, so that no judgment will come upon men save what is unavoidable.<a name=143:2></a> The Son of man will do all possible for men, and so God would impress upon us that in resorting to judgment He places it in the hands of One who is on our side.<a name=143:3></a> We can look for the utmost fairness, we are to expect nothing but what is entirely right and just.<a name=143:4></a> We are told that all judgment is committed into the hands of Christ because He is Son of man.<a name=143:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The occasion of judgment is now only too apparent after so many centuries of the most wonderful testimony that has ever been presented to men.<a name=143:6></a> It is suitable that Ezekiel should be allowed to witness to us, as he represents Christ as the Son of man, and at the outset he speaks about the opened heavens, a suggestion that has immense importance, for it is what characterises our dispensation -- the heavens are opened.<a name=143:7></a> He begins with the opened heavens (chapter 1), and he ends with Jehovah-shammah (chapter 48: 35); meaning that the instrumentality employed by the opened heavens, although it may involve the severest judgment, will culminate in a place obtained here for God, for as you know Jehovah-shammah means "the Lord is there".<a name=143:8></a> That is what the service of the gospel has in view, that there should be a place for God in the hearts of men, and this book shows that God has the means by Him of effecting this; and so the object of the present testimony of the gospel is that God
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=144>[Page 144]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		through that testimony should find a place in the hearts of men.<a name=144:1></a> He is not content with anything less, and so whilst this book abounds with judgment and references to judgment, the great end is reached -- that God dwells here.<a name=144:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will understand what I wish to speak on; it is a word in relation to the Son of man.<a name=144:3></a> I would, as it were, stand before you like Simeon.<a name=144:4></a> I love to think of Simeon as coming into the temple by the Spirit and taking up the Child in his arms; no one can rightly hold Christ, so to speak, and present Christ, save as by the Spirit.<a name=144:5></a> Simeon took Him in his arms, and as having Him in his arms, he represents, as I may say, the whole race of man.<a name=144:6></a> Wrapped up in that precious Babe was the mind of God and the grace of God for men; and wrapped up in that precious Babe in the arms of Simeon, was the love of God for men; and He was the One who was about to become the Mediator of God and men, giving Himself a ransom for all.<a name=144:7></a> And thus you see that the preacher is entitled to hold, as it were, before men, Him in whom everything is for the blessing of men.<a name=144:8></a> So there is remarkable correspondence between, not only John, but Luke and this prophet.<a name=144:9></a>

		Whilst John, in the opening chapter of his gospel, enlarges on the Person -- He it is indeed that is to be preached, the Son of God -- yet at the end of that chapter we find the Lord saying to Nathanael, "Thou shalt see greater things than these" -- greater things!<a name=144:10></a> Nathanael had been sitting under his fig tree, quite indisposed to believe the testimony that was then available.<a name=144:11></a> Philip had said to him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph", but Nathanael said, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?<a name=144:12></a>" How his remark reflects our unbelieving hearts!<a name=144:13></a> Philip had spoken about Moses;

		he did not say, 'Can anything good come out of Moses?<a name=145:1></a>' Why not?<a name=145:2></a> Why not say that equally with saying, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?<a name=145:3></a>" What did it matter that He was brought up in Nazareth if Moses spoke about Him?<a name=145:4></a> If Moses spoke about Him in the law, and the prophets spoke about Him, He must be worthy of attention, and yet Nathanael says, ignoring all that Moses and the prophets had written, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?<a name=145:5></a>" How our unbelieving hearts may pick out what is despicable, and fix everything there.<a name=145:6></a> But God is not going to alter His way for your unbelieving heart or mine; it pleased Him that His Son should be called a Nazarene, and why should your unbelieving heart rest in what you regard as despicable?<a name=145:7></a> God does not.<a name=145:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Philip says to Nathanael, "<i>Come and see</i>"; and that is the principle today.<a name=145:9></a> The one who comes and sees indicates that God is working with him.<a name=145:10></a> If you do not come and see, and if there is no disposition to come and see, then I am very doubtful about your Christianity.<a name=145:11></a> That is the principle with John, and so later the Samaritans came and saw.<a name=145:12></a> Nathanael came, and when the Lord saw him coming, He said of him, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<a name=145:13></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be as I am speaking to you, the Lord, looking into your heart, sees a movement (one great feature of the preaching is to make Christ attractive); it may be He sees you moving a little bit towards Christ.<a name=145:14></a> He sees the movement, I do not; for God alone reads the hearts, but one always reckons on the reading of the hearts as the word is preached.<a name=145:15></a> I may think I see something in the countenance, but, as I said, God only knows the thoughts; He goes below the countenance and He reads the heart.<a name=145:16></a> So when the Lord saw Nathanael coming to Him.<a name=145:17></a> He said, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<a name=145:18></a>"

		He said nothing about his unbelief, nothing about that reference to Nazareth; the Lord passes over all that.<a name=146:1></a> He is occupied with the evidence of the work of God in him -- that is the thing.<a name=146:2></a> He can afford to disregard all disparagements from our unbelieving hearts as He sees the work of God -- He rests in that.<a name=146:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So He says, "An Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<a name=146:4></a>" Nathanael replied, "Whence knowest thou me?<a name=146:5></a>" Ah, the Lord knows every one; He has been watching you from the very beginning; and He says to Nathanael, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee".<a name=146:6></a> He saw you before you began to move.<a name=146:7></a> He takes account of your need from the beginning; He saw Nathanael before Philip spoke to him, and Nathanael answered, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God".<a name=146:8></a> Have you ever made a confession?<a name=146:9></a> The secret of much misery in souls is in not having made a confession.<a name=146:10></a> Now have you ever made a confession of Christ?<a name=146:11></a> I urge that you do.<a name=146:12></a> I press the great importance of confessing.<a name=146:13></a> He says, "Thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".<a name=146:14></a> What a wonderful confession at the first meeting with Christ!<a name=146:15></a> What light there was for that "Israelite indeed" as he came into contact with the Son of God!<a name=146:16></a> He could never have made that confession under the fig tree.<a name=146:17></a> It is as you come into contact with the Lord in your soul that everything becomes clear -- that you apprehend Him.<a name=146:18></a> "Thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".<a name=146:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these".<a name=146:20></a> You say, Can there be greater things?<a name=146:21></a> A principle with John is that greater things are always ahead.<a name=146:22></a> There is no possibility of any finite person compassing what is of God, it is infinite, and so the Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these .<a name=146:23></a>.<a name=146:24></a>.<a name=146:25></a> .<a name=146:26></a> Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon

		the Son of man".<a name=147:1></a> It was as if the Lord said, Nathanael, you have got to widen the vision of your horizon; and so it is, as you come into contact with Christ, light fills your soul, and you make a confession.<a name=147:2></a> I would urge again, especially upon the young, that you confess Christ.<a name=147:3></a> And then you will get more light, greater things, and the greater things are connected, remarkable to say, with the Son of man.<a name=147:4></a> The Son of man embraces the whole of humanity; He stands in relation to every man and woman and child in the whole universe -- He knows every one.<a name=147:5></a> He has undertaken to remove what lay upon us.<a name=147:6></a> How wonderful that as a Man He is on our side; and God would impress us with His interest in Him in that His angels -- the angels of God -- ascend and descend upon Him.<a name=147:7></a> Are <i>you</i> interested in Him?<a name=147:8></a> He is interested in you.<a name=147:9></a>

		And so I read in chapter 4, because I think it is the foundation of the book, for if the Son of man is to relieve us, remove our guilt and give us the Spirit, He must undergo the judgment; there is no escape.<a name=147:10></a> Simeon said of Him, "A light for revelation of the Gentiles"; He was to bring the Gentiles in under God's eye so that God should be favourable -- a wonderful thought!<a name=147:11></a> As Simeon had Him in his arms He represented the whole race of man, but how could He bring up men and present them to God unless He removed what lay on them -- death and judgment?<a name=147:12></a> So we have Him here portrayed in Ezekiel lying three hundred and ninety days on one side.<a name=147:13></a> Now picture that from a physical point of view!<a name=147:14></a> It speaks of the Lord Jesus held in death, for He only could bear the iniquity.<a name=147:15></a> Ezekiel was bound down with bands so that he could not move from one side to the other.<a name=147:16></a>

		Now I wish to enlarge on this, and in proceeding I would remark on the difference between the house as it is suggested to us in John, and as it is formally presented in Luke; we have to apprehend both evangelists in this respect, but we arrive at Luke through John.<a name=166:12></a>

		But John contemplates what is wholly spiritual.<a name=167:8></a> With Luke, the elder brother of the prodigal hears what is going on inside; but not so with John.<a name=167:9></a> He contemplates the house as the sphere of the family, as that in which the family of God is found, not in the way of protection, but where the Father's affections are known, and the Son's affection, and the Son abiding in it for ever.<a name=167:10></a> There, where we know our immediate relation with the Father as the brethren of Christ, we can readily understand how that instead of seven steps, we have eight.<a name=167:11></a> I have no doubt that the scene in Bethany is a picture of millennial blessing, but when we come to chapter 20 we have something beyond, and it is possible that many of us never take the eighth step.<a name=167:12></a> The idea of the eighth step is that we begin anew, without limitations.<a name=167:13></a> Think of a beginning to which there are no limitations We think of Him who is said to be "the hind of the morning", and we cannot impose limits on Christ as risen and exalted into heaven.<a name=167:14></a> Who can indicate to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is remarkable correspondence between Ezekiel and John.<a name=168:7></a> Ezekiel, as you will observe, dates this occurrence of being shown the house in the visions of God from the captivity, and it is John who gives us an account of our captivity -- the captivity of the assembly.<a name=168:8></a> One need not go outside the writings of John for assembly history.<a name=168:9></a> If we understand his Apocalypse aright, we have opened up to us all assembly history; and not only assembly history, but also the history of Western Europe.<a name=168:10></a> We have first of all given to us in that remarkable unveiling, the history of the assembly from its decline and fall to its end on this earth.<a name=168:11></a>

		contrast were the conditions in Jerusalem in his day to the heavens opened and visions of God!<a name=169:1></a> John not only had the heavens opened to him, but he was invited to come up into them.<a name=169:2></a> Nevertheless, there is a remarkable correspondence between the prophet Ezekiel and the prophet John.<a name=169:3></a> They both had to do with the captivity, and if we understand our prophet (that is, John), and we understand the history of the assembly, we begin to make our dates accordingly.<a name=169:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most humiliating to have to learn spiritually how to date our years from the captivity; not from the year of our Lord from this point of view, but from the given year of our captivity.<a name=169:5></a> In order to arrive at the dates spiritually, we have to analyse carefully chapters 2 and 3 of the book of Revelation, and as we do so, we definitely arrive at the year.<a name=169:6></a> We shall then know the light that governs the position.<a name=169:7></a> There is a certain light governing every period of the history, and that light is conveyed in what the Lord Jesus Himself says to every assembly.<a name=169:8></a> Notwithstanding the captivity, He graciously speaks a word to every assembly, and the word to any given assembly is the light for the moment.<a name=169:9></a> If we are to enter into the understanding of the house, we must know the year, and then return in the light that governs that year.<a name=169:10></a> As we understand the light, then we see a way out.<a name=169:11></a> There is a way out.<a name=169:12></a> The Lord's word to every assembly is virtually, "This is the way, walk ye in it", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#30:21">Isaiah  30:21</a>.<a name=169:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Spirit takes that up and enlarges it, and applies it so that it becomes intelligible, not only to those walking in the light of the assembly, but to every Christian; it is, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=169:14></a> So that I get all the good, you may say, of what the Spirit says, and it is by the Spirit I am led out; and being led out of the captivity is to be led into the house

		Now in conclusion I want to say a word about the north gate.<a name=175:8></a> If I know that God is in His house, then I am to be concerned as to how I am to go in.<a name=175:9></a> I see that in the east gate He requires unity.<a name=175:10></a> The people could come in by the north gate or by the south gate; chapter 46: 9.<a name=175:11></a> In its application to ourselves, we must go in by both.<a name=175:12></a> The south gate represents the favour of God and the north gate represents the discipline of God, and we can never be in the house without these two features.<a name=175:13></a> I enter into the house in the shining of God; all that God is is favourable to me.<a name=175:14></a> How that quickens the pace, so to speak, as I enter the south gate.<a name=175:15></a> I have no fear, "Perfect love casts out fear".<a name=175:16></a> But then as I think of the flesh in me, as I think of what I am capable of, I know the necessity for the north gate.<a name=175:17></a> The north gate represents the discipline of God.<a name=175:18></a> The discipline of God is all for my good and I cannot be in the house unless I understand the hand of God in discipline in view of promoting holiness.<a name=175:19></a> I can come in by the north and go out by the south, or I can come in by the south, and go out by the north.<a name=175:20></a> The going in means that I have had an experience of the presence of the glory, and of the speaking.<a name=175:21></a> These two features have wrought in my soul and I go out not as I came in, for in the house one's exercises are confirmed.<a name=175:22></a> What I have taken in of the light of God in the face of Jesus Christ, and what I have taken in through His discipline, all are confirmed there, and thus I have gained, and I go out different from what I went in.<a name=175:23></a>

		It is on my mind to call attention to the need of activity in service and testimony for Christ.<a name=177:1></a> No one has more moral title to address us in this respect than the apostle Paul.<a name=177:2></a> His service for Christ was unremitting; he says that he "laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me"; and as having finished his course he addresses Timothy, whom we may regard as a representative servant now, and he charges him before God and before the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge the quick and the dead, to preach the word, to be instant in season and out of season, and furthermore to watch in all things to do the work of an evangelist, and to make full proof of his ministry.<a name=177:3></a> It will be readily seen, therefore, that there was not to be much holiday-time for this servant.<a name=177:4></a> The need of service was urgent, and it is urgent, and as the word came to Timothy so it comes to us.<a name=177:5></a> The Lord would lay it upon us, dear brethren, that the need is great, and I want to show from the Scriptures, in the Acts, just what it is that is to be preached.<a name=177:6></a> If we see that the preaching is to go on, it is obvious that we should understand what the preaching is.<a name=177:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of preaching is not peculiar to our time, to our dispensation; indeed, we may say that the preacher is Christ, and whatever preaching according to God there may be, it is really His.<a name=177:8></a> And so His service in this respect has a backward bearing as well as a forward bearing, and in the backward bearing we have three outstanding preachers employed.<a name=177:9></a> Peter says, referring to this, "He [Christ] went and preached unto the spirits in prison; which sometime

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Noah was a preacher of righteousness, and he was personally in accord with his preaching.<a name=178:8></a> He was a man approved of God, he found favour with God.<a name=178:9></a> He was not the seventh from Adam, like Enoch.<a name=178:10></a> Enoch is the end of an exercise -- the seventh.<a name=178:11></a> He represents the development of life beginning with Adam as restored.<a name=178:12></a> The restoration of Adam was the outcome really of the light that Seth had, for he called his son Enos, meaning that he was weak, mortal.<a name=178:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Through Seth and Enoch we have a development not of death, but of life, for Seth anticipated the longevity of the race as outlined in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5">Genesis  5</a>, but he knew that however long a man lived, he died, and so anticipating that he called his son's name Enos.<a name=178:14></a> Light had broken in, for the divine sentence was accepted, and men began to "call upon the name of the Lord", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:25">Genesis  4:25</a>, 26.<a name=178:15></a> Thus we have Adam set up afresh in Seth, and Enoch is the seventh from him through Seth.<a name=178:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in the acceptance of death that life is realised, and so Enoch before his translation had the testimony that he pleased God.<a name=178:17></a> He was at the end of a dispensation, he was the seventh from Adam.<a name=178:18></a> He had the precious sense in his soul, conveyed to him by God, that he pleased Him: "And he was not; for God took him", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:24">Genesis  5:24</a>.<a name=178:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next great preacher is Solomon.<a name=179:7></a> I do not say there were not others, for there were; but these stand out prominently.<a name=179:8></a> What we find in Solomon is that he is a son.<a name=179:9></a> No one can rightly present Christ except as a son.<a name=179:10></a> Solomon was a preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.<a name=179:11></a> There was with him conscious relationship and conscious affection, for he was the son of his father, and tender and only beloved in the sight of his mother, and there was withal moral power in his preaching, for he was a king.<a name=179:12></a> We may be assured that if we preach in the consciousness of sonship, there will be moral power, and that is what is needed.<a name=179:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to Jonah we have a man that has gone through death.<a name=179:14></a> Let no one undertake to preach otherwise.<a name=179:15></a> These three men set out indeed the features of a preacher.<a name=179:16></a> There must be practical righteousness, a walk with God; there must be consciousness of sonship and moral power; and there must be the <i>experience</i> of death and resurrection; not the doctrine -- the doctrine surely -- but the <i>experience</i> of the doctrine.<a name=179:17></a> Hence you believe as having gone through things; as the great preacher of the New

		With Jonah we have a vow, but, like many of us, he was not true to it, for he fled to Tarshish when he should have gone to Nineveh.<a name=180:2></a> But he is brought to it and that brings in another consideration, that if you take up an attitude of soul before God -- and it is right to do so, for I doubt if anyone is effective in service who has not a secret understanding with the Lord -- the Lord gives you to understand what you are efficient in, what you are qualified for, and in the understanding of that you take up your work.<a name=180:3></a> There is often with us great indefiniteness.<a name=180:4></a> Many of us go about the work of the Lord in a most casual manner, far different from our ordinary employment; but the idea of a vow is that I have got a definite obligation resting on me.<a name=180:5></a> "For necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!<a name=180:6></a>" Paul said, Does the Lord regard lightly any obligation that He gives to you?<a name=180:7></a> No; He holds you to it.<a name=180:8></a> If you think lightly of the obligation and the great privilege of ministry, <i>He</i> does not; it has cost Him much.<a name=180:9></a> And so the apostle says again, "We have <i>this</i> treasure in earthen vessels".<a name=180:10></a> It was a treasure that he had in his soul, and he valued it.<a name=180:11></a> So, having received <i>this</i> ministry -- what ministry?<a name=180:12></a> The one <i>he</i> had, not the one Peter had.<a name=180:13></a> It was the ministry indeed of the love of God in Christ, the new covenant, but to him it was "<i>this</i> ministry", and he adds, "We preach not ourselves"; he was not giving out, like Simon Magus, that he was some great one, he was giving out that Christ was a great One, and so he says, "We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake".<a name=180:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to speak about what is preached, and first of all from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, to show that the preaching is light as to the wealth of heaven.<a name=181:3></a> The chapter sets before us what I may call administrative preaching.<a name=181:4></a> It is said that Peter stood up with the eleven, meaning that there were twelve -- one was about to speak, and the others were standing by.<a name=181:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want for a moment to enlarge upon this feature of the preaching, because one is conscious in oneself, and in what one sees, that in the preaching there is often a great sense of poverty; whereas the twelve represented an administration of infinite wealth.<a name=181:6></a> It was not a mere sermon of doctrine that Peter preached.<a name=181:7></a> He stood up with the eleven; you will observe that it does not say with the eleven apostles.<a name=181:8></a> Lower down in the chapter we have the apostles' doctrine, not the doctrine of the twelve.<a name=181:9></a> When you have the term 'apostles', the idea of authority and rule is emphasised.<a name=181:10></a> Paul tells us that after the Lord appeared to Cephas, and to the twelve, that He appeared to all the apostles, a seeming repetition, but in no sense such.<a name=181:11></a> The first has reference to administration, the second has reference to authority, to rule.<a name=181:12></a> When I speak of administration it is not simply the administering of laws; what is referred to is the wealth of heaven.<a name=181:13></a> Think of that, dear brethren!<a name=181:14></a> Peter is dealing in his address with what was present and obvious to every one there; the Holy Spirit had come down, and He had come upon the disciples and had filled them.<a name=181:15></a> He came in as the sound of a rushing mighty wind, and that sound filled the house, and so we read those in Jerusalem said, "We hear them speaking .<a name=181:16></a>.<a name=181:17></a>.<a name=181:18></a> the great things of God".<a name=181:19></a>

		not exactly speaking, as every one can speak -- sisters can do that -- but every one cannot preach.<a name=182:1></a> It does not require gift to speak; but it requires gift to preach, and gift is available.<a name=182:2></a> If God has been pleased, beloved brethren, to give us the Holy Spirit -- the greatest possible gift -- do you not think He would give us sufficient gift or ability to speak of Him, and to speak of Christ rightly?<a name=182:3></a> The speaking by the disciples generally does not bring about conviction, but the preaching of Peter did.<a name=182:4></a> "The people said, Men and brethren, what shall we do?<a name=182:5></a>" There is that power given of God by which the truth is enforced so as to carry conviction.<a name=182:6></a> It is wonderful that gift is available; as it is said, "Covet earnestly the best gifts".<a name=182:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Peter stood up with the eleven, what you find in the administrative preaching is that the Scriptures are opened up with spiritual intelligence, so as to enforce what is immediately on hand.<a name=182:8></a> The Holy Spirit was present, poured out from heaven, representing the wealth of heaven; but in order to bring out the truth relative to the Spirit Peter cites Joel, and to establish the truth of the resurrection and ascension of Christ he cites David.<a name=182:9></a> We have, therefore, the prophets and the psalms linked together with spiritual intelligence so as to establish on the one hand that God would pour out the Spirit, and on the other that Christ should rise from the dead and sit at God's right hand in heaven.<a name=182:10></a> So we see how Peter -- the first preacher in our dispensation -- by the Spirit links up Scripture and sets out in the clearest possible manner Christ risen and exalted and the Holy Spirit on the earth.<a name=182:11></a> "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear .<a name=182:12></a>.<a name=182:13></a>.<a name=182:14></a> therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to go on to Philip for a moment.<a name=183:3></a> He is the second preacher, and what we observe is that he is not primarily commissioned, and yet he preached in the most effective way, being one of those who were scattered, and what I may remark is that the Spirit of God always acts in accord with the governmental dealings of God.<a name=183:4></a> We are labouring at a great disadvantage unless we take into account that the government of God is favourable to the testimony, so that the very scattering here furthered the spread of the gospel.<a name=183:5></a> It is not now to set out the position, not to call attention to the Spirit exactly; it is to show that God has a Man who can do everything.<a name=183:6></a> What an immense thing it is to stand up with the knowledge of Christ in my soul and know that I am presenting a Man who can do everything.<a name=183:7></a> That is the idea of a commissioned preacher, for although nothing is said of this in his case, Philip was undoubtedly serving under the Lord's direction; later he was sent by the Spirit to the eunuch.<a name=183:8></a> Every naval and military man knows what a commission is.<a name=183:9></a> A commission represents authority.<a name=183:10></a> The preacher stands up as commissioned; he is consciously representative of Christ, and he knows that he is presenting One who can do everything.<a name=183:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>there are no miracles recorded; Peter makes no reference to them, nor does he perform any in that chapter; the point was to call attention to the greatness of the position.<a name=183:12></a> When we come to the preaching of Christ we have miracles wrought, and so as Philip preaches, he performs works of power.<a name=183:13></a> There was the evidence there of the Christ -- the Christ risen from the dead; He can cast out demons, He can relieve souls, He can meet any

		In the next evangelical work of Philip we have not the preaching of the Christ, but the preaching of Jesus -- a preaching that must touch every heart.<a name=184:6></a> You will observe I am going over the great features of the subject -- matter of the preaching and incidentally calling attention to the importance of being in accord with these features if we are to be preachers.<a name=184:7></a> And so he preached Jesus.<a name=184:8></a> If I preach Jesus, I preach a Man who has won my heart.<a name=184:9></a> "When we shall see him", unbelief says, "there is no beauty that we should desire him".<a name=184:10></a> Not so with Stephen; not so with Philip.<a name=184:11></a> How important it is that Jesus should be known personally, and a knowledge of Him in this light means that I am no respecter of persons; I recognise that He is Head of every man and I appropriate Him in relation to every man: "A light", said Simeon, "to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel".<a name=184:12></a> What a position; to stand up with Jesus, as it were, appropriated in my soul in relation to the whole race of men, for that is what the preaching of Philip involved.<a name=184:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=187:5></a> Well, there are many thoughts which, I hope, by the Lord's help, may come before us.<a name=187:6></a> One is that the writer is identified with the people of God in their different circumstances.<a name=187:7></a> He says, "I was among the captives", and in the body of the book he dates from the captivity (see chapter 40).<a name=187:8></a> In that way, he accepts the governmental dealings of God.<a name=187:9></a> Another thought is that "the heavens were opened", and another, that he is addressed as "son of man", the term, indeed, appearing more frequently in the book of Ezekiel than in all the rest of Scripture: reminding us that the race of man is in view, rather than a favoured part of it.<a name=187:10></a> A further thought is, that it is based on signs, most of which appear in the prophet himself, and, generally speaking, involving much suffering.<a name=187:11></a> Another thought is, that in chapter 1 we have for the support of all these things, an array of power here, having a universal bearing, the number four governing it, and all under, or subservient to "a man above upon it", i.<a name=187:12></a>e.<a name=187:13></a>, the throne.<a name=187:14></a> These thoughts, I believe, are seen running through the book, and they culminate in the whole house of Israel being seen in life, and the house of God set up in relation to God's own purpose, as it says, in "the land of Israel" (chapter 40: 2); and then blessing flowing out from the house, in the river; the river flowing out from under the threshold and south of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=188:5></a> Would you say that Ezekiel, in that way, is suggestive of John?<a name=188:6></a> "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>.<a name=188:7></a> Does the presentation of John correspond with Ezekiel?<a name=188:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=188:9></a> I thought so.<a name=188:10></a> It gives the geographical position of the captivity as by the river Chebar, far away from the earlier centre, as John gives the island of Patmos.<a name=188:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=188:12></a> From what you have been saying, there is a considerable analogy between Ezekiel and the book of Revelation.<a name=188:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=188:14></a> There is.<a name=188:15></a> John's ministry is based on signs, excepting the epistles; his gospel and the Revelation certainly are based on signs.<a name=188:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a> we read, "He <i>signified</i> it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John", meaning that it was by signs, and Ezekiel is the same in character.<a name=188:17></a>

		W.M.<a name=188:18></a> It is remarkable that both of these books begin with the servant in captivity, and end with living water.<a name=188:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=188:20></a> That is very suggestive.<a name=188:21></a> In Ezekiel, a river issued out of the <i>house</i>, and came down south of the altar; in Revelation, it is out of the <i>throne</i>.<a name=188:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=189:2></a> I have no doubt that is right.<a name=189:3></a> Ezekiel touches John in a most remarkable way, as illustrated by the number of steps in the approach to the house.<a name=189:4></a> First, there is a series of seven steps, and then a series of eight steps; as if Ezekiel wants to set up the earthly system according to complete exercise, seven being the number that denotes such exercise, according to the light governing the position.<a name=189:5></a> Eight, I think, goes beyond, leading as it says, "into the inner court", which would mean immediate proximity to the house, where God Himself dwells; chapter 40: 20, 22, 28, 31.<a name=189:6></a> Now John, I think, in the Revelation, has the same thought, viz.<a name=189:7></a>, the eternal state of things, which corresponds with the eight steps.<a name=189:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=189:9></a> So that Ezekiel indicates there is another step, in the second series, without unfolding the nature of it, whilst in the Revelation we get light as to what that eighth step is.<a name=189:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=189:11></a> Yes, it is beyond the millennial blessing.<a name=189:12></a> The tabernacle of God with men, is certainly beyond the millennial day.<a name=189:13></a> John saw a new heaven and a new earth; <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:1">Revelation  21:1</a>.<a name=189:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=189:18></a> It is the point that is made.<a name=189:19></a> Israel had forfeited their privilege; not only was the throne lost but the Shekinah, or divine presence, was about to be lost.<a name=189:20></a> Although with the greatest reluctance, yet the glory eventually departed.<a name=189:21></a>

		D.M.<a name=190:13></a>R.<a name=190:14></a> Do you think that we get a suggestion of the glory departing in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>?<a name=190:15></a> Stephen "saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God" (verse 55).<a name=190:16></a> The Jews filled up the measure of their sin, in stoning Stephen which gave the Lord a free hand to select another vessel.<a name=190:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=190:18></a> Stephen saw the glory of God.<a name=190:19></a> That is contemplated in Ezekiel: it departed first from over the threshold of the house, and then it stood upon a mountain beyond Jerusalem, so that it finally left, and Stephen sees it in heaven.<a name=190:20></a> He sees the Son of man and the glory; and then after that, you have worked out the thought seen here, that all the power of God on earth was subservient to a Man in heaven; so that He speaks in power out of heaven to Saul, as Jesus.<a name=190:21></a> Then the term 'Lord' is emphasised in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>, to remind us that He has authority to repress and restrain all that would lift up its head against the testimony of God.<a name=190:22></a> These elements ought to have been in Jerusalem; they were no longer there, but in heaven, in His hands, so that the opposing elements

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=191:3></a> Do you think the Lord before the high priest would have a reference to this in Ezekiel?<a name=191:4></a> They say, "Tell us if <i>thou</i> art the Christ the Son of God".<a name=191:5></a> He says, "Thou hast said.<a name=191:6></a> Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:63">Matthew  26:63</a>, 64.<a name=191:7></a> It was this largely that produced the accusation of blasphemy, when the Lord turns the question from "Son of God" to "Son of man".<a name=191:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=191:9></a> And so in answer to Nathaniel, the Lord says to him, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee"; and Nathaniel answers, "Rabbi, <i>thou</i> art the Son of God, <i>thou</i> art the king of Israel", which was quite in keeping with an Israelite's expectation, that is, any pious Israelite would, as reading the Psalms, know that the Son of God was the King of Israel; but the Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these .<a name=191:10></a>.<a name=191:11></a>.<a name=191:12></a> .<a name=191:13></a> Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:48">John  1:48</a> - 51.<a name=191:14></a> That was for "one truly an Israelite"; an instruction to him that there were greater things to come, in relation to the Son of man, that is, the whole race of man is to be brought into view.<a name=191:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=232:1></a> These chapters, I thought, call attention to the covenant.<a name=232:2></a> I think that the Lord will help us in seeing the applicability of this prophecy to our own times, both in regard to its scathing denunciations of what marks the apostasy around us, and then its appeal to the remnant, especially in regard to what belongs to the whole assembly, for chapter 16 goes back to the beginning of Jerusalem's history.<a name=232:3></a> In verse 6 it says, "And I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said unto thee, in thy blood, Live!<a name=232:4></a> yea, I said unto thee in thy blood, Live!<a name=232:5></a> I caused thee to multiply, as the bud of the field; and thou didst increase and grow great".<a name=232:6></a> Then verse 60 reverts to the covenant made; so that it would apply to our own times.<a name=232:7></a> We have come into what the early saints had, that is, we have come into the good of the covenant.<a name=232:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=232:9></a> We were saying the last time that the introduction of the remnant helps greatly all through, and what is before us here.<a name=232:10></a> A remnant is not the fag-end of something, but in the divine ways, it is the depositary of the original, as in the mind of God, it cherishes, secures and preserves that which is precious to God, and carries it through.<a name=232:11></a> In regard to what you are saying now, it helps, do you not think, to see the introduction of the remnant in that way?<a name=232:12></a> The thought of the new covenant is taken up and made good at the end; although it had disappeared for the greater part of the period of the assembly's history.<a name=232:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=233:14></a> The Lord's supper reminds us of it.<a name=233:15></a> In chapter 16: 8 it says, "And I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, and behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness; and I swore unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mine".<a name=233:16></a> There you see the thing -- how God entered into covenant relationship with His people at the outset.<a name=233:17></a> It was the time of love.<a name=233:18></a> It was when love existed and operated that the covenant was made.<a name=233:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=233:20></a> The Lord never forgot that period to which He refers in these verses; there doubtless had been a response; so He says, "I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth".<a name=233:21></a> The interval had been full of corruption, rebellion, and repudiation of all the infinite grace of God, but He comes back to it, "I will remember my covenant".<a name=233:22></a> They had proved false, but God remains true.<a name=233:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=234:4></a> That, I think, is what has come about.<a name=234:5></a> In reading a scripture like this, our concern is to make a present application of it.<a name=234:6></a> The Lord gives us a lead in reading the scripture in the synagogue of Nazareth.<a name=234:7></a> It was not to unfold the prophetic word but to make a present application of it; and so he says, having read it, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:21">Luke  4:21</a>.<a name=234:8></a> It is in that way the value of the Scriptures becomes apparent; a present application of them may be made; the Lord says, "Today".<a name=234:9></a> Therefore, the value of this scripture to us is, that we can make a present application of it.<a name=234:10></a> "No prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:20">2 Peter  1:20</a>); therefore to make an application of this scripture to our own times enables us to see that God has come back to the covenant, that is to say, He has brought the saints to see that He loves them, to the end that they should love Him.<a name=234:11></a> Unless God brings about love for Himself in our hearts He has no dwelling-place; He dwells only in love.<a name=234:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=234:16></a> I think that is right.<a name=234:17></a> Really the city is the subject of this chapter; the address is to Jerusalem, not to Israel.<a name=234:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=234:22></a> Quite.<a name=234:23></a> It has been remarked that the city according to God is the product of the covenant; and that is perfectly obvious in the heavenly city, because in order to have the glory with which she comes down, she must first be invested with it; and

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=246:1></a> In our last reading we dwelt chiefly on chapter 16, and what I think was noted was that that chapter refers to Jerusalem and the system set up in relation to it; for the covenant was made with it; but this chapter 20 treats of the whole nation.<a name=246:2></a> It is said, "It came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of Jehovah, and they sat before me".<a name=246:3></a> Those responsible in relation to the whole nation of Israel came to enquire of Jehovah, and the passage read shows that the covenant is also treated in that relation, so that we have, I think, a suggestion in chapter 16 of a privileged part of the people of God.<a name=246:4></a> Jerusalem stood for a certain privilege as compared with the whole nation; God never loses sight of the whole of His people, although a certain section of them may be privileged.<a name=246:5></a> There are certain sections of Christendom that have been peculiarly privileged, and correspondingly come in for peculiar judgment on account of those privileges, the privileges being disregarded; but then God never gives up the whole.<a name=246:6></a> He has got the whole sphere of Christendom in His mind, the eastern branch as well as the western and its later subdivisions.<a name=246:7></a> I think that this chapter may be taken in connection with the whole responsible sphere, and God calls attention to the fact that although they came to enquire there was no virtue in that.<a name=246:8></a> In verses 3 and 4 He says, "I will not be enquired of by you.<a name=246:9></a> Wilt thou judge them, wilt thou judge, son of man?<a name=246:10></a> Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand unto the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=247:3></a> I suppose the fact of the matter was that the elders in approaching Ezekiel had no moral formation at all.<a name=247:4></a> Do you think that the Spirit of God, in taking up the past history of the fathers, would put upon the elders that they come burdened with all that the fathers had indulged in, the guilt of which they had accepted by a process of self-judgment?<a name=247:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=247:6></a> Yes.<a name=247:7></a> So that you find in the history of the assembly as a responsible body, that the leaders at different times accept a certain responsibility, but there is no judgment of things <i>from the beginning</i>.<a name=247:8></a> The assumption of these leaders, or elders among the saints, and the part acceptance of the obligation that goes with it is not enough.<a name=247:9></a> God said he would not be enquired of by them.<a name=247:10></a> Things had to be gone into more thoroughly.<a name=247:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=247:12></a> I suppose the point of view we get here differs with Christendom in its ideas, since with all the varied leaders there are in it, the remnant itself is not in view here.<a name=247:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=247:14></a> Not until the end.<a name=247:15></a> There are those who accept responsibility, and in a certain way recognise God, especially when heresy lifts up its head, but that will not do.<a name=247:16></a> Things have to be really dealt with.<a name=247:17></a> God will not support any mere surface measures, and so He refuses to be enquired of; but then, what is so beautiful is, He undertakes the matter Himself.<a name=247:18></a> In verse 33, He says, "As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I reign over you".<a name=247:19></a> God asserts His rights; and whilst men disregard the rights of God, there is no use in attempting

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=264:11></a> The articles of commerce are creatures of God, and in themselves are good; as you said, they were available for David, for Hiram always loved David, and the temple was furnished by him.<a name=264:12></a> But when the creatures of God are carried beyond that, and made the occasions of competition, rivalry and amassing of fortunes, there is room only in such commerce for the god of this world.<a name=264:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=276:4></a> Yes, these two ideas of a watchman and a shepherd come under that head.<a name=276:5></a> It says in verse 1 of chapter 33, "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one man from among them all, and set him for their watchman".<a name=276:6></a> That is to fix the responsibility of the watchman first; then in verse 7, it says, "So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel".<a name=276:7></a> The responsibility of Ezekiel follows on that.<a name=276:8></a> Then in chapter 34: 1, it says, "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel".<a name=276:9></a> There again you have service, that is, responsibility in service.<a name=276:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=276:11></a>M.<a name=276:12></a> There is a difference between what the people of the land do in respect of a watchman and what the Lord does.<a name=276:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=276:14></a> Yes, so we have in chapter 33, the people of the land setting up one to be a watchman, and the responsibility attaching to him, and then what follows is Ezekiel, Jehovah's watchman.<a name=276:15></a> Then, again, the shepherds of Israel that were responsible, in chapter 34, and Jehovah Himself as Shepherd.<a name=276:16></a> These are the two lines, I think, that run through these two chapters, but whether it be the watchman whom God sets up or the watchman whom man sets up, responsibility attaches to him.<a name=276:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=277:1></a> One who, I think, like Habakkuk, stands upon his watchtower to see what may come about, and give warning.<a name=277:2></a> It would involve one taking account of what God does, and what the enemy may be doing.<a name=277:3></a> The watchman would take account of everything that would affect the people of God.<a name=277:4></a> If you take Habakkuk, for instance, he says in chapter 2, "I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer as to my reproof.<a name=277:5></a> And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision, and engrave it upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.<a name=277:6></a> For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but it hasteth to the end, and shall not lie though it tarry, wait for it; for it will surely come, it will not delay" (verses 1 - 3).<a name=277:7></a> There is an illustration of a watchman who is vigilant and has the mind of God; so that here it says, in contrast to that, "if he see the sword coming upon the land, and blow the trumpet, and warn the people; then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head".<a name=277:8></a> There would be a danger besetting the people, probably some act of God in discipline or in judgment, and the watchman seeing it coming, and warning the people, his responsibility ends there.<a name=277:9></a> He blows the trumpet and warns the people.<a name=277:10></a> "Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head" (verse 4).<a name=277:11></a> So that one can readily see how important the service of a watchman is.<a name=277:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=277:16></a> Well, the point is, I think, that he is responsible whether appointed by man or otherwise.<a name=277:17></a> Ezekiel was not appointed by man but by God, "I have set thee a watchman".<a name=277:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=278:4></a> The point is, he is a watchman, and of the greatest possible value.<a name=278:5></a> The Lord says in Mark, "I say to all, Watch", chapter 13: 37.<a name=278:6></a> If you are on your watch-tower, you see from every point of the compass what is happening, and the saints are not taken unawares.<a name=278:7></a> I expect a warning in ministry would have reference to what is coming.<a name=278:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=278:9></a> The full responsibility is thrown on whoever is on the tower.<a name=278:10></a> He should be morally apart and above others, as to the carrying out of things, clearly discerning.<a name=278:11></a> I suppose we are listening here now, in the Lord's word, to what the watchman is saying, "what I say to you, I say to all, Watch".<a name=278:12></a> In other words, the Lord suggests that all of us should be watchmen.<a name=278:13></a>

		A.F.<a name=278:14></a>M.<a name=278:15></a> Would you say that one idea of a watchman is that his service is never relinquished?<a name=278:16></a> In Isaiah, you have an expression in regard to the watchman; he says, "I stand <i>continually</i> upon the watch-tower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward <i>whole</i> nights", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#21:8">Isaiah  21:8</a>.<a name=278:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=279:5></a> That is very suggestive, because they were honoured in that the angel of the Lord stood by them and announced the thing to them; they were in a fitting attitude.<a name=279:6></a> I think that Mark would set us up in that way, the word there is, "Watch".<a name=279:7></a> Those who are watching are honoured; "an angel of the Lord", it says in Luke, "was there by them", and then it adds, "the glory of the Lord shone around them", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:9">Luke  2:9</a>.<a name=279:8></a> As the angel announced the birth of the Lord, a multitude of the heavenly host came, so that it is a very beautiful illustration of watching and shepherding.<a name=279:9></a>

		I had in mind that we might get help in this chapter as to how we are to take our place in the assembly according to the divine mind.<a name=308:2></a> The thought I had before me especially centres round the transfiguration.<a name=308:3></a> This chapter comes in between the introduction of the assembly by the Lord and its relation to the kingdom; chapter 16 is the assembly, and chapter 18 the kingdom.<a name=308:4></a> Chapter 17 gives us the heavenly character and the capacity to enter into the assembly, in order to have part in it.<a name=308:5></a> Unless we understand our part in what is heavenly, we shall not act according to heaven in the assembly.<a name=308:6></a> The assembly is that which is heavenly in the sense of dominance for good.<a name=308:7></a> It is said of the Lord, "His face did shine as the sun".<a name=308:8></a> It is heavenly light in the sense of supreme dominance for good.<a name=308:9></a> The sun shines on the evil and on the good.<a name=308:10></a> Unless we are in accord with that principle, we shall not be able to deal with good and evil in the assembly.<a name=308:11></a>

		The sun rises day after day, month after month, year after year, century after century, and shines in its power, regardless of what goes on on the earth.<a name=308:12></a> The Lord shines upon us in that dominant way, and He intended that Peter, James and John should shine correspondingly in the kingdom.<a name=308:13></a> Coming down from the mount they had to meet the power of Satan, but they were not equal to it then.<a name=308:14></a> Later in the Acts, when dealing with what existed at Jerusalem after the Lord ascended to heaven, they were superior to the power of evil.<a name=308:15></a> On the day of Pentecost, Peter showed that he had profited by this experience.<a name=308:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew is peculiar in this presentation of the transfiguration, because he wanted to insist on the character of the heavenly administration.<a name=309:6></a> We learn thus how to rise above evil and to administer good, otherwise we shall be overcome by evil.<a name=309:7></a> If a brother trespasses against me, I am to seek to gain him.<a name=309:8></a> Peter inquires of the Lord how often he should forgive his brother; and the Lord says, "Until seventy times seven".<a name=309:9></a> Peter's inquiry and the definite number given by him -- "Until seven times" -- show how little he had so far profited by the lesson of the transfiguration.<a name=309:10></a> I believe the Lord intends Peter to be a model both negatively and positively to all those who have part in the assembly.<a name=309:11></a> The history of Peter as given by Matthew brings out the mixture which is found in every one of us.<a name=309:12></a> On the other hand, he confesses Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, and on the other, he would turn the Lord aside from the path by which alone the assembly could be brought in.<a name=309:13></a> And here, in the presence of this light.<a name=309:14></a> Peter says, "Let us make here three tabernacles".<a name=309:15></a> In chapter 16 we see, in Peter, the flesh on which Satan acts in us; he was the instrument of Satan in endeavouring to turn the Lord aside from the only path in which He could glorify God, sin having come in.<a name=309:16></a> In that light he would bring the Lord to the level of Moses and Elias.<a name=309:17></a> Then again, he would limit the grace that marked the kingdom of God; nevertheless, he was typically the material for the

		Now the principle of the assembly is to come down; this is opened up in the Acts.<a name=310:10></a> In chapter 2 we have a sound from heaven; in chapter 9, a light from heaven, in chapter 10, a sheet from heaven, so that in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>the city comes down from God out of heaven.<a name=310:11></a> Heavenly grace comes down.<a name=310:12></a> Here it is as He descended from the mountain.<a name=310:13></a> He who descended is the same also who ascended.<a name=310:14></a> He descended first into the lower parts of the earth.<a name=310:15></a> We see, therefore, that the whole conception of God with regard to the assembly is that it comes down.<a name=310:16></a> The gifts have come from a Christ who has gone up, but who first descended; therefore they -- the gifts that are here -- should be characterised by the grace of the One who gave them.<a name=310:17></a> Apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists -- all are for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, so that the principle of going down should mark the servant.<a name=310:18></a> In taking our place in the assembly, we are to be in heavenly grace and dignity.<a name=310:19></a> Thus the assembly is morally lifted above the religious systems of the world.<a name=310:20></a> If evil has to be dealt with in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter is asked a question in verse 24.<a name=311:3></a> I have to answer questions if I belong to the assembly.<a name=311:4></a> If someone asks me, 'Does your Master pay tribute?<a name=311:5></a>' I say, 'My Master is in heaven; He does not pay taxes'.<a name=311:6></a> I know what to say if I am asked.<a name=311:7></a> When the Lord asked, "Whom do men say that I am?<a name=311:8></a>" Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=311:9></a> The Lord says, that is a revelation; that is not merely the result of faith in an objective truth: it is a revelation; "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=311:10></a> I must learn to be governed by the light given.<a name=311:11></a> Hence, Peter having been on the mount, should have been able to answer the question, "Does your Teacher not pay the didrachmas?<a name=311:12></a>" But he was not yet governed by the light.<a name=311:13></a> He did not have in his soul the sense of the greatness of Christ, he put his Master down to the level of other people.<a name=311:14></a> The tax was for the service of the temple.<a name=311:15></a> The Lord gives special light for the moment, but the general principle of my being is that I have light and that I walk according to it.<a name=311:16></a>

		We might look a little into the subject of light.<a name=321:1></a> Light necessarily enters into all God's operations.<a name=321:2></a> Before giving form to the creation, He said, "Let there be light".<a name=321:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought we might see the special character of the light in which the assembly is set.<a name=321:4></a> It involves Paul's ministry.<a name=321:5></a> There had been light vouchsafed to the Jews in general, but with Paul we get degrees of comparison with regard to light.<a name=321:6></a> First, it is spoken of as the light that reached him from heaven, then as "a great light", and, finally, as "a light above the brightness of the sun".<a name=321:7></a> It was not accidental, but a light from heaven, and there was particular significance in it as indicating what should come in for the saints through Paul.<a name=321:8></a> John speaks of light perhaps more than any of them, but it is not spoken of as a light from heaven; it is rather the true light, which, coming into the world, lightens every man.<a name=321:9></a> John emphasises its universal character -- that it is not partial.<a name=321:10></a> But in Paul we have our light.<a name=321:11></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#60">Isaiah  60</a>gives the idea, "Arise, shine!<a name=321:12></a> for thy light is come", only there it applies to the Jewish remnant in Jerusalem in the future.<a name=321:13></a> The time will arrive when Israel's light shall shine.<a name=321:14></a> There will be a time of great darkness; gross darkness shall cover the peoples, but God will come in for the remnant of Israel in Jerusalem.<a name=321:15></a> There will be a shining through Christ for them: "The glory of the Lord is risen upon thee".<a name=321:16></a> It is not a light that is directly vouchsafed to the Gentiles; they shall walk in it, but it comes to them through Israel.<a name=321:17></a> I refer to that passage for the idea of special light.<a name=321:18></a> There shall be a time of darkness on the earth, but the glory of Jehovah shall
