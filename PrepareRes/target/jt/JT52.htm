		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> The proposal is to look at the scriptures which treat of springs, or wells, or other water typical of the Spirit, especially in view of freshness in the assembly.<a name=1:3></a> Our hope and expectation is that through these meetings God will help us to a clearer apprehension of Christ and the assembly.<a name=1:4></a> The apostle says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>, "but <i>I</i> speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly".<a name=1:5></a> He had been speaking of natural family relationships, but the subject of Christ and the assembly was the main thought, and so it is throughout Scripture.<a name=1:6></a> Christ and the assembly stand out as the theme -- especially now, in view of the translation of the saints and the marriage of the Lamb.<a name=1:7></a> God would help us to have a clearer view of this great matter, and help that those who do not recognise the greatness of it may be drawn into it as having part in it.<a name=1:8></a> It is thought that linking on the idea of springs with the subject will lead to a clearer apprehension of the freshness that is essential to assembly functions.<a name=1:9></a>

		There can be no question of the freshness that is in Christ.<a name=1:10></a> He remains what He has always been since He became Man.<a name=1:11></a> The voice of the Bridegroom is there, and the feelings of the Bridegroom, and they remain even in heavenly glory.<a name=1:12></a> In the type, He comes out of His chamber, we are told, the sun representing Him, and rejoices as a strong man to run the race (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>).<a name=1:13></a> There is no question as to freshness and vigour with Him, but there is a very great question as to these things with those of us who form the assembly.<a name=1:14></a> Even if we apprehend the truth in any measure, we are apt

		<a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>affords us a view of Christ as the Bridegroom, John the baptist saying that he is the friend of the Bridegroom, who rejoices to hear His voice.<a name=2:2></a> This section will help us to begin with what is peculiarly applicable to our times, in accord with John's ministry; John the baptist being a model in the sense of appreciation of Christ, and disallowance of himself, in order that Christ may be everything and in all.<a name=2:3></a> He brings Christ in as the Bridegroom very noticeably, and then proceeds to enlarge upon the greatness of Christ's Person, leading up to the statement that the Father loves the Son and gives all things to be in His hand.<a name=2:4></a> Then we have this well-known passage in chapter 4, affording us a clue as to how the bride comes into view, from the standpoint of John's gospel.<a name=2:5></a> The woman undoubtedly may be taken to represent how the bride comes into view.<a name=2:6></a> A most disreputable person actually, yet she is brought into complete, and you might say, intelligent appreciation of Christ.<a name=2:7></a> He is now the one Man that displaces all the others, of whom there were six -- five, and the one she then had, which was not her husband -- and there can be no question about her disallowance of him at once.<a name=2:8></a> It is evident that we get deliverance from all that is corrupt by coming into contact with Christ, and He becomes all to us.<a name=2:9></a> The woman immediately takes an interest in His affairs and speaks to others about Him, and secures others for Him.<a name=2:10></a> That is, I think, a good platform for us to begin with in this inquiry.<a name=2:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:16></a> We cannot say that John understood the assembly; but she is Christ's fulness.<a name=2:17></a> You can hardly get a greater concrete expression of the idea of increase as regards Christ than in the assembly which is said to

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:14></a> John used it for baptism, which would point to death.<a name=3:15></a> In the next chapter it is said that the Lord's disciples were baptising, but He Himself was not doing it.<a name=3:16></a> He was not making Himself a Centre by any formal sacrament, but would become a Centre, because of what He was personally, and the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>represents how He becomes everything to christians.<a name=3:17></a> As to the water at Aenon, quantity is stressed.<a name=3:18></a> Quantity is not the point in chapter 4.<a name=3:19></a>

		C.A.<a name=3:20></a>M.<a name=3:21></a> I thought the quantity might suggest that all had disappeared in death, making way for this living suggestion about the Bridegroom and the bride.<a name=3:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		John?<a name=4:1></a> It is not a question of the quantity of water, not that <i>he</i> is making anything of it, but the Spirit of God mentions it; John was baptising there on this account.<a name=4:2></a> The question is whether the baptism of John really had not lost its force, because John the evangelist brings Christ in in ministry before the time mentioned in the synoptic gospels.<a name=4:3></a> They say that the Lord waited until John was cast into prison before He began.<a name=4:4></a> In John's gospel the Lord began before this, and morally He superseded John.<a name=4:5></a> John himself attested that in saying, "He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me" (chapter 1: 15).<a name=4:6></a> According to chapter 1 John had stopped; he "stood", and his disciples began to leave him.<a name=4:7></a> His service had already accomplished its purpose; but he is going on with it.<a name=4:8></a> John, however, appears in his true and glorious character in that he repudiates any thought of rivalry with Christ; he disappears here with flying colours: saying, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (chapter 3: 30).<a name=4:9></a> That is the end of John, because the Person is on the ground now who is to take up everything for God.<a name=4:10></a> God had not allowed the removal of John.<a name=4:11></a> John carried on until that happened; but the Lord had entered on His service.<a name=4:12></a> A divine Person need not wait upon any formal matters in the government of God.<a name=4:13></a> I think it is to give the right place to Christ in our own times.<a name=4:14></a> He cannot be bound by formal or legal ties.<a name=4:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:16></a>M.<a name=4:17></a> It seems to emphasise what John says: "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven".<a name=4:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:19></a> That is right.<a name=4:20></a> I suppose he is alluding to what came out of heaven.<a name=4:21></a> The Lord was baptised at the Jordan; heaven owned Him then; and so in chapter 10 of this gospel, the Lord as rejected by the Jews comes to where <i>John was baptising</i> (chapter 1: 28); meaning, I think, that He passed over what took place at Aenon.<a name=4:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:19></a> Well, that may be true on the public side, but how many are baptised that are not responding at all?<a name=5:20></a> The real point is the well of water springing up into everlasting life; a living state of things.<a name=5:21></a> What kind of a bride can there be without a living state of things?<a name=5:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=23:1></a> The brethren will be aware that our subject for these monthly readings is wells, springs, or other typical living water -- active water denoting generally what is living -- in relation to the assembly.<a name=23:2></a> We had <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>at our last meeting.<a name=23:3></a> In the chapter which is proposed for our present consideration, we have the river standing in relation to the assembly, as seen in Eve, the most exalted type, representing it <i>apart from sin</i>.<a name=23:4></a> The type we had last time stressed the historical phase of the assembly; that the members of it have had to do with sin, as seen in the woman of Samaria.<a name=23:5></a> Eve appears before sin came into the world, so that she represents the assembly in its most exalted, eternal relations, without any sin-stained history.<a name=23:6></a> It was taken out of Christ, so that it is His counterpart.<a name=23:7></a> It is said in Ephesians that God gave Him to be Head over all things to the assembly, which is His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all (chapter 1: 22, 23).<a name=23:8></a>

		It will be before us now to discover what the river signifies as in this early type.<a name=23:9></a> First it is to be noted that it went out of Eden, which would suggest, typically, a heavenly environment.<a name=23:10></a> It is a place of delights, an extended one.<a name=23:11></a> The river was to water the garden, which was more limited, and from thence it flowed out universally.<a name=23:12></a> The suggestion clearly is that <i>production</i>, resulting from such an influence, is in mind.<a name=23:13></a> Mention is made of gold, and bdellium, and the onyx stone; three features of material which would have part to the structure, for the idea of structure is in mind.<a name=23:14></a> The woman is built; that is the word used.<a name=23:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:9></a> It is a sphere, indicating how far God had gone on these lines; Eden itself is wider than the garden.<a name=24:10></a> The river flowed out of Eden, so that it is a gathering up, influentially, of what God is, so far, in the way of affording pleasure.<a name=24:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=212:1></a> I think this term, "the river of God", fits into the conclusion of our inquiry.<a name=212:2></a> The phraseology in this Psalm is peculiarly spiritual as covering the great thought of a river of refreshing power, symbolical of the Spirit, which runs through the Scriptures.<a name=212:3></a> The Psalms being representative of <i>experience</i>, the term would flow from that side, coming from a person who had faith: "There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God" (verse 4).<a name=212:4></a> <i>There is</i> a river.<a name=212:5></a> This is intended to fit permanently with us, and would come up in doleful times.<a name=212:6></a> The river in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>points to its final service in the millennium, showing that the great thought with which we have been engaged will run through to the end of God's testimony.<a name=212:7></a> It will be the source of life in millennial times, the tree of life also being seen on either side of it and in the street of the city, bearing twelve manner of fruits.<a name=212:8></a> It is a yearly matter, time yet being taken account of.<a name=212:9></a> The matter is divided up into twelve months, but extending on to the end of time.<a name=212:10></a> The position does not take us beyond that, but it shows that this great principle of the river gives character to the millennial period; and in a monthly way.<a name=212:11></a> And finally, it is thought that it is due to the Lord that we should see that what has been before us is held in an exclusive sense for Him, as in <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#4">Song of Songs  4</a>.<a name=212:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=291:1></a> What was before us at our last reading relates to Christ as Head of the assembly as seen in David in relation to the service of God, a most important feature of our subject.<a name=291:2></a> How headship enters into the service of the saints as together in assembly for the Lord's supper was considered.<a name=291:3></a> We were diverted a little to consider the general principle of the care meeting, a very important subject; but the chapter in Chronicles which we read presents David in a most remarkable role as head, and, we may say, as minister of the sanctuary, for he leads in the service.<a name=291:4></a> We are told that he blessed Jehovah in the sight of all the congregation; and then in verse 20 he directs the congregation to bless Jehovah.<a name=291:5></a> He says, "Bless now Jehovah your God", and the congregation did so.<a name=291:6></a> So, we have the service proceeding to the end of verse 22.<a name=291:7></a>

		In this first section David speaks to God, saying, "Thou art exalted as Head above all"; applying the idea of headship to God himself, showing David's intelligence as to this great thought.<a name=291:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We also saw how as leading up to David's ministry, Dagon fell before the ark in the house of Dagon, among the Philistines.<a name=291:9></a> David slew the Philistine and cut off his head, and took it to Jerusalem as a testimony, to the place where the service of God was to be inaugurated, and to the setting aside of all headships of evil.<a name=291:10></a> We noted in Colossians how God set aside what stood in the way of His people.<a name=291:11></a> He took certain things out of the way, making a show of principalities and powers.<a name=291:12></a> Further on in 1 Samuel we saw that Nabal, the husband of Abigail, was set aside by God.<a name=291:13></a> He was in the way; a churlish man, and antagonistic to David -- pointing to what exists today as set up by men.<a name=291:14></a> All such things are to be discredited in the minds of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=292:8></a> Headship certainly involves feeling; for we can readily see that Abigail would be marked by deep feelings in her union with David, and these would be allied with intelligence.<a name=292:9></a> She was a woman "of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance".<a name=292:10></a> She is typical of the saints as under the Lord's eye.<a name=292:11></a> His beauty being reflected in us.<a name=292:12></a> The assembly is of Him; brought out of death with Him, formed and beautified by the Spirit to correspond with her Head.<a name=292:13></a> And the Lord clothes us with His own blessed thoughts, so that we are suitable to Him.<a name=292:14></a> As regards Christ's ministerial service in the sanctuary, this involves feelings too, towards God and towards the saints.<a name=292:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=299:1></a> I was thinking of <i>quickening</i> as seen in the epistles to the Colossians and the Ephesians.<a name=299:2></a> The word 'quickening' may suggest to some minds here that the subject of eternal life should come up, but it is not in my mind.<a name=299:3></a> The term 'eternal life' is wider than quickening, applying to the earthly saints in the future as well as to the saints in this dispensation, and also involving an order or sphere of things into which believers go.<a name=299:4></a> "These shall go away into eternal punishment, and the righteous into life eternal", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:46">Matthew  25:46</a>.<a name=299:5></a>

		The thought now is to consider the word 'quickening' as seen in these two epistles; in them it takes on a more exalted significance than it does elsewhere.<a name=299:6></a> We have it in the Old Testament, particularly in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>, a familiar psalm to many of us, the longest one in the book.<a name=299:7></a> The word 'quickening' appears there more frequently than in the rest of the Old Testament; it is an outcome of the <i>desires</i> of the saints, that psalm being largely a question of desire.<a name=299:8></a> The word 'quickening' is also found in the New Testament in a wider and more general significance than in the two epistles in which we read.<a name=299:9></a> The idea is connected with the Father in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, "For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens them, thus the Son also quickens whom he will" (verse 21).<a name=299:10></a> The Father quickens and the Son quickens here; and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>we are told, "It is the Spirit which quickens" (verse 63).<a name=299:11></a> But nowhere else have we the expression, "quickened with Christ" save in these two epistles.<a name=299:12></a> It applies in Scripture only to the saints of this dispensation, and it is thought that the affections of the saints are specially brought into it, in the thought of being not only made to live, but made to live <i>with Christ</i>, in association with Him, involving that we are <i>sharers of His life</i>.<a name=299:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=300:13></a> Yes; all the past and all that would hinder our progress and enjoyment in this new state of association with Christ.<a name=300:14></a> We are told, "Having forgiven us all the offences; having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which stood out against us, which was contrary to us, he has taken it also out of the way, having nailed it to the cross; having spoiled principalities and authorities, he made a show of them publicly" (verses 13 - 15).<a name=300:15></a> So that what might hinder us in enjoyment and progress in this life is taken out of the way at one stroke in the death of Christ.<a name=300:16></a>

		These scriptures relate to the government of the assembly, and that is why they have been read.<a name=318:1></a> What I have in mind is <i>local gatherings, and stability in them</i>.<a name=318:2></a> Government itself is intended to promote stability, and prevent chaos, and never was there a time when it was more needed than the present: the stabilising of conditions which are severely shaken among the nations.<a name=318:3></a> In early days when faith was developing, especially in the one said to be the father of all who have faith, it will be recalled that this man, Abraham, in a time of shaking such as we are experiencing now, resided by the oaks of Mamre.<a name=318:4></a> It was war time, one might say a world war, four kings against five -- nine kings engaged in deadly conflict.<a name=318:5></a> Abraham was on neither side and only came into the conflict because his brother had been affected by it, carried away, as many christians have been in recent years.<a name=318:6></a> Our concern as believers is their recovery; not exactly in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense.<a name=318:7></a> And in this effort, if we are in faith, we are wrestling.<a name=318:8></a> Persons who have faith are taught how to wrestle.<a name=318:9></a> It is said that an angel wrestled with Jacob, and of christians it is said that "our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:12">Ephesians  6:12</a>.<a name=318:10></a> It is a very real exercise, and it has in view that we belong to the heavenly calling; also to the heavenly army.<a name=318:11></a> Our concern is the rescue of our brethren, but that, whilst not ignoring the conflict, we may be kept free in our spirits from its influence.<a name=318:12></a>

		Now, the verse read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14">Acts  14</a>corresponds with what I am saying.<a name=319:8></a> The apostles, Barnabas and Paul, were active and successfully so; but they were sufferers, for the enemy raised a storm as usual when God is working.<a name=319:9></a> He is the prince of the power of the air, and God allows him to stir up strife and storm.<a name=319:10></a> You know how he used it against Job and his family.<a name=319:11></a> He also used it against Paul and Barnabas.<a name=319:12></a> They were successfully engaged in the blessed service of God, many being converted; and Paul was stoned.<a name=319:13></a> Such was the storm of opposition.<a name=319:14></a> He was drawn out of the city as dead; so that he was laid aside by the power of the devil's winds, bitter north winds of persecution; but he was encircled by the brethren, as we have been saying here today.<a name=319:15></a> How precious it is to be encircled by the brethren!<a name=319:16></a> And he rose up and entered into the city.<a name=319:17></a> He did not flee the city; he rose up, not a coward, but a victorious soldier of Jesus Christ, a good one, enduring hardships of the severest kind.<a name=319:18></a> He and Barnabas returned to these meetings that were mentioned, and as you will observe in verse 22, they were "establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to abide in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God".<a name=319:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		Then this verse that I read, that "having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed".<a name=320:8></a> They saw that the tender plants planted in those towns were exposed to the bitter winds of persecution.<a name=320:9></a> What will happen to them when we leave?<a name=320:10></a> would arise in the minds of these great servants, for they cared with genuine feeling about them.<a name=320:11></a> They must leave and visit other parts, and what will happen as they depart?<a name=320:12></a> Will the disciples lose heart?<a name=320:13></a> Will they be discouraged?<a name=320:14></a> Will disintegration set in?<a name=320:15></a> Will the assemblies in these towns be effaced?<a name=320:16></a> These solemn considerations arose or were in the hearts of these devoted men.<a name=320:17></a> And so they chose "them elders in each assembly".<a name=320:18></a> Evidently there were several that might be able to serve in these churches, for there was a <i>choice</i>.<a name=320:19></a> They were not limited to one.<a name=320:20></a> In fact, we never find only <i>one</i> elder in an assembly.<a name=320:21></a> In these assemblies there was a choice, and elders were chosen in each.<a name=320:22></a> Earlier, if an apostle was required there was a choice, too.<a name=320:23></a> There were two nominated.<a name=320:24></a> Doubtless there could have been others; but it was regarded that two were sufficient, and Matthias was selected, but it was by the disposition of God on the principle of the lot.<a name=320:25></a> They cast lots according to Old Testament procedure and God honoured this.<a name=320:26></a> But there is not casting lots for these elders, nor is there any election of them, nor is there any appointment of them by a superior elder or bishop.<a name=320:27></a> It is the

		Well now, I have said all that about the verse read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14">Acts  14</a>to show you how concerned the apostles were about stability; so that before they left they chose them elders in each assembly.<a name=321:10></a> Thus the assemblies were furnished in so far as the wisdom of God in these two men could furnish them.<a name=321:11></a> But as elsewhere, the Spirit would have part in the choice.<a name=321:12></a> When the apostle Paul sent for the elders of Ephesus, he said to them that "the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers" of the assembly (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>).<a name=321:13></a> And the same would apply here, that whilst they were chosen by the apostles, the Holy Spirit was there.<a name=321:14></a> There can be no assembly without the Holy Spirit, no assembly according to God, nor can there be any christian according to God without the Holy Spirit.<a name=321:15></a> Someone will say to me, Well, every christian has the Holy Spirit.<a name=321:16></a> If he is a full christian he has, but there are many who are only half, may be not even that.<a name=321:17></a> The teaching abroad is so defective that persons, although subjects of the work of God, are often unfit for the reception of the Holy Spirit.<a name=321:18></a> But any one who is truly a christian, that is to say, his sins are forgiven, he is justified through the death of the

		And now I go to Titus, so that we may see what is in mind in this selection of spiritual servants.<a name=322:10></a> We are down in Crete in this passage, and Titus was there, a worthy disciple and servant, and a companion of Paul, a trustworthy man.<a name=322:11></a> The apostle says to him in this letter, "For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest go on to set right what remained unordered, and establish elders in each city, as <i>I</i> had ordered thee" (verse 5).<a name=322:12></a> It is not here choosing.<a name=322:13></a> He does not say 'choose' here; it is 'establish'.<a name=322:14></a> That is to say, the thing must be done.<a name=322:15></a> He does not say, If there be any suitable persons.<a name=322:16></a> There is no 'if' about it.<a name=322:17></a> You may dismiss the 'if' when God is working.<a name=322:18></a> God will not fail to provide what is needed, but He is pleased to use trustworthy persons.<a name=322:19></a> And that is one of the most important things to keep before us, trustworthy persons in the service of God; that heaven can rely on one in a crisis, that the brethren can rely on him, too.<a name=322:20></a>

		I have in mind to speak about <i>experience</i>: experience with God, with His people, and with the things of God, with a view to showing that such experience causes increase in our knowledge of God, of Christ, of the Spirit, and of the saints; also of the things of God in general.<a name=361:1></a> The service of God requires that we should progress in experience, so that there should be elders amongst us.<a name=361:2></a> We have among the gifts the word of wisdom; that is not exactly the fruit of experience, it is a divine gift, but the use of it is greatly enhanced by experience, and this may be said of every gift that God gives.<a name=361:3></a> In one sense, every saint has gift: "to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a>.<a name=361:4></a> And the exercise of the gift effectively is really contingent upon experience.<a name=361:5></a>

		Scripture speaks much of God <i>showing</i> things, that is, to persons who valued what was shown.<a name=363:3></a> In this connection I wish to speak first of light.<a name=363:4></a> We read of the light being sweet (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#11:7">Ecclesiastes  11:7</a>).<a name=363:5></a> The passage read in Acts is from the third account of Paul's vision on the way to Damascus, and from it I wish to speak of his experience in light.<a name=363:6></a> It was a vision, because he saw the Lord, but what I have in mind now is his experience in the light that shone.<a name=363:7></a> Light is one of the first things we have in Scripture.<a name=363:8></a> God said, "Let there be light" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:3">Genesis  1:3</a>), but that light is not defined, nor is the source of it given us.<a name=363:9></a> Paul, however, speaks of a light above the brightness of the sun, shining from heaven round about him.<a name=363:10></a> I have read the last mention of it in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26">Acts  26</a>; he mentioned it twice himself, and the Holy Spirit mentions it directly once.<a name=363:11></a> Paul here speaks of the light in a superlative sense.<a name=363:12></a> In speaking to Agrippa here, he had much expansion inwardly; no doubt God helped him peculiarly in this address.<a name=363:13></a> It was a unique opportunity, and he did not come short in the appreciation of it.<a name=363:14></a> I do not suppose anyone really can speak on God's behalf save as he appreciates an opportunity as divinely given.<a name=363:15></a> And this was divinely given, and availed of, for the apostle was in much liberty and power.<a name=363:16></a> He says, "At mid-day, on the way, I saw, O king, a light above the brightness of the sun, shining from heaven round about me and those who were journeying with me", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:13">Acts  26:13</a>.<a name=363:17></a> I do not suppose any other monarch had such an address presented to him as this one spoken to Agrippa.<a name=363:18></a> "O king", the apostle says.<a name=363:19></a> He knew what to say; he knew objectively whom he was addressing; and he knew what form of words to use.<a name=363:20></a> He was not communistic in that sense; he recognised dignities.<a name=363:21></a> There are those who speak

		Now Luke, as we have often noted, in recording the incident, says just that it was "a light from heaven".<a name=364:9></a> That was important; it was important at that point to stress heaven.<a name=364:10></a> Not a light from Jerusalem, but from heaven; not a light from Rome, but from heaven.<a name=364:11></a> Heaven was peculiarly interested in Paul at that time, and the light shone from there round about him.<a name=364:12></a> Then in the next account, which was by himself, in chapter 22, he says to his Jewish hearers that it was "a great light" from heaven (verse 6).<a name=364:13></a> The material heavens are full of lights, and a great variety of them; but Paul says, "a great light".<a name=364:14></a> He is alluding to the area of comparativeness which the heavens suggest.<a name=364:15></a> He had been learning since he first saw it, the first time he experienced it; that is, he had been experiencing more as to light.<a name=364:16></a> How many times the apostle would have thanked God as he recalled that memorable day outside Damascus!<a name=364:17></a> The impression as to the light that shone around him never left him, and it increased.<a name=364:18></a> Not that the light increased in itself, but it increased in his soul; that is the point.<a name=364:19></a> In your experience of divine light, what you saw yesterday was wonderful then, but as you

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well might Agrippa say, "In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian" (verse 28).<a name=365:17></a> To be a true Christian involves that I must see the light above the brightness of the sun.<a name=365:18></a> And that is the light today; Paul had experienced it and we need it now; making sure of things by experience, so that we might find our way through, because the darkness is very great, and the confusion around.<a name=365:19></a> Natural light will not do; but this light above the brightness of the sun in our souls will carry us through the darkest experiences; and it becomes more and more magnified.<a name=365:20></a>

		This is not only so with men of this world, unregenerate men, but, alas, it finds a home even among christians, and we are given the word that he who "exalts himself shall be abased": God sets Himself peculiarly against self-exaltation, it interferes with His operations amongst us, it even blinds and darkens those who would serve, and so He sets Himself against it peculiarly.<a name=373:5></a> He abases all those amongst His people who exalt themselves.<a name=373:6></a> It is for <i>Him</i> to exalt, it is <i>His</i> prerogative.<a name=373:7></a> The Lord told the mother of the sons of Zebedee that it was the Father's prerogative to exalt His own.<a name=373:8></a> She would have her sons exalted <i>because they were her sons, and she was their mother</i>.<a name=373:9></a> Alas, dear brethren, we allow this spirit of self-exaltation; but it is he who humbles himself that is exalted.<a name=373:10></a> In the world this spirit obtains, and at times hides itself in men of great powers; they seek power and place, and will allow nothing to thwart them in so far as it is possible.<a name=373:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to speak of lovers of God.<a name=401:1></a> That there are such in this world at the present time is undoubted.<a name=401:2></a> Indeed, Jehovah, as about to demand love from His people, said at Sinai that He had thousands of lovers even then -- a matter that must have been of great moment to Himself, for God is said to <i>be</i> love; love is <i>of Him</i>.<a name=401:3></a> And so <i>He</i> values, more than any, love in others.<a name=401:4></a> He loves it, or rather, He loves the lovers, His lovers.<a name=401:5></a> He loves them because they are of Him, and the love that they have is of Him, and so He was not in this sense in poverty even at Sinai when about to assert His right to men's hearts, to their love.<a name=401:6></a> He had lovers already, and so today.<a name=401:7></a> Many of us here could count them even by the thousands, were we put to the test -- thank God!<a name=401:8></a> -- and it is fair to assume that most here, if not all, are amongst them.<a name=401:9></a> Hence, how delightful to God is this meeting; one's heart is sensible already of being in an atmosphere, in this sense, in that one is speaking to lovers of God and that God is pleased with them, whilst at the same time He would desire more and more such.<a name=401:10></a> There is to be a constant increase of love, and the idea is introduced in this first scripture amid that sorrowful list, dear brethren, of persons, nominal christians -- a depressing list.<a name=401:11></a> What you will observe, especially if you are looking at the New Translation, is the recurrence of the word "love", but only once as applied in a good sense, as applied to persons who love God.<a name=401:12></a> We have in the passage for instance, "lovers of their own selves" -- a phrase that comes home in the way of a challenge as to how much selfishness may be lurking with us, although in the main we may be "lovers of God".<a name=401:13></a> Then it is said as to the word "covetous" -- "lovers of money", which is the proper rendering.<a name=401:14></a> If I love myself I shall certainly love money,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and we are told elsewhere that the love of it "is the root of all evil" -- a remarkable thing!<a name=402:1></a> -- and yet we may not discern that in our hearts there is that love, a love called the love of money, or covetousness.<a name=402:2></a> The passage is not treating of real christians, but <i>I am speaking</i> to real christians and suggesting that, although we are real christians and lovers of God, too, yet there may be something of this lurking in our hearts -- love of self and love of money, for they go together.<a name=402:3></a> Self is the most difficult to get rid of, I quite believe.<a name=402:4></a> It is surprising, and one has to admit it, how much of self there is in us, in oneself, at times quite unknown to us, through our minds moving in a certain groove.<a name=402:5></a> Indeed, we clothe self, we ornament it, without thinking that we are doing it, telling of our good deeds without meaning to do so in a premeditated way, but in our little tales we see to it that self, in some way or another, perhaps ornamented, is in the very middle of the picture.<a name=402:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as James would say, "My brethren, these things ought not so to be", and the constant ministry of Christ, the ministry of His death in the power of the Spirit, is to lead us to discern self.<a name=402:7></a> We are told that the Lord Jesus came by water and blood, meaning that in becoming incarnate, He intended to die.<a name=402:8></a> He did not come into this world to live as a man in flesh.<a name=402:9></a> He <i>intended</i> to die.<a name=402:10></a> He came by water and blood.<a name=402:11></a> He must furnish the water and the blood, and these are in His death, that is, when the soldier's spear pierced His side on the cross, there came forth the means of cleansing; and then we are told that the Spirit is the Witness.<a name=402:12></a> He keeps on applying the water and the blood.<a name=402:13></a> That is the order in John's epistle.<a name=402:14></a> In the gospel, it is the blood and the water.<a name=402:15></a> The blood is the first mentioned as the fundamental thing, as the great fundamental doctrine of atonement, but the water is the first in view of christians being led to judge themselves -- not only what they do and say, but the <i>thing</i>, that thing self that

		Well now, I go on to the second scripture, the positive side, just to point out what has oftentimes been brought before us.<a name=405:14></a> The apostle says, "We know not what we should pray for as we ought".<a name=405:15></a> Then he says, alluding to that, "we <i>do</i> know that all things work together for good to those who love God".<a name=405:16></a> Thank God for such a person as this great servant.<a name=405:17></a> We continually have reference to him in our minds, this great servant who is intended to represent the mind of the Lord as to christianity in its fulness.<a name=405:18></a> He says, "we <i>do</i> know" -- someone knew; he did, with others -- "that all things work together for good to those who love God".<a name=405:19></a> <i>All things</i>.<a name=405:20></a> Now that is victory, because the "all things" are workers, however adverse they may seem to be.<a name=405:21></a> Some of them may seem overwhelmingly adverse, but in time we shall prove that they are workers for good, that those seemingly adverse things are poised divinely, so as to work with what is not adverse, but manifestly in our favour, so as to produce good.<a name=405:22></a> It is the balancing,

		Well then, finally we have Deborah's song (for that is what is the theme of the chapter) -- "then sang Deborah", as you will observe, and Barak sang.<a name=406:14></a> This song is from victorious lips, triumphant lips, and the leader is a sister; the leader, too, in the great movement that overthrew the enemy.<a name=406:15></a> Deborah represents victory in sisters, beginning with victory over themselves, for she sat, as we are told, she judged Israel, dwelling under her own palm-tree -- the palm denoting undoubtedly her victory over herself.<a name=406:16></a> Otherwise how could she judge Israel?<a name=406:17></a> No true Israelite, viewed spiritually, would go to a person who is not self-judged, for judgment.<a name=406:18></a>

		In closing, one would say at this time to the dear brethren that we may see to it that we are lovers of God, and continue to be that, so that there may be the shining, the victorious shining, the beneficial shining, too, not only light but warmth, for it is the sun in his might -- as Matthew presents the Lord on the mount of transfiguration.<a name=408:12></a> His countenance characteristically in that gospel shone as the sun.<a name=408:13></a> It is Christ in His majestic glory, presently to appear in this world, but now to be reflected there in the lovers of God.<a name=408:14></a>

		I have read these scriptures because they speak of cruses.<a name=416:1></a> I have in mind to consider each cruse mentioned as representing a vessel; and each saint of God is to be regarded as a vessel.<a name=416:2></a> The Scriptures say that saints are "vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:23">Romans  9:23</a>.<a name=416:3></a> No doubt God has in mind to have vessels in glory, that we shall not be there merely as blessed people or sight-seers, but as usable.<a name=416:4></a> God will have use for each of the redeemed.<a name=416:5></a> One of them, Paul, is spoken of as an "elect vessel", meaning that he was outstanding; but clearly the idea attaches to each christian, and it applies now, for we are to be usable now by God.<a name=416:6></a> The governments of the world lay claim to almost everybody now, and rightly, as under God.<a name=416:7></a> It will be remembered that Joseph in his great administration under Pharaoh secured all Egypt for Pharaoh; he really made them all as purchased property in the sense of servants or servitude.<a name=416:8></a> Every Egyptian would be amenable legally to the behests of the king, not simply as a subject but as a born slave.<a name=416:9></a> That principle is applied in the world now in a very wide sense, and in a wider sense still it is applied by God; not simply that we are slaves as commonly understood (though every one who loves God loves the thought of being His slave), but it is an honourable position.<a name=416:10></a> Even our Lord Jesus Christ took a bondman's form -- the most touching thing perhaps in the Scriptures.<a name=416:11></a> He had served, according to the type, for six years, and could go out free, but instead of going out free He said, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21:5">Exodus  21:5</a>.<a name=416:12></a> So He became a Bondman for ever, and that is the true, immutable, unchangeable testimony of His death.<a name=416:13></a> He is the most wonderful of all vessels; indeed every other vessel hangs on Him, according to the Scriptures, as if

		So the word is 'new', the cruse is new.<a name=419:6></a> Elisha wanted this one, he asked for it, and it may be the Spirit of God is asking it from someone here.<a name=419:7></a> Have you got this new thing?<a name=419:8></a> Why this cruse?<a name=419:9></a> Well, there were men in the place, the word is not used accidentally.<a name=419:10></a> There were sons of the prophets there too; they are not said to be men, although they were such, of course, literally.<a name=419:11></a> Indeed, there were said to be among them fifty strong men.<a name=419:12></a> But "the men of the city" are persons sensibly responsible in the place.<a name=419:13></a> Now pursuing my thought, I am not speaking for the moment of a locality, but of a person.<a name=419:14></a> Each person is responsible in himself, so that he represents in himself the idea of the man or men of the place.<a name=419:15></a> The human person is regarded as an institution in Scripture.<a name=419:16></a> The apostle Paul works it out in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>he says, "So then <i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law" (verse 25).<a name=419:17></a> "<i>I myself</i>" is the responsible being in the institution of his person; and he is resolving certain things.<a name=419:18></a> What is he resolving to do?<a name=419:19></a> He says, I am going to do the will of God.<a name=419:20></a> That is one of the finest resolutions one can make.<a name=419:21></a> If you resolve to put it off, it is one of the worst things you can do.<a name=419:22></a> This matter of accepting a certain responsibility is of first and last importance for every person.<a name=419:23></a> So Paul says, "<i>I myself</i>", and it is in that sense I am speaking tonight.<a name=419:24></a> The place was Jericho, a well-known city, a

		Now this new thing was there in Jericho, the Jerichoites had it, and they had the salt as well.<a name=422:6></a> Salt as a type is used by the Lord several times; the passage most applicable to what I am saying is <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:50">Mark  9:50</a>, "Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another".<a name=422:7></a> The Lord says to His disciples, "Ye are the salt of the earth".<a name=422:8></a> The idea is that the believer can be used of God for purification, for healing the waters -- conditions, we will say, in the local meeting, conditions in the christian himself.<a name=422:9></a> This is a question of one man, one woman, one person being available to God as constituted new by the work of God, and able to take on this salt, that is, the power of preservation.<a name=422:10></a> And so, dear brethren, this matter comes very close to us.<a name=422:11></a> The Lord says, "Have salt in yourselves".<a name=422:12></a> Every gathering of the Lord's people requires this admonition.<a name=422:13></a> And then again, "Let your word be always with grace, seasoned with salt", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:6">Colossians  4:6</a>; that is, whatever you say is to have an element of correction, of preservation, or refusal of corruption.<a name=422:14></a> There is no hope of our getting on without this type of conversation.<a name=422:15></a> Well now, this cruse is available; the salt is put into it, and Elisha goes to the source of the waters, and the source is purified.<a name=422:16></a> It says, "Thus saith Jehovah: I have healed these waters: there shall not be from thence any more death or barrenness.<a name=422:17></a> And the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke" (chapter 2: 21, 22).<a name=422:18></a> How remarkable is the recovery in this city!<a name=422:19></a> And it is at the initiative of the men, persons who are

		Now when we come to chapter 19 we get Elijah fleeing from a wicked woman, Jezebel, because she had threatened to slay him, and according to what I read, "he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a certain broom-bush, and requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough: now, Jehovah, take my life; for I am not better than my fathers.<a name=425:17></a> And he lay down and slept under the broom-bush.<a name=425:18></a> And behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise, eat!<a name=425:19></a> And he looked, and behold, at his head was a cake, baked on hot stones, and a cruse of water".<a name=425:20></a> He was lying down, but there was a cake baken on coals and a cruse of water at his head.<a name=425:21></a>
