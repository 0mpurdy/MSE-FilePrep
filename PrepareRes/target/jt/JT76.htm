		THE ASSEMBLY AS SEEN IN THE CLOSE OF THE GOSPELS (1)

		J.T.<a name=1:4></a> The thought in mind is the assembly as seen in the endings of the gospels, first the family link as in John and then the link of grace as in Luke, so that we may see the working of the assembly in view of the conditions that have arisen on the earth, the violence that has come in.<a name=1:5></a> God may help us to see what is in the assembly, not simply so many persons, but what God has in the assembly as an offset to all the evil here; that He has something He can go on with and use in view of the end.<a name=1:6></a> It is thought that we should begin with the Spirit in this inquiry.<a name=1:7></a> John begins early with preparation for the new order of things in Christianity and chapter 14 introduces the Spirit.<a name=1:8></a> We shall see Him later, of course, in chapter 20, as breathed into the disciples.<a name=1:9></a> The Lord is taking the subject up here in view of chapter 20, to prepare us, or the disciples, for the great fact of the Spirit's coming and His operations with a view to the assembly.<a name=1:10></a> It is thought that God has taken account of conditions that have arisen on the earth, unparalleled conditions, bringing out the wickedness of man here on earth, and then offsetting it by what He has here in the assembly, not simply the persons, but what is in the assembly viewed as an organism.<a name=1:11></a> The order of man that God has secured would show what He has in the assembly before He begins to work in Israel and the nations.<a name=1:12></a> The verses read begin with love for Christ and the keeping of His commandments, and the Spirit given.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.G.<a name=1:14></a>H.<a name=1:15></a> Is the suggestion that the assembly is the scene of the Spirit's operations in our day?<a name=1:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:1></a> Yes, it is the greatest thought operationally, I suppose, and the greatest thought familywise.<a name=2:2></a> God has it now, not simply persons, but over against the awful development in man that has come about in our time, He has actually, in the assembly already, the new order of man that is according to His mind.<a name=2:3></a> We are on a high level here leading up to chapter 20.<a name=2:4></a> What is going on in the assembly in the way of divine visitations brings about response to them, over against the awfulness of the conditions that are abroad.<a name=2:5></a> We have every advantage in the presence of the Spirit, the Father and the Son coming in and the Spirit operating, indicating visitations -- coming and going -- the active service of divine Persons.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=2:7></a>H.<a name=2:8></a> The word "the Comforter" used by the Lord in speaking of the Holy Spirit conveys the idea of managing our affairs.<a name=2:9></a> In the early part of the chapter does it have reference to managing our affairs inwardly, so that we might be restful and full of comfort and grace in the presence of all these awful things around, not so much making way for us through these things but helping us inwardly in them?<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:11></a> Yes, divine Persons are carrying on, the Lord Himself being in evidence, telling us all about it by instructing us as to how things are to go on, the coming and going of divine Persons and the effect of it inwardly and outwardly in a family way.<a name=2:12></a> I think there is the evidence of all this in a little way throughout the world.<a name=2:13></a> God is going on with it in the midst of the turmoil and violence.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=2:15></a> What do you mean by coming and going?<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:17></a> The Lord says, "I am coming to you.<a name=2:18></a> Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live".<a name=2:19></a> It is a wonderful thing that we are directly in touch with heaven through divine Persons being active in coming and going.<a name=2:20></a> The effect of that is to be known among us.<a name=2:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:3></a> That is good.<a name=3:4></a> The Lord calls attention to what they and we have to do with -- the rulers who have no part in Him at all, but we know Him.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=3:6></a> It raises the question of what knowledge we have of the assembly and how much attention we are giving to it.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:8></a> We have been holding it theoretically, perhaps, and not apprehending its origin, character, and testimony, what God has in all this dispensation, what He is going on with in an unseen way, although the effect is seen outwardly.<a name=3:9></a> Hence, I think the Lord has sought to remind us that the assembly is not a mere servant to us or something to be resorted to at times.<a name=3:10></a> It is the chief thought of God.<a name=3:11></a> So it has been remarked many times, "Let not the assembly be charged", (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:16">1 Timothy  5:16</a>).<a name=3:12></a> Take care of it, do not make it common.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=3:14></a>E.<a name=3:15></a> Being an organism, it needs the Spirit's help.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:17></a> That is right, organism is the word; indeed, it is active in that sense.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=3:19></a>W.<a name=3:20></a> Does the reference to the individual in verses 21 and on give the character of the conditions to which the divine Persons will come?<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:22></a> That is good, I am sure.<a name=3:23></a> The word 'assembly' is not used in John, but the persons who form it are spoken of; but it is not forgotten that it is an organism.<a name=3:24></a> We begin here, "If ye love me, keep my commandments.<a name=3:25></a> And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter".<a name=3:26></a> We cannot think that that Comforter is given to each of us severally.<a name=3:27></a> It is a collective thought.<a name=3:28></a> The Lord says, "That he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him".<a name=3:29></a> The <i>ye</i> is

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=4:4></a>W.<a name=4:5></a> Judas, not Iscariote, confirms that as he asks the Lord, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?<a name=4:6></a>".<a name=4:7></a> He evidently takes it as a collective matter.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:9></a> Yes, and a love matter too, not a mere theoretical, or doctrinal thought; it is the persons that are in mind, and what is said of them shows it must be a collective thing.<a name=4:10></a> There must be an organism involved.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:12></a>M.<a name=4:13></a> Would you say the word 'orphans' in verse 18 stresses the idea of family?<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:15></a> You can see how it touches us.<a name=4:16></a> The family is in view in that sense.<a name=4:17></a> The Lord's word implies fatherhood in the sense in which John speaks of it.<a name=4:18></a> He tells us that the Lord called them "children"; they were 'His own'.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.N.<a name=4:20></a> Does the position of the Lord Jesus on high and the presence of the Holy Spirit down here make up for all that would make us orphans as regards the world conditions which you have in mind?<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:22></a> Yes, and as the worldling comes in touch with those of whom the Lord speaks, he finds something there that he did not know of before.<a name=4:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=4:24></a>S.<a name=4:25></a> Would the orphan conditions for the ten days only give emphasis to the reality of the Comforter when He came?<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:27></a> Yes, the ten days would bring that out.<a name=4:28></a> The ten days, which we shall see in the Acts, brought out what they were and how much they could do for one another.<a name=4:29></a> Peter could take a lead and propose what should be done, before the Spirit came, but how great the effect when the Spirit actually came, and began to function, and <i>they</i> began to function in His power.<a name=4:30></a> So you learn by contrast, but still the ten

		F.S.<a name=5:2></a>C.<a name=5:3></a> Were only the disciples left orphans?<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:5></a> I think so.<a name=5:6></a> I do not think there would be any in the future having that status.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=5:8></a> Do you think that the teaching of the Holy Spirit here forms part of the great provision the Lord has for us?<a name=5:9></a> The Lord said, "Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe on God, believe also on me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:1">John  14:1</a>).<a name=5:10></a> In His service here, the Spirit is meeting the idea of restless hearts.<a name=5:11></a> It would set us at rest in regard to the realm of divine things.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:13></a> Yes, He would put everything right.<a name=5:14></a> The Lord is anticipating that, but He is doing it, too, while He is with them; He is telling them of greater things.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=5:16></a> The Lord said, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him"; that is divine manifestations to individuals.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:18></a> In the first reference to it we get the order, the love first.<a name=5:19></a> "If ye love me, keep my commandments".<a name=5:20></a> In the other one that you speak of the Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him".<a name=5:21></a> Verses 15 to 17 are the ones for us to dwell on now; what the Spirit is as among us, as secured by love and prayer; secured by the Lord's intercession for us.<a name=5:22></a> The Spirit has to be viewed by Himself first as worth having, and then there are the activities of the Son and the Father that the saints might have Him.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=5:24></a>M.<a name=5:25></a> The Spirit would require a realm of active love and obedience in which to operate.<a name=5:26></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:27></a> I think we want to get on to that.<a name=5:28></a> We are touching now the operational side, and the conditions for operations.<a name=5:29></a> The conditions must flow out from divine Persons, but can we not be brought into

		them?<a name=6:1></a> It is a question now of whether we desire this.<a name=6:2></a> The Lord makes the suggestion as to whether we desire these conditions, or are we content to be grovelling along to think little or nothing of them.<a name=6:3></a> The Lord is intimating that these conditions are there.<a name=6:4></a> "If ye love me, keep my commandments.<a name=6:5></a> And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you".<a name=6:6></a> The Lord is throwing it back on them, as it were, in an abstract way, saying these things are so and are attainable.<a name=6:7></a> What brings them about is indicated; that is, love.<a name=6:8></a> If there is not love for Christ, there is no value in talking about it at all.<a name=6:9></a> If there is not love for Christ, there is certainly none for the brethren; but if there be love for Christ, and then the keeping of the commandments, what will not the Lord do under those circumstances?<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.G.<a name=6:11></a>H.<a name=6:12></a> Does the word, "He abides with you, and shall be in you" suggest the Spirit's operations in the assembly?<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:14></a> That is the idea.<a name=6:15></a> He is going to operate, not simply with you, but in you, and that implies the assembly as an organism.<a name=6:16></a> So that the greatest possible operations are going on, and conditions are there for them too.<a name=6:17></a> Men are going on too, of course, and God is with them in mercy and we pray for them, but they have no part in this at all.<a name=6:18></a> It is an inner matter and belongs to the highest realm.<a name=6:19></a> The Lord is saying it is for us; it is a matter of prayer, love, and keeping the commandments.<a name=6:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=6:21></a> Would you say what these commandments would be for us?<a name=6:22></a>

		A.E.<a name=7:3></a>H.<a name=7:4></a> Would there be more spiritual character to these commandments than the commandments in 1 Corinthians, for instance?<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:6></a> I think we have to consider whence they come.<a name=7:7></a> Paul is giving them in 1 Corinthians and he is saying they are the Lord's.<a name=7:8></a> What he is giving, I think, is specified, but what is mentioned here is not specified.<a name=7:9></a> It is a question of what the Lord will give.<a name=7:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=7:11></a>H.<a name=7:12></a> I was thinking of certain things coming out in current ministry by the Spirit.<a name=7:13></a> Eventually they take the character of a commandment although we may not be able to find a verse.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:15></a> Well, I think we shall not get much help from the ministry unless we take up the specific ones stated by the apostle.<a name=7:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=7:17></a>H.<a name=7:18></a> I was thinking we might look for something more spiritual at the end than that.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:20></a> I do not think we shall get help unless we take up the specific ones, because we are apt to be too high in our attitude in what we call the ministry meeting or prophetic meeting.<a name=7:21></a> They are not quite as high, you know, as we think they are.<a name=7:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=7:23></a>H.<a name=7:24></a> Then perhaps we ought to look more at 1 Corinthians.<a name=7:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:26></a> I should certainly say that, to see what Paul has said.<a name=7:27></a> The Lord had certain things to say, but Paul says much more.<a name=7:28></a> It is a question of level.<a name=7:29></a> For instance, the Lord goes up to heaven Himself and gives gifts to men.<a name=7:30></a> What is the level there?<a name=7:31></a> He went beyond all the heavens we are told, and in Corinthians, what is the level there?<a name=7:32></a> It is not hard to see.<a name=7:33></a>

		A.P.<a name=7:34></a>T.<a name=7:35></a> It says in Acts the Holy Spirit is given to those who obey Him.<a name=7:36></a> Would that include all that you suggested?<a name=7:37></a>

		J.H.<a name=8:5></a>E.<a name=8:6></a> Would Rebecca help?<a name=8:7></a> After the presentation of the servant, the question was put, "Wilt thou go with this man?<a name=8:8></a> And she said, I will go" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:58">Genesis  24:58</a>).<a name=8:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=9:5></a> Well, it is a question of what there is.<a name=9:6></a> Of course, there is no doubt that each meeting might be measured, and that is what one was thinking, that there might be deliverance from all things that are interfering with the operations of the Spirit; so that there should be always a year of release, all complaints dealt with so that the brethren are released and happy together.<a name=9:7></a> Otherwise you do not get what is contemplated here.<a name=9:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=39:1></a> I believe we shall see that Luke contemplates a system governed by intelligence in man; lines of truth run through it showing that this intelligence is developed.<a name=39:2></a> It is a growth; hence angelic services are in such evidence here, but this chapter contemplates that there was want of intelligence.<a name=39:3></a> There ought to have been intelligence, meaning that the possibility of it was there.<a name=39:4></a> These women, for instance, are seen as acting unintelligently, but they are reminded of certain things that the Lord had said to them that they should have known, and indeed they had known but had forgotten.<a name=39:5></a> It says in verse 6, "He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day.<a name=39:6></a> And they remembered his words".<a name=39:7></a> That is to say, they had the intelligence, but had forgotten.<a name=39:8></a> There can be no doubt the Lord's supper is intended to keep us rightly intelligent, because there is a tendency to forget.<a name=39:9></a> Then another thing that helps on this line is the presence of men toward the end.<a name=39:10></a> Angelic service is in order at the beginning, but we have in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>, for instance, two men who were Moses and Elias appearing on the mount, and here in chapter 24, verse 4, we have two men.<a name=39:11></a> In the Acts, we also find two men, as if God had in mind in His counsels to make much of men, giving them pre-eminence even over angels; so although these are doubtless angels, they are not called angels.<a name=39:12></a> The idea of men is kept in mind both here and in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>.<a name=39:13></a> Then in this chapter we have two men, one of whom is not named, but they are called senseless which

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=40:19></a> Yes, I am thinking of that.<a name=40:20></a> The incident at Emmaus was not the Lord's supper, but was very like it, something that was to become established as a memorial.<a name=40:21></a> It is not to establish what the Roman Catholics speak of as the Eucharist, which is one kind, and is false, of course.<a name=40:22></a> The idea of one kind is to make way for the two kinds, that is, the bread and cup.<a name=40:23></a>

		supper from the Lord, which only confirms what we are saying, that it was necessary to have it at Corinth.<a name=41:1></a> There was a remarkable work of God at Corinth but there was apparent shallowness and that is usually accompanied by forgetfulness, so the apostle evidently uses great care in recording the matter in the first letter.<a name=41:2></a> The fact that it was needed is clearly shown in the conduct that arose in the assembly, most scandalous conditions really.<a name=41:3></a> They ate the Lord's supper and called it the Lord's supper, but Paul says it is not really that at all.<a name=41:4></a> They were despising the assembly in what they were doing.<a name=41:5></a> Evidently it furnishes the occasion for him to give the thing clearly, as we often have it in our meetings on Lord's day morning.<a name=41:6></a> We never tire of it because it is so accurate; the wording is only found in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>.<a name=41:7></a> Much as to it is found in the gospels, but it is carefully worded in this first epistle to the Corinthians in order to stress the idea of the memorial: "In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying.<a name=41:8></a> This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:25">1 Corinthians  11:25</a>.<a name=41:9></a> That is added in this epistle to enlarge the idea of a memorial.<a name=41:10></a>

		A.E.<a name=41:11></a>H.<a name=41:12></a> Is there any connection in your mind between this memorial in the Lord's supper, and what Jehovah says to Moses at the burning bush in regard to His name?<a name=41:13></a> "This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.<a name=41:14></a> Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I have indeed visited you" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3:15">Exodus  3:15</a>,16).<a name=41:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=42:7></a> Yes, and we sometimes find ourselves unable to go on to the heavenly side of things.<a name=42:8></a> The meeting is sometimes shallow and it is well to admit our weakness and God accepts us accordingly.<a name=42:9></a> So it says, "And if thou make me an altar of stone"(<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20:25">Exodus  20:25</a>) as if the Lord has left open whether we are equal to it.<a name=42:10></a> The 'if' is not attached to the idea of the altar of earth, because there can be no service at all without it.<a name=42:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=42:15></a> Therefore, the memorial in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3">Exodus  3</a>, you remember, is on a very high level.<a name=42:16></a> It is a question of the name of Jehovah involving really the mysterious name of Jah.<a name=42:17></a> That is the highest level in the Old Testament, I would think, where the service of God is introduced; that name is to be before them, and it is to be before them as a memorial.<a name=42:18></a> "This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3:15">Exodus  3:15</a>).<a name=42:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=58:1></a> There can be no doubt that this section is the culmination of the instruction which begins in the first chapter where we have the Babe, at least the Lord's birth, contemplated, and which involves His conception and birth in chapter 2 which we already noted, the suddenness with which the angel appeared and called attention to the sign involved in the birth of the Lord, and the reference to His condition in the manger which is peculiar to Luke.<a name=58:2></a> The instruction thus begun is followed up with the Lord's humanity, that is, His manhood, not simply babyhood, but manhood.<a name=58:3></a> The babyhood, boyhood, and manhood of Christ are contemplated in this account and there can be no doubt the Spirit of God intended that the link should be maintained with the whole account in the Scriptures, the whole testimony involving the manhood of Christ, His incarnation.<a name=58:4></a> What is said about Adam's creation and Eve's is to be noted, and then the reference later to humanity in the book of Leviticus, the birth of children, male and female, and how the incoming of children involved uncleanness, showing that the moral issue was raised; all that brings out the infinite holiness of the Lord's conception and birth.<a name=58:5></a> Luke has this in mind in calling attention, particularly in this chapter, to humanity as it is in Him.<a name=58:6></a> Hence it is said, "And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst".<a name=58:7></a> The Man is there in these extraordinary and peculiar circumstances, but still a Man; this points to what is to abide, that is, as to physical condition in the Lord.<a name=58:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=59:1></a> I think that is right.<a name=59:2></a> The infinite holiness of Christ's conception and birth are conveyed in the words, "that holy thing".<a name=59:3></a> In Paul's word, "Since otherwise indeed your children are unclean, but now they are holy" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:14">1 Corinthians  7:14</a>), holiness is predicated of the children of believing parents, but only in a provisional way, not intrinsically so; whereas Christ was intrinsically holy, so the word refers to what was substantial.<a name=59:4></a> "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>).<a name=59:5></a> That thought is intended to be fixed into our souls as to the humanity of Christ.<a name=59:6></a> We have much detail about the Lord; and in this the basis is laid for the humanity of believers, not simply as baptised or converted, but the whole physical condition of humanity in the believer, as it is to be eternally.<a name=59:7></a> It is clear that the subject of humanity in the Old Testament is initial, whereas the New Testament contemplates it as final; hence we are told of "his body of glory", and that we are to be transformed into conformity to it.<a name=59:8></a> Our body of humiliation is to be changed into the likeness of His body of glory.<a name=59:9></a> The use of the word 'glory', it would seem, is to bring out finality in the thing; that it is finished, and we are conformed to it.<a name=59:10></a>

		A.E.<a name=59:11></a>H.<a name=59:12></a> In the spiritual history of our souls it would seem as though we start with apprehending Christ as the Babe, holding to this idea of the holy thing, and then progress until we come to understand the full-grown man, Jesus Himself.<a name=59:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=59:14></a> Luke has that in mind and in our subject it links on with Paul.<a name=59:15></a> The idea of humanity as it is in Christ is developed in Paul's ministry and enters into the truth of the assembly, where we have the idea of male and female continued.<a name=59:16></a> Luke contemplates infancy.<a name=59:17></a> Matthew goes a little further.<a name=59:18></a> In the beginning he deals with the boy Jesus, but Luke begins with the thought of infancy.<a name=59:19></a> Even in regard of ordinary children Luke calls them infants.<a name=59:20></a> The

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=80:1></a> What was intimated at the outset was that Luke has a system of grace in mind with which the assembly is identified, and this chapter bears out the thought.<a name=80:2></a> The Lord is again seen here upon earth before His ascension so as to keep in mind manhood in Him, and so it is seen in its beautification of life, not simply in the basic thoughts of it which are most important.<a name=80:3></a> What an opportunity is given for examination of humanity according to God, to be used systematically in view of the testimony of God in a world-wide sense!<a name=80:4></a> Now we have Luke's point of view, but still with Jesus on earth, but risen and seen in life, presented indeed in life.<a name=80:5></a> So that our thoughts are, as it were, lifted to the beauty of life in Christ and that in operation, for operation is in mind in the system, not exactly what we shall have in eternity, but what is here in the Spirit; although we do not propose to look into the thought of the Spirit in the second chapter, but only to pursue the idea of humanity in the Lord as seen finally in this chapter.<a name=80:6></a> It was in mind to call attention, at the outset, to how early the thought of the Lord's ascension is seen in the gospel of Luke.<a name=80:7></a> The time of His receiving up is mentioned in chapter 9 confirming that there was haste, as it were, in reaching the position in heaven, the position contemplated.<a name=80:8></a> Peter later says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:21">Acts  3:21</a>, "Whom heaven indeed must receive".<a name=80:9></a> He is there, received, but carries on in view of the assembly, not in view of the prophetic feature of the testimony, but of the assembly; not in view of the millennium, but the assembly, and so there is the completion of the twelve, the administrative side of the position in the twelve apostles.<a name=80:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=121:16></a> Well, preaching is a gift and it is a gift involving power, peculiar power.<a name=121:17></a> While we are considering that point, there is also the charm of the Preacher, that is of the Lord Himself.<a name=121:18></a> Luke is particularly the preaching gospel.<a name=121:19></a> And then the teaching which also involves gift goes with that.<a name=121:20></a> That includes the opening up of the minds of the brethren as alluded to already, "Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures, and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:45">Luke  24:45</a> - 47).<a name=121:21></a> The operations of grace to save come out in preaching.<a name=121:22></a> The

		J.T.<a name=201:1></a> There are certain features that belong to the assembly that we might consider: the first is righteousness, which is in mind for this meeting; then sowing, leading up to the assembly, the formation of the assembly; and then the functioning of the assembly.<a name=201:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be understood that the theme is the assembly, but in a somewhat limited sense -- the assembly seen in Matthew, the only gospel in which it is found formally.<a name=201:3></a> It is thought that to get a true understanding of the assembly we would begin with Matthew.<a name=201:4></a> There will be other features, all in a limited way, as we remarked, such as chapter 13 in which we have the ministry of the kingdom of God, but the idea of sowing governs the chapter.<a name=201:5></a> And then it is hoped that we shall come to formation of the assemblies, to which these other scriptures are introductory.<a name=201:6></a> Formation begins properly in chapter 16, and then the idea of the function of the assembly is found in chapter 18.<a name=201:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=201:11></a> Righteousness is a great governing thought in the gospel of Matthew and we see it particularly expressed in chapter 3 in the verses read, in which the Lord, when He was baptised, came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptised of him.<a name=201:12></a> He was very definite.<a name=201:13></a> He did not come casually as many doubtless in different parts of that region came to the Jordan to be baptised of John.<a name=201:14></a> "Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him".<a name=201:15></a> It was very definite.<a name=201:16></a> John is the baptiser; and his protest was met by the Lord saying, "Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to

		J.T.<a name=203:5></a> It is said, "Now in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying.<a name=203:6></a> Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.<a name=203:7></a> For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, saying.<a name=203:8></a> Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.<a name=203:9></a> And John himself had his garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey.<a name=203:10></a> Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan, and were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:1">Matthew  3:1</a> - 6).<a name=203:11></a> I should think that opens up the matter: it had in view the "confessing their sins".<a name=203:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McK.<a name=203:13></a> With the Lord it would not be for confessing sins, nor merely an external matter; it was an inward matter, for He loved righteousness.<a name=203:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=203:15></a> He had joy in the service, and in John performing it in righteousness.<a name=203:16></a> Then in verse 7 it says, "But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he [John] said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath?<a name=203:17></a> Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance.<a name=203:18></a> And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.<a name=203:19></a> And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.<a name=203:20></a> <i>I</i> indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear; <i>he</i> shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire; whose

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=205:21></a> Confession of sins is a very real thing.<a name=205:22></a> Another matter that comes up in connection with all this is the matter of currency; what currency are we using in meeting our obligations?<a name=205:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.MacPh.<a name=205:24></a> I was thinking of it in relation to your remark about ecclesiastical righteousness.<a name=205:25></a> Practical righteousness has to be worked out practically in our souls before we arrive at that.<a name=205:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=205:30></a> Because there is such a thing as depreciated currency, and if it is used it has to be used at its market value.<a name=205:31></a> Hence, if I make confession of sins, for instance, ecclesiastical sins, what is the value of the confession?<a name=205:32></a> We are dealing with the currency of heaven.<a name=205:33></a> It is heaven that values repentance.<a name=205:34></a> There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repents.<a name=205:35></a>

		J.T.<a name=216:15></a> Well, we might look at the scripture that deals with this matter in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:1">2 Corinthians  8:1</a>,2, "But we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia; that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their free-hearted liberality", and so on (verses 1 - 15).<a name=216:16></a> And then again we have in the scripture in the passage in chapter 9:7, "each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.<a name=216:17></a> But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work: according as it is written.<a name=216:18></a> He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains for ever" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#9:7">2 Corinthians  9:7</a> - 9.<a name=216:19></a> That is the conclusion of this subject.<a name=216:20></a> It is a question of righteousness.<a name=216:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=223:1></a> Our subject is the assembly.<a name=223:2></a> We considered righteousness, which is an important feature in Matthew leading up to the assembly, and it is thought now that we should consider the sowing, then formation in the next meeting, and the assembly in function in the last reading.<a name=223:3></a> The scriptures read deal with the sowing.<a name=223:4></a> The closing verses from 51 to 58 call attention to the Lord's method of completing subjects in His ministry and, of course, He intends that we should learn from Him, from His example, so that the matter of sowing is finished, so to say, in this chapter and it is a subject that should now be touched in relation to the assembly.<a name=223:5></a> It is essential to the assembly.<a name=223:6></a> It is essential to the subject of the assembly.<a name=223:7></a> The subject of righteousness too, by itself, is essential to the matter of the assembly, as we saw last night.<a name=223:8></a> There are many other subordinate subjects which could be alluded to, but there is no time, because we are not pursuing the whole gospel of Matthew, but just taking up certain features of the assembly as mentioned.<a name=223:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject of sowing has a peculiar place, extending in the Scriptures to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8">Genesis  8</a>and entering in peculiarly to the provisional period of the earth's existence.<a name=223:10></a> It is said, "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>).<a name=223:11></a> It is to continue.<a name=223:12></a> So that sowing is a feature of the provisional period of the earth as it is.<a name=223:13></a> Presently we will have a new earth and new heaven; but the learning time is in the first earth and the first heaven, according to the hymn we sang in which we said that the Lord is Head of creation -- not the new creation but the present one.<a name=223:14></a> His great provisional

		position is in view of the working out of the truth of the assembly, and then the working out with Israel too, and the continuance of the nations in testimony; and then there will be change.<a name=224:1></a> In the meantime it is a provisional period, the learning period, and in order to have things for God there must be sowing, otherwise there will be sterility or such conditions which would hardly be controlled.<a name=224:2></a> The seed time and harvest show that God is continuing to provide for suitable seed to be sown and grown, and all this leads up to the thought of the assembly and enters into the truth of it.<a name=224:3></a> So we have in the verses read at the beginning of the chapter: "And that same day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea", alluding to the nations.<a name=224:4></a> Having left the Jewish position, He took up a position in relation to the nations as the great sphere of His sowing.<a name=224:5></a> "And great crowds were gathered together to him, so that going on board ship himself he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.<a name=224:6></a> And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow: and as he sowed, some grains fell along the way, and the birds came and devoured them"; and so the passage runs on until we come to the positive result of the sowing: "And others fell upon the good ground, and produced fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.<a name=224:7></a> He that has ears, let him hear".<a name=224:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=247:1></a> Well, just so; which would point to Asia and the part that Europe had in Asia.<a name=247:2></a> The early assembly developed from Jerusalem, carrying with it the metropolitan idea, so the assembly is alluded to in the singular in the Acts right up to chapter 9, and even then it is questionable that the full thought of assemblies (in the plural) was known.<a name=247:3></a> It awaited Paul's ministry, and it is he and Barnabas who selected elders in each city, so that the assembly should be self-contained, as it were.<a name=247:4></a> We have in Thessalonica, which is distinctly a Pauline assembly, an allusion to the fact that they took their pattern from the assemblies in Judaea.<a name=247:5></a> The brethren will remember that.<a name=247:6></a> It is in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:14">1 Thessalonians  2:14</a> -- "For <i>ye</i> , brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus".<a name=247:7></a> It is remarkable that Europe should look eastward in the early ministry of the testimony through Paul.<a name=247:8></a> It would be like dwelling in the tents of Shem, but eventually we know that those who were brought in through Paul's great work in Asia turned away.<a name=247:9></a> "Thou knowest this, that all who are in Asia .<a name=247:10></a>.<a name=247:11></a>.<a name=247:12></a> have turned away from me", (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>).<a name=247:13></a> This included the seven assemblies.<a name=247:14></a> So gradually there is a falling away from Shem and little or nothing through Paul after that in the east; the movement is towards the west.<a name=247:15></a> It is the earth of Japheth that takes in the different assemblies.<a name=247:16></a> We have to deal with geography in these matters.<a name=247:17></a> "The earth is Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof",(<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#24:1">Psalm  24:1</a>).<a name=247:18></a> And He does with it what pleases Him, and He was not pleased to turn east much after the assembly at Jerusalem.<a name=247:19></a> The movement was westward and it is westward still.<a name=247:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.G.<a name=247:21></a>McA.<a name=247:22></a> That is seen in the fact that the assembly is composed chiefly now of gentiles.<a name=247:23></a> There are not many Jews.<a name=247:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=269:1></a> I think we shall see the great pleasure that the Lord has at a time like this.<a name=269:2></a> There is a certain likeness in Adam's position in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>; what pleasure God had in him as functioning according to the wisdom he had.<a name=269:3></a> So that it is said, "And .<a name=269:4></a>.<a name=269:5></a>.<a name=269:6></a> .<a name=269:7></a> Jehovah Elohim .<a name=269:8></a>.<a name=269:9></a>.<a name=269:10></a> brought them to Man, to see what he would call them" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:19">Genesis  2:19</a>.<a name=269:11></a> The comparison that we are making is with what the Lord finds in the assembly in its service, in its functioning here; earlier allusion was made to the pearl, what pleasure He had in it, and the treasure too; whatever the treasure was, it affords joy to the Lord.<a name=269:12></a> The comparison that is being made is in verse 15 of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, "And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:15">Genesis  2:15</a>.<a name=269:13></a> And in verse 18 it says, "And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a help-mate, his like" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>.<a name=269:14></a> And then, "And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought them to Man, to see what he would call them" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:19">Genesis  2:19</a>.<a name=269:15></a> What God was to see in Adam's movements and words!<a name=269:16></a> as if God would find pleasure in what He could see and hear.<a name=269:17></a> "And whatever Man called each living soul, that was its name" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:19">Genesis  2:19</a>.<a name=269:18></a> So, it seems to me that this enters into our subject this afternoon, that is to say, the subject of the assembly, the assembly actually functioning for the Lord here, what there is in it for Him.<a name=269:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.C.<a name=269:20></a>T.<a name=269:21></a> Then according to Scripture and the thought in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, the movements that take place in the assembly would be recognised in heaven.<a name=269:22></a>

		R.W.<a name=270:8></a>S.<a name=270:9></a> Would it be in line to inquire if there is not a great deal of disparity in assembly administration as to the standards of it here and the concrete working out of it amongst us?<a name=270:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=270:11></a> That is a good inquiry.<a name=270:12></a> I think we should just perhaps go into that matter now, only it is thought that the earlier verses read, that is, in chapter 17, ought to be before us so that we may be able to rightly judge, be in a right spirit to gauge what the assembly's action may mean; and, therefore, the scene on the mount is surely intended to affect us as to dignity and glory.<a name=270:13></a> The very persons that are involved in chapter 18 are now seen above, and surely it is intended that they should be affected and when they come down know how to gauge aright what is said and done by the assembly.<a name=270:14></a> And then again in the end of chapter 17, this matter of sonship is not above; it is not seen above; it is seen in Capernaum, and it is a matter of taxes, of a certain tax that the Jews had to pay to the temple; and the Lord in taking this matter up waits until Peter came into the house before speaking of it, which is a characteristic idea in Matthew: that there is something in the house leading up to the assembly which gives liberty to the oracle; to whatever is in the

		A.S.<a name=271:4></a>B.<a name=271:5></a> You referred this morning to chapter 14 in relation to the feeding, that the Lord looked up into heaven in the first instance; in the second it is rather what is available by the Spirit on earth.<a name=271:6></a> So in chapter 16 in regard to revelation, the initial movement is from heaven and then the Lord joins in with that, and so here it is the heavenly side preceding the earthly side.<a name=271:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=271:8></a> It is the heavenly side in the mount of transfiguration where Christ is honoured and glorified, and the earthly side in Capernaum where taxes are to be paid, and the question is raised as to who should pay them; whether the brethren are exempt in such cases or whether they may not or should not pay them rather than cause offence.<a name=271:9></a> The matter is trivial anyway, and it is a question of how the brethren may, in the dignity of the mount of transfiguration, be ready to adjust a small matter, the small claim that the government may put forth and meet it that way.<a name=271:10></a>

		I have in mind to speak about teaching, and I selected these Scriptures because they give examples of it, of persons who needed teaching and accepted it and became taught in the Scriptures, in the truth of Christianity.<a name=292:1></a> I have selected chapter 19 to speak of persons who are evidently untaught.<a name=292:2></a> You will observe that the apostle, who was in the full height of his ministry at this time, had been up to Jerusalem and came back to Ephesus by the upper quarters, and finding these men in Ephesus he made inquiry as to whether they had received the Holy Spirit since they had believed.<a name=292:3></a> You will observe that no such question was asked of Apollos.<a name=292:4></a> The apostle asked the question of these twelve persons: had they received the Holy Spirit since they believed?<a name=292:5></a> Instead of saying as we often do, 'Yes' or 'No', and perhaps truthfully (it ought to be truthfully), the twelve men said, "We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come".<a name=292:6></a> Now I would say that is inexcusable ignorance.<a name=292:7></a> Most of us are ignorant, some more and some less.<a name=292:8></a> Indeed, all are more or less ignorant, but if anyone of those accustomed to attending meetings in this room in this city, should say that he did not know there was any Holy Spirit, I would say that brother would be inexcusably ignorant, and that he would be one who could not possibly, on these current lines, progress in the truth.<a name=292:9></a> It might even be an ignorance linked with the denial of the Spirit as a divine Person, for it is just possible that such ignorance may possess us.<a name=292:10></a> They were baptised, but it was a discarded sort of baptism.<a name=292:11></a> The writer of the Hebrews speaks about the doctrine of baptisms.<a name=292:12></a> We are more likely to talk about the doctrine than the thing, but the thing is more important.<a name=292:13></a> So they were baptised according to John the baptist.<a name=292:14></a> John was cut off in his ministry.<a name=292:15></a> He had wrought wonderfully.<a name=292:16></a>

		I have had a desire since coming here to speak a word as to Colossians.<a name=346:1></a> It is a peculiar epistle treating of Christ among the gentiles; "Christ in you" (as among the gentiles) "the hope of glory".<a name=346:2></a> It is somewhat like Joseph in Egypt, typical of Christ, separated from his brethren.<a name=346:3></a> So it is that Colossians is Christ seen among the gentiles; peculiarly, of course, bearing on ourselves and having in mind what is said in verse 27 of chapter 1, "To whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory".<a name=346:4></a> That is, Christ among the gentiles.<a name=346:5></a> As Paul once said, "Lo, we turn to the nations" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:46">Acts  13:46</a>).<a name=346:6></a> The salvation of God is sent to the gentiles and they will receive it; a comforting word for us: they will receive it.<a name=346:7></a> We cannot just say that now, for much has elapsed since, but the gentiles have received the gospel, the salvation of God.<a name=346:8></a> The Colossians, for instance, had received it, but many have given it up since, the apostasy having set in, so that we cannot with much confidence say of any section of the gentile world now that they will receive the salvation of God, but the apostle could speak of the dispensation in that sense: they will receive it.<a name=346:9></a> This epistle shows what was in mind: that Christ should be among the gentiles, and that as among them, the ministry would be there, and the toil or labour of the apostle was to present every man perfect in Christ; a very great thought: to present every man perfect in Christ.<a name=346:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a challenge as to whether we belong in this late day to the gentile world that <i>has</i> received the salvation of God.<a name=346:11></a> There is an opportunity for some who may have neglected it even since yesterday,

		that you should receive the salvation of God which is sent, which is among us.<a name=347:1></a> One would love to have this feeling, that one had some little result in endeavouring to present the glad tidings, because it is no less than that.<a name=347:2></a> What has been before us would make up our minds as to this great matter of the gentile world, and how they at the beginning were regarded by the great apostle that they would receive the salvation of God; they would receive it.<a name=347:3></a> One has no doubt that during these holidays a good many will be affected.<a name=347:4></a> We thank God for these holidays.<a name=347:5></a> We call them holidays, but really they become holy days to us.<a name=347:6></a> During these three days here in Chicago in the midst of this terrible city, one of the worst in the world, that there should be a company of holy people is a very great matter; a very great matter to heaven; and our thought now is that there should be an increase, that something should be accomplished in a turning of heart, with a view to the presenting of someone perfect in Christ, not simply perfect, but perfect in Christ.<a name=347:7></a> That is a qualifying word, which belongs, as we might say, to a higher presentation of the truth, that persons are not only secured, but in Christ.<a name=347:8></a>

		Well now, what has been in my mind, too, is to connect what I have to say with the idea of completeness.<a name=347:9></a> It is found in these three passages that I have read: "the assembly; of which <i>I</i> became minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given me towards you to complete the word of God", or 'fill out'.<a name=347:10></a> I refer to this to begin with.<a name=347:11></a> It is a proper beginning, too, of the subject, that the word of God has been filled out.<a name=347:12></a> The word of God began, of course, to be spoken as early as <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, and it was being spoken ever since, but not completed, not filled out -- very far from being filled out - in Old Testament times; and, of course, I need not say that the completion of the letter of the Scriptures

	<div class="paragraph">
		was very gradual, I mean, the Old Testament Scriptures.<a name=348:1></a> However much there was was to be regarded as Scripture, for "every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>); so even in Old Testament times it was profitable.<a name=348:2></a> It is more so now, for not only is it added to, it is complete.<a name=348:3></a> That is Paul's assertion here, and it is of value to us because we are living in times of great looseness.<a name=348:4></a> Persons who would assume to know, such as teaching people -- college people, high school people and grammar school people are apt to say things very loosely -- are apt to say very untrue things about the Holy Scriptures, some of them going so far as to say that certain parts of the Scriptures are not inspired.<a name=348:5></a> Therefore the importance, dear brethren, of having our loins girded about with truth, meaning that our thoughts are not to flow loosely.<a name=348:6></a> When talking to people, it may be, in the workshop or in the store or in the school or in the train or in the bus, we are not to be speaking loosely of things so that we find ourselves speaking untruths, speaking lies.<a name=348:7></a> Very easily we may slip into it, and hence the great importance of having our loins girded about with truth, so that our thoughts do not flow loosely.<a name=348:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I believe Colossians is a tightening-up epistle; you will understand what I endeavour to say.<a name=348:9></a> It may be in regard of morals, domestic relations, and many other such things that need tightening up, girding.<a name=348:10></a> And so in regard to this matter of the word of God, let us put our seal to it in saying that it is complete.<a name=348:11></a> We set to our seal that God is true, but also that the word of God is complete.<a name=348:12></a> The Old Testament did not contain the completeness; it contained much, and the Spirit of God was not in a very great hurry -- I use that word 'hurry' rightly -- to begin writing the New Testament.<a name=348:13></a> There was no

		New Testament to appeal to in the early chapters of the Acts, but nevertheless time was taken in heaven and on earth.<a name=349:1></a> Scribes began to work under God, to set out the mind of God in writing in what are called 'the holy writings'.<a name=349:2></a> The Spirit of God began to do that, but not in any great hurry.<a name=349:3></a> The principle was the <i>doing</i> first; what kind of work should develop in Christianity, and then to write down an account of it.<a name=349:4></a> We read of good works, too, that were ordained before that we should walk in them -- a most important matter.<a name=349:5></a> And then that they should be written down.<a name=349:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have the epistles, particularly those of Paul, and we see how he selected what to write and to whom to write.<a name=349:7></a> I say 'selected' because it is evident that they were selected; he decided to write to the Thessalonians, probably his first epistle.<a name=349:8></a> Well, he had great pleasure, it is quite evident, in writing that epistle.<a name=349:9></a> He styles it, "To the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father"(<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:1">1 Thessalonians  1:1</a>).<a name=349:10></a> What a lovely group they were, and what a lovely term used: "in God the Father".<a name=349:11></a> It is not "in Christ" now.<a name=349:12></a> I have already spoken of "in Christ" but here it is "in God the Father".<a name=349:13></a> Surely there was something peculiar, dear brethren, in that epistle.<a name=349:14></a> But then in time Paul selected to write to the Colossians, and I have read from the epistle to the Colossians.<a name=349:15></a> He had never seen the Colossians, he tells us, a remarkable thing too; the doctrine is so profound, dealing with the Person of Christ.<a name=349:16></a> Colosse was not very far away from the well-known church of Laodicea.<a name=349:17></a> We have not a record of the epistle to the Laodiceans, but there was one; in the one to Colosse we have four chapters.<a name=349:18></a> Paul had not known the Colossians, and, of course, we might say in speaking of ourselves, Paul has not known us and yet his epistles speak to us.<a name=349:19></a> They are our stock in trade, to speak reverently.<a name=349:20></a> They are final, authoritative words; words containing

		completion, too, of subjects and particularly this one which speaks of the completion of the word of God.<a name=350:1></a> Paul had not known them, and it is a word, dear brethren, for us as to being ourselves in the place of the Colossians and seeing how an epistle from Paul would affect us even now.<a name=350:2></a> He had never seen them and, of course, he has not seen us, but it is well to compare and see how things worked out as to epistles and the effect of them.<a name=350:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So he says to them, "Rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:5">Colossians  2:5</a>).<a name=350:4></a> He had joy in the knowledge of the Colossians; they had order.<a name=350:5></a> What a word it is now.<a name=350:6></a> There is so much disorder.<a name=350:7></a> Even with the Corinthians there was disorder, but not among the Colossians; that is a very important matter to note; and, dear brethren, a very important matter to note as to ourselves that we are walking orderly, that we are not marked by disorder in our services, in our incomings and outgoings among the people of God.<a name=350:8></a> Heaven is looking on, because that is really what is implied in what Paul says: "Rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ"(<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:5">Colossians  2:5</a>).<a name=350:9></a> That is what he could say of them; a very real pleasure to him.<a name=350:10></a> One often thinks of it as one is sitting down with the brethren at the Lord's supper, because the Lord's supper is the beginning of the service of God.<a name=350:11></a> Every Lord's day begins the service of God; and Paul, although not having been there, could discern, for he had a remarkable outlook.<a name=350:12></a> He said to the Corinthians, "Ye and my spirit being gathered together"(<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:4">1 Corinthians  5:4</a>), for discipline and yet he was not there, showing what an advantage the early Christians had in Paul.<a name=350:13></a>

		He wrote thus in order to say, perhaps, things that would not be so pleasant to the ear; and so we have such words as 'combating'.<a name=351:1></a> The dear servant "who is one of you", he says, named Epaphras; a beloved servant, Paul says; he singled him out, he was one of the Colossians, and one of the things he said about him was, "combating earnestly for you".<a name=351:2></a> And what was he combating for?<a name=351:3></a> That they might stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.<a name=351:4></a> This word 'combating' implies that in that assembly the enemy had certain opportunities and advantages so that the apostle Paul had to clothe himself with armour.<a name=351:5></a> He speaks of combating for them in regard to the knowledge of the mystery.<a name=351:6></a> He was combating in his own soul that these dear people, whom he had never seen, should be set up in the knowledge of the mystery of God, in which were hid then and are hid now all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, but he had to combat; it is a remarkable word.<a name=351:7></a> Yet they were lovely Christians.<a name=351:8></a> One could see that outwardly anyway.<a name=351:9></a>

		The apostle could say, "Rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ",(<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:5">Colossians  2:5</a>) and yet they were in danger from the devil; he was allowed too close to them.<a name=351:10></a> That is what I am speaking about now.<a name=351:11></a> It is what I had in mind to speak about, that the devil should not be allowed to come into close quarters.<a name=351:12></a> It is too dangerous.<a name=351:13></a> They were allowing that and Paul had to combat for them, to agonise, as it were, in combat against the devil.<a name=351:14></a> It was a critical time for the Colossians, and it may be a critical time for some here.<a name=351:15></a> We have been hearing of the assembly, but then, has the devil any room to get in to oppose what has been brought forward?<a name=351:16></a> And so the need, dear brethren, of going home, as we shall, no doubt, tonight or tomorrow, God willing, and getting on our knees.<a name=351:17></a> It is a praying time now.<a name=351:18></a> Presently the ministry time for this season

		say that what I am reading of here -- the completion of the word of God, is just all written.<a name=353:1></a> It is not only a question of writing; it is a question of the mind of God being revealed, but in words in some sense.<a name=353:2></a> The completion of the word -- it is the word of God; if from God, it is the word; even if it be not written.<a name=353:3></a> "Who hath made man's mouth?<a name=353:4></a>"(<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:11">Exodus  4:11</a>), God.<a name=353:5></a> The most wonderful thing in God's whole creation is man's mouth, and it is through that mouth that the word of God comes.<a name=353:6></a> First from God Himself through some agency, but particularly, dear brethren, and reverently do I say it, through the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is called the Word of God.<a name=353:7></a> That is what He is called.<a name=353:8></a> It is one of His titles.<a name=353:9></a> His Name is called the Word of God, and that means He has spoken; the Lord has spoken what is in the mind of God, and it has been completed.<a name=353:10></a> What God intends to unfold to us is completed; nothing is to be added to it.<a name=353:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say that nothing was added after this immediate time when this epistle was written.<a name=353:12></a> All John's writings were probably added, but the idea of 'complete' here is the working out of the thing, the fulness of the thing, the idea of the thing in its fulness.<a name=353:13></a> That is the idea, that Paul completed the word in that sense, and now it can be said to be absolutely so, and there are not even any additions verbally, I mean, in writing.<a name=353:14></a> All is now finished; and hence the certainty that we may have, dear brethren, as to all matters in the word of God; not simply the letter of Scripture, but the word of God.<a name=353:15></a> "For the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:12">Hebrews  4:12</a>.<a name=353:16></a> It is the word of God; nothing is concealed from it.<a name=353:17></a> "And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things are

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I am speaking thus so that the brethren will be on their guard as to Scripture, as to what we are going on with in our Bible readings and in our private readings, for we are enjoined to give attention to reading, and in our public readings such as we have had here, so that everything that is said imparts the idea of completion in what our blessed God has furnished us.<a name=354:5></a> His mind is disclosed to us.<a name=354:6></a> He loves to have us pursue the meditation of it, as it is said, "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another",(<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a>).<a name=354:7></a> What were they speaking of?<a name=354:8></a> We are not told, but can you doubt it was a question of what was revealed in the Scripture?<a name=354:9></a> "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.<a name=354:10></a> And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure",(<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a>,17).<a name=354:11></a> What a thought that is for us.<a name=354:12></a> We become the veritable property of God through this way of reading His word and attending to it, comparing spiritual with spiritual, and thus persons known to heaven and reflective of what is in heaven -- our names being written up there.<a name=354:13></a> And the Lord says, "I will write upon him my new name" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:12">Revelation  3:12</a>), a most precious thought, all indicative of what the saints are as taking up the word; as the Lord says to Philadelphia, "Thou .<a name=354:14></a>.<a name=354:15></a>.<a name=354:16></a> hast kept my word, and

		Well now, I pass on to the second scripture which is in the second chapter.<a name=355:2></a> It is a question of the completeness of the saints; "ye are complete in him".<a name=355:3></a> Now, if you follow me, I have been speaking about the completeness of the word of God; now I am speaking about the completeness of the saints.<a name=355:4></a> How very seldom can we speak of each other, and say such-and-such a brother is complete.<a name=355:5></a> Well, who is complete?<a name=355:6></a> That is the question.<a name=355:7></a> The apostle here says, "Ye are complete in him".<a name=355:8></a> Let us analyse it for a moment.<a name=355:9></a> "See that there be no one who shall lead <i>you</i> away as a prey" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:8">Colossians  2:8</a>).<a name=355:10></a> Remember, I have been speaking of the devil and the combat that came in because he came in, the combat of Paul and Epaphras, that the truth should stand with the Colossians.<a name=355:11></a> Now here he says, "See that there be no one who shall lead <i>you</i> away as a prey through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the teaching of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.<a name=355:12></a> For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"(<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:8">Colossians  2:8</a>,9).<a name=355:13></a> We have the other scripture in chapter 1 where it is said that "in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell"(<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:19">Colossians  1:19</a>).<a name=355:14></a> What is said in chapter 2 is in addition to that.<a name=355:15></a> You can see how the idea of the fulness of God is brought to us.<a name=355:16></a> It was brought to the early Christians and is brought to us now.<a name=355:17></a> There is nothing at all short of deity in Christ.<a name=355:18></a> Paul says, The fulness now dwells in Christ bodily; within the compass of a blessed Man, within that compass the whole thought of God was really there.<a name=355:19></a> All the fulness dwells in Him bodily.<a name=355:20></a> That is, you could locate it, because it was in that Man, described to us in the Scriptures, the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=355:21></a> In that Person, and within the compass of His Person, all the fulness

		And so, as I said a minute ago, how little we hear of the thought that such-and-such a brother is complete; one who conveys the characteristics of a complete person, complete towards God.<a name=356:11></a> So it says, "And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and authority", so that heaven looks down on us, and sees what we are as in Christ, taken up in Christ.<a name=356:12></a> What He is from God towards us is one thing, but what we are in Him towards God is another thing; and that we are complete towards God, that there is nothing missing.<a name=356:13></a> One may say there is a good deal missing in me, and of course, I would acquiesce in that and refer to myself too, but still I would insist on this idea of completeness, viewing ourselves as in Christ and involving the Spirit.<a name=356:14></a> It is only in the Spirit that we are in Christ, and involved in our having the Spirit is that we are complete in Christ Godward; and that enables us to have part in the service of God.<a name=356:15></a> There is nothing

		And then, finally, there are the exercises of Epaphras in the verse read in chapter 4:12: "Epaphras, who is one of you, the bondman of Christ Jesus, salutes you".<a name=357:4></a> We have had him before in chapter 1, and there can be no doubt that he gave Paul a clue as to what was needed at Colosse.<a name=357:5></a> Paul had not been there but Epaphras had been there and was there, and Paul could quote him.<a name=357:6></a> No doubt he was one that he had derived information from as regards the work of God at Colosse, and how important it is.<a name=357:7></a> We have had at these meetings our brethren who are placed here and there in localities, sown, as it were, in their places, so as to look after the interests of Christ.<a name=357:8></a> So here is a brother called Epaphras, a worthy man, beautifully spoken of in chapter 1, and so here, one who could be entrusted with the interests of Christ at Colosse.<a name=357:9></a> Paul had not been there, but he knew what was there from the information that Epaphras could give him, and, of course, from the intuition that he, as a great apostle, had by the Spirit.<a name=357:10></a> He speaks of such things as no other one does: "Rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ".<a name=357:11></a> So that Paul had a full account.<a name=357:12></a> He could, as it were, make a picture and visualise that the order was going on at Colosse when the service of God began on the first day in any week; he could picture what was there: "rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:5">Colossians  2:5</a>).<a name=357:13></a> But what sad thoughts they would realise, when the apostle thought of philosophy and vain deceit.<a name=357:14></a> Some young people in the meeting possibly were reading

		Another feature is referred to in chapter 2, the handwriting in ordinances, saying, "Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize, doing his own will in humility and worship of angels, entering into things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh, and not holding fast the head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:18">Colossians  2:18</a>,19).<a name=358:6></a> So we have further, "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch"(<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:21">Colossians  2:21</a>).<a name=358:7></a> That is the legalist; an attempt was being made to introduce that legalism among the Galatians and so here.<a name=358:8></a> The apostle is working against it, combating against it, that the saints might be preserved from it.<a name=358:9></a> And so it is, dear brethren, any legality, any intenseness of religiousness according to man, according to the flesh, is to be avoided, for in the end it will damage if we admit of it.<a name=358:10></a> "Stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage".<a name=358:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:1">Galatians  5:1</a>).<a name=358:12></a>

		Chapter 2 begins with what is priestly; "first of all" indicating there is something to be first, that is we are thinking of men in regard to the general position, feeling for them, for it is "supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men"; the full priestly thought is in mind.<a name=467:8></a> With that, of course, is the great thought of sonship alongside the priesthood.<a name=467:9></a> It does not come up here but it is well to think about it because priesthood and sonship go together.<a name=467:10></a> Priesthood is the great preservative amongst us in regard to everything.<a name=467:11></a> In Deuteronomy the priests have the last word about everything.<a name=467:12></a> All this helps us in view of the present time, because priesthood is not local in that sense -- it is universal.<a name=467:13></a> We have to think about the position as priests, and see everything according to that point of view, so that the saints are responsible in regard to everything that happens in the assembly, whether it be local or universal.<a name=467:14></a> We are to see that everything

		The matter of the priests and elders saying the same thing was introduced and we observed in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:5">Deuteronomy  21:5</a>, "And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near"; it was stressed that there should be no divergence in the speaking of the local elders and the universal priests.<a name=469:2></a> If there is a divergence it is a question of how the truth has been apprehended, but if there is patience and a waiting on God He will reveal His truth.<a name=469:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The seriousness of one local company interfering with another local company came up at this point, and we were impressed with the Lord's jealousy of His rights in each locality, noting the Lord's separate word to each of the seven assemblies in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3, and also, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>).<a name=469:4></a> Flowing out of this we were helped to see that in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>it is not a question of repentance, but of the offender "being such" and "him that has so wrought this".<a name=469:5></a> It was a matter of public wickedness.<a name=469:6></a> Here a helpful suggestion was made that, while many matters such as "some fault" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:1">Galatians  6:1</a>) can be 'mended' privately, others involve the one, two, three of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, while certain cases in which <i>the Lord's name</i> has been dishonoured must come under <i>assembly discipline</i> .<a name=469:7></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>, nothing is said about repentance but "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a>.<a name=469:8></a>

		We have the "assembly of God" and the "assembly of the living God", chapter 3:5,15, and we saw Timothy's relation to the assembly, first in regard to the care of it, and then in regard to his conduct in it.<a name=471:8></a> We referred to the last paragraph of chapter 2, which is very instructive about the whole matter, because it is a question of men and women; that is, "Men pray in every place" and "In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:8">1 Timothy  2:8</a>,9.<a name=471:9></a> Then woman is not to exercise authority over man -- an allusion to the fact that <i>the assembly is not to exercise authority other than what the Lord has committed to her</i> .<a name=471:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The allusion to men praying brought up the service of young men, whether they are filling out their part sufficiently.<a name=472:7></a> We were reminded that Timothy, though a young man, was a man of God and was given a charge.<a name=472:8></a> This should normally exercise each of our young men as being right on moral lines to enquire of himself if he has received a charge.<a name=472:9></a> It will be seen that a practical line came before us here, in relation not only to young men but to the dress of women -- that it is to be seemly, not extreme or conspicuous.<a name=472:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We spent some time on chapter 3, our brother calling attention to the high standard which becomes this section because, as he said, <i>the assembly of God</i> is in mind, and Paul never fails to impress us with the greatness of this vessel.<a name=472:11></a> We rested on the word 'irreproachable', searching ourselves whether this could be said of any one of us -- not one thing against him.<a name=472:12></a> Running down the list, while not minimising this faithful word of Paul, we were reminded that we are in 2 Timothy conditions, and if this scripture were insisted on to the letter, almost all of us would be disqualified from overseership.<a name=472:13></a> Enosh, whose name means, 'Man, as weak, mortal' was mentioned, but the scripture continues, "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:26">Genesis  4:26</a>.<a name=472:14></a>

		Verse 5 was considered -- how one who aspires to oversight conducts his own house.<a name=473:1></a> Is a brother disqualified if a member of his family has been withdrawn from or is not in fellowship?<a name=473:2></a> It was said that if the head of the house asserts his authority and maintains right principles in the home he is not disqualified -- he takes issue about things.<a name=473:3></a> Eli was mentioned as one who was disqualified, "because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#3:13">1 Samuel  3:13</a>.<a name=473:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Further enquiry was made as to an unmarried brother with no household.<a name=473:5></a> It was observed that Paul was unmarried, with no household, and we were reminded that in 2 Timothy days Paul says to Timothy, "Do the work of an evangelist", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:5">2 Timothy  4:5</a>.<a name=473:6></a> The need for skill in doing things in the assembly was mentioned, that while 'elder' would literally allude to one who is older yet the Lord would help any one of us to arrive at eldership rapidly by having the basic quality of love.<a name=473:7></a> We observed that David lowered the age of the Levites from thirty to twenty (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#23:27">1 Chronicles  23:27</a>).<a name=473:8></a> This would suggest ten years of learning before they entered upon their full levitical service.<a name=473:9></a> There is no thought of only one elder being in a city -- it is plural, and the 'know-how' mentioned twice in this chapter has its application especially in days of difficulty, and when there is trouble in the local setting.<a name=473:10></a>

		We were warned that fleshly leadership may come into a local assembly and shut out what is of Christ and of the Spirit.<a name=473:11></a> There must be room for the Spirit to speak in each assembly -- the Lord is very jealous over every local position, "there am I", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>.<a name=473:12></a> "The pillar and base of the truth" works out locally.<a name=473:13></a>

		We spent much time with great profit on the mystery (verse 16), the order of man -- God, manifest in flesh, or as the note says it probably should read, 'He who has been manifested in flesh', how the Lord Jesus was here amongst men, how God was seen for the first time by angels, bringing up the early part of Luke's gospel and the need of having holy thoughts as to the incarnation.<a name=474:8></a> 'He who has' was no less than Christ, no less than God, and we rested on many beautiful sections of <a href="../bible/2John.htm#1:7">2 John  1:7</a>, "Jesus Christ coming in flesh", is that order of manhood.<a name=474:9></a> This chapter was said to reach a wonderful conclusion, for chapter 4 goes on to speak of the Spirit speaking expressly, and we were profoundly affected as we went over verse 16, reading it several times, "And confessedly the mystery of piety is great.<a name=474:10></a> God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory".<a name=474:11></a> Justification in Spirit was said to be seen by the way the Lord did things, and as the Spirit is here everything as to Christ is justified now.<a name=474:12></a> Mephibosheth was introduced as one who was never entirely cleared by David, for David was not right about him,

		Now I go on to 1 Samuel, to speak of David, not to bring him out as a type of Christ, exactly, but as a type of any of us as coming under the eye of God in loveliness.<a name=496:10></a> At first, perhaps, others may not know it; perhaps we do not know it ourselves, but then it becomes an open matter, God honouring us by some way that He has planned, so that His mind about us is unmistakable.<a name=496:11></a> But before touching David, I must say something about the Lord Jesus in this respect.<a name=496:12></a> I have referred to how the saints regard Him, and I think what should be noted particularly are the reasons for His lovableness that are given by the lover of Christ, typified in the Song of Songs -- how intelligently her thoughts of His personal glories are expressed.<a name=496:13></a> But then there is the Lord Himself, as under God's eye in all His lovableness, as seen in the gospels.<a name=496:14></a> So that before speaking of what is lovable, it would hardly be right not first to speak of Jesus; not only as we see Him, but as God saw Him in manhood here.<a name=496:15></a> What history has been made in heaven!<a name=496:16></a> Perhaps some of us have not thought that

		Well now, Daniel is on that line; his prayer in the early part of the chapter is beautifully worded; I would urge every one here to read it.<a name=503:12></a> Gabriel told him that "at the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth".<a name=503:13></a> Now what did Daniel have in mind when he prayed?<a name=503:14></a> He had something definite in mind, which he had learnt from books -- hence the importance of reading, and getting the mind of God.<a name=503:15></a> Evidently he wanted to know what the mind of God was as to His people and His holy city; and God sent Gabriel to tell him, and in doing it he says, "Thou art one greatly beloved".<a name=503:16></a> Now that is what I wanted to come to.<a name=503:17></a> Daniel was beloved always, I believe, even when he ruled under Nebuchadnezzar and Darius.<a name=503:18></a> One of the earliest things said about Daniel is that he "continued unto the first year of king Cyrus" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#1:21">Daniel  1:21</a>): God saw to that; he must have been an old man, but God was pleased with him from the

		I want to show now from <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>how Christ came into the woman spoken of there.<a name=516:5></a> She had had five husbands!<a name=516:6></a> That is her history, and the one she then had was not her husband.<a name=516:7></a> You can see how far away she was from the idea of being espoused to one man, a chaste virgin to Christ.<a name=516:8></a> Could anyone be further away?<a name=516:9></a> And yet she is only a picture of any or all of us.<a name=516:10></a> How far away we are naturally from the divine idea!<a name=516:11></a> And yet the gospel proposes to bring us to it in spite of the terrible obstacles.<a name=516:12></a> This woman comes to this.<a name=516:13></a> She had come out to the well with her water-pot, intending to fill it and carry it back to the city, but she left it and went back to the city without it.<a name=516:14></a> Why did she leave her water-pot?<a name=516:15></a> She was teachable, spiritually; she had taken in spiritual thoughts.<a name=516:16></a> Dear brethren, we shall never reach the idea of spiritual ministry unless we begin to take in spiritual thoughts.<a name=516:17></a> The chapter is full of spiritual thoughts.<a name=516:18></a> The Lord set out to impart to that woman spiritual thoughts, to give her spiritual ability.<a name=516:19></a> He presented spiritual things to her, and did not hesitate to bring before her the greatest spiritual thoughts, going so far as to say to her, "God is a spirit".<a name=516:20></a> That is the foundation of what He was talking about; He wanted to lead her on spiritual lines.<a name=516:21></a> If she is to have to do with God she must be spiritual.<a name=516:22></a> In truth it is a question of teaching, and the root of the teaching is in chapter 3 where the new birth is spoken of by the Lord: "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (verse 6).<a name=516:23></a> It is not <i>a</i> spirit,

		but <i>spirit</i>; it is the character of the thing.<a name=517:1></a> It is not that another spirit is imparted to the person, but "that which is born .<a name=517:2></a>.<a name=517:3></a>.<a name=517:4></a> is spirit".<a name=517:5></a> It is that character of things, and it is fundamental in that sense; so that the Lord's words to the woman, that "God is a spirit", would be in keeping with that.<a name=517:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, we may say that the woman shows that she had not been listening for naught, and that is important in these matters.<a name=517:7></a> If we are not taking in spiritual things, we are not profiting by them.<a name=517:8></a> She was now beginning to be spiritual in her thoughts; a great change had come about in her.<a name=517:9></a> She left her water-pot -- that is the token that this woman had been listening spiritually -- and went away into the city.<a name=517:10></a> She had become the water-pot herself; that is the lesson.<a name=517:11></a> She was carrying water to the city such as she had never taken there before, nor could have carried before.<a name=517:12></a> She was the vessel herself.<a name=517:13></a> And when she went to the city, she went to the men!<a name=517:14></a> I want to bring out, from that, that her body was "dead on account of sin".<a name=517:15></a> Christ was in her!<a name=517:16></a> She says, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?<a name=517:17></a>".<a name=517:18></a> It is a matter of intelligence; she is not yet speaking of Christ's attractiveness or His loveliness as we get in the Song of Songs; it is a question of how He appealed to her intelligence.<a name=517:19></a> What I am speaking of is most important.<a name=517:20></a> If persons can be secured spiritually, through their intelligence, they can know how to triumph over any attempt of the serpent to divert them from Christ; they have an answer for him.<a name=517:21></a> Indeed, they do not need to answer him; they turn away from him, as discerning the voice of their Saviour and Shepherd.<a name=517:22></a> It says, "The woman .<a name=517:23></a>.<a name=517:24></a>.<a name=517:25></a> went away into the city, and says to the men .<a name=517:26></a>.<a name=517:27></a>.<a name=517:28></a>".<a name=517:29></a> That is not for nothing; it is mentioned with the greatest care by the Spirit of God; she says, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?<a name=517:30></a>".<a name=517:31></a>

		It becomes a matter for the men to decide; and it is a matter for <i>your</i> intelligence; your conscience, of course, as having been touched by a Man who can tell you all things you have ever done!<a name=518:1></a> Where can you get the like?<a name=518:2></a> As said the man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9:33">John  9:33</a> "If this man were not of God he could do nothing".<a name=518:3></a> It is spiritual logic, I may say.<a name=518:4></a> She says, "Come, see a man", but she does not end there -- "who told me all things I had ever done".<a name=518:5></a> The men are not influencing her now -- her body is dead.<a name=518:6></a> They would have influenced her earlier, but not now.<a name=518:7></a> Christ is influencing her; Christ is in her!<a name=518:8></a> She is full of a Man who can tell her all things she had ever done.<a name=518:9></a> Surely, she would say.<a name=518:10></a> He is the Christ, but it is for you to see for yourselves.<a name=518:11></a> And they went off to see the Lord Jesus.<a name=518:12></a>

		Finally, Peter uses a remarkable phrase: "the hidden man of the heart".<a name=518:13></a> He is speaking of marital life, but he is also speaking of adornment in the wives.<a name=518:14></a> The adornment of women is a matter of great importance to the commercial world; if it did not have that to reckon on there would be great loss.<a name=518:15></a> Peter is speaking about adornment, and he tells the wives the things that are not to be their adornment: "Whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of the hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel".<a name=518:16></a> He says, "Let it not be that", and then he uses this phrase: "but the hidden man of the heart".<a name=518:17></a> What did the apostle have in his mind in speaking of "the hidden man of the heart"?<a name=518:18></a> He is not speaking of a person, but expressing a characteristic thought.<a name=518:19></a> As I apprehend it, it is a man in the sense of <i>the new</i> man, not a person, but a characteristic thought.<a name=518:20></a> And do I understand what is hidden in that way?<a name=518:21></a> What is the hidden man of my heart?<a name=518:22></a> It surely is a conception, dear brethren, but not so much the idea of a person, although it must work back to Christ.<a name=518:23></a> It must direct the mind to the Lord

		Jesus.<a name=519:1></a> He is the hidden Man, undoubtedly, but it is to be manifested.<a name=519:2></a> You cannot see this "hidden man" in the adornment of the world.<a name=519:3></a> He is in the hearts of Christians.<a name=519:4></a> True Christians normally have something in reserve, something secret, and they are thinking of that all the time.<a name=519:5></a> Whatever they put on, they are thinking of that.<a name=519:6></a>

		Now, to show that it is a question of character or of a quality, the apostle goes on to say, "For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands; as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:5">1 Peter  3:5</a>,6).<a name=519:7></a> That is the idea.<a name=519:8></a> It is well when we get a concrete example of what is in mind.<a name=519:9></a> This adornment refers to what is hidden, "the hidden man of the heart".<a name=519:10></a> The idea should have begun with Eve, and should have come right down.<a name=519:11></a> Thank God, it found some expression in Sarah, a holy woman.<a name=519:12></a> She adorned herself in this way; she was one of those of whom the apostle tells us that they were in subjection.<a name=519:13></a> If we speak of this in a wider sense, what is it but the assembly as having a conception of a Man hidden in her heart?<a name=519:14></a> And all that is external must flow from that!<a name=519:15></a> And the fundamental thought in that is subjection.<a name=519:16></a> "The assembly is subjected to the Christ", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:24">Ephesians  5:24</a>).<a name=519:17></a> It is not simply 'subject', but God has placed everything in subjection to Christ.<a name=519:18></a> It is not a question of our taking a position, but of our being placed in that position.<a name=519:19></a> The assembly is placed in subjection to Christ, and any move away from that position is lawlessness; because it is the place of the assembly; it is the place of wives in relation to their husbands; and any disregard of that is lawlessness.<a name=519:20></a> The apostle Peter can call upon one of old; he can bring her forward as a concrete case, a woman who had that kind of adornment in them hidden man of the heart.<a name=519:21></a> She was marked by calling her husband lord.<a name=519:22></a>

		Well, dear brethren, I do not know if I have made as plain as I would wish, what this "hidden man" is, but I think the key lies in this word 'hidden'.<a name=520:1></a> It is a question of determination inwardly as to quality.<a name=520:2></a> "The hidden man" is an expression covering both man and woman, as in "Let us make man in our image .<a name=520:3></a>.<a name=520:4></a>.<a name=520:5></a>" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>).<a name=520:6></a> That word 'man' covered both man and woman.<a name=520:7></a> It is a question of laying hold of qualities as seen in Christ, and of their coming out in us.<a name=520:8></a> That is the idea of adornment, and it works out in subjection, and we have this case brought forward of a holy, godly woman who illustrates it in her subjection, calling her husband lord.<a name=520:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what I had to suggest to you, and I commit it all to the Lord that through it He might have a greater place in our hearts, that His qualities may come out in adornment in us here below as loving Him.<a name=520:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have to say, dear brethren, has reference to the name which we, as Christians, have been baptised to and which is called upon us.<a name=521:1></a> I have the public position of Christians in mind.<a name=521:2></a> Matthew has it in mind, particularly; James speaks of "the excellent name which has been called upon you"; John says that for "the name" certain have "gone forth, taking nothing of those of the nations"; so that these apostles, in writing thus, have the public position in mind.<a name=521:3></a> John has what I may call the private position particularly in mind in his gospel; he builds inward, as it is said of David, in taking Zion, that he "built round about from the Millo and inward", (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#5:9">2 Samuel  5:9</a>).<a name=521:4></a> John's gospel has that in mind, particularly, and Paul also has it in mind; being the architect, as I may say, of the public assembly, he has the inward in mind more than any.<a name=521:5></a> He speaks of the Father, "that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:16">Ephesians  3:16</a>), with a view to our eternal relations.<a name=521:6></a> John, also, ministers on the same line, directing us through the words of Christ into heavenly and eternal relations.<a name=521:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in his epistles, particularly in the second and third, John speaks of the assembly in its public aspect.<a name=521:8></a> He speaks, for instance, of Diotrephes casting persons out of it, and he speaks of the love of the brother to whom he wrote having been declared to the assembly.<a name=521:9></a> The assembly is to be informed of matters of special interest, in the sense that every right feeling is in it; indeed, I might say, what is of heaven is here below in that sense, for the feelings and sympathies of heaven are in it.<a name=521:10></a> There is respect and reverence for God, and for Christ, and respect for dignitaries; these things mark heaven.<a name=521:11></a> We read

		So that what I am speaking of is the assembly of God, or the assembly as such, for it had acquired that place, the word denoting a very great matter.<a name=522:9></a> Matthew brings it in to supersede military protection for the saints, for they that take the sword perish by it.<a name=522:10></a> The assembly is a refuge from any such feeling.<a name=522:11></a> He also shows that it supersedes the court of the land for the Christian.<a name=522:12></a> And James, if you will allow me, shows that the hospital is superseded by the assembly.<a name=522:13></a> He speaks of it in relation to the bodily illnesses of the saints, of which there is always much.<a name=522:14></a> But in the passage I read he avoids using the word 'assembly' for he is speaking of rich people blaspheming the excellent name.<a name=522:15></a> He uses the word 'synagogue' showing the character of the epistle.<a name=522:16></a> While it deals with what is really of God, in the Christian sense, it also includes the great Jewish community, addressed in grace by the Spirit of God in this way, so that even the synagogue was observed.<a name=522:17></a> But he does not finish the epistle without speaking of the assembly.<a name=522:18></a> There is no suggestion of rich blasphemers

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, as I said, I am seeking to occupy you with the public side of our position.<a name=523:3></a> If you follow what I have been saying, you will see that there is that which is really intended to supersede, for believers, all mere human institutions.<a name=523:4></a> I am not here to say a word against such institutions, whether it be military, official or authoritative.<a name=523:5></a> They are there provisionally, but spiritually they are superseded by the assembly.<a name=523:6></a> Would that everyone here would take that in, but the young ones especially.<a name=523:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we are living in a dual sort of way; living in relation to what is spiritual and of God, and at the same time living in relation to what is public in a literal sense, subject to governments, subject to every human institution for the Lord's sake, honouring the king and all dignitaries, praying for them too, making supplication for them, giving thanks for them.<a name=523:8></a> So that the Christian is never an overturner of governments, he is a patient sufferer in regard to any ill-treatment.<a name=523:9></a> Inwardly he is in another world; that is the position; he is in an out-of-the-world state of things.<a name=523:10></a> That may be an expression that the young ones may not fully understand, but if you will be patient and think it over and see that there is another world opened up, and that the assembly is a part of it, there will be great gain.<a name=523:11></a> The assembly is to be a great luminary in that world presently.<a name=523:12></a> She is coming out of heaven from God.<a name=523:13></a> In the meantime it has a public place, but not as a rival of governments, for those who form it know that patience is our present normal right attitude -- we are in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ.<a name=523:14></a>

		Matthew has all this in mind when he records what we do not have elsewhere, that the countenance of the angel at the tomb of Jesus was like lightning.<a name=524:11></a> In this chapter the angel is a public personage; in the other gospels his service is private.<a name=524:12></a> But here he is a great heavenly official with his countenance like lightning, and he is sitting upon the stone that had been on the mouth of the tomb in which the Lord of glory lay.<a name=524:13></a> He says, "He is not here".<a name=524:14></a> He is a public personage.<a name=524:15></a> The keepers were as dead men on account of him; that is, the keepers were those who represented the murderers of Christ.<a name=524:16></a> He is against them; he is against the seal that is on the tomb, because it is against Christ.<a name=524:17></a> Had it been another tomb, it would have been different.<a name=524:18></a> But it

		He then speaks in the language of the prophets of the Old Testament: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty".<a name=533:14></a> I apprehend he is bringing in Isaiah, who is the most feeling of all the prophets.<a name=533:15></a> There is no book in the Old Testament that inspires more feeling than the prophesy of Isaiah.<a name=533:16></a> What the writer says here is confirmed in Isaiah.<a name=533:17></a> John tells us that the Lord God, that is, Jehovah, says this.<a name=533:18></a> So that, at the outset, we see that ministry begins with God, the minister being profoundly affected by God as known.<a name=533:19></a> All this is brought to bear on the actual ministry, for God is presented in the book that is before us.<a name=533:20></a>

		Now I want to say a word about the wood offering.<a name=552:2></a> It is a unique kind of expression which is only found in Nehemiah; that is, in remnant times.<a name=552:3></a> Romans teaches us something about the wood offering.<a name=552:4></a> It is not wood for construction, because, at that time, the temple had been restored and the service of God resumed.<a name=552:5></a> It is kindling -- firewood.<a name=552:6></a> It is a very great necessity, for the fire of the burnt-offering had to be kept burning all night, and it is very remarkable that Nehemiah makes such a point of it.<a name=552:7></a> He tells us, in chapter 10, that the brethren had committed themselves to supply the provisions for the service of God: "We made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God" (<a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#10:32">Nehemiah  10:32</a>).<a name=552:8></a> The great point with any such agreement is that it is to be in accord with the mind of God, and not merely a human thought.<a name=552:9></a> And this was a mutual arrangement which came entirely within the scope of the mind of God.<a name=552:10></a> Such arrangements provide for the outflow of love.<a name=552:11></a> And amongst the things to be provided was the wood-offering; that is, that there should be wood in the house of God.<a name=552:12></a> It was wood for the fire -- kindling wood.<a name=552:13></a> I recognise that in the types, the fire denotes judgment.<a name=552:14></a> But this is not the fire that is outside the camp.<a name=552:15></a> That is not in mind here; it is related to what goes up to God.<a name=552:16></a> There can be no fire without this wood.<a name=552:17></a> We may have hymns and words in our meetings without real stimulation, nothing kindled, as it were.<a name=552:18></a> This wood brings in some touch that would kindle the feelings, some touch that causes the fragrance to ascend to God.<a name=552:19></a> I am not overlooking the divine thought of fire; it involves suffering.<a name=552:20></a> I believe we get it first in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, in a very pathetic way.<a name=552:21></a> Isaac called his father's attention to the wood.<a name=552:22></a> The wood was there,

		My thought is not to follow on what our brother has been speaking of, nor do I think much of consecutive or suggestive thoughts, in that sense, in a meeting like this; but rather that we should have something direct.<a name=554:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What has come to me now is based on these verses about Adam's generations.<a name=554:2></a> It is a thought that is full of suggestion.<a name=554:3></a> The idea begins in the first chapter of the Bible and runs right through.<a name=554:4></a> But what is in my mind, mainly, is to call attention to the peculiar situation that arose immediately in the facts recorded in the Bible, as Moses was directed to write.<a name=554:5></a> Peculiar circumstances arose almost immediately as to man, but why is it that these circumstances <i>did</i> arise?<a name=554:6></a> What was the divine mind in them?<a name=554:7></a> Why should it be, for instance, that man's creation should be so recent; that is, so comparatively recent?<a name=554:8></a> And why should there be male and female?<a name=554:9></a> All these thoughts are in my mind and what I have to say about them will be brief, but presented in the form of suggestion as to these meetings.<a name=554:10></a> They are peculiar meetings and, I believe, very opportune.<a name=554:11></a> Our brethren have been well advised, under God, to invite their brethren from elsewhere to meet together in this way, and what has been before us has been opportune in meeting existing need, as I fully believe.<a name=554:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well then, as I have said, why should this situation at the beginning of the Bible be -- why should there be creatures, male and female, called the lower creation, and why should they be made before Adam, and why should they be made subject to Adam?<a name=554:13></a> And then, why should there be creatures made much earlier than man, not marked by male

		and female?<a name=555:1></a> For the angels are not marked by male and female.<a name=555:2></a> And so with these things in mind I have read these two verses which call attention to Adam's <i>generations</i> .<a name=555:3></a> The passage goes on to say, "In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him.<a name=555:4></a> Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created".<a name=555:5></a> We are told about this incident -- a great incident -- in the first chapter of Genesis: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<a name=555:6></a> And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>).<a name=555:7></a> Now you will note that this is repeated, in part, in the passage we have read, only our passage distinctly gives us the creation of man and woman, whereas chapter refers to the creation of Man, mentioning the woman only by inference: "Let them have dominion", and again, "male and female created he them".<a name=555:8></a> Man was to rule as male and female over the lower creation.<a name=555:9></a>

		This is the time for learning.<a name=558:1></a> There is much to be learned, and a great need for learning.<a name=558:2></a> There is also some ability to teach.<a name=558:3></a> It is also important that there should be examples from whom we may learn.<a name=558:4></a> The apostle Paul was an example as a leader.<a name=558:5></a> He enjoins us that we are to be followers of him, as he also was of Christ.<a name=558:6></a> And then, in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13">Hebrews  13</a>, we have the suggestion that leaders are to be remembered; that is to say, those who were here before us are to be remembered: "Remember your leaders".<a name=558:7></a> No doubt it has reference to those who have gone to be with the Lord, or if they are still living, their past service is in mind.<a name=558:8></a> Then, in verse 17 it says, "Obey your leaders, and be submissive; for <i>they</i> watch over your souls as those that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not groaning, for this would be unprofitable for you".<a name=558:9></a> The word, therefore, at this time is for the younger ones.<a name=558:10></a> Often, those who minister the word say that it is a word for the young, but in these scriptures the younger ones are particularly in mind, that they may learn.<a name=558:11></a> We can thank God for the many young men in this country who have ability to minister the truth.<a name=558:12></a> In this <i>city</i> I may say, there are a good many who are capable of serving in this way.<a name=558:13></a> It is of God that their spirits are to be in the service as well as their words and that the Holy Spirit may be availed of so that their ministry will influence others.<a name=558:14></a> We are to be influenced by what is said and the manner of those who say it.<a name=558:15></a>

		God carries it down, letting us know what Paul was so that we may learn by example and by objective thought.<a name=559:1></a> And so it says, "Be my imitators, even as I also am of Christ".<a name=559:2></a> So that our learning is to begin with divine Persons, not simply with any one of us, not even the greatest of us, such as Paul.<a name=559:3></a> The learning must begin from Christ: "as I also am of Christ".<a name=559:4></a> But then we have this unique example in Paul, for the example is carried down through Paul from the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=559:5></a> Paul learned from Christ.<a name=559:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, as I said, it is the learning time, and that applies to every one of us here today.<a name=559:7></a> Presently the time will come when very bad things will be set out as doctrine, but we are to be prepared to overcome.<a name=559:8></a> The point is to be overcomers.<a name=559:9></a> Whatever may come, let us be overcomers!<a name=559:10></a> So that we are to learn from Paul, but through him we learn from Christ.<a name=559:11></a> That is what is in mind in this scripture.<a name=559:12></a>

		Then, in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13">Hebrews  13</a>, we have the idea of leadership in those who have been before us.<a name=559:13></a> We might refer to the apostles, of course, for they have been.<a name=559:14></a> Paul has been, but the point is to <i>remember</i> our leaders.<a name=559:15></a> Paul was a great leader, and there have been many leaders since then.<a name=559:16></a> One might speak of the great servant of whom we often speak -- Mr.<a name=559:17></a> Darby.<a name=559:18></a> We have learned much from him; not that any of us have seen him, but we have learned through having heard of him, and many accurate things have been said of him and of his ministry.<a name=559:19></a> So that the fact of an example is there for us.<a name=559:20></a> We may say that it is still here today as is also the example of Paul, for he enjoins that we should learn from his example.<a name=559:21></a> But the first thing in this passage is that we are to remember our leaders who have spoken to us the word of God.<a name=559:22></a> It says, "spoken to you".<a name=559:23></a> It is not simply that it was spoken, but spoken to <i>you</i> .<a name=559:24></a> So that each of us is to be a learner.<a name=559:25></a> And not only

		so, but we are to consider "the issue of their conversation".<a name=560:1></a> It is the issue of it, what issues out of it, what culminates from it.<a name=560:2></a> The leaders that have been before us have set us examples as to this; it is the kind of men they were; not only what they said, but what kind of men they <i>were</i> .<a name=560:3></a> I would like to have seen Mr.<a name=560:4></a> Darby, but I have learned much of his manner and ways and things that he said.<a name=560:5></a> One can thus speak of him in that way as one of the leaders who have spoken to us the word of God.<a name=560:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it says, "Imitate their faith".<a name=560:7></a> Now that is something specially interesting -- to imitate faith.<a name=560:8></a> We may learn how to exercise faith as we see it in others.<a name=560:9></a> We may ask, What is faith?<a name=560:10></a> Or, What is <i>your</i> faith?<a name=560:11></a> but we are to learn what faith is and to imitate it as we see it in exercise.<a name=560:12></a> So that we are to "imitate their faith".<a name=560:13></a> And then, further, it says, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come".<a name=560:14></a> We are directed to ancient things, in that sense, but things that have come within our range.<a name=560:15></a> And that is what is in mind, especially for the younger ones, that they may learn what to say, learn what deportment they are to have, what kind of spirit they are to display and learn how to set out the truth.<a name=560:16></a> They are to learn from others.<a name=560:17></a> We should not at all be ashamed to learn from our elder brethren.<a name=560:18></a> If they can set out the truth in a distinctive way, let us learn from them how to do it.<a name=560:19></a> We are to be teachers of one another and learners from one another.<a name=560:20></a> But then, we have not only the actual teaching, but the <i>spirit</i> of the teacher.<a name=560:21></a> And so the thought culminates in our Lord Jesus Christ Himself: "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come".<a name=560:22></a>
