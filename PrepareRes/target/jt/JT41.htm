		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak about establishment, the state of being divinely fixed or established in the things of God.<a name=1:2></a> What is said as to this to the saints at Corinth may be mentioned at the outset, indicating what is in mind.<a name=1:3></a> "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ", says the apostle, "and has anointed us, is God".<a name=1:4></a> "In Christ" is fixity, and it is there that we are to be established, not in this world.<a name=1:5></a> What I have in mind as to this is specific -- that is, establishment in <i>the divine family</i>.<a name=1:6></a> I read in Hebrews as giving the great principle, "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second", and I wish to apply it to the family.<a name=1:7></a> There is the first family and the second, but He takes away the first, as we have read in the book of Job, in order to establish the second; for any thought that God has introduced is never to be abolished, it is to go through, and one of the great conceptions in the divine mind is the family.<a name=1:8></a> "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father)" -- an only one with a father particularly brought out a father's affections.<a name=1:9></a> The truth is presented in that way so as to impress us with the peculiar affection that flows out from the Father, and which belongs to the family.<a name=1:10></a>

		Isaac is a type of Jesus in this respect.<a name=1:11></a> The word in regard of him was, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest".<a name=1:12></a> Abraham and Isaac, seen in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, foreshadowed the passage I quoted from <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>.<a name=1:13></a> It is the setting out of the family thought;

		so we are told later in John that the Father loveth the Son, and we are also told that the Lord Himself said that He loved the Father.<a name=2:1></a> Moreover it is stated in the same great family gospel, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him".<a name=2:2></a> We have the idea of the family greatly stressed, and God would have us to understand it.<a name=2:3></a> It was a primary thought with Him, and every primary thought continues into eternity.<a name=2:4></a> The thought of the family is supremely such, for we are told in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>that in eternity "the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him" (who is God and Father) "that God may be all in all".<a name=2:5></a> <i>All in all</i> -- that is, every created intelligence will be filled with God, but He will be Father as well; He is God <i>and</i> Father.<a name=2:6></a> The Son will be there, there will be the perfect radiation of affection between divine Persons, and the Spirit pervading all to make this good in every heart.<a name=2:7></a> That is not the first family, but the second.<a name=2:8></a> We are told "that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual", and this applies to the family.<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark records for us an incident which brings out this great thought of the family and how it is experienced now -- the moral element that enters into it.<a name=2:10></a> When I use the word moral in this sense, I refer to what has to do with time.<a name=2:11></a> It is the same family in mind, only viewed as constituted capable of overcoming evil and practising righteousness.<a name=2:12></a> There will be no need of these features in eternity, for there will be no evil there, and no need of the moral element in the sense in which it is spoken of in this passage.<a name=2:13></a> Evil will be relegated to its own place, the lake of fire, never more to lift up its head.<a name=2:14></a> The divine family is marked off, as the Lord says, by doing the will of God, and I want to show how the first family comes into evidence in this passage in Mark, so that you may see how this idea of the first family may even apply to a believer's house.<a name=2:15></a> I hope also to show from Job how God works in such a house, so that the first family may

		In this remarkable passage in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>, we have the Lord's mother, Mary, the most honoured of women; and yet here she is on the line of the first family -- that is, on the line of nature.<a name=3:3></a> In this she erred more than once.<a name=3:4></a> For instance, at the marriage in Cana she said to the Lord, "They have no wine", as much as to say, You are my Son, and I have liberty to call Your attention to this matter.<a name=3:5></a> He said to her, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=3:6></a> mine hour is not yet come".<a name=3:7></a> He repudiated the introduction of nature in this way.<a name=3:8></a> Mary is adjusted at once, and sets an excellent example for fathers and mothers who would pursue the natural; she says to the servants, "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it".<a name=3:9></a> But here in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>she is on natural lines; the multitude tell Him that His mother and His brethren are standing outside; He is inside and they are calling Him.<a name=3:10></a> Think of who He was!<a name=3:11></a> Mary should have known -- no one on earth should have known better who this Person was, but she is standing outside, and the <i>brethren</i> are inside.<a name=3:12></a> The disciples are sitting around Him, for He looked round in a circuit.<a name=3:13></a> If we are not in the divine family, if we are on the line of nature, we are really outside the circle of those who are sitting around the Lord Jesus, those who love Him.<a name=3:14></a> The relatives call Him to come out to them; they were His brothers and sisters according to nature, and they call Him as if they had a claim on Him.<a name=3:15></a> That is what enters into this; they were calling Him.<a name=3:16></a> Why did they not come into the circle, and sit down and listen to what He was saying?<a name=3:17></a> No; they did not, and the Lord scathingly rebukes them.<a name=3:18></a> Parents may expect such rebukes when they are on the line of nature and not on the line of the second family.<a name=3:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the book of Acts.<a name=3:20></a> Luke refers to "all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach".<a name=3:21></a> The Lord here in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>exemplifies what He is about to say, in that He

		looks round upon those who were sitting around Him; He was doing that as if to say, My heart is set on those who are sitting round Me, they are delightful to Me, and I must not be called outside.<a name=4:1></a> It will not do at all to give up the second family for the first.<a name=4:2></a> No doubt Mary and His brethren were thankful in after years for this rebuke, as, for instance, when they were found in the upper room later on.<a name=4:3></a> If you were to ask Mary, What did you think when Jesus said that to you?<a name=4:4></a> -- she would say, 'Oh, how foolish I was, and how faithful He was!<a name=4:5></a> I feel this, as recalling that He was inside with His brethren and I was outside'.<a name=4:6></a> She was a true believer and a highly honoured one, but she was on the line of the first, the natural family, and she was rebuked.<a name=4:7></a> The Lord looked round on those who sat about Him, and saw them listening, not merely as curious and interested persons, but listening.<a name=4:8></a> The heavenly family is a circle of affection, for John says as we love the brethren we know we have passed from death unto life.<a name=4:9></a> The Lord looked round and said, "Behold my mother and my brethren!<a name=4:10></a> For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother".<a name=4:11></a> Young people, come into the second family!<a name=4:12></a> You do not want to be taken away by the government of God.<a name=4:13></a> It says that He "taketh away the first".<a name=4:14></a> Many have been taken away by death, others through worldliness, so that they are morally dead.<a name=4:15></a> The point to understand is what the first represents -- the flesh in the believer is to be taken away.<a name=4:16></a> How?<a name=4:17></a> Through the efficacy of Christ's death -- by self-judgment, by self-renunciation and the avoidance of all that goes with the flesh, by the washing of water by the word.<a name=4:18></a> If I put my son to the university I want a name for him; I want him to be distinguished in this world; that is the first family.<a name=4:19></a> The jailer, believing in God, was at once baptized with his family; that means that he was at once going in for the second.<a name=4:20></a> So with Lydia also, at Philippi.<a name=4:21></a> They were remarkable cases, they started with the idea of the second family.<a name=4:22></a>

		Now I go on to Job to illustrate what I am saying, for the Old Testament always helps in this way; it gives us details.<a name=5:1></a> In chapter 1 you will find that Job's sons and daughters are specifically mentioned four separate times, and in every instance -- except the first -- they are mentioned as meeting in each others' houses.<a name=5:2></a> That is, they are viewed from the very outset as constituted to carry on as brothers and sisters <i>without</i> their father.<a name=5:3></a> Young people very often like to get relieved of the father's authority and influence.<a name=5:4></a> It does not exactly say that here, but it does say that they met alternately in their brothers' houses.<a name=5:5></a> Very nice, you say.<a name=5:6></a> Yes, from their point of view.<a name=5:7></a> On the last occasion they are drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; not a word about Job and his wife.<a name=5:8></a> On every occasion Job sent and sanctified them, and he rose up early in the morning and offered sacrifices for every one of them.<a name=5:9></a> But why send?<a name=5:10></a> Why not go?<a name=5:11></a> Why should he be exempted from these occasions?<a name=5:12></a> There is not a word about Job being present at those family gatherings.<a name=5:13></a> This was not written by accident, but with purpose to teach us.<a name=5:14></a> Although the father was unique as far as he went, he did not take part in what his children were going on with.<a name=5:15></a> Was his life rather tame then?<a name=5:16></a> No, Job was a man of great affairs, but there was never any word of his children <i>having part</i> in his affairs.<a name=5:17></a>

		If you read chapter 29 you will be impressed with what a man he was in his district.<a name=5:18></a> He says, "When I went out to the gate through the city, .<a name=5:19></a>.<a name=5:20></a>.<a name=5:21></a> the aged arose, and stood up.<a name=5:22></a> The princes refrained talking .<a name=5:23></a>.<a name=5:24></a>.<a name=5:25></a> The nobles held their peace".<a name=5:26></a> He was the leading man in his district, perhaps a wide one, but there is no mention of his children.<a name=5:27></a> I have no doubt that Job was known far and wide.<a name=5:28></a> He lived in the land of Uz, and was one of the most distinguished men of his time.<a name=5:29></a> His was not a tame life, but a life of affairs; "I .<a name=5:30></a>.<a name=5:31></a>.<a name=5:32></a> dwelt as a king in the army", he says as to his public life.<a name=5:33></a> But I am speaking now about his children.<a name=5:34></a> He sent and did things for them, but that was all.<a name=5:35></a> No doubt it suited them that he did not come;

		there is not the slightest hint that they missed their father, or were at any loss owing to his absence from these feasts in their houses.<a name=6:1></a> In the last instance the feast was in the <i>eldest</i> brother's house; they were on the line of <i>nature</i>, and they moved in that way; but a wind came from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men and they died, and the messenger says, "I only am escaped alone to tell thee".<a name=6:2></a> Is not that a solemn lesson to children who disregard parents and are content to go along by themselves, who want to go on the line of the first family!<a name=6:3></a> A solemn warning, too, for parents who allow their children to do these things!<a name=6:4></a> It came from the devil -- God gave him leave; but there is no word of him after chapter 2.<a name=6:5></a> It was the Lord who allowed these things -- it was a question of the governmental dealings of the Lord.<a name=6:6></a> Job was a converted man, but godliness may be only up to a point, not going far enough.<a name=6:7></a> How terrible is the thought that He taketh away the first!<a name=6:8></a> All that is on the line of nature fails.<a name=6:9></a> He gave it abundance of time to prove itself, but now it is exposed.<a name=6:10></a> He taketh away the first, and what for?<a name=6:11></a> that He may establish the second.<a name=6:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So I come to the last chapter, in order that you may see how the discipline of God brought Job to the second family.<a name=6:13></a> Forty wonderful chapters intervene, chapters of education, bitter experiences for Job, but well worth the while, as we see when we read this forty-second chapter.<a name=6:14></a> You will notice what is said in verse 7: "And it came to pass after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, Mine anger is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job.<a name=6:15></a> And now, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept".<a name=6:16></a> God had spoken to Job.<a name=6:17></a> I am here tonight that God may speak, and all meetings of this kind are intended to give God opportunity

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what is to be observed is, that the root of the matter was in Job, and that the second family as worked out today is not merely a second family of persons but a second family in <i>principle</i>.<a name=7:4></a> Children, of course, are born on the line of nature, but the second family is the idea.<a name=7:5></a> The first family is there -- that which is natural is first, afterwards that which is spiritual.<a name=7:6></a> Circumcision came in on the eighth day, indicating the second family, that is, the spiritual.<a name=7:7></a> So it is with baptism; household baptism came in under Paul and is a great thought in christianity.<a name=7:8></a> At Philippi, the two leading believers have their households baptized, and the baptism of the household implies the thought of the second family.<a name=7:9></a> Why should I bring in death if the first family is not to be removed?<a name=7:10></a> There is no point in anyone having his household baptized unless he has the second family in mind.<a name=7:11></a> The idea in the mind of the believing parents is that the child is dead and buried, and is to be brought up in the light of the second family -- in the light of Christ risen from the dead.<a name=7:12></a> So you find the principle in Moses; he is laid in the water.<a name=7:13></a> Indeed, you find the principle as early as Seth.<a name=7:14></a> When his son was born, by the name he gave him he said, He is a poor dying creature; he called his name Enosh, which conveys this thought.<a name=7:15></a> The babe, however delightful, is born to die, and the parents say that he must die, and baptism means that.<a name=7:16></a> It is taking away the first so that the second may be established.<a name=7:17></a> So the eunuch says, "See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?<a name=7:18></a>" So with Paul; Ananias says, "Why tarriest thou?<a name=7:19></a> arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:16">Acts  22:16</a>.<a name=7:20></a> The "first" has sins attached to it, and these must go, the person and his sins all go in baptism.<a name=7:21></a> It is a question of baptism to Christ -- "as many as have been baptized unto Christ Jesus, have been baptized unto his death .<a name=7:22></a>.<a name=7:23></a>.<a name=7:24></a> so we also should walk in newness of life".<a name=7:25></a> Room is

		made for the second.<a name=8:1></a> The point in the early verses is to bring in Job as the head; he is regarded as a priest also.<a name=8:2></a> The second family here illustrates any family brought up on the line of baptism to Christ as Head, risen from the dead.<a name=8:3></a> The Lord indicated to Eliphaz and the two others that Job would intercede for them.<a name=8:4></a> "My servant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept".<a name=8:5></a> He is a priest.<a name=8:6></a> The new order of things is to have such a man as this leading.<a name=8:7></a> How we can apply this to our Lord Jesus!<a name=8:8></a> How God has accepted Him!<a name=8:9></a> Job is a type, though perhaps a dim one.<a name=8:10></a> The Lord Jesus is the only Man acceptable to God in His own Person.<a name=8:11></a> He is Priest to God for all His people.<a name=8:12></a> These three friends of Job are brought in and saved because of this man.<a name=8:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told the Lord accepted Job, and thus he was set up again with twice as much as he had before, except that his sons and daughters were not increased in number.<a name=8:14></a> There is the passing over to the second, for in truth the second is reached in the same individuals.<a name=8:15></a> Romans takes up a man responsible to God, and the "second" is worked out in him by the removal of the first.<a name=8:16></a> Job has twice as much as he had had in cattle, but only the same number of sons and daughters.<a name=8:17></a> See what a man Job is!<a name=8:18></a> How different from his friends and neighbours and brethren!<a name=8:19></a> He is set up, not only in acceptability to God, but to everyone.<a name=8:20></a> God has been doing this ever since Job's day, working out His thoughts with us in severest discipline, so as to put away the first and establish the second.<a name=8:21></a> Job's friends bring him money and earrings, and set him up as if he were the centre of affection.<a name=8:22></a> He had seven sons and three daughters, and in all the land there were no women so fair as the daughters of Job.<a name=8:23></a> It is not the natural now, not a question of physical features, the beauty of these women is typically spiritual.<a name=8:24></a> The second family is marked by this.<a name=8:25></a> It would be well to consider these women and others who are mentioned, holy women of old, women of faith.<a name=8:26></a> The women of the New Testament form one of the most interesting studies as

		one works out in each the transfer from the first to the second.<a name=9:1></a> What a group you find standing by the cross of Jesus, the <i>Marys</i>, which imply that they knew suffering!<a name=9:2></a> Where are there women to be compared with those delineated by the pen of the holy writers in the New Testament!<a name=9:3></a> There are not any so fair, as is said of the daughters of Job.<a name=9:4></a> In the first chapter no names were given, for names indicate character, and their characters were evidently not worth naming.<a name=9:5></a> No doubt they were "<i>society people</i>", distinguished among men, but God took them away with a terrible stroke, to make room for the second.<a name=9:6></a> Now the second family comes into view; their names are given, and the daughters are specially mentioned; but there is not a word about feasts in their brothers' houses in this last chapter.<a name=9:7></a> It says Job gave them an inheritance amongst their brethren; they are in subjection in their own right positions.<a name=9:8></a> That is where all true christian sisters should be -- amongst their brethren in the assembly, in the family of God; and that is what the Lord had in mind when He looked round upon that circle that were sitting around Him.<a name=9:9></a> What a holy place for young sisters!<a name=9:10></a> Instead of the dance hall and all that kind of thing -- to enjoy an inheritance amongst the brethren, an inheritance handed down from their parents and given by God Himself, for Job is here representative of God.<a name=9:11></a> God is the Father of all the spiritual families; they are all named of Him, and to each He has given a rich inheritance amongst the brethren.<a name=9:12></a>

		So the Lord looking around in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>indicates that those round Him were <i>morally</i> right, they were doing the will of God, not their own will.<a name=9:13></a> The place in the divine family is based on this, not doing one's own will.<a name=9:14></a> I suppose each of these feasts in the brothers' houses was a matter of the will of the brother.<a name=9:15></a> Their father is not there, he has other matters, and they are quite content to be without him, and Job is seemingly satisfied to let it be that way.<a name=9:16></a> For this reason they are taken away.<a name=9:17></a> In Mark the second family is composed of "whosoever shall

		I have before me to speak about christianity in its initial features, and if the Lord help, as I hope He will, to show its superiority as compared with human religions -- indeed with all that is merely human.<a name=11:1></a> I have in view to help the young, for as young we are prone to be discouraged by the outward smallness of what we are identified with, allowing our natural sensibilities to control us, and thus disqualifying us from viewing things morally, from the judging of values, and disqualifying us for the appraisement of heavenly things.<a name=11:2></a> The Lord introduced the idea of values in His parables, speaking of the treasure that the man found as if he were not looking for it, and then of something that one was seeking as a merchant-man ready to pay for what he sought, his taste being of the highest order.<a name=11:3></a> He found one pearl of great price and sold all to obtain it.<a name=11:4></a> He thus stresses the idea of value and the ability to esteem it proportionately.<a name=11:5></a> One observes and knows, from one's own experience, that what marks the young, and perhaps all, is the constant tendency to gravitate to a lower level; and the lower we get, the larger things become on that level.<a name=11:6></a> So we become discontented with what is of real and abiding value, and hence turn back to what is visible and to what is appraised among men as of value, and yet is of no real value.<a name=11:7></a>

		My subject is teaching, and how it works out in the doings and sayings of those taught.<a name=22:1></a> For the principle is <i>doing</i> and teaching in the teacher, and learning and doing in the taught.<a name=22:2></a> In his second letter to Theophilus, Luke refers to "all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach".<a name=22:3></a> Christianity therefore is exemplified, and then taught.<a name=22:4></a> It is a substantial thing, not merely a system of ethics and doctrines, but concrete things worked out livingly first in Christ, and afterwards in His apostles, who as having learnt from Him, were marked by doing and teaching.<a name=22:5></a> What I have in mind is to work these things out in John's gospel, and what is to be observed is that the Lord draws from the Old Testament as to this matter.<a name=22:6></a> He says, "they shall be all taught of God"; that is the result of all teaching -- whether by the Lord, by His apostles, or by gifted men since the apostles' time; for one of the gifts given by Christ was that of teaching -- pastors and teachers are one gift.<a name=22:7></a> In this sense, the teacher not only takes care of the minds of the saints, but of the saints themselves.<a name=22:8></a> All is included in God's teaching, for after all God does everything, whether it be in this wonderful dispensation, in the one that is to follow, or in the one that is past.<a name=22:9></a> The great testimony is, What hath God wrought!<a name=22:10></a> The more we advance in the knowledge of God, the more we attribute everything to God.<a name=22:11></a> So the passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>is significant, "they shall be all taught of God".<a name=22:12></a> What a joy if it can be said of us that we are characteristically taught of God!<a name=22:13></a> -- not priding ourselves in the schools and colleges we may have graduated from, but that we have been taught of God; for the teaching of God is the only teaching that goes into eternity.<a name=22:14></a>

		My subject is worship.<a name=31:1></a> Although a very great one, and extensive in its bearing, one can only hope to present it under these four scriptures briefly, but I hope, by the Lord's help, concisely.<a name=31:2></a> The epistle to the Philippians is an appropriate one to begin with, although there is very much more detail in the epistle to the Hebrews as to this great matter.<a name=31:3></a> The state of the assembly at Philippi furnished an excellent setting for such a verse as I read in chapter 3.<a name=31:4></a> The apostle writes that letter with great feeling.<a name=31:5></a> It is peculiarly a love letter, and in his allusion to the worship of God, we can understand how his heart entered into it.<a name=31:6></a> We may safely say that in the heart of no one on earth at that time had God such a place, and so he would be full of holy feeling in speaking of himself and others as the circumcision who worshipped God by the Spirit; alluding by way of contrast to those who worshipped nominally, but by earthly means and methods and not by the Spirit of God.<a name=31:7></a> The word used here for "worship", is one which relates rather to the public service of God; what God had in mind when He said, "Let my son go, that he may serve me".<a name=31:8></a> God had in mind that He should be served by persons in the liberty of sons, not in slavish fear or in a mere fleshly way by human means and devices, but from the heart, as indeed the Lord Jesus, who is the great Leader in all this, the Minister of the sanctuary, said, "God is a spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth"; "the Father", He says, "seeks such as his worshippers".<a name=31:9></a> Mark you, it is the <i>persons</i> that He seeks -- the worship of course, but the <i>persons</i> are before Him.<a name=31:10></a> The apostle Paul has this in mind, that he was amongst those persons; and all true christians characteristically belong to those persons who are the true circumcision,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what the apostle has in mind, and I have before me to bring out the thought of how worship is induced and maintained here on earth until the coming of the Lord, because the word in Philippians implies that it is the public thing, what is due to God -- the real service, of course, but still what can be seen by others.<a name=32:6></a> God intends this to go on, with however few or however many, and the thing is, can I include myself in this "we"?<a name=32:7></a> "<i>We</i> are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God", those who have turned their backs on man-made religion, however antiquated or honoured according to man, and turned their faces to God as His sons, who have accepted the death of His beloved Son as bringing to an end the flesh even in its religious character.<a name=32:8></a> They worship according to the prescribed way and the Spirit of God is the sole power for that worship.<a name=32:9></a> There is of course outward order.<a name=32:10></a> Luke in his gospel and treatise in Acts has in mind what is seemly, what is according to God in public service.<a name=32:11></a> So he tells us, for instance, that the Lord Jesus <i>placed</i> Himself at table.<a name=32:12></a> You may say that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have in mind to say, dear brethren, will bear on parental instinct, spiritual instinct, seen in Rachel and Jacob, and will include something on <i>addition</i>.<a name=83:1></a> What is to be observed, is that a certain occurrence, which, in the light of subsequent facts had a spiritual import, drew forth certain comments from these parents, the one bearing on addition -- Rachel's remark -- and the other on the place and circumstances suited to addition.<a name=83:2></a> Rachel says, "Jehovah will add to me another son"; not two sons, but another.<a name=83:3></a> She is limited to one more, and hence calls her son, just born, by the name of Joseph, which indicates what was in her mind, "addition".<a name=83:4></a> Jacob immediately says to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my country".<a name=83:5></a> A spiritual occurrence is the basis of this remark, suggesting that Christ had come into his vision in Joseph; and if there is to be any addition to Christ it cannot be in Padan, spiritually it must be elsewhere; that is to say, in Jacob's own country, in his own place.<a name=83:6></a> Adding to Christ in the world is what marks christendom, and so much of the toil of so-called evangelists ends in this increase, additions to Christ in the wrong place.<a name=83:7></a> It is "my place" Jacob speaks of now, which was not Padan, and "my country", which also was not Padan, but Canaan.<a name=83:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Rachel's remark deserves first consideration here because of what was in her mind.<a name=83:9></a> "Jehovah will add to me another son", she says.<a name=83:10></a> She had been very urgent as to sons, and had said that she would die if she did not have them.<a name=83:11></a> Her maternal instincts for sons were strong, and now that Joseph was born, her own first-born, she says this, "Jehovah will add to me another son".<a name=83:12></a> That is a spiritual remark, for it indicates that whatever she might have understood, it synchronises with the divine counsels that there were to be twelve sons of Jacob.<a name=83:13></a> There were to be twelve, not thirteen.<a name=83:14></a> Were she simply controlled by
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=84>[Page 84]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		her natural instincts, according to earlier facts, she would have expected other sons, but she says "another son".<a name=84:1></a> Her remark synchronises exactly with the divine thought, and so must and should every spiritual remark.<a name=84:2></a> If we are under the control of the Spirit we shall be in accord with divine purpose.<a name=84:3></a> The nearer we get to God and to the end of our service, the more divine counsels are to us.<a name=84:4></a> God has His own thoughts, He is a God of measure; and the number that He seeks is known to Him, and He will have that number, no more and no less.<a name=84:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are, therefore, dear brethren, working within a realm of certainty, as the apostle Paul at the end of his service says, "For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that <i>they</i> also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:10">2 Timothy  2:10</a>.<a name=84:6></a> What a realm he was in, speaking thus!<a name=84:7></a> He laboured and suffered reproach in relation to it.<a name=84:8></a> Maybe it would be said that he should have gone further afield.<a name=84:9></a> He had said that he purposed to go to Spain, but we are not told that he went there.<a name=84:10></a> Some may have said that he was remiss, and that he was imprisoned on account of that, but it was not so.<a name=84:11></a> He laboured and suffered reproach; whatever people thought, whatever reproach may have been heaped upon him, he laboured that the elect might obtain the salvation that was in Christ Jesus, and that with eternal glory -- what a great thought!<a name=84:12></a> Not simply being saved as by fire, he had a greater thought than that in his service, although he says there is a possibility of that, but his thought was that they might "obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory".<a name=84:13></a> So it is that the divine number is to be secured.<a name=84:14></a> This does not set aside that the righteousness of God is "unto all".<a name=84:15></a> The gospel is to all, but nevertheless there are those that are called the elect, and they are to obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<a name=84:16></a> What a salvation is that to my soul!<a name=84:17></a> You do not want anything less than that.<a name=84:18></a> It is not that they might obtain forgiveness of sins simply, although that is a very great matter, but

		that they might obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<a name=85:1></a> There will be additions on those lines.<a name=85:2></a> Hence Rachel had no other thought than one other son, that is, the twelfth.<a name=85:3></a> She had him with sorrow.<a name=85:4></a> The accomplishment of divine thoughts, in the sense I have spoken of, lay with her, but it was with sorrow.<a name=85:5></a> She died at the birth of Benjamin, showing the lines on which God is working, as the apostle says, labouring and suffering reproach.<a name=85:6></a> Indeed that apostle is about to die for the truth, and die <i>he would</i> for the truth.<a name=85:7></a> It is surely worth dying for; and so Rachel suffers and stands out in that way as a type of a mother in Israel, which is another great matter.<a name=85:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are not many so styled, nor is she, yet she stands out because of this spiritual remark, and because of the mention of her in the prophets, "Rachel weeping for her children".<a name=85:9></a> That is another thing that God honours, weeping for her children because they are not.<a name=85:10></a> The Spirit of God carries the thought further into the New Testament, where it speaks of the sorrowful incident of Herod's murderous destruction of the first-born in Bethlehem, near which Benjamin was born.<a name=85:11></a> It was the place of Rachel's sorrow.<a name=85:12></a> She named him 'son of my affliction'.<a name=85:13></a> The last of Jacob's sons is the son of his mother's sorrow, but also the son of his father's right hand.<a name=85:14></a> These two things go together and come in in the last days -- maternal experience of sorrow intelligently expressed as Rachel dies, for she says, "Son of my sorrow".<a name=85:15></a> She little thought of that perhaps when she said "Jehovah will add to me another son", but there it was.<a name=85:16></a> Nevertheless, there was the promised addition -- and what an addition!<a name=85:17></a> for he was the son of his father's right hand!<a name=85:18></a> So that we have in Benjamin the complete number, that number by which the right hand of God can accomplish its desires.<a name=85:19></a> For the twelve alludes spiritually to the working out of love.<a name=85:20></a> It is a great divisible number, suggestive of manipulation, and love works on those lines, disposing of each brother and sister according

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rachel has a great place in that way, and I am speaking of her so that we might take in what the maternal idea is in this great matter of addition.<a name=86:2></a> If there is to be addition, this is the thought -- discernment as to what is needed; for there is so much needed, and then suffering so that the need might be supplied.<a name=86:3></a> For there must be suffering.<a name=86:4></a> The Lord Jesus has brought about the counsels of God by suffering and the greatest servant is spoken of in that way; "I will show him how great things he must suffer", the Lord says.<a name=86:5></a> Paul was a true Benjaminite.<a name=86:6></a> He was the son of Benjamin and he corresponded with the maternal thought in his mother, for she was his mother in suffering, so that the complete number should be there.<a name=86:7></a> Whatever that number may be, whether it be for the meeting, the service, or the full accomplishment of the counsels of God, it must be attained; and so she says, "Jehovah will add to me another son".<a name=86:8></a>

		Now much has to be stated both on her account and on Leah's account.<a name=86:9></a> They two, we are told in the book of Ruth, built the house of Israel, a great matter.<a name=86:10></a> That is not building with wood, hay and stubble.<a name=86:11></a> These two women built the house of Israel.<a name=86:12></a> And so Leah begins with a son, it is the first great thought in this family.<a name=86:13></a> Sonship is the great thought governing the counsels of God, whether they be the heavenly or the earthly, for sonship applies to the earthly as it does to the heavenly.<a name=86:14></a> For us, that is, for those who have part in the heavenly calling, it has a greater significance, for it underlies that wonderful movement spoken of in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, the heavenly city seen descending from God out of heaven.<a name=86:15></a> It is an act of her own.<a name=86:16></a> What grace, what liberty, what dignity in that movement!<a name=86:17></a> Israel will have no such greatness, but nevertheless the word applied to Israel was, "Let my son go": the message sent to Pharaoh, "Let my son go, that he may serve me"; and the apostle Paul says of them, "to whom pertaineth the adoption".<a name=86:18></a> This

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next child is one who <i>hears</i>.<a name=87:9></a> You can see how the sons of Jacob set out consecutively the divine thoughts amongst the brethren.<a name=87:10></a> First we have the great thought of sonship that must dominate all.<a name=87:11></a> Then the next is the person who hears -- Simeon, for if God sets out His thought in Christ, the thing is to take in what is in His mind as to that thought.<a name=87:12></a> "He that has ears to hear, let him hear".<a name=87:13></a> Then we have Levi, the servant; also representing the heavenly family, his name signifies <i>united</i>.<a name=87:14></a> There is the idea of union in Levi.<a name=87:15></a> Judah was the fourth son of Jacob -- <i>praise</i>.<a name=87:16></a> The divine thoughts are thus opened up to us in this family.<a name=87:17></a> Praise, that is what Judah means.<a name=87:18></a> How glory fills the scene as we can see it now, and how glory after glory filled the scene in that house!<a name=87:19></a> Incongruous indeed, the maidservants coming in, but nevertheless the glory was there.<a name=87:20></a> And then Dan comes in to judge.<a name=87:21></a> One of the most important things in the divine economy is the ability to judge.<a name=87:22></a> And then we have Naphtali.<a name=87:23></a> Gad, Asher -- each one of them adding his own quota to this wonderful domain of glory, the family of God; all to be opened up in due course as the apostle Paul says, "the testimony to be rendered in its own times".<a name=87:24></a> Genesis is like a seed plot, as has often been remarked, and the beautiful fruit of the divine sowing is manifested as time goes on under the nurture of God, for Jacob is said to have been a field.<a name=87:25></a> "See", says Isaac, "the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed", and here it is opening up.<a name=87:26></a> And so we get Asher, a blessed happy man; and we get

		From the scriptures I have read you will have observed that my thoughts are running on divine foundations -- the foundation of God, as it is called in Timothy.<a name=116:1></a> The idea of foundation extends very far back, the earth itself being founded.<a name=116:2></a> "Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#3:19">Proverbs  3:19</a>.<a name=116:3></a> Its foundation is often alluded to in Scripture, and is particularly linked on with what I would bring before you.<a name=116:4></a> "He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever".<a name=116:5></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:69">Psalm  78:69</a>.<a name=116:6></a> So that the thought is very old, as old as the earth; and connected with it is joy, for the foundation indicated what the great structure was to be.<a name=116:7></a> "Whereupon were the foundations thereof sunken?<a name=116:8></a> or who laid its corner-stone, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?<a name=116:9></a>" <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:6">Job  38:6</a>, 7.<a name=116:10></a> Intelligence was brought into it in God's creatures, and it was discerned that great things were in view, so that it occasioned joy.<a name=116:11></a>

		If it occasioned joy then, it would be right to expect that sympathy would be aroused in our hearts as the matter comes before us at this time; for we are the sons of God as christians, and we should not be wanting in sympathy in following up this thought of the foundation of God; the matter is so great and involves so much.<a name=116:12></a> Without it, there can be nothing permanent; with it, we have unshakable conditions; a kingdom that cannot be moved.<a name=116:13></a> I speak of it that we might be established in the apprehension of it, as Paul says, "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:21">2 Corinthians  1:21</a>.<a name=116:14></a> God loves to have us fixed and clearly apprehending the foundation upon which we rest, the

		SPIRITUAL INSTRUCTION FOR PART IN THE ASSEMBLY (4)

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=216:1></a> The subject in view is discernment of the features of the assembly.<a name=216:2></a> It began with certain of those who loved the Lord, as seen in the end of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23">Luke  23</a>and the beginning of chapter 24.<a name=216:3></a> They were regulated by the commandments; but were wanting in faith and intelligence as to actual facts existent -- that is to say, that the Lord was risen.<a name=216:4></a> We are seeing how the Lord brings them, step by step, into the assembly, that they might discern Him there opening their understandings; how He leads them to a point, as far as to Bethany, and how they are in the temple as a testimony on God's part to the Jews.<a name=216:5></a> Then in view of the assembly formally presented in Acts, it is stated that the Lord assembled with them; and further we get how He was taken up from them.<a name=216:6></a> They returned to Jerusalem, but "to the upper chamber where were staying both Peter, and John", and the rest, with the women (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:13">Acts  1:13</a>).<a name=216:7></a> Then Peter stood up in their midst and conveyed the light governing the position.<a name=216:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these facts have to do with <i>the Lord's own handiwork</i> while here, including the "forty days", always having the assembly in mind.<a name=216:9></a> What is before us now, in these passages, is the thought of the assembly actually formed by the descent of the Spirit; and what marked it at the outset, so that we might have a right conception of the Pentecostal assembly.<a name=216:10></a> If the Lord permit, we might later consider the assembly as formed under the ministry of Paul, and how it became the vessel of divine service and praise.<a name=216:11></a> The intent throughout is that we might learn to be spiritual, and to apprehend the assembly in its spiritual features so as to be in accord with it, and have part in it intelligently.<a name=216:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=219:17></a> What is any office or gift aside from the ability to discern the Lord?<a name=219:18></a> We must learn His movements in the assembly, and all gift and ministry ought to take character from these.<a name=219:19></a> That is what gives it its touch, so in the assembly on the Lord's day one gets suggestions as to one's movements and service.<a name=219:20></a> The more spiritual we are, the more we shall find our beginnings in the assembly, because we get touches there that we get nowhere else.<a name=219:21></a>

		In Acts we have presented the historical facts of how it came into evidence in the course of the testimony; first, in the Lord's ministry during the forty days, and secondly in the ministry of the twelve, particularly of Peter during the ten days between the Lord's ascension and the coming of the Holy Spirit; and then what came out after the gift of the Spirit.<a name=231:8></a> In the three passages now read we have what is seen in Paul's ministry.<a name=231:9></a> These passages bring out the most salient points.<a name=231:10></a>

		We should refer to chapter 4, which gives us the last view as to the positive state of things developed under the twelve -- the last view of the Pentecostal assembly.<a name=231:11></a> It contains features of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, but here the saints are viewed as "their own".<a name=231:12></a> "And having been let go, they came to their own company", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:23">Acts  4:23</a>.<a name=231:13></a> And we have the form of their prayer, how they prayed.<a name=231:14></a> The saints are still intact, and in view of their continuance they are governed by the principle of prayer and dependence.<a name=231:15></a> A deep sense of need arose as the testimony proceeded.<a name=231:16></a> The saints had need.<a name=231:17></a> It is said, "they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.<a name=231:18></a> And they, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:23">Acts  4:23</a>, 24.<a name=231:19></a>

		My subject this evening is friendship -- friendship with God, friendship with Christ, and friendship with one another.<a name=249:1></a> I have read these passages, accordingly, as speaking of this great subject -- the Lord Himself speaking of it says, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<a name=249:2></a> Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<a name=249:3></a> Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you".<a name=249:4></a> We have this great subject set out in the most perfect and concise way from the lips of the Lord Jesus, who Himself answers exactly to what is said in the Old Testament, "there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother" -- that is the idea of friendship set out absolutely in Christ; and every true christian knows that He is a Friend above all others.<a name=249:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before proceeding with the subject in a positive way, I may say a few words about friendship with the world.<a name=249:6></a> If there are any here who are cultivating friendship with the world, they are not likely to have much interest in what I have to say about friendship with God, friendship with Christ, or friendship with the people of God.<a name=249:7></a> James tells us that "friendship with the world is enmity with God" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#4:4">James  4:4</a>) -- a most solemn statement -- so that if there is anyone here who is friendly with the world, he or she would not be interested in what I am saying about friendship with God.<a name=249:8></a> James speaks very strongly, and other scriptures are full of denunciation of friendship with the world.<a name=249:9></a> It is an insidious thing, and comes out even in a man like Jehoshaphat, for instance -- he was a very honoured man and used of God, but he cultivated friendship with the world.<a name=249:10></a> Jehu charged him with

		it and said, "Shouldest thou .<a name=250:1></a>.<a name=250:2></a>.<a name=250:3></a> love them that hate the Lord?<a name=250:4></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#19:2">2 Chronicles  19:2</a>) -- a very simple and forceful way of putting the matter.<a name=250:5></a> How often that is the case with many of God's people!<a name=250:6></a> They love God, as Jehoshaphat did, and yet go far in forming alliances with worldly people in marriage or in business.<a name=250:7></a> But we have this word which shows that it is abhorrent to God and inconsistent with the light which we profess to hold; so James warns us and says if you are on terms of friendship with the world you are at enmity with God.<a name=250:8></a> Let us face this matter; whatever excuses we may bring in, if friendship with the world exists we cannot hide it from God.<a name=250:9></a> He is not occupied with outward appearances, but with the heart.<a name=250:10></a> His word is "sharper than any two-edged sword, .<a name=250:11></a>.<a name=250:12></a>.<a name=250:13></a> and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=250:14></a> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do"; for even if we are to be shut out of the presence of God for ever, we have to do with Him -- whether as converted or unconverted persons, we all have to stand before the judgment seat of God.<a name=250:15></a> Christians do not stand before Him at the same time as unbelievers, for their matters are settled before -- but we all have to stand before God; hence the seriousness of friendship with the world.<a name=250:16></a>

		James also tells us that Abraham was called the friend of God; others in the Old Testament had said it, indeed Jehoshaphat, to whom I have referred, said that Abraham was God's friend.<a name=250:17></a> Isaiah says it, quoting Jehovah Himself as saying "Abraham, my friend".<a name=250:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we want to see what friendship with God implies.<a name=250:19></a> It means that God is pleased to take a man into His confidence.<a name=250:20></a> A friend opens up his mind to you -- he confides in you.<a name=250:21></a> It is a question of confidence.<a name=250:22></a> God knows everything, but then it says, "If any man love God, the same is known of him".<a name=250:23></a> This is a distinction.<a name=250:24></a> He would regard you as a lover of His.<a name=250:25></a> God calls His friends by name.<a name=250:26></a> He says, "Shall I hide from Abraham

		But then there is more than that.<a name=251:15></a> He says: I can trust you!<a name=251:16></a> I do not know of anything more to be desired than to be trusted by God, and so it says here of Abraham: "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?<a name=251:17></a>" And immediately He gives the reason for this -- that Abraham was trustworthy.<a name=251:18></a> God was about to overthrow Sodom and Gomorrah.<a name=251:19></a> God came down as to this.<a name=251:20></a> He heard the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah.<a name=251:21></a> Of course He knew what the cities were without coming down, but coming down shows His infinite fairness, that as to just what the state was, all should know that the judgment was according to first-hand knowledge.<a name=251:22></a> And then He says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?<a name=251:23></a> .<a name=251:24></a>.<a name=251:25></a>.<a name=251:26></a> For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice".<a name=251:27></a> These are the reasons God Himself affords for entrusting this information to Abraham -- the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, meaning in type the overthrow of the world.<a name=251:28></a> What a great position a friend of God has -- he knows

		Then finally there is the thought of friends of one another.<a name=256:3></a> The apostle John is writing his last letter; the third epistle says, "The friends greet thee".<a name=256:4></a> Why did he say "friends"?<a name=256:5></a> He did not say "christians", he selected the suitable word, he meant persons who confided in one another, who loved one another.<a name=256:6></a> We may assume that he learnt friendship from Christ in leaning on His bosom, as we have seen; and he records Him as using the word "friends" in its truest sense.<a name=256:7></a> We must learn everything from Christ, and we learn in Him "a friend that sticketh closer than a brother".<a name=256:8></a> John learnt it, as I said, in the bosom of Jesus, he learnt from the Lord in the place of love.<a name=256:9></a> I believe he is the last of the apostles -- he lived to be a very old man, but he carried on in love.<a name=256:10></a> His ministry is full of the thoughts of love; that we are to love one another and keep ourselves from idols -- keep ourselves from idolatry and all that is antichristian.<a name=256:11></a> And so he speaks of those with him as the friends -- the "friends greet thee", and also those with Gaius -- "Greet the friends by name".<a name=256:12></a> In those days the enemies were always attacking, the lives of the saints were exposed, and therefore they needed particularly to confide in one another.<a name=256:13></a> Today the same conditions exist, only more in a spiritual sense, and so the need of true friendship amongst us, that the brethren should dwell together in love, and confide in one another, that we should be transparent and each know that the other would not betray him but rather protect.<a name=256:14></a> John says, "The friends greet thee".<a name=256:15></a> That is not a mere handshake but a salutation that comes from the heart -- from friend to friend.<a name=256:16></a> As Jehu says to Jehonadab, "Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?<a name=256:17></a>" That is, he

		These verses of Scripture present to us the idea of a mantle or cloak or general outer covering, and that is what I wish to speak of, such a garment having, as other garments in Scripture, a symbolical significance.<a name=267:1></a> Clothing has a great place in Scripture, the first to make clothing being God Himself, not for ornament but for covering; so that the thought is dignified in that way.<a name=267:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Clothing later came to take on the idea of ornament, representing also rank and office, as appears peculiarly in the book of Revelation; but it also especially suggests one's measure, another important suggestion, for God is the God of measure, and whilst that includes the universe in its immensity, it also refers to persons particularly.<a name=267:3></a> That brings up what no doubt each of us has had before him, the necessity of knowing one's measure; for, as constituted a part of an organism, each of us has to fit; the measure must be accurate otherwise he will be a misfit and practically excluded from the working out of the great organism of which we form part.<a name=267:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=313:6></a> Yes.<a name=313:7></a> Everything must be learned from Him, but He is never contemplated as a creature; He is Firstborn of all creation: the thought of creature never attaches to Him.<a name=313:8></a> All that we do is to be learned from Christ, and especially the working out of life, because He is said to be the Originator of life (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:15">Acts  3:15</a>).<a name=313:9></a> That word is used four times in the New Testament, meaning one who originates a thing, and not only that, but who exemplifies it, sets it out.<a name=313:10></a> The gospels show <i>how</i> the Lord did things.<a name=313:11></a> You get a good deal there about His walk and the way He spoke, the promptness with which He did things, and the courage with which He faced difficulties.<a name=313:12></a> Every one of these four features comes out perfectly in Him, and they are presented in the gospels so as to impress us, that we may take on that character.<a name=313:13></a> The Lord said in Mark, "Go into all the world", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:15">Mark  16:15</a>.<a name=313:14></a> That would require the lion character, because the world is opposed.<a name=313:15></a> Then it says, "Preach .<a name=313:16></a>.<a name=313:17></a>.<a name=313:18></a> to all the creation", the creation being viewed abstractly as in relation to God, although alienated.<a name=313:19></a> Every creature is sustained by God and has in that sense a link with God.<a name=313:20></a> It is one thing to preach to a man as a worldling, and another thing to preach to him as a creature.<a name=313:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=346:3></a> What I am free to suggest for consideration is the Spirit as seen in the two Corinthian epistles.<a name=346:4></a> The subject of the Spirit in these epistles is extensive, running throughout, and ending in the second letter with the fellowship of the Spirit.<a name=346:5></a> We may be helped at this time to consider the subject in relation to <i>revelation</i>, not exactly the revelation of God, but the <i>things</i> He has prepared for these that love Him, and it may be well to dwell on the relation of this subject to the ministry.<a name=346:6></a> That is how it is introduced, as will be observed: the apostle alludes to his own use of the Spirit, as a minister.<a name=346:7></a> These meetings are composed of brothers, and whilst all are called to serve, including sisters, yet there are those who are fitted to serve in a <i>special</i> way, and it will be perhaps wise to confine our remarks at this time as much as possible to the ministerial side of our position as seen in them.<a name=346:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Lately some of us have been considering the numeral <i>three</i> as in a large measure governing God's testimony.<a name=346:9></a> There is much throughout Scripture alluding to adequate or full testimony which God is pleased to give in any given relation.<a name=346:10></a> So that we noted the three men who came to Abraham, three patriarchs mentioned in the book of Genesis, and then the three leaders, Moses and Aaron and Miriam (<a href="../bible/Micah.htm#6:4">Micah  6:4</a>); these are formally stated in the prophet to have been sent before Israel.<a name=346:11></a> It is significant that the great minister, Moses, is seen as having to flee from Egypt, that is, he is persecuted, but he <i>sat by the well</i> in Midian, a very suggestive thought, implying that ministry is dependent upon the Spirit, not on any mere natural ability, and that is what the apostle

		J.T.<a name=389:10></a> This chapter is properly to be connected with that chapter, and it enters into the teaching beginning with chapter 10 of our epistle: "we, being many, are one  body" -- our bodies are involved.<a name=389:11></a> The body of Christ on earth now necessitates the saints in their bodies, and chapter 10, as it bears on the Lord's supper, would bring out that our bodies are in subjection -- they are holy -- so that we sit together as one body.<a name=389:12></a> The teaching in Romans underlies all this as to the body, that is, "if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin".<a name=389:13></a> The woman of Sychar, I believe, illustrates that strikingly because ordinarily she would be influenced by men, but after she had had to say to Christ, she was not so influenced.<a name=389:14></a> She comes to them and says, "Come, see a man .<a name=389:15></a>.<a name=389:16></a>.<a name=389:17></a> is not this the Christ?<a name=389:18></a>" She was manifestly superior.<a name=389:19></a> In principle, Christ was in her.<a name=389:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These books from which I have read are calculated to help to the end I have in mind.<a name=454:2></a> They lead up to the thought I have expressed, that the end is sure and glorious; an eternal weight of glory indeed is spoken of as the portion of those who look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen.<a name=454:3></a> Infinite glory for God is in anticipation also.<a name=454:4></a> He is to be glorified in the assembly, in Christ Jesus, throughout all generations of the age of ages, that is, for eternity.<a name=454:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to show that all this glory is brought within our range of intelligence, indeed, that from the outset God had in His mind a residence for it.<a name=454:6></a> This was indicated in the incoming of the glory to the tabernacle in the wilderness, and subsequently to the temple, its final residence; both types pointing to <i>the assembly</i>, a word which we never tire of, a word which, indeed, has a meaning which is peculiar to itself in the minds of intelligent believers in Christ.<a name=454:7></a> It is not intelligible to the unregenerate, for it is a treasury word, a word belonging peculiarly to the vocabulary of the spiritual, and in no sense does it convey so much as when we say it is the dwelling-place of God and of His glory.<a name=454:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So much is it the residence of God's glory, that it is said of the assembly, viewed as the heavenly city, that it comes down from God out of heaven, <i>having the glory</i>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are great thoughts and one would lay them on the minds of the brethren at the outset, and then seek to show how they are reached from our side.<a name=455:6></a> I have read from Ezra, specially to bring forward the importance of the prophetic ministry; that is stressed in <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#5">Ezra  5</a>.<a name=455:7></a> The prophets of God prophesied, but they worked with the builders as well, they were practical men.<a name=455:8></a> I may have to tax your memories, but I hope everyone here has read this book of Ezra; it is a very priestly book; it links on with Chronicles and through Chronicles with the beginning of God's ways and operations on the earth, that is, it begins with Adam, for the first book of Chronicles begins thus.<a name=455:9></a> The second book links on with this book of Ezra, the closing paragraph being almost identical with the opening paragraph of this book, so we have a golden chain of testimony running right through.<a name=455:10></a>

		In chapter 4 we get recovered saints, and when I say recovered saints, I include those of our own times, for one does not refer to Scripture as mere history; it should not be read except as bearing on the person who reads it, and those who hear it.<a name=455:11></a> That is the way to understand Scripture.<a name=455:12></a> These recovered saints were exclusive according to <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#4">Ezra  4</a>, and there is a difference between exclusiveness, right in itself, and a prophetic condition amongst us.<a name=455:13></a> In chapter 4 the adversaries of Judah and

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not be afraid of the word exclusive, because it is a very good word, one to be treasured, having its own significance in the minds of the spiritual.<a name=456:4></a> This chapter brings out that the brethren, as restored, were exclusive, they were exclusive in the sense that they would not accept unhallowed support.<a name=456:5></a> They would not have anything to do with any associations or fellowships that were not divinely accredited.<a name=456:6></a> That is a most important item in our position.<a name=456:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Exclusiveness in itself is a negative thought, and what you find in this fourth chapter is that the adversaries continued to harass the saints, and were successful in their efforts, showing that exclusiveness by itself is not sufficient; and so much did the enemy succeed that the work of God actually ceased.<a name=456:8></a> The adversaries wrote a letter to the king, saying everything bad they could about the people of God.<a name=456:9></a> If we are <i>merely</i> negative and people speak thus of us, they are pretty sure to incite successful opposition.<a name=456:10></a> We must have more than exclusiveness if we are to be effective in our service; there must be a positive side to the position or the enemy will have an advantage, and hence what you find here is that the work ceased.<a name=456:11></a> The enemy was successful in his great effort to blacken the people of God, by relating what the history of Jerusalem had been, what a rebellious city it had been, and how damaging to the kings, and so on: a long tale of accusation, with the result that the king was persuaded to authorise the adversaries of the people of God to prevent the work by force and power, which they did immediately.<a name=456:12></a>

		We have been speaking about glory as emancipating us from the world; as attractive and setting us free in the presence of God, it is given here as an incentive to go on.<a name=464:7></a> We are told that the latter glory of the house is to exceed the former, and that is what we are going on to.<a name=464:8></a> To this end I have stressed this thought of the prophetic ministry, as that which governs the position initially, and then the need of readiness on the part of the saints to move, and as we move, there is glory after glory opening up to our minds, as incentives to go forward unfalteringly until the consummation.<a name=464:9></a>

		In Zechariah we have the day of small things recognised.<a name=464:10></a> They are small, but nevertheless no one is to despise them, and the prophet sees in these "two sons of oil" what denotes the unlimited supply of spiritual power to go on with.<a name=464:11></a> The word is addressed to Zerubbabel who represents the responsible element and, of course, we are all responsible.<a name=464:12></a> When authority is failing in every direction and lawlessness lifting up its head with such power, the Spirit of God is asserting government -- in a small way, of course, but it exists as a testimony.<a name=464:13></a> Zerubbabel, the governor, represents it here.<a name=464:14></a> He is typical of the Lord being content to be with us in this day of small things; with us to govern us, and as things are right and orderly amongst us the work of God proceeds.<a name=464:15></a>

		UNITY AS LEADING TO INCREASE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:1">Ephesians  4:1</a> - 16
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read these verses in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>to speak of unity.<a name=466:1></a> As you will observe, these verses treat of unity in its general bearing, for indeed the bearing of this epistle is more universal than local, and I have in mind to dwell on the universal setting of unity.<a name=466:2></a> That there should be such a thing is a victory achieved by God.<a name=466:3></a> In taking out a people from among the nations for His name, He unified them, so that they should be, not only theoretically, but practically one body, "one body in Christ".<a name=466:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As soon as the Holy Spirit came down, according to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, He sat on each of the saints assembled, and they began to speak in the different dialects or languages represented in Jerusalem at that time, and the representation was large, not indeed of the nations as such, but of Jews and Jewish proselytes from among them, and they testified that what the saints were saying they understood, as spoken in the language in which they were born.<a name=466:5></a> What was said would establish a basis for practical unity as they returned to their respective countries, and as God wrought, there would be the existence of unity as the effect of the truth on their walk and ways.<a name=466:6></a> This was what was divinely intended as over against the deliberate scattering by God at Babel, where the race of mankind was scattered judicially throughout the whole earth.<a name=466:7></a> The principle of unity was to be introduced and it was to overthrow the confusion that had existed.<a name=466:8></a> Language ceased to be a barrier; and to the end that unity should be maintained, there were the gifts of tongues, so that divine things should continue to be ministered amongst the nations in an intelligible way.<a name=466:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is to be observed from a practical point of view is that the first breach recorded was due to sectional feelings arising (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6">Acts  6</a>).<a name=466:10></a> The Hellenists, that is, the Grecian Jews, complained that their widows were

	<div class="paragraph">
		neglected in the daily ministrations, not that their widows were any more interesting to heaven than the other widows, but they were of more interest to the other disciples who were from the part of the world indicated.<a name=467:1></a> I mention this, for indeed it is part of what I have in mind, that in dwelling for a little on this great thought of unity, we should keep before us the danger of disruption arising from sectional feeling.<a name=467:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another illustration of sectional interference with the divine economy and unity is in the book of Numbers, chapter 16, where a great rebellion arose, two hundred and fifty of the princes of Israel being involved in it, and led by Korah, a Kohathite.<a name=467:3></a> He and his family of the Levites were stationed on the south side of the tabernacle as was also the tribe of Reuben, and the rebellion arose through the combination of this section of the Levites with certain of the tribe of Reuben, manifestly because they were adjacent to each other.<a name=467:4></a> Partisan feelings sprang up, arising from the contiguity of the tribe of Reuben to the Kohathites, the leading family in the tribe of Levi; the combination that arose was disastrous.<a name=467:5></a> So, dear brethren, there is always this danger of our being affected sectionally or nationally, or even in a continental sense, in a hemispherical sense, for a whole hemisphere may be affected because of mutual contiguity.<a name=467:6></a> The truth that is before us in this chapter implies that all this has to be watched, lest the work of God should in any way be marred, for His great thought is unity.<a name=467:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord had this in mind in His prayer to His Father recorded by John, and by John only; He prayed for those who should believe on Him through the services of the apostles -- that they should be one.<a name=467:8></a> He also says, that the glory that the Father gave to Him He gave to those whom the Father gave Him, so that they might be one -- a very remarkable thing.<a name=467:9></a> He says to His Father, "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one".<a name=467:10></a> What a standard of unity!<a name=467:11></a> The Lord saw that the conferring of glory

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=468>[Page 468]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that He had received on the disciples was to promote the great thought of unity; that as we are glorified according to God, the state is present for unity according to Him.<a name=468:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking thus, I am not referring to actual glorification, a condition which is still in prospect.<a name=468:2></a> There is glorification now, as the apostle Paul says, "whom he has justified, these also he has glorified".<a name=468:3></a> I believe God intends glorification to mark us in all our settings, but particularly in regard of unity, that we are together happily and freely as dignified and as glorified by God.<a name=468:4></a> It all lies in the Spirit; for the Spirit works in us in the sense of anointing, and sealing, and of the earnest; so that we are not small, or legal, or exacting, and the Jewish element is negated in us.<a name=468:5></a> What is required for unity is largeness of heart in spiritual formation and wealth.<a name=468:6></a> The smallness that naturally attaches to us is inimical to unity, it militates against it.<a name=468:7></a> It descends to the level of judaism, that is current religious and sectarian feeling.<a name=468:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying, this thought of sectionalism may spread.<a name=468:9></a> Take, for instance, the great ocean in which we are set, the Pacific; it is not very long since that some of us had to consider the idea of contiguity, as related to its shores, involving thousands of miles of distance between saints who are supposed to be neighbours.<a name=468:10></a> In truth, they are not neighbours, and yet the principle had to be recognised.<a name=468:11></a> The thought of neighbourhood is good, but it may become merely sectional, for this is a time of travel and reduction of distances, and what is intended to be a right principle may degenerate into sectionalism, tending to cleavage.<a name=468:12></a> In this sense we may think more of persons who are near to us, than of those further off, and we may flatter one another that things are better because of this contiguity; such feelings and thoughts are entirely inimical to the work of God, and to the great unity that properly belongs to us, which is inclusive of every saint on earth.<a name=468:13></a> When we arrive at the idea of

	<div class="paragraph">
		resurrection, all sectionalism disappears, and the great unity is realised.<a name=469:1></a> We never cross Jordan until we come to face death, for it is through death that we arrive at resurrection.<a name=469:2></a> As we do come to face Jordan, that is, death, there it is before us in all its rolling force, for Jordan overflows its banks in the time of harvest.<a name=469:3></a> When we arrive there, the Spirit of God says, The Ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going before you.<a name=469:4></a> This is no sectional thought.<a name=469:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two and half tribes had taken up a section which, alas!<a name=469:6></a> proved disastrous in time, for in all these things, the sowing means reaping.<a name=469:7></a> They had taken up the section they had appraised and which they thought suited them best.<a name=469:8></a> They appropriated it and determined to have it, whatever Moses said.<a name=469:9></a> Happily they were amenable to the requirement to send forty thousand men, a fully representative number, to cross the Jordan; the unity of God's people was thus maintained in principle.<a name=469:10></a> They crossed over willingly and valiantly to fight the battles attendant upon taking possession of the inheritance, so that the unity was there, and it was a question of "the Lord of all the earth".<a name=469:11></a> God has nothing less than that in His mind, and I believe that the more we come to Jordan and understand the spiritual side of the position and the power of God operating in all Israel, as it were, in all the saints, sectionalism disappears.<a name=469:12></a> It is a question of the twelve tribes of Israel taking up their position in relation to the testimony of God as "the Lord of all the earth".<a name=469:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of all this, you will see how Colossians and Ephesians fit in.<a name=469:14></a> In Colossians it says, they had love for all the saints.<a name=469:15></a> They were universal in their thoughts, and their love was spiritual.<a name=469:16></a> These are two things that are striking in regard to these saints.<a name=469:17></a> The only mention of the Spirit is in relation to their love -- a very fine setting.<a name=469:18></a> It was <i>love in the Spirit</i>, and love in the Spirit, dear brethren, will never be sectional or preferential.<a name=469:19></a> If we have a "little sister" who needs attention, we are not to speak ill of her, but we will make the most of her and add

		to her, wherever she is.<a name=470:1></a> The family relationship stands, however geographically apart these persons may be.<a name=470:2></a> It is therefore a question of making the most of what there may be.<a name=470:3></a> Those of us who travel about the world thankfully recognise how the work of God in some places prospers more than in others, and we are, of course, entitled to inquire why it is, but, nevertheless, the work of God is the work of God, and the "little sister" is entitled to every bit of affection and help we can give her.<a name=470:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is that the principle of the body requires that the uncomely parts should be taken care of, and greater honour conferred upon them, instead of detracting from any section.<a name=470:5></a> In comparing ourselves with other sections, we should make the most of every section of the work of God.<a name=470:6></a> God would have us to make the most of our brothers and sisters, of the gatherings large and small throughout the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America; also, of course, the British Isles, these southern countries, and the West Indies.<a name=470:7></a> It is a question of the unity of the Spirit, what God is going on with.<a name=470:8></a> We are in it by profession, but we are to be in it in reality, as this chapter teaches us: "with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in love; using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace".<a name=470:9></a> That is the first great statement.<a name=470:10></a> We must begin locally bearing with one another in love, and we may have to bear with a brother five thousand miles away.<a name=470:11></a> We may have to bear with his letters and with his influence.<a name=470:12></a> We are taxed, so to speak, in this way.<a name=470:13></a> It is a poor thing, dear brethren, so richly endowed as we are, if we cannot suffer from our brethren in profiting by them, because there is something of value in every brother.<a name=470:14></a> It may be something I need, and I do not want to be deprived of it.<a name=470:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, there are conditions in the "little sister" which are to be enhanced, and we must see to it.<a name=470:16></a> If she be a door, for instance, we will "enclose her with boards of cedar"; if a wall, we will "build upon her a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next is a circle of authority and, as understanding the inner one, we hail the outer one because it involves authority and power for protection.<a name=471:12></a> "One Lord, one faith, one baptism".<a name=471:13></a> It includes responsibility on our part.<a name=471:14></a> As in it we may have to think of persons whose possession of the Spirit is questionable; in such times as ours certainly, this second circle includes those whose christianity is very questionable; and what forbearance is needed in respect of that!<a name=471:15></a> There is the positive thing, the actual existence of a kingdom vested in Christ in heaven, and operated here on earth as under Him.<a name=471:16></a> It is a protection for us, but it calls for very great consideration and a good deal of suffering and humiliation, in order to get down to people who may indicate good evidence of their genuineness and yet they are not clear.<a name=471:17></a> Their christianity is cloudy, and I hardly know anything requiring so much grace as to serve such.<a name=471:18></a> But they are professedly in the realm of the Lord's authority, having

		in this wonderful environment, we see unity promoted.<a name=473:1></a> To show the bearing of this, the Spirit of God quotes from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>, a convenient scripture at this point.<a name=473:2></a> Quotations in the New Testament from the Old are intended, among other things, to help us in our meditations and in ministry, and we are struck with the skill in which passages are brought forward by the Spirit in the New Testament; and here is a passage brought forward, in view of this unity being set up in principle, so that there should be powerful ministry here; not simply that things are said and we converse about them, but that there should be a powerful ministry here superior to all opposing forces that exist; that is the idea of gift.<a name=473:3></a> Gift is superior to all the enemy can bring forward against it, and so it says that the Lord "ascended up on high", leading captivity captive and has given gifts to men.<a name=473:4></a> Further it says -- and this should touch our hearts -- "that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth".<a name=473:5></a> He has ascended far above all the heavens and being thus ascended He has given gifts.<a name=473:6></a> The gifts here are not simply given to the persons who have them, but the persons themselves are the gifts.<a name=473:7></a> That brings up the thought of suitability to the gift, that the person is in keeping with it, so that <i>he</i> may be spoken of as a gift from the ascended Christ.<a name=473:8></a> We can understand how careful the Lord was in regard to the twelve apostles, so that they should represent him, and also in regard to Paul and others.<a name=473:9></a> The gifts are representative of Him who has given them.<a name=473:10></a> If one is this in a characteristic way, it is most serious to discredit Him.<a name=473:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be observed that only four are mentioned here, and this is in accord with the universal unity I have been speaking of.<a name=473:12></a> It is worked out and maintained in ministry exercised by these four classifications of gifts.<a name=473:13></a> They are given in wisdom.<a name=473:14></a> The apostles came first as representative of the Lord's direct authority, so much so, that the doctrine of the apostles was that with which the saints

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=478:1></a> The subject in mind is <i>leadership</i>, not only to dwell on the leaders of God's people, but also God's people as led, and this book is aptly fitted to help us on this point, for the whole position of the testimony in this book is made to hinge on those who were put forward as leaders.<a name=478:2></a> It is said that God was with each judge.<a name=478:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book begins with putting Judah forward; he occupies the early part of it, the outstanding leader from Judah being Othniel, son of Kenaz, as we read in chapter 3.<a name=478:4></a> It is said that the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, so that the thought of leadership in this book requires the Spirit; it contemplates men who are spiritual.<a name=478:5></a> In view of the leadership of Israel after Moses, Jehovah said of Joshua, "a man in whom is the Spirit", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:18">Numbers  27:18</a>.<a name=478:6></a> And if leadership is to be successful, spirituality must exist in some measure, at least, in those who are led.<a name=478:7></a> This chapter helps particularly, for it shows how those who are led are spiritual, that is, they are those who surrender the mere natural enjoyment of God's creatures with a view to the testimony.<a name=478:8></a> They partake of God's creatures, but partake of them not merely for satisfaction, but in order to take part in the testimony.<a name=478:9></a> Another thought that appears in this book is that leaders <i>led</i>, and the idea of leading is peculiarly in Gideon, because it is not a question of what he said, but of what he <i>did</i>.<a name=478:10></a> It says here, "it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do", hence spiritual leadership is in what the person does, as <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>says of the Lord Jesus -- "Jesus began both to do and to teach".<a name=478:11></a> Acts being the great book of precedent and exemplification of the truth in the leaders, this is significant.<a name=478:12></a>
