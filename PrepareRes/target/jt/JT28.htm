		DIVINE WISDOM OPERATING AGAINST APOSTASY (1)

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#14:1">2 Samuel  14:1</a> - 33
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:4></a> I was thinking of the working of wisdom as seen in 2 Samuel, so that we might understand how it comes in, in meeting the apostasy at the present time.<a name=1:5></a> Beginning with chapter 14 the subject runs on to chapter 20.<a name=1:6></a> I understand it is a question of the development of wisdom, in view, typically, of the antichristian uprising typified in Absalom.<a name=1:7></a> I thought this would be a suitable chapter to introduce the subject, because it lays bare the motives underlying the return of Absalom.<a name=1:8></a> The initiative lay with Joab; it was not that he cared for Absalom -- he did not.<a name=1:9></a> His thought was to ingratiate himself with the king, to enhance his own importance.<a name=1:10></a> It helps to see that in this section David generally represents what is of God in the Christian profession, rather than Christ Himself.<a name=1:11></a> At times he appears as a type of Christ, of course.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=1:13></a> Joab did not really care for Absalom.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:15></a> He cared about no one but himself; he was thinking of his own reputation and distinction.<a name=1:16></a> He wanted to be in the favour of the king as long as the king was in power.<a name=1:17></a> I think that he is a type of those influences that have opened the door to antichristian agents in Christendom, especially in the Protestant area.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:19></a> Would you say that they all had themselves and their own glory before them?<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:21></a> That is right; they did not know what the result would be, that is, the burning of the barley field.<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=2:1></a> The food for the people of God would be destroyed on those principles.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:3></a> More than that; it has reference to the Lord -- to the Person of Christ.<a name=2:4></a> That is what these antichristian principles are dealing with; that is what they are really at.<a name=2:5></a> Joab did not bargain for it; he represents the 'orthodox', but out of selfish motives he opens the door for the admittance of these agents of evil.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:7></a> Would the barley field suggest Christ in resurrection?<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:9></a> Barley implies the firstfruits.<a name=2:10></a> I think that in Joab's field it would not represent the whole thought; it would not go beyond Christ as He was here.<a name=2:11></a> As cut down and presented as a sheaf (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>) it would be Christ in resurrection.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:13></a> Would it be what came out here in the Lord's person?<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:15></a> It was Joab's growing, typically; he was orthodox.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:17></a> Would you give us a word as to what is antichristian?<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:19></a> Well, you can see in Absalom indications of it.<a name=2:20></a> He was a very attractive man.<a name=2:21></a> He is described here as very fine in appearance; such a man as would appeal to the young -- to the natural mind.<a name=2:22></a> There was no one in Israel so much praised for his beauty -- he was <i>praised</i>.<a name=2:23></a> Much is made of his head and the hair he grew -- the weight of it.<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=2:25></a> It says there was not a blemish in him, he was so comely.<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:27></a> That would be an indication of the antichrist.<a name=2:28></a> He will be a very wonderful man; people will wonder after him.<a name=2:29></a> But it was not that he (Absalom) had any attraction for Joab -- he had not.<a name=2:30></a> Absalom, however, represents the features of antichrist as they appear now, rather than the person himself.<a name=2:31></a>
	</div>

		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:1></a> Would you say it was a question with Joab of getting Absalom back without touching the sin question?<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:3></a> That is the point; the sin question is not dealt with at all in Joab's reckoning.<a name=3:4></a> And what you will notice is that he hires an agent, and that a woman having a reputation for wisdom, and he puts words into her mouth.<a name=3:5></a> I suppose he typifies those who are in a position today to bring in such men.<a name=3:6></a> The woman has no liberty as to what she is to say; he puts the words in her mouth (verse 3).<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:8></a> In the New Testament language, she is a vessel "to dishonour", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:20">2 Timothy  2:20</a>.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:10></a> Had you in your mind the thought of a system -- a religious system that would work on that line?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:12></a> What the woman says (verse 14) was intended to be orthodox, what David could accept.<a name=3:13></a> Indeed, it is often used as a gospel text.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:15></a> True things are not always the truth.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:17></a> They get a twist in the mouths of persons who are governed by wrong motives.<a name=3:18></a> Paul speaks about serving God in the glad tidings <i>in his spirit</i>.<a name=3:19></a> It is not simply in word or doctrine, but in <i>spirit</i>; but that is not in this chapter.<a name=3:20></a> The spirit of Joab is ambition, and the spirit of the woman is that of an hireling, and the result is the bringing in of a murderer without repentance.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:22></a> In speaking of what is antichristian, is there a certain weakening on the part of David that makes room for it?<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:24></a> The breakdown of David is the antecedent to this.<a name=3:25></a> He is never again what he was before, he is weak -- right in his motives, but weak.<a name=3:26></a> I suppose he represents those who are seeking to be for God at the present time.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:28></a> Would you connect that with the government of God?<a name=3:29></a>

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:1></a> Oh, surely.<a name=4:2></a> After the breakdown of the church it never, even in the remnant, regains its former greatness or power.<a name=4:3></a> What marks the whole position here is David's weakness.<a name=4:4></a> It is unaccountable that such a man should be so wanting in watchfulness that all this terrible uprising should occur, he being there with his mighty men.<a name=4:5></a> But in the light of the antitype it is intelligible enough.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:7></a> I suppose that at the beginning things were held by the apostles in the power of the Spirit.<a name=4:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:9></a> John says, "they went out from among us"; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:19">1 John  2:19</a> instead of coming in they are seen going out.<a name=4:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> Yes, but they were met by apostolic energy; they were not unchallenged, as in later days.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:15></a> This line of things leads up to the burning of the barley field.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:17></a> Yes; it is very solemn.<a name=4:18></a> David is increasingly encumbered, but his weakness was apparent, and Joab saw that his leanings were toward Absalom.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:20></a> Would it be natural affection that Joab worked on with David?<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:22></a> No doubt it was.<a name=4:23></a> He went to all this trouble with the woman; he knew how to get at David.<a name=4:24></a> There was an absence of righteousness.<a name=4:25></a> It was quite right, of course, that the banished should be brought back, and that means should be devised; God does that, but what kind of means does He use?<a name=4:26></a> not such as we get here, it must be on the ground of righteousness.<a name=4:27></a> Any leanings towards Absalom must be on the ground of righteousness.<a name=4:28></a> David, above all men, should have known this.<a name=4:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:30></a> Does David represent that which is supposed to stand for God -- the church?<a name=4:31></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:2></a> It says in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>, "pursue righteousness".<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:4></a> That is the <i>first</i> thing to be followed.<a name=5:5></a> Whatever feelings you may have, the wise course is to follow righteousness first, but it is coupled with faith and love and peace -- four things.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:7></a> These qualities were absent in Joab because he had himself before him.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:9></a> He was allowed to continue until Solomon's reign, when judgment was meted out to him, the immediate occasion of it being that he turned after Adonijah.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:11></a> Yes; he represents cleverness in the things of God -- orthodox cleverness.<a name=5:12></a> This is sure to be coupled with unrighteousness.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:14></a> It was a humbling thing in the case of David that he gave way here.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:16></a> Very humbling, especially in view of what he represents -- what exists today -- as we have been saying.<a name=5:17></a> The very fact that Joab was behind the woman's speech ought to have condemned it in the eyes of a man like David.<a name=5:18></a> We are reminded here of our exposure to damaging influence through clever flattery.<a name=5:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:20></a> Does this indicate that David had not got right with God?<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:22></a> Well, it appears that he had not regained the spiritual perception that he had.<a name=5:23></a> There is evident a peculiar combination of weaknesses.<a name=5:24></a> As already said, this is intelligible in view of what marks the people of God today.<a name=5:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:4></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>seems to indicate that he had judged things, but there must have been some hidden motives, otherwise we can hardly conceive that in full restoration he would have made a mistake like this.<a name=6:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:10></a> Quite so; he should have gone, but stayed at home; hence the breakdown.<a name=6:11></a> What we have before us is the <i>moral</i> consequence; but the result of David's sin from the standpoint of grace is Solomon.<a name=6:12></a> Solomon is out of view in these chapters; he exists, but he is not in view.<a name=6:13></a> What is in view in connection with the work of God is the working out of the thing he represents.<a name=6:14></a> Solomon represents the wisdom of God, but the wisdom of God in public display.<a name=6:15></a> In the meantime, there is the working out of wisdom in other connections; that is, at the present time, in the face of the awful breakdown in the testimony, God has come in, as we shall see in the later chapters, and He meets the antichristian uprising by wisdom.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As this proceeds we have to accept the solemn fact that He allows the introduction of such men as Absalom, and that this has come about through orthodox persons -- persons holding the truth ostensibly -- those who are professedly true to David, but only in order to enhance their own position.<a name=6:17></a> In our weakness true Christians, being governed by natural feelings, give way to them.<a name=6:18></a>

		Ques.<a name=7:1></a> Would you say that these upheavals worked out the desire in David's heart to build God an house?<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:3></a> They did; he had the desire to build for God before, but the result is reached in Solomon, who came in on God's part, in grace.<a name=7:4></a> In Chronicles we see how David reached the thought of God through discipline occasioned by his failures.<a name=7:5></a> But on the other hand we see here how the enemy works on what is natural in us.<a name=7:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:7></a> Do you also suggest that the weakness was in regard to natural relationships?<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:9></a> Yes.<a name=7:10></a> Joab succeeded on that line here.<a name=7:11></a> Thus we are warned as to the danger of allowing natural feelings in the things of God; through this the door is opened to the enemy.<a name=7:12></a> This woman's speech may be taken to represent what is orthodox -- what any person might accept, for it is true that we "are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again".<a name=7:13></a> It is true, but it is not the whole truth.<a name=7:14></a> In the first book of Samuel we read that the children of Israel drew water and poured it out before Jehovah (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:6">1 Samuel  7:6</a>); this represented the people in self-judgment.<a name=7:15></a> Samuel offered up a sucking lamb.<a name=7:16></a> That involves the gospel.<a name=7:17></a> This woman speaks about water being spilt, this is man's state, but pouring it out before the Lord is owning it -- repentance.<a name=7:18></a> Christ (the sucking lamb) is the answer, which God accepts.<a name=7:19></a> The rights of God are thus maintained.<a name=7:20></a> Popular evangelisation, to a large extent, brings back man without repentance.<a name=7:21></a> You hear of people being brought back in thousands, but what about the rights of God?<a name=7:22></a> What about repentance?<a name=7:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:26></a> Quite so; popular service makes much of appearance, but God is not looking at this.<a name=7:27></a> He is looking at man's heart -- what the motives are.<a name=7:28></a> The

		J.T.<a name=27:1></a> It may be remarked that the object of our taking up this subject is to see how the wisdom of God works to meet the current antichristian activities.<a name=27:2></a> As already said, David in the main throughout this section represents what is of God in the Christian profession.<a name=27:3></a> Sometimes he rises into a type of Christ, but generally he typifies what is of God in the Christian profession.<a name=27:4></a> This includes his great failure in chapter 11, and then his want of discernment and exposure to deception in the following chapters, for, alas!<a name=27:5></a> even the saints are marked by these things.<a name=27:6></a> So that the enemy attacks us, as knowing our weakness in the way of natural inclinations; sometimes amounting to positive sin, but generally exposure to flattery, the saints being sometimes marked by natural feelings.<a name=27:7></a> So that Joab, as we had before us yesterday, discerned that the king's heart longed for Absalom.<a name=27:8></a> That is, the natural dominated the king's desire; he was not thinking that righteousness should govern Absalom's return.<a name=27:9></a> Thus he is exposed to Joab's machinations; and the woman's speech, which Joab put into her mouth, included an appeal, not only to David's affections, but to his vanity.<a name=27:10></a> She tells him he is as an angel of God, that his judgment is always right; whilst at the same time he was receiving her wrong thoughts, and being deceived by her.<a name=27:11></a> Over against that, what comes out in this section is that, in adversity, what is distinctively of God comes to light.<a name=27:12></a> Adversity brings out what is of God in David in every case.<a name=27:13></a> Before Joab's appeal to his natural feelings he breaks down, but God comes in in discipline, and this brings out the latent features

		J.T.<a name=43:1></a> In considering these chapters as types of our own times -- the people of God in the present dispensation -- it should be noted that they do not present consecutive history, but rather different views of the saints, of our position and circumstances; so that in this chapter we have another viewpoint.<a name=43:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have been considering David as representative of what is of God in the profession, marked on the one hand by exposure to deception through natural feelings and affections; and on the other hand, as a subject of the work of God, seen in times of trial and discipline.<a name=43:3></a> So that the work of God in David shines in the exit, or flight, from Jerusalem; it shines there more than elsewhere.<a name=43:4></a> There is a thorough acceptance of the discipline of God at the brook Kidron, at the ascent of Olivet, and in the worship of God at the summit.<a name=43:5></a> That is one view; it is a most delightful view because it shows what is possible, what God effects among His people.<a name=43:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we have still the capability of being deceived; when a true lover of Christ, Mephibosheth, was slandered by his servant, David accepted the slander.<a name=43:7></a> Over against that you have the railing of Shimei, who is of the house of Saul, which again brings out the work of God in David, who humbly accepted His governmental dealings.<a name=43:8></a>

		Ques.<a name=56:1></a> Would you say a little for the benefit of those who were not here this morning?<a name=56:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=56:3></a> We read chapter 18 this morning, which, as you will observe, gives an account of the final stage of the conflict between David's forces and those of Absalom.<a name=56:4></a> What developed was, that those responsible to lead were governed by mixed motives.<a name=56:5></a> David was indefinite, being prepossessed with his love for Absalom.<a name=56:6></a> He was governed by natural feeling and affection, and so was indefinite, with the result that the battlefield was badly chosen and many lives were unnecessarily sacrificed.<a name=56:7></a> The command was divided into three parts instead of being directly centred in David, who was responsible, and who, indeed, was best qualified as a military leader.<a name=56:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The battle took place in the wood of Ephraim, and more people were destroyed by the trees than by the sword; this should not have happened.<a name=56:9></a> The door was thus opened to Joab, who, as we have already noticed, was governed by personal motives, having his own reputation before him; so that he, through David's weakness, acquired the dominating position.<a name=56:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We noted that these records are not consecutive, as typifying the current history of the people of God, but rather present different views.<a name=56:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we had in chapter 18 refers to the conflict and the principles that should govern us.<a name=56:12></a> The conflict we shall have as the testimony continues.<a name=56:13></a> Joab acquired a dominant position amongst them, all due to the weakness of the element that was directly responsible to God, and fitted to lead.<a name=56:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=57>[Page 57]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we noted, in the end of the chapter, another feature of our present position, that is, the carrying of messages.<a name=57:1></a> The victory, involving the death of Absalom, had to be reported to David, and Joab is now typical of one in a position to give a message.<a name=57:2></a> Ahimaaz says, "Let me run" We noted the disposition of young brothers to "run anyway" Whereas Joab had pointed out that the message was not suited to him in that the king's son was dead, but Ahimaaz says, Let me run, and he <i>did</i> run, but he had no definite message, so that when he arrived he had to stand on one side -- a humiliating thing.<a name=57:3></a> The Cushite was fitted for the message; although not so fast a runner, he had a message.<a name=57:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=57:5></a> I thought what you said about those who suffered through the trees was important; in a crisis side issues arise, and people are carried away by them.<a name=57:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=57:7></a> Quite so; I think it should be well noted that in conflict the effort should be to avoid unnecessary losses.<a name=57:8></a> Losses there must be; if there is opposition to the truth there has to be discipline, but these scriptures show that the effort should be to restrict it -- to reduce it to a minimum.<a name=57:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=57:10></a> So that the spirit in which the conflict is carried on is important, there should be a desire to save the brethren.<a name=57:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=57:12></a> The culminating feature is in the wise woman at Abel, she reduced the loss to one -- the chief offender; chapter 20:16 - 22.<a name=57:13></a> She did it in her wisdom.<a name=57:14></a> I believe it is in this woman's wisdom that we see the point of all this instruction.<a name=57:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=57:18></a> I thought that in this chapter we might see that another exercise is in view; it is the 'reconstruction' period.<a name=57:19></a> There always has to be such a period after a conflict, because everything is affected.<a name=57:20></a> All the people of God are affected in a conflict for the

		testimony, and there has to be a rearrangement according to what has been brought to light.<a name=58:1></a> There should be some spoil out of every conflict.<a name=58:2></a> So that now it is a question of David's return to Jerusalem, and Jordan involves an exercise in these new circumstances; death has to be accepted.<a name=58:3></a> It is stated "Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.<a name=58:4></a> And all the people were at strife throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of .<a name=58:5></a>.<a name=58:6></a>.<a name=58:7></a> the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land because of Absalom.<a name=58:8></a> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle; and now why are ye silent as to bringing the king back?<a name=58:9></a>" (verses 9,10).<a name=58:10></a> It was a sorrowful situation, but not a hopeless one, for the chief offender was out of the way.<a name=58:11></a> And now David is coming back into his place, so that we have the thoughts of many hearts revealed, showing what has been effected in those who came to meet him.<a name=58:12></a> It is the time of readjustment, and we find our places according to what we have gained in the exercise.<a name=58:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=58:14></a> It is very important that in every crisis, although we may not go through it intelligently, yet we should feel we gain something.<a name=58:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=58:16></a> Something comes to light that has to be definitely noted in a crisis, and I think that what came to light in David was his undue attention to natural affection.<a name=58:17></a> When Absalom was slain, he referred to him <i>eight</i> times as "his son" calling him "My son, my son" showing how obsessed he was, and that is the secret that God would bring to light.<a name=58:18></a> There is always something underneath that comes to light, and David exposes himself in bewailing Absalom so many times as his son.<a name=58:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=58:20></a> Attention was called to the spirit that animated Joab, and the spirit that was shared by the ten armour-bearers.<a name=58:21></a> That we should carry a right spirit is a very important thing.<a name=58:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=59:1></a> I think we noted that the point was that they were <i>his</i> men -- Joab's men; it comes to light in this chapter that he had a band associated specially with him, so that when Amasa was slain, one of Joab's men said, "He that favours Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab" <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#20:11">2 Samuel  20:11</a>; he places Joab before David, showing that Joab was a party man; he had more concern about himself than about David.<a name=59:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=59:5></a> Yes; readjustment is proceeding, and David makes plain that he intends to supersede Joab, but he is not able to do it.<a name=59:6></a> That is to say, in the government of God the effect of his weakness stands.<a name=59:7></a> Joab regains his place as head of the army.<a name=59:8></a> In the end of chapter 20 Joab is said to be over all the host of Israel; that was not David's intent, but he was unable to prevent it -- a very humiliating experience for a king.<a name=59:9></a> Nevertheless, what we get here is, one and another coming into evidence in relation to David's return.<a name=59:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=59:13></a> I think all this instruction in connection with the wise woman lays the ground for Solomon's reign.<a name=59:14></a> The wise woman of Abel through her wisdom delivered the city; her thought was to save all except the offender.<a name=59:15></a> Solomon was governed by that principle (see <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#3">1 Kings  3</a>); he would not allow the child to be cut in two; he brought to light in his wisdom the mother of the child.<a name=59:16></a> The mother would have the child whole even if given to another.<a name=59:17></a> That is the thing to get hold of; your great thought is not to divide the saints; you preserve the truth, but you preserve the saints with it.<a name=59:18></a> That brings to light the mother of the child.<a name=59:19></a> And for that wisdom is essential.<a name=59:20></a>

		I have been encouraged to turn to Isaiah, and to these chapters, as indicating how the truth is developed in a remnant of God's people.<a name=74:1></a> And when I refer to a remnant I do not mean a part -- a fragment; it is not in this way that the idea is treated in Scripture.<a name=74:2></a> In <i>principle</i>, it embraces the whole, for it contains the substance.<a name=74:3></a> According to chapter 6 the 'trunk' -- a figure taken from the terebinth -- remains, although felled (verse 13).<a name=74:4></a> And thus in the remnant is said to be the "holy seed"; that which is of God in the nature of a seed for productiveness is there, the "holy seed" is said to be the trunk of it.<a name=74:5></a> And so chapter 7 takes up the thought and follows it through the immediately succeeding chapters.<a name=74:6></a> In chapter 9 there is the recognition of Christ as on their side: "Unto <i>us</i> a child is born, unto <i>us</i> a son is given"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I wish to emphasise is the development of the truth as involving headship, and the patience of God.<a name=74:7></a> Some of us take little account of the patience of God in His dealings with us.<a name=74:8></a> We are moved at times by ministry, but we overlook what it has cost God to provide it.<a name=74:9></a> Whatever comes to us in the way of ministry, refreshment and edification, is from God.<a name=74:10></a> He is constantly taking account of our needs, not only the current needs, but coming ones.<a name=74:11></a> So that in view of the continuance of the testimony here, God is now preparing for it.<a name=74:12></a> In making this provision He selects His own vessels, and in due course His selection comes to light.<a name=74:13></a> We may quarrel with it; this is inevitable if the flesh works, but in result we shall see that God's selection is wise.<a name=74:14></a> And so, in dealing with the remnant here He approaches

		those responsible, but He approaches them for their encouragement; "the house of David" is mentioned.<a name=75:1></a> True enough Ahaz was of the lineage of David, but I think there is more than that in the reference.<a name=75:2></a> God was still standing by that house.<a name=75:3></a> "It was told the house of David" that there was a confederacy against him, and he was moved as the trees of the forest are moved by the wind.<a name=75:4></a> It is well indeed to take account of evil; it is not wise to ignore it, especially a confederacy.<a name=75:5></a> A confederacy is the most potent of all opposition to God; organised opposition is the most serious.<a name=75:6></a> And so you find in the gospel of Matthew, which is calculated to meet this, in support of the testimony in the assembly, that the Lord deals with <i>twos</i>.<a name=75:7></a> Indeed, this number is employed on the side of evil as well as of good.<a name=75:8></a> The evil is met by the good on its own ground.<a name=75:9></a> Thus we have "two of you" -- two of the assembly -- as over against two demoniacs, two blind men, etc.<a name=75:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the prophet is indicating patience and that, dear brethren, is what I wish to emphasise -- the patience of God; how He will not pass over those responsible; He would treat them with the utmost kindness, giving them all due credit.<a name=75:11></a> Ahaz is of the house of David, and his heart is moved; he has no means of meeting the confederacy, which proves that he had not been accustomed to rely on the power of God; but God would assure him of His interest in him.<a name=75:12></a> How often it is that we are unable to cope with the confederacy through which the enemy would attack us!<a name=75:13></a> Therefore the word is, "Fear not" I want to show that the secret of that lay in Ahaz understanding the headship of these confederacies, for all must turn on this ultimately.<a name=75:14></a> "For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin .<a name=75:15></a>.<a name=75:16></a>.<a name=75:17></a> and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son" verses 8,9.<a name=75:18></a> What kind of heads were these?<a name=75:19></a> Attention is called

		What you get in the epistle to the Corinthians is the development of wisdom.<a name=76:3></a> The way out, in every difficulty, is by wisdom.<a name=76:4></a> Now, Corinthians does not give you headship fully, it leads you up to it, I mean collectively.<a name=76:5></a> It teaches that Christ is made that unto us: "Who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption"; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a> but that is objective, that is what He is.<a name=76:6></a> He is available to us as wisdom.<a name=76:7></a>

		But then, as the man must lead, the apostle says, "Christ is the head of every man" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:3">1 Corinthians  11:3</a>.<a name=76:8></a> It is an individual matter: before I can arrive at what is collective I have got to know Christ as my own Head.<a name=76:9></a> Every brother, therefore, is responsible to come into the apprehension of Christ as his Head.<a name=76:10></a> In that fact he has got a certain superiority over his wife -- he is <i>her</i> head, for God would put things right in our households.<a name=76:11></a> If things are not right in our houses they will not be right in the assembly, and so Christ is Head to the man.<a name=76:12></a> It is man there in contrast to woman.<a name=76:13></a> He begins to discover the superiority of wisdom in the ruling of his house; his superiority must lie in wisdom, and Christ is become his Head for that.<a name=76:14></a> So that, whatever mistakes have been made, there is a way out, or rather I should say, a way <i>back</i>, for it is ever thus, and the retracing of steps is humiliating.<a name=76:15></a> It may be, indeed, that things have been done that cannot be undone, and the government of God goes on, but certainly where there has been deflection, wisdom leads us to retrace our steps.<a name=76:16></a> It is in the retracing of steps taken in folly that we show we are learning wisdom; it is humiliating, but wholesome.<a name=76:17></a>

		I have it before me to speak to you about the cross.<a name=84:3></a> You will observe in chapter 19 it is said that certain ones stood by the cross of Jesus, and I read from chapter 12, having in mind to link on the verses read from that chapter with those in chapter 19.<a name=84:4></a> I might, indeed, refer to earlier passages in this gospel, where the cross is alluded to without naming it, as in chapter 3, for example, but I wish to speak of it as specially called attention to by the Lord in chapter 12 -- as the evangelist explains, "This he said, signifying by what death he was about to die" <i>What death</i>?<a name=84:5></a> The cross.<a name=84:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I may remark is that this subject, extensive as it is in the epistles as well as in the gospels, bears particularly towards the western world.<a name=84:7></a> The apostle, as most of you will remember, introduces it very early in his first letter to the saints at Corinth.<a name=84:8></a> He speaks of "the word of the cross" -- mark <i>the word</i> of it!<a name=84:9></a> "The word of the cross" he says, "is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:18">1 Corinthians  1:18</a> -- that is to say, a class of persons known as the <i>saved</i> -- "it is God's power" (chapter 1:18); and then later he alludes to it, that is, to Christ crucified, in regard to the saints viewed in another way -- "to those that [are] <i>called</i>, both Jews and Greeks" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:24">1 Corinthians  1:24</a>; to them it is the power of God, and the wisdom of God.<a name=84:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I said, its bearing is towards the west, speaking, of course, from the standpoint of the origin, geographically, of the testimony; not that

		one would stress unduly the geographical thought, but we are bound, in dealing with the testimony of God to follow the Scriptures, and if we do, we must take account of it.<a name=85:1></a> The division of the race -- of the families of Noah -- was not accidental.<a name=85:2></a> God looked a long way ahead in His governmental orderings.<a name=85:3></a> Although He had concealed the church (for "it is the glory of God to conceal a thing" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:2">Proverbs  25:2</a>), although He had kept it there hidden for the ages, He always had it in His own mind, and in His governmental orderings He never lost sight of it; so that we find before the testimony actually reached the west, as we speak of it, the Holy Spirit was peculiarly active in the way of limitation.<a name=85:4></a> We have to learn negatively as we have to learn positively.<a name=85:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>, therefore, the apostle Paul was forbidden to speak the word in Asia.<a name=85:6></a> The word <i>was</i> preached in that province later, but at this particular juncture he was forbidden to speak it there.<a name=85:7></a> And then again he had it in mind to go into Bithynia to preach and "the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:7">Acts  16:7</a> Then, further, we are told that the Macedonian man was seen by him in a vision, saying, "Pass over into Macedonia and help us" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:9">Acts  16:9</a> Thus you see how geographical positions were in view, and so the apostle, concluding that the Lord would have him to go to Macedonia, came westward.<a name=85:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I am saying involves more than may appear on the surface; it involves that, whilst the field is the world which the Lord has acquired a right to by redemption, having already had title to it creationally, and that whilst He commissioned His apostles to go "into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:15">Mark  16:15</a>), yet He reserved His rights, as I may say, as the Prince of the princes of the Levites, so that no one -- not even a Paul -- was a free-lance; there is no such thought warranted in the Scriptures; the most gifted, the

		But what we find here in John's gospel is not that.<a name=86:8></a> What we find is Greeks coming up to see Jesus -- not as having been born merely, but as well known in His public ministry; and they say to Philip, "Sir, we desire to see Jesus" and the Lord says in answer to the desire expressed by them, "The hour is come" -- not that the King of the Jews should reign, but "that the <i>Son of man</i> should be glorified" They approach Philip who, the Holy Spirit tells us, was of Bethsaida -- a Galilean; and Philip tells Andrew, who was of the same city, and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus, their

		And then in this gospel, need I comment on the wonderful message which was sent to the disciples, again by a woman?<a name=93:1></a> What is so touching about it is that she assumed not to be directly sent to the disciples.<a name=93:2></a> It says she "comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had said these things to her" <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:18">John  20:18</a> She delivers her message in a most comely way; she had the light before the others.<a name=93:3></a> And then here, as I said, there is the principle of confidingness on the part of the Lord in those who were standing by the cross.<a name=93:4></a> Is it not an incentive to draw near to the cross, not only to hear the word of it, but to boast in it?<a name=93:5></a> As we do this, we may be assured that we shall prove that the Lord confides in us.<a name=93:6></a> So John is entrusted with the Lord's mother.<a name=93:7></a>

		Then another thing with regard to John is that it says, "But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.<a name=93:8></a> And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true, that ye also may believe" <a href="../bible/John.htm#19:34">John  19:34</a>,35 He was a <i>witness</i> of the blood and the water that flowed from the riven side of Christ.<a name=93:9></a> He was such an one as could speak of it, as having seen it.<a name=93:10></a> Now that is another great matter.<a name=93:11></a> There are two ideas in the thought of witness, one is that I am competent, as having seen the thing, and the other is that I am called upon to bear testimony, or witness.<a name=93:12></a> And so, beloved brethren, as standing by the cross, we shall be witnesses of much; we shall not present things merely as having heard, we shall be able to say, "I know" We were speaking lately about the public assembly -- that the first speakings in it were marked by certainty.<a name=93:13></a> The assembly of God should indeed be marked in that way -- not only by order, but by the things that are said: they "found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together, saying, The Lord is indeed risen"; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:33">Luke  24:33</a>,34 there was certainty as in it.<a name=93:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=95:1></a> I thought we might look briefly at the tabernacle as presented in Exodus and Leviticus this morning, and in Numbers this afternoon, so that we may see something of the largeness and elevation morally of that in which God dwells, and how it is inclusive of the universe; and then that as dwelling in it, He calls out of it.<a name=95:2></a> In Leviticus, it is not only that He spoke out of it, but He <i>calls</i> -- the latter thought underlies the assembly.<a name=95:3></a> He forms those who are called, not only out of the world, but in relation to that in which God is.<a name=95:4></a> Not only did the people need to be delivered out of Egypt, but they needed to be delivered out of the smallness of human thoughts, however extended -- deliverance out of mere national or local feeling, into the greatness of the realm in which God has placed Himself and in which He lives.<a name=95:5></a> It is only as we hold ourselves locally in relation to the whole divine system that we see things aright.<a name=95:6></a> So it occurred to me the Lord might help us in the consideration of the subject, in a brief way, great as it is; that, delivering us out of the world, He would also deliver us out of the smallness of our own thoughts.<a name=95:7></a> Thus we are on a higher plane in chapter 25 of Exodus than we are earlier.<a name=95:8></a> Moses, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the elders of Israel were taken up, and they saw the God of Israel and what was under His feet.<a name=95:9></a> Thus we get an elevated view, and then that in which God would dwell and is to be known.<a name=95:10></a> Whatever may be the responsibilities locally, our thoughts are never to be less than that which is presented in relation to God.<a name=95:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=114:1></a> It is evident that, as in Exodus, we have the dwelling, that in which God is with us -- dwells with us, so Leviticus gives us how we are to be <i>with Him</i>, hence the call out of the tabernacle, or tent of meeting, as it should read; then how those who answer to the call are to be with God -- the terms on which we are to be with Him.<a name=114:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Numbers is the <i>public</i> position, how we are to be <i>for</i> God and in connection with the latter the love shown in the divine way of being with us in all the vicissitudes of the wilderness journey -- the love, patience and grace that shine in the divine manner in the wilderness, so that the book is really, as we might say, in the wilderness.<a name=114:3></a> I believe the original title, at least a certain title given to the book, was simply, "In the wilderness" The book opens with God speaking in the wilderness, He speaks out of a tent, but it was in the wilderness.<a name=114:4></a> And so the numbering is said to be in the wilderness of Sinai, and the first movement is from one wilderness to another; chapter 10:12.<a name=114:5></a> Thus we are with God, or rather God is with us in circumstances in which there is nothing for the flesh; and in connection with this, we have military units and orderings involving local responsibility; so that while the love of God is put to the test, and answers to it perfectly in these circumstances, our love is also tested, for the wilderness brings out where we are, and what we are.<a name=114:6></a>

		<a name=115>[Page 115]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=115:1></a> Well, that is right.<a name=115:2></a> The second verse (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#1">Leviticus  1</a>) begins the subject of the terms: "When any man of you presenteth an offering to Jehovah, ye shall present your offering of the cattle, of the herd, and of the flock" <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#1:2">Leviticus  1:2</a> That leads on to what may be regarded as the divine requirements, the terms upon which we, from our side, are to be with Him, to approach Him.<a name=115:3></a> The requirements, while they take account of, and make provision for the majesty of God, also make provision for the minutest work of God in His people; the youngest and weakest is provided for as well as those who are most advanced.<a name=115:4></a> But one's thought was to dwell, not on the terms, but rather on the fact that God called out of the tabernacle; and then in Numbers to point out how the love of God comes in, typically, in the way in which He accepts the circumstances of His people, accommodating Himself, as it were, to them; so that He told David, who was minded to build Him an house, that He had not dwelt in a house since the day that He brought up Israel out of Egypt, "even to this day" but had walked in a tent, and in a tabernacle; <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:6">2 Samuel  7:6</a>.<a name=115:5></a> He had never had, as we may say, such accommodation as David had in mind to provide for Him; but He points out to David that He had accepted what there was; He had walked in a tent, for note, it is a matter of walking, not dwelling merely; there was very little restfulness in it; He walked in a tent with them and in a tabernacle.<a name=115:6></a> The allusion is to Numbers, to bring to our attention what divine love is as with us now, bearing with us, and putting up with all sorts of things, and yet finding its way to be with us.<a name=115:7></a> Numbers, therefore, opens with the speaking in the wilderness -- out of the tent, but <i>in the wilderness</i>.<a name=115:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=117:8></a> You get two beautiful touches in the type.<a name=117:9></a> Paul refers to one of them, "a spiritual Rock which followed [them]" furnishing drink and refreshment, "now the rock was the Christ" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:4">1 Corinthians  10:4</a> The rock went behind, and the ark went before; that is to say, all the pioneering work, involving the severest conflict and drudgery, so to speak, belonged to the Lord.<a name=117:10></a> The allusion, I suppose, to the rock which followed them gives the thought of water-carrying -- a sort of drudgery; divine love expressing itself thus.<a name=117:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>we find that the proper position of the ark was in the centre, the divine intent being that Christ should be honoured among the people, and that all should serve Him; He was to be in the very midst of the armies of Israel, surrounded by them.<a name=117:12></a> Instead of that, however, He breaks through the ordinary rule and goes before.<a name=117:13></a> It is a very remarkable thing that there is nothing said previously about the ark going before, showing how divine love reserves its own liberty.<a name=117:14></a> It acts from itself; as the Lord did when He sat at table, then rising from supper He laid aside His garments.<a name=117:15></a> Love would act thus, and He sets an example to us, that, instead of in any way preserving dignity or honour we may rather accept the drudgery.<a name=117:16></a> The whole idea of the system that

	<div class="paragraph">

		The New Testament, therefore, leaves us in no doubt as to what the book of Proverbs alludes to when it personifies Wisdom.<a name=132:4></a> In the letter to the Corinthians the subject is touched on.<a name=132:5></a> The position, the environment, and the antecedents of the saints in Corinth made it opportune that this subject should be introduced there.<a name=132:6></a> Being Greeks, they were conversant with the subject of wisdom, but it was largely, if not altogether, a matter of word, a matter of literary or oratorical composition.<a name=132:7></a> It was not the wisdom of God.<a name=132:8></a> What remains of it, certainly, is simply of that character, and the apostle expressly says that his preaching was not of that kind; he preached Christ crucified; the Jews had sought a sign, and the Greeks wisdom, but he had preached Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block, to the Greeks foolishness; but to those called, both from among the Jews and the Greeks, Christ was the wisdom of God; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:22">1 Corinthians  1:22</a> - 24.<a name=132:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will observe that in the passages I have read from the New Testament we have the worshippers of God alluded to, and I wish to show how these appear in a day such as is described in 2 Samuel, the Old Testament, as ever, serving to illustrate in the way of type and shadow what is presented in substance in the New.<a name=163:1></a> In the New Testament we have the substance, so that the result of this dispensation is seen in the heavenly city as coming down from God out of heaven having His glory; and, as measured, it is solid; it is a cube; it is not an abstract thing.<a name=163:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity is substance, all emanating from the Head -- from Christ.<a name=163:3></a> There was a demand for this throughout the Old Testament, and so in the coming in of the Lord Jesus as a man we have the substance; and the body, which may indeed be regarded as the substance now, is of Him.<a name=163:4></a> So that I selected the passage in 2 Samuel deliberately, as illustrating how worshippers of God appear in our own times -- times which correspond with what 2 Samuel presents in the section from which I have read -- times in which the public vessel of the testimony of God has failed, as of old David failed personally, and brought down upon himself, his house and his kingdom, these lamentable things which these chapters in 2 Samuel depict for us.<a name=163:5></a> We are in like circumstances, and the question in my mind in speaking to you now is, how is God to have His part?<a name=163:6></a> That He should have His part is obvious, and no Christian would deny it theoretically; but how it is to come about is not so clear.<a name=163:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We speak of the worship of God, meaning that He has His part, but Scripture rather stresses

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>worshippers</i> of God; it is a question of the persons, so that immediately I speak of the matter I have to inquire as to whether I am among the worshippers of God.<a name=164:1></a> John's gospel therefore fits in, calculated, as it is, to secure for God in a day of small things and brokenness what is His due.<a name=164:2></a> That gospel has a way of bringing in things without always naming them, though sometimes, as in this case, the thing is formally named.<a name=164:3></a> The woman brought in the subject.<a name=164:4></a> In the preceding chapter the Lord Jesus is said to be loved of the Father as the Son, and that all things have been given into His hands.<a name=164:5></a> Amongst these "all things" necessarily, is the service of God, involving what is due to Him.<a name=164:6></a> The Old Testament had indicated that there should be "a minister of the sanctuary"; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:2">Hebrews  8:2</a> it was indeed a prominent feature, and what comes out in regard of the one who represented this, namely, Aaron, is that he, as first introduced to us, is called "the Levite" He was the brother of Moses -- his senior by three years.<a name=164:7></a> We have no record as to how he acquired the distinction of being the Levite; it is not simply that he was of the tribe of Levi, for Moses was also, and <i>he</i> is not called the Levite.<a name=164:8></a> Aaron is called, not simply <i>a</i> Levite, but <i>the</i> Levite, which spiritually means that he had acquired the way of denying what is natural, preferring what is spiritual.<a name=164:9></a> That is what is said of Levi: "Who said to his father and to his mother, I see him not" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:9">Deuteronomy  33:9</a>); he on one hand could take his sword and smite his brother when the truth required it, and, on the other hand, present sweet incense to the nostrils of God.<a name=164:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now John's gospel presents the Lord according to this; it does not stress the official; it shows that the service of God was there before the time for the Lord's entering upon it officially; "for John was not yet cast into prison" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:24">John  3:24</a> we are told, as if attention was called to that.<a name=164:11></a> Our Lord was already the Levite,

		He was already cleansing the temple, He was already possessed with the zeal of the house of God, it was consuming Him, so that, according to the end of chapter 3 everything is formally given into His hands; He had, so to speak, qualified.<a name=165:1></a> This has not reference exactly to what He was divinely, but to what came out in Him as a man here, as I may say, spontaneously.<a name=165:2></a> It was His Father's house, and He was moved, and consumed with zeal as the Levite to have it cleansed, for it was unfit in its then condition for the holy service which it was in His heart should be rendered to God.<a name=165:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so this woman is undoubtedly guided, unknown to herself, perhaps, to bring in this subject -- a most unlikely person, for what is to be of God in a day of brokenness and corresponding religious pretension is sure to come out in connection with unlikely persons.<a name=165:4></a> God goes out of His way, as it were, to bring in persons whom the religious mind of the day would repudiate; He slights what is in religious prominence and distinction among men.<a name=165:5></a> He is not dependent upon men with all their education and training, antiquity and public show; He shows, not only that He has no appreciation of them, but that He can do without them, as He says to the wicked, "What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy mouth?<a name=165:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#50:16">Psalm  50:16</a>.<a name=165:7></a>) That is God's word for unconverted people essaying to be His ministers.<a name=165:8></a> He needs them not; He says, "If I were hungry, I would not tell thee"; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#50:12">Psalm  50:12</a> He has infinite resources.<a name=165:9></a> Such is God's holy independence of man in regard of His service.<a name=165:10></a>

		certain place, a habit which is very common.<a name=166:1></a> Where do you worship?<a name=166:2></a> people ask.<a name=166:3></a> The Lord says in effect, It is not a question of <i>place</i>, it is a question of <i>sate</i>.<a name=166:4></a> I am just dwelling on this for a moment as governing the whole subject of the worshippers of God.<a name=166:5></a> It is "neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem" There was a great difference of course between the Samaritan mountain and Jerusalem, and the Lord will never let go any distinction that God makes.<a name=166:6></a> If I look abroad at Christendom and take up the great religious bodies, I certainly am bound to make distinctions, for God does.<a name=166:7></a> The Lord makes a great distinction, for salvation was of the Jews.<a name=166:8></a> It is a question of the mind of God here, not of the state of the Jew, and there was much to be said in favour of the Jew as compared with the Samaritan, and no true intelligent Christian would deny or ignore what is to be said in favour of any person or body here; the Lord would put this woman in her place.<a name=166:9></a> If I am dealing with souls associated with what is grossly wicked, I should not fail to tell them; it is for their good, as you find in the addresses to the seven churches.<a name=166:10></a> The Lord has a word for each of them, and He does not fail to tell them of the extreme wickedness where it existed.<a name=166:11></a> But there were great distinctions, and we find that the Lord in every address commended what He could.<a name=166:12></a> And so here.<a name=166:13></a> But then what He wants to say is that the worshippers of God must worship <i>in spirit</i> and in truth.<a name=166:14></a> The whole religious system around us is brushed aside as at a stroke in regard of this.<a name=166:15></a> He says, Worship does not consist in place, in buildings, in what is material; it is a question of spirit and truth.<a name=166:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I want to point out briefly that the Lord is not speaking here of the Holy Spirit; He is speaking of spirit in contrast to what is material.<a name=166:17></a> What underlies it is the fact that "God [is] a Spirit" and that He has placed in man what corresponds with

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=167>[Page 167]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Himself.<a name=167:1></a> Man is spirit, soul and body, and if I am born again, as the Lord teaches earlier, "that which is born of the Spirit <i>is</i> spirit" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a> that is the kind of thing it is; that is to say, not only have I got a spirit as over against what I am materially, but that is augmented in that in my whole being morally I am born anew, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit; so that whilst every man has a spirit, he who is born anew is in <i>principle</i> spiritual, which could never be said of the natural man; he is that in principle and he begins to think spiritually; and, inasmuch as that in him called spirit relates to God, what he is as born anew thinks of God.<a name=167:2></a> The gift of living water is a further and immense addition to that.<a name=167:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this underlies what the Lord is teaching -- that I have a spirit; as being born anew I become spiritual in principle, but I have also living water which springs up.<a name=167:4></a> My own spirit does not spring up of itself, nor does that which is born of the Spirit of itself spring up, but the Spirit of God coming into the believer, on the ground of redemption, becomes in him a spring, and that spring has reference to God.<a name=167:5></a> And so the Lord here, as already the Minister of the new sanctuary, is bringing out the great principles that govern the worshippers of God; they are constituted spiritual.<a name=167:6></a> The Father had been seeking them; the Minister of the sanctuary knew it, and He is bringing them in, so that they worship Him in spirit and in truth; He seeks such.<a name=167:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to go on to Philippians to enlarge a little on the thing as it was at the outset.<a name=167:8></a> This (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>) is the light from the Lord's own lips, governing us as worshippers.<a name=167:9></a> The apostle, in writing to the Philippians, classifies the worshippers.<a name=167:10></a> There were those who were not that, and these were dangerous.<a name=167:11></a> They were dogs -- persons who prowl about, unclean; they were evil workmen, possibly nominal Christians, showing that workmanship is not everything, for

	<div class="paragraph">
		one may be working evilly; and then finally, the concision -- people who do not go all the way -- concision, not circumcision; and this enables the apostle to bring in his thought.<a name=168:1></a> He says, "<i>We</i> are the circumcision, who worship by [the] Spirit of God" It is not now a question simply of worshipping <i>in spirit</i>, it is a question of the <i>power</i> to worship.<a name=168:2></a> We have to give an account of ourselves.<a name=168:3></a> No truly spiritual people will advertise, but we may be asked questions, and so here you have the apostle giving an account of himself and of others in regard of this subject; they were worshippers, but of what kind and by what power?<a name=168:4></a> He says, "We are the circumcision" that is to say, we go the whole way spiritually.<a name=168:5></a> Now I would plead for this -- going all the road.<a name=168:6></a> Circumcision means that you go the whole way.<a name=168:7></a> The Lord is calling for that.<a name=168:8></a> The number will be reduced as you go forward undoubtedly.<a name=168:9></a> The apostle goes on to speak later of persons who walk, but they were the enemies of the cross of Christ; he referred to them weeping -- persons who did not go all the way, but rather were enemies of the cross.<a name=168:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=174:1></a> I have been thinking today about the Lord's supper as being representative of food, as it is also a memorial of the Lord.<a name=174:2></a> It occurred to me that perhaps it is less understood as food than it is as a memorial.<a name=174:3></a> Luke presents the memorial, having in mind that the Lord would be absent and that He should not be forgotten -- that there should be a means of calling Him to mind and thus giving Him place as Head.<a name=174:4></a> He therefore makes much of order as such -- the hour and placing; "when the hour was come" the Lord "<i>placed</i> himself at table" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:14">Luke  22:14</a> we read.<a name=174:5></a> This bears out the instructions of 1 Corinthians, where we have the same idea advanced and enlarged on in chapter 11, indicating how the supper is to be eaten, and our behaviour in it, lest we should attempt to partake of it in an unworthy or unsuitable manner.<a name=174:6></a> But Matthew, being the administrative gospel, has in view that it should be food, so that we should be sustained spiritually in the assembly; he therefore stresses the idea of eating, saying nothing about the memorial, but he records the going to the mount of Olives, as if the eating were to give spiritual strength for that.<a name=174:7></a> In the challenge as to the betrayal and also in introducing His supper, the disciples were eating; see verses 21 and 26.<a name=174:8></a> "As they did eat" and "as they were eating"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reading these verses, well known to most of us, I have in mind to speak about the unity of the Spirit, and I wish to remark at the outset that it stands connected, as I hope to show in the passage, with a fixed order of things.<a name=187:1></a> A fixed order of things has always stood connected with God's testimony.<a name=187:2></a> The principle appears at the outset in the heavens and the earth; there was stability connected with them, which stability could not be affected by anything occurring on the earth's surface or through man as placed upon it.<a name=187:3></a> Much is made of the foundations.<a name=187:4></a> Wisdom had to do with them, and as laid "the morning stars sang together, and all the Sons of God shouted for joy" <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>.<a name=187:5></a> A stable order of things was in view, so that in the Old Testament, at least, the earth is referred to as established for ever; God "built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:69">Psalm  78:69</a>.<a name=187:6></a> And so in introducing man upon it, God had a stable order of things in which His testimony was set -- not, indeed, that it was set in man, but nevertheless it was there, and there permanently, so as to be referred to.<a name=187:7></a> As man veered from his orbit there was always that which was stable and which God never failed to refer to as needed.<a name=187:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish that this may be laid hold of at the outset, for unless it is we shall be unduly uneasy, whereas God would have us to be assured.<a name=187:9></a> Hence in view of dark days we are told that the "foundation of God" stands sure, that is to say, there is stability, and stability in connection with which the testimony stands.<a name=187:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having said so much in regard of what is stable and to which I hope presently to return, I wish for a moment to speak of the great vessel -- Paul -- through whom those words which I have read have come to us.<a name=188:1></a> You will remember that in chapter 3 of this epistle he speaks of himself as "prisoner of the Christ Jesus" He was a prisoner, but not of the emperor; he was a prisoner of Christ Jesus.<a name=188:2></a> We can understand how restful he was as such; the Christ needed him for other work than that which he had essayed to do in making his way to Jerusalem.<a name=188:3></a> He was moved somewhat obviously by undue affection for his nation, and such undue affection can never make for the unity of the Spirit.<a name=188:4></a> Anything bordering on national feeling must be inimical to the unity of the Spirit.<a name=188:5></a> The Spirit is above and beyond all such feelings; and so we find with this great vessel that the Holy Spirit witnessed to him <i>in every city</i> that bonds and afflictions awaited him.<a name=188:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to note the words the Spirit of God uses, and the use made of the word 'city' in connection with Paul's ministry is of immense importance in the testimony.<a name=188:7></a> Elders had been appointed in cities and this was not for nothing, for we find that freedom was found in them for the Spirit, that through them even this great vessel could be reminded of what was ahead of him.<a name=188:8></a> Cities are areas of population to which God intended primarily to pay special attention.<a name=188:9></a> In the book of Proverbs (chapter 1:21) we are told that wisdom lifts up her voice "in the chief [place] of concourse" God in His consideration for men sets His testimony <i>there</i>.<a name=188:10></a> It is not only that it is there, but it is superior in organisation and power to man's organisation.<a name=188:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so we find that the Spirit of God witnessed to Paul in every city that bonds and afflictions awaited him.<a name=188:12></a> You can see therefore the importance of maintaining the divine order in cities so that there should

	<div class="paragraph">
		be room for the Spirit to bear witness, not only in any given city, but even in a general way, as in this case.<a name=189:1></a> His face was turned to Jerusalem, whereas Christ's activities were in the West and He had used the apostle, as he himself tells us, from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:19">Romans  15:19</a>.<a name=189:2></a> In the power of Christ he had witnessed in that immense region bearing towards the West -- the great Grecian system.<a name=189:3></a> But now his face was towards the East, towards Jerusalem, and so as he disregarded the testimony of the Spirit in the cities, he was taken prisoner in Jerusalem.<a name=189:4></a> The instrumentalities of the imprisonment and the fact that he appealed to Caesar are of small moment; he was the prisoner of the Christ for the Gentiles.<a name=189:5></a> In chapter 4 he tells us that he was the prisoner not of the Christ, but "in the Lord"; that is to say, he was not a felon, he was a prisoner <i>in</i> the Lord, as the better reading plainly states.<a name=189:6></a> Thus he is consciously, as you may say, able to appeal to these beloved Ephesians, and he appeals to them first in regard of their calling.<a name=189:7></a> He intended it to be a leverage in their souls; he intended that they should be touched by the wonderful place they had in the divine purpose; that they were to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with <i>long suffering</i>.<a name=189:8></a> And then he brings in another thought, "Using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace" You see the word 'unity' here opens up for us an immense range, and, in referring to the Old Testament as to the fixed order of things, I wish for a moment to show from it how this fixed order of things, that is to say, a <i>moral system</i> of things in connection with men, took form and became established as marking the Israelitish economy.<a name=189:9></a> And for that reason I specially call your attention to Joseph, as one who may be regarded as supremely suggestive, typically, of this great principle of endeavouring to

	<div class="paragraph">
		keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.<a name=190:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer briefly to the introduction of the elements of unity.<a name=190:2></a> They sprang from Jacob.<a name=190:3></a> There were twelve sons born of several mothers, and in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37">Genesis  37</a>the Spirit of God introduces the generations of Jacob.<a name=190:4></a> He had in mind to develop, in these generations, this great principle of unity; but only Joseph is given to us in that chapter, and many chapters intervene before we have the generations of Jacob, for the reason that the unity of the Spirit in the principle of it became sadly interfered with, so much so that the Holy Spirit drops the thought and fixes our attention on one of the sons of Jacob.<a name=190:5></a> Presently the murderous state of the others came to light; rivalry and envy culminating in hatred marked the ten.<a name=190:6></a> But in the presence of this, we have introduced in Joseph the sure means of the establishment of the unity of the Spirit, and so in relating his first dream he tells us that his sheaf stood up and the others did obeisance to it, that is to say, in the midst of this state of things you have power, a power to stand up -- a great principle throughout Scripture; for, as the unity of the Spirit is outwardly interfered with, the only hope is in the ability of someone to stand up.<a name=190:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not remark how this applies to the Lord throughout the gospels, both morally and in the power of life, as He rose from the dead.<a name=190:8></a> And so as we proceed in the history of Joseph we find that he brings about unity with the most marvellous skill going through the most excruciating sorrows and trials, he emerges therefrom into lordship and brings about in his brethren the unity of the Spirit in a most marvellous way, so that now the testimony moves on out of Canaan, not a unity of agreement to differ, but a unity of affection brought about under the influence of Joseph -- a unity, as we may say, in priesthood, so that Jacob is carried down into Egypt

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to say here, so as to make the matter clearer, that this is how matters began in Egypt.<a name=191:2></a> Lordship is established, and unity brought about under the influence of Joseph, and then the light of God covering their whole history, poured out into their ears from their father Jacob.<a name=191:3></a> What a picture!<a name=191:4></a> If it be a question only of the light of God coming to us, is that not an incentive to unity?<a name=191:5></a> For it is as the tribes are brought together in the unity of affection that the mind of God is opened up to them and they are blessed.<a name=191:6></a> Can we afford to forfeit these things by the intrusion of elements of discord and dislocation?<a name=191:7></a> Can we afford to trifle with these things?<a name=191:8></a> Think of what is in the heart of God for us!<a name=191:9></a> And so, as I said, you have a marvellous opening up in Jacob, the father of the twelve sons, of the mind of God, and then a blessing for each of them.<a name=191:10></a> "This is what their father spoke to them; and he blessed them: every one according to his blessing he blessed them" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:28">Genesis  49:28</a>.<a name=191:11></a> So that they are in Egypt possessed of the mind of God in unity, and <i>blessed</i>.<a name=191:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this, I may further add, makes room for <i>ministry</i>, and so the book of Exodus opens up the great subject of ministry.<a name=191:13></a> I am endeavouring to show you the great importance of unity, the unity of the Spirit.<a name=191:14></a> Think of the depths of the book of Exodus, of the wonderful provision made in the training of Moses and of Aaron for the ministry!<a name=191:15></a> In chapter 6 the Holy Spirit gives you the genealogy of the sons of Jacob until he arrives at Levi, for it is now a question of the ministry.<a name=191:16></a> The unity of the tribes has been secured.<a name=191:17></a> Can we afford to lose ministry from God?<a name=191:18></a> What should we do without it?<a name=191:19></a> And so the book of Exodus opens up to us the ministry, and from the ministry the sanctuary, and in connection with the sanctuary the establishment in type of a fixed order of things, for the tabernacle was a pattern,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show further how this great moral system (corresponding with <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:4">Ephesians  4:4</a> - 6) is pictured, vaguely it may be, in the typical books.<a name=192:3></a> First, we have one Lord.<a name=192:4></a> It is true that we have lordship in Joseph, but that was from the divine side "God" he says, "sent me <i>before you</i> to preserve you a remnant in the earth" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#45:7">Genesis  45:7</a> God acted from Himself apart from the people in setting up Joseph.<a name=192:5></a> But I want to speak of lordship in connection with Moses, for that is what we have to do with as entering into the mediatorial system which God has set up.<a name=192:6></a> Joseph was not lord in connection with a fixed order of things, Moses was, and he acquired that place on moral grounds; and so I would appeal to young people here for a moment as to how you regard Christ.<a name=192:7></a> What is He to you?<a name=192:8></a> You may refer me to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>and say, God has made Him Lord and Christ; but what have <i>you</i> made Him?<a name=192:9></a> <i>You</i> cannot make Him Lord and Christ in heaven, and you cannot make Him Lord and Christ over all things, but it is for you to do that in your own soul in regard of yourself.<a name=192:10></a> Hence in the epistles of Paul we have, "To <i>us</i> .<a name=192:11></a>.<a name=192:12></a>.<a name=192:13></a> one Lord, Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a> "Jesus Christ <i>our</i> Lord" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a> etc.<a name=192:14></a> It is said of Moses that he was "king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people And the tribes of Israel were gathered together" <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:5">Deuteronomy  33:5</a> that is to say, he acquired kingship in their affection, hence it came out, as we are told in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#14">Exodus  14</a>, "the people feared Jehovah, and believed in Jehovah, and in Moses his bondman" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#14:31">Exodus  14:31</a> The Holy Spirit enlarges on that for us in saying that they "all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:2">1 Corinthians  10:2</a>); they came under him there was one Lord, and the one act of faith attributed to them is that "by faith they passed through the

		Red Sea" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:29">Hebrews  11:29</a>.<a name=193:1></a> There was "one Lord, one faith, one baptism" The unity was developed in connection with that.<a name=193:2></a> In the altar set up by Moses and in the breastplate of the high priest you see unity in affection; and then finally, in the ordering of the tribes in relation to the new system, what came out was a change in the relative position of the tribes, that is to say, there was a test for them and they stood the test, for Judah had the first place.<a name=193:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see how God forecast, as worked out morally in the souls of the people of God, the establishment of a moral system that was to stand -- a stable thing.<a name=193:4></a> There was one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and in relation to that the unity of the tribes.<a name=193:5></a> And then as we might expect, there is the assertion in the book of Deuteronomy, "Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#12:29">Mark  12:29</a>; the unity of God is seen.<a name=193:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come back to my scripture (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>), so that you may see how simply the matter stands, and I would refer for a moment to the body.<a name=193:7></a> He says, "[There is] one body" Bearing in mind what I have said, you will see how this stands in the Acts in connection with the second concentric circle spoken of -- "one Lord, one faith, one baptism" I want to show you how that concentric circle does not refer to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>directly, but to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>; that this fixed order of things that is before us here refers to what has come about under Paul, not what was at Pentecost, great as that was.<a name=193:8></a> And so you find in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>that Saul sets out breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord.<a name=193:9></a> The Holy Spirit wishes to bring into evidence <i>what the Lord</i> can do.<a name=193:10></a> It was a question of the disciples of the Lord, and so the chapter develops for us what the Lord was to His people, and in the exercising of that power in regard of His people, in defence of His people and in providing for them, the great truth of the body comes to light, "Why dost thou persecute me?<a name=193:11></a>" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a> There

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it is!<a name=194:1></a> But then before we have the thing formally named we see it working out among the saints.<a name=194:2></a> It is a principle generally in Scripture that a thing is present before it is named, and so in the chapters that follow we have the working out of the principle of the body in circumstances that were opposed to it, and that militated against it, that is to say, Jewish feelings versus Gentile feelings.<a name=194:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want you to take notice of this, because, as I have already remarked, national feelings and sympathies, and local feelings and sympathies are inimical to the working out of this great principle of the body and of the unity of the Spirit.<a name=194:4></a> Hence in this chapter you find how the barriers are broken down, as I said before, in a moral way in a man like Barnabas -- a man for the moment, a man who had been surnamed by the apostles, "son of consolation" a man who although himself a Jew, a Levite by birth, could take account of what God was doing elsewhere, and who can appreciate it, and who can link things on in a living way; he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit, we read.<a name=194:5></a> He was identified in a practical way with what God was doing elsewhere, and he links all together.<a name=194:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now you find that at Antioch such conditions of unity existed that the truth of the one Spirit stood out.<a name=194:7></a> I have been speaking of the Holy Spirit witnessing in cities, but I wish to dwell for a moment on the exercise of His function in Antioch, so that we may see what we may miss by disregarding the unity of the Spirit.<a name=194:8></a> We find there men like Barnabas mentioned first, and Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.<a name=194:9></a> They were men from different parts of the world and from different stations of life, but they are all together ministering to the Lord.<a name=194:10></a> They were in Antioch, in the assembly there and the Holy Spirit speaks.<a name=194:11></a> I refer to it briefly so

	<div class="paragraph">
		that you may see how the one Spirit operates in relation to unity, practical unity, amongst the saints.<a name=195:1></a> "Separate me" He says, "Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:2">Acts  13:2</a> So that the one body is the first thing mentioned; it is a question, when I come to it practically, of myself.<a name=195:2></a> "[There is] one body, and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling" The body is composed of believers who have the Spirit.<a name=195:3></a> How do I stand in relation to them?<a name=195:4></a> That is how it works.<a name=195:5></a> How do I regard them?<a name=195:6></a> Am I prepared to lose any of them?<a name=195:7></a> Can I afford to lose any of them?<a name=195:8></a> These are questions that I have to ask myself in the presence of God.<a name=195:9></a> At Antioch were they prepared to do without Barnabas and Saul?<a name=195:10></a> No!<a name=195:11></a> they did not wish to let them go, but the Holy Spirit demanded them, and they <i>released</i> them; they let them go.<a name=195:12></a> Need I say that Barnabas and Saul were loved?<a name=195:13></a> They were, but they let them go, laying their hands upon them.<a name=195:14></a> There was on the one hand the evidence of loving confidence among these brethren, and on the other, entire submission to the Holy Spirit.<a name=195:15></a> There is thus presented a beautiful picture of practical unity among saints, and the presence of the one Spirit operating in relation to it.<a name=195:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not go further.<a name=195:17></a> I would particularly emphasise the body; "There is one body" It is worked out in Corinthians from the Lord's supper.<a name=195:18></a> Before it is introduced in its local bearing, we have it in its general bearing and that is, "we, [being] many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:17">1 Corinthians  10:17</a> Now that is worked out as from the body of Christ, for the passage (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a>) says, "The bread which we break, is it not [the] communion of the <i>body of the Christ</i>?<a name=195:19></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a> The body of Christ is given to us for food, as the Lord Himself said, "Take eat: this is my body" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:26">Matthew  26:26</a> If I feed on that I shall not give place to the natural propensities of my own will, for I

		shall see that He took that body to carry out the will of God.<a name=196:1></a> I can never be in the one body practically, according to God, save as eating His body, and so it goes on, "We, [being] many, are one loaf, and one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:17">1 Corinthians  10:17</a> Let us be consistent with what we are doing!<a name=196:2></a> Much has been made of the Lord's supper; we may well thank God for every bit of light and instruction accorded to us, but let us think of Christ's body to be eaten.<a name=196:3></a> "Take eat" He says, "this is my body" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:26">Matthew  26:26</a> As I do that, I cannot reserve anything; all has to go to make room for that, and in making room for the great features of Christ as doing the will of God, and witnessing to the love of God down here, I fit into the one body.<a name=196:4></a> We get that truth consolidated in chapter 12.<a name=196:5></a> The apostle says, "For also in [the power of] one Spirit <i>we</i> have all been baptised into one body" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a> So that in the mentioning of the body first in this great system -- a fixed order of things -- I begin with myself; how am I in that?<a name=196:6></a>

		Then I go to the Spirit, then on to the calling, and then I find myself surrounded by the kingdom, "one Lord, one faith, one baptism" as it is developed in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>and 10.<a name=196:7></a> Then I find, "one God and Father" It is not now, "Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#12:29">Mark  12:29</a> but it is, "To us [there is] one God, the Father" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a> You see what a fixed and blessed state of things we are connected with, and it is immovable; it is as fixed as the ordinances of the heavens and the earth; it cannot be moved.<a name=196:8></a> God has done it, but I am in it.<a name=196:9></a> I begin with myself in regard of it -- my relation to the body.<a name=196:10></a> It is a question of my relation to my brethren, and apart from attention to this there is no possibility of keeping the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.<a name=196:11></a>

		to His body as food: "Take, eat" He says, "this is my body" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:26">Matthew  26:26</a> But He refers in this chapter not to that but to the condition He had taken in flesh and blood: "for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink" (verse 55).<a name=198:1></a> "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal" (verse 54).<a name=198:2></a> It is a question of the condition which the Lord took, or I should say more correctly, of that which He became here, for in John it is a divine Person become <i>flesh</i>.<a name=198:3></a> As a divine Person become flesh, He took up a condition which was laid down in death -- perfectly sinless and holy, yet He laid it down in death.<a name=198:4></a> It was the expression of all the grace of heaven, but He laid it down; and it was that we might learn the end of it in ourselves, that the condition has been ended vicariously in Him.<a name=198:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The condition -- manhood -- is retained, for the Son of man ascends up where He was before.<a name=198:6></a> He laid down His life that He might take it again, but in another condition, not now flesh and blood, but in another condition in which we share, or have part, as eating the food furnished.<a name=198:7></a> Thus we see His condition in manhood is one thing; the eating of His body is another, and the taking of the Lord's supper is food.<a name=198:8></a> He expressly says in Matthew, as also in Mark, we are to eat: "Take, eat: this is my body" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:26">Matthew  26:26</a>; and to drink the cup, saying, "Drink ye <i>all</i> of it" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:27">Matthew  26:27</a>; all Christians are appealed to in that way -- no one should omit to drink of it.<a name=198:9></a> The Lord was to be here, on the one hand, as a vessel for the will of God, and on the other as an expression of the love of God; and so we have to eat and to drink.<a name=198:10></a> John is not dealing with the assembly as such, he is concerned about life, and so it has a very direct application now, because there is so little life in evidence among the people of God.<a name=198:11></a> This sign is to bring out that the Lord is taking account of the need that exists, and that whatever you or I do, He Himself knows what

		Now what I would point out is that He changes His position radically before this subject is introduced.<a name=199:3></a> The chapter, as you observe, begins with, "After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee, [or] of Tiberias" There can be no doubt about the location; we have the two names given by which that sea was known, and it is not simply that He went across the sea, but that He went away beyond it, and this happened after certain other things had occurred.<a name=199:4></a> These other things had taken place in Jerusalem; chapter 5.<a name=199:5></a> Jerusalem stood for the recognised religion of the day, the accredited religion of the world, and I would point out in this connection that the emphasis in John is laid on the <i>Jews</i>; the scribes and the leaders of the people are mentioned, too, but the emphasis in John is on the Jews as the opposers of Christ.<a name=199:6></a> In the synoptic gospels it is more the leaders of the Jews who had the responsibility.<a name=199:7></a> The Lord in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23">Matthew  23</a>deals unsparingly with them, "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!<a name=199:8></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:13">Matthew  23:13</a> There it is not a question of the Jews, but of the leaders of the Jews.<a name=199:9></a> There are corresponding leaders at the present time, and their teachings are leavening the mass.<a name=199:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John takes account of the masses; he contemplates light as having been presented to them -- the most wonderful light, but they have rejected it.<a name=199:11></a> It was a reprobate condition; it is not simply prominent leaders, but a reprobate, apostate condition of the masses; and that we have to deal with now.<a name=199:12></a> The evil teaching, which in various forms has been current for well-nigh a century past, is no longer peculiar to certain leaders, it is permeating the masses.<a name=199:13></a> So that we find a condition in the masses that is opposed to Christ.<a name=199:14></a> Hence John begins with the light, "In him

		You find in John generally that individuals as such get blessing, corresponding to our own time, and so chapter 5 brings out what I have been saying.<a name=200:3></a> The Lord was in Jerusalem; God was lingering there providentially, notwithstanding the guilt of the city, as He is today in Christendom; He is lingering over the profession.<a name=200:4></a> The Lord appears in the midst of these things, and by His word He raises up an impotent man.<a name=200:5></a> In answer to Him the man says, "I have not a <i>man</i>, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool" <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:7">John  5:7</a> In the midst of all that profession there was not a man, not one with sympathies according to God, one who would care for such a person as that.<a name=200:6></a> Doubtless there were many there of repute, Gamaliels and the like, but the impotent man says, "I have not a <i>man</i> .<a name=200:7></a>.<a name=200:8></a>.<a name=200:9></a> to cast me into the pool" <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:7">John  5:7</a> In the midst of all that, there was no one with the sympathy, the compassions of God to meet need, and so the Lord appears and He Himself meets the need, and heals the man.<a name=200:10></a> It is on the sabbath, and in so doing He interferes with the symbol of the current religion, and for this we are told the Jews persecuted Jesus because He had done these things on the sabbath day!<a name=200:11></a> Think of the condition among the masses -- the Jews -- that would persecute a man who did such a work as to say to a poor, impotent man who had lain there for thirty-eight years, "Take up thy couch and walk"!<a name=200:12></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:8">John  5:8</a> Think of the condition there that would lead the Jews to persecute Him!<a name=200:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to say a little about the assembly, and the features whereby it is recognised.<a name=208:1></a> I have selected the passage of scripture from the Song of Solomon so as to call attention to these features, for we are not called upon to answer any question of this kind save as the answer is spiritually obvious.<a name=208:2></a> The scripture does not deal in puzzles; its questions suppose ability to answer in those questioned.<a name=208:3></a> I began, therefore, with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>as the passage in the gospel that formally introduces the assembly.<a name=208:4></a> What it is may be gathered from the Lord's remarks to Simon; He says to him as answering his question, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona" He refers to him by the name he bore in his <i>responsibility</i>.<a name=208:5></a> In the corresponding passage in John's gospel, the Lord says, "Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:42">John  1:42</a>), Omitting that he was 'blessed' as such; it was what he was naturally, but in Matthew the Lord addresses him by the name he bore in his responsibility, and says that he was 'blessed'; Simon, the son of Jonas was blessed.<a name=208:6></a> He was blessed in that he was so favoured as to receive the revelation from the Father in heaven about Christ.<a name=208:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was an immense favour, and would stand in relation to Simon in his responsibility while he remained on earth.<a name=208:8></a> No one had that particular favour; others were blessed in other connections, such as Mary, the mother of our Lord.<a name=208:9></a> She was blessed among women; that particular advantage would never depart from her in her path of responsibility here.<a name=208:10></a> Again, the woman who anointed the Lord in Simon the leper's house was specially distinguished,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus a man standing out in responsibility, but blessed, and it describes those of us who form the assembly in its <i>public</i> character; the assembly as it is seen in us as in flesh-and-blood conditions.<a name=209:3></a> The truth of the assembly at Corinth is an example.<a name=209:4></a> It was composed of men and women, old and young, who had believed in Christ, who had been baptised and in consequence received the Holy Spirit, but still remaining in their position in this world as responsible to God.<a name=209:5></a> Romans provides the material for the assembly from this point of view.<a name=209:6></a> The believer in Romans is Simon Bar-jona, blessed; it is the same person, of the same parents, the same family links, in the same place, but a disciple, baptised and possessed of the Spirit of God -- a changed man, a blessed man, as I said, but still the same individual.<a name=209:7></a> Indeed, we see it illustrated in Simon the leper; he was not a leper then, but he had that public character; it was Simon the leper; Jesus was at his house, and the woman of whom I spoke anointed the Lord's head in that house.<a name=209:8></a> Although a leper, he was responsible, and the fulfilment of that responsibility is in part seen in that he entertained the Lord; he had Him in his house and in that house the Lord's head was anointed by the woman of whom I have spoken.<a name=209:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Romans contemplates the believer from that angle.<a name=209:10></a> He has got his body, which he can use as a sacrifice; it is the same body in which he sinned, but by the Spirit it is now in his control; it is dead in regard to sin; the Spirit in it is life in view of

		An exercised person comes into one of their meetings, and there is ministry.<a name=210:5></a> The women are silent, they are suitably attired, their heads are covered; the men are in subjection; they wait upon one another; they give place to the prophet because his ministry is the most desirable and profitable, and so one may discern in that company of persons in a particular room or building, in a particular street, that God is there, that God has got a footing, a place where everything is morally right; even the order of creation is not violated.<a name=210:6></a> Now that is what marks the assembly of God, and I take Simon, the son of Jonas, being blessed, as descriptive of those who form it.<a name=210:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind in making these remarks the Lord's words in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12">Matthew  12</a>, in commenting on His own personal service and testimony; He refers to Jonah and to Solomon as typical vessels of Old Testament times, times in which, as it may be remarked, nothing was perfect.<a name=237:3></a> It is said that the law makes nothing perfect, whereas Christianity involves what is perfect; and whilst God in Old Testament times bore with what was not perfect, He is less disposed to do this now for the reason that He has brought in what is perfect, "That which is perfect is come" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13:10">1 Corinthians  13:10</a> And so He said, "Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, more than Jonas [is] <i>here</i>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:41">Matthew  12:41</a>; what He referred to was there.<a name=237:4></a> The Ninevites had a remarkable testimony presented to them, but the message was not enhanced by the vessel -- a matter worthy of note, for the divine intent is that the ministry should be enhanced by the minister and not detracted from.<a name=237:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so on Jonah much care had been expended.<a name=237:6></a> One is often impressed with the care and attention paid to the vessel so that the message should not be in any way impaired by it.<a name=237:7></a> But in the case of Jonah, his spirit and viewpoint were on a much lower plane than that of Jehovah; he complained against God

		and said he did it justly; he knew that God would be gracious and merciful, but he was not equal to his knowledge.<a name=238:1></a> The book of Jonah is a remarkable part of the Old Testament as covering a specific testimony and a specific place; both the testimony and the place and the vessel are carefully specified.<a name=238:2></a> The Lord alludes to all this in saying, "Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, more than Jonas [is] here" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:41">Matthew  12:41</a> That is what I want to call attention to -- the quality of the new thing, what was there in Christ.<a name=238:3></a>

		And so the Lord goes on, referring to the queen of Sheba.<a name=238:4></a> "She came" He says, "from the ends of the earth" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:42">Matthew  12:42</a> The Ninevites did not have to move.<a name=238:5></a> Jonah went to them; it was grace.<a name=238:6></a> Remarkable testimony!<a name=238:7></a> But the queen of Sheba moves; she came, the Lord said, from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon.<a name=238:8></a> She had not seen him, she had heard; the tidings of his fame had reached her, and she moves.<a name=238:9></a> She came to hear his wisdom, and the Lord says, "And behold, more than Solomon" -- having the quality in view -- "[is] here" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:42">Matthew  12:42</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now those remarks of the Lord indicate the quality of the thing that was presented to the Jews, for Matthew has the Jew in view -- his responsibility.<a name=238:10></a> So the Lord sets before us the quality of that which was presented, what it was that was presented; and having brought that in, He has brought in a standard, a perfect standard, and I believe that His mind is to maintain that standard.<a name=238:11></a> If there be deterioration, as there has been to a lamentable degree, God would bring us back to the perfect standard.<a name=238:12></a> In Matthew we find a greater than Jonas, a greater than Solomon is here.<a name=238:13></a> Luke, without saying that, presents the Lord's service, so that <i>we</i> might say it.<a name=238:14></a> He presents it in such an unmistakable form that we recognise its superior quality.<a name=238:15></a> A great infidel once said that Luke

		They went up to the temple at the hour of prayer, which was the ninth hour, the hour of prayer being the incense hour -- God's hour!<a name=241:5></a> You will all remember how Zacharias was offering incense in the temple at that hour, and the people were praying without, when Gabriel came in; but the quality of the service was poor, for although the priest was serving, "in the order of his course" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:8">Luke  1:8</a> and the people themselves were praying, yet Gabriel did not find things as they should be; they were not right.<a name=241:6></a> May I not comment on our prayer-meetings?<a name=241:7></a> One loves to think of the hour of prayer; it is like the evening oblation, it is that in which God has something marked by the fragrance of Christ.<a name=241:8></a> These two were going up together at that hour, and they say, "Look on us" Then Peter said, "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have, this give I to thee: in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:6">Acts  3:6</a> These are his words; but we have not only words but action, for Peter took him by the right hand and lifted him up.<a name=241:9></a> It is the quality that you see, the thing was there that men could look at, representing what God presented in connection with His work, representative of Christ.<a name=241:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, as I said, the chapter calls attention to Paul's speaking.<a name=242:10></a> Here, too, in this same chapter we get another lame man -- a remarkable instance of the work of God at Lystra; he heard Paul speaking.<a name=242:11></a> It is not now, "Look on us" but the speaking; he <i>heard Paul speak</i>.<a name=242:12></a> And Paul saw him and saw that he had faith, and we read he heard Paul speak.<a name=242:13></a> Need I say that he paid attention; he had never heard speaking like that.<a name=242:14></a> The populace proposed to make a god of Paul, and called him Mercury, because he took the lead in speaking.<a name=242:15></a> One can form some little conception of the character of Paul's speaking.<a name=242:16></a> There must have been some representation of his Master, of that exhibition at Nazareth, in the manner and expression and words and grace of the apostle.<a name=242:17></a> Evidently he took the lead in speaking.<a name=242:18></a> They wanted to offer sacrifice to him because he did so; and the reason why he did so was because he was qualified, because of his spiritual intelligence divinely given, which exceeded that of Barnabas, and Barnabas recognised it.<a name=242:19></a> At this juncture there was not the

	<div class="paragraph">
		To the lame man Paul cried with a loud voice, "rise up straight upon thy feet" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:10">Acts  14:10</a> We do well to take note of that, for one of the most important things in our time is the ability to rise up and stand upon one's own feet.<a name=243:4></a> One is of no value practically in the assembly until one has learnt balance, being able to stand, to stand upon one's own feet.<a name=243:5></a> I did not mean to refer to that, but these are realities that are to teach us how to be material for the assembly of God.<a name=243:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go on to the end of Luke because the passage there has in view what I have been speaking of; it is a question of what they were <i>saying</i>.<a name=243:7></a> You will all remember how it is said of the remnant in Malachi that they spoke often one to another.<a name=243:8></a> We are not told <i>what</i> they said, but it does say that they did it often, and that they spoke to one another; and the Lord hearkened and heard.<a name=243:9></a> The Lord was interested, because that is the idea of hearkening.<a name=243:10></a> Much conversation goes on amongst the people of God that does not move heaven in the least degree, heaven is not interested in it.<a name=243:11></a> In this case the Lord was interested, and He said, as it were, That is worth taking note of, for that is really what is meant by "a book of remembrance" <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a> What they were speaking of was in keeping with the mind of God, and so He took note of it.<a name=243:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Luke develops this thought of speaking.<a name=243:13></a> In the last chapter he takes up the thought of the public assembly.<a name=243:14></a> He tells us that two of the saints were going to Emmaus and the Lord drew near and went with them; and two words are used; it is said they conversed together, and the Lord refers to their discourse, that is to say, we may be able to discourse
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		about things, and converse about them, and yet have our backs on the assembly -- a very solemn thing!<a name=244:1></a> "What discourses are these which pass between you" the Lord said, "as ye walk, and are downcast?<a name=244:2></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:17">Luke  24:17</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of them, I suppose, would make a speech covering what had happened concerning the Lord that he was cognisant of, and the other would follow on and make another speech.<a name=244:3></a> The Lord heard all that, but there was very little power in it.<a name=244:4></a> It was not such a discourse as you get from Paul, because he says, "I have <i>believed</i>, therefore have I spoken" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:13">2 Corinthians  4:13</a> They were not believing.<a name=244:5></a> The Lord said, "O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!<a name=244:6></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:25">Luke  24:25</a> The prophets believed what they spake.<a name=244:7></a> Speaking without faith is valueless.<a name=244:8></a> And so the Lord said, "O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken.<a name=244:9></a>.<a name=244:10></a>.<a name=244:11></a> and having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:27">Luke  24:27</a> What speaking that was!<a name=244:12></a> A discourse indeed, causing their hearts to burn!<a name=244:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is how Luke presents the thing; he is leading up to the public body, the public assembly, and what they were saying in it.<a name=244:14></a> The Lord, as we know, went as far as the two were going, and turned in with them, and they recognised Him in the breaking of bread.<a name=244:15></a> They said, "Was not our heart burning in us as he <i>spoke</i> to us on the way?<a name=244:16></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:32">Luke  24:32</a> They set out that night for Jerusalem, and arriving there found the eleven; for that is what I want to come to -- they found the eleven.<a name=244:17></a> Some of you young people may not have found the eleven.<a name=244:18></a> You think that you have to be found, and that all the finding belongs to others, but it belongs to you, and until you begin to find things you will never have them.<a name=244:19></a> "Seek, and ye shall find" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:9">Luke  11:9</a> the Lord said.<a name=244:20></a> So these two found the eleven and those who were with them.<a name=244:21></a> The eleven represent authority, the authority of the Lord Jesus.<a name=244:22></a>

		That is one thing of great importance for young people seeking assembly relations; be sure to find that which Christ has accredited, not simply that you have found those who have the truth, but those who are accredited by Christ.<a name=245:1></a> These eleven apostles represented Christ.<a name=245:2></a> They were together and there were others with them.<a name=245:3></a> There was thus a company answering to the mind of God -- the assembly.<a name=245:4></a> I should not care to be with that which God has not accredited.<a name=245:5></a> We are to seek God out in what He is taking account of, and in all that is being done by Him in every locality.<a name=245:6></a> You want to find what God accredits, and it is to be found; as I said before, you have to seek it, and when you seek it you will find it, and when you find it, you ought to identify yourself with it.<a name=245:7></a>

		These two found the eleven and those who were <i>gathered together</i>, saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon" And then they told how He was recognised, or made known to them in the breaking of bread.<a name=245:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to dwell on this particularly in closing, because it is most important.<a name=245:9></a> One thinks of this brother and that brother, what they say severally, and we know what they say and how they say it.<a name=245:10></a> Now what were those gathered, as seen here, saying?<a name=245:11></a> They were saying something <i>very definite</i>: "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon" You know there is much that is indefinite said and the effect is indefinite.<a name=245:12></a> I am referring now to our readings.<a name=245:13></a> If things are said indefinitely, the impression is indefinite and it vanishes, there is nothing built in, nothing abiding.<a name=245:14></a> The public assembly is a place in which things are said definitely and certainly.<a name=245:15></a> It is not a debating society.<a name=245:16></a> If I have something from the Lord, I do not need to apologise for saying it; it is what <i>should</i> be said, and it should be listened to.<a name=245:17></a> And so they were saying, "The Lord is indeed

	<div class="paragraph">
		risen and has appeared to Simon" They were speaking definitely and they were occupied with <i>grace</i>.<a name=246:1></a> I believe in these things we have the leading features of our dispensation -- the great fact of the resurrection, and the great fact of grace.<a name=246:2></a> The risen One appears to the erring one.<a name=246:3></a> Is that not grace?<a name=246:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What an immensity is told in what they were saying, reaching down even to us.<a name=246:5></a> Who of us does not regard as full of grace that simple remark, "and has appeared to Simon"?<a name=246:6></a> Not to Peter, for Luke is too accurate for that, it is to Simon.<a name=246:7></a> Who of us is not a Simon -- an erring one?<a name=246:8></a> They were not commenting on Simon's cowardice.<a name=246:9></a> How much could have been said about that!<a name=246:10></a> But they were not saying it, they were saying that the Lord had <i>appeared to him</i> -- a very different matter; they were speaking about grace.<a name=246:11></a> The public assembly should be marked by that, by speaking about grace, for this is the dispensation of it.<a name=246:12></a> Luke presents grace, and they were speaking about it; it is worth speaking about.<a name=246:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the last thing is the breaking of bread.<a name=246:14></a> There has been a great deal said in recent years, thank God, about the breaking of bread.<a name=246:15></a> If the Lord cause His people to speak much about anything, you may depend upon it He has something in it.<a name=246:16></a> In Luther's time they spoke about justification by faith and corresponding features of the truth.<a name=246:17></a> Later on other things were spoken of, and later still other truths, amongst these the breaking of bread.<a name=246:18></a> I believe we shall go on speaking about that right to the end; certainly we shall if we take the apostle Paul's example in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>; he spoke till the break of day.<a name=246:19></a> He discoursed before the breaking of bread, and he conversed with the brethren after the breaking of bread until the morning, being ready to depart on the morrow.<a name=246:20></a> How much are we gaining from this speaking?<a name=246:21></a> Here they said the Lord was recognised or made known unto them in the breaking of bread.<a name=246:22></a>

		I need not proceed, but much might be said as to our conversation, what we say, for there are many idle words, and there is much spoken and written that profits but little.<a name=247:7></a> If I think of a brother who ministers, I like to think of him as speaking for Christ.<a name=247:8></a> In the chapter I cited in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12">Matthew  12</a>the Lord makes a point of words.<a name=247:9></a> He says, "Every idle word which men shall say, they shall render an account of it in judgment-day: for by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:36">Matthew  12:36</a>,37 Hence the importance of keeping our mouths, so that profitable things only may proceed out of them.<a name=247:10></a> I believe the cloven <i>tongues</i> of fire mean that corrupt things should be nullified; that the tongue should not have the poison of asps under it, that it should not be an unruly member, but that it should be a member under the control of the Spirit of God.<a name=247:11></a> A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.<a name=247:12></a> Hence the importance of controlling our tongues and keeping our mouths, and particularly that when we go to the house of God there should be no indefinite speaking, but that there should be definiteness with us -- five words with the understanding rather than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.<a name=247:13></a> It is the five words with the

		I had in mind to speak about divine walking.<a name=260:1></a> It will be remembered that God, having placed man in the garden of Eden, came down in the cool of the day, His voice being heard, as we read, "they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim walking in the garden" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:8">Genesis  3:8</a>, so that, at that very early period of God's relations with man we have this feature, and it runs through the Scriptures, as we find with Enoch and with Noah that they walked with God.<a name=260:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have in mind, beloved friends, is to show that this walking involves what is judicial -- it involves government, then that it involves grace.<a name=260:3></a> I hope to speak of the subject in these two relations; and I have touched on it in Zechariah first, because in his prophecy the former idea is somewhat stressed, particularly as to these symbols of divine government -- horses.<a name=260:4></a> You will observe that there were four chariots with their horses in this chapter.<a name=260:5></a> The idea is introduced in chapter 1, and, as we have been occupied, in this book, already today with the Holy Spirit (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#4">Zechariah  4</a>) -- the medium of God's direct action -- I wish, for a moment, to dwell on the medium or mediums of His indirect action.<a name=260:6></a> Both activities on the part of God bear upon the testimony.<a name=260:7></a> In the presence of the Spirit here, we have the medium of direct action, but, in the existence of government, although in the hands of those who know Him not, God has agencies of indirect action, but, nevertheless, of immense importance to us as standing in relation to what God is doing directly.<a name=260:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I have selected this final chariot -- called "the bay" here -- as the power with which the assembly has had to do, with which, indeed, our Lord Jesus

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ has had to do.<a name=261:1></a> It will be known that, in the gospel of Luke, John the baptist's ministry is given to us in a historical setting, and the name of the Caesar is given -- Tiberius Caesar -- and all the governmental dignitaries of the time; chapter 3:1.<a name=261:2></a> These are not regarded, in Luke, as adverse, specially.<a name=261:3></a> They <i>are</i> regarded as adverse (at least, Herod was) in Matthew, but Luke presents them in relation to the testimony.<a name=261:4></a> They had their place in the government of God, and although symbolised by the horse, meaning that they have neither conscience nor heart, yet they are amenable to external pressure, and God has, not only in the presence of the Holy Spirit here, but in the presence of angelic power, His forces for operation.<a name=261:5></a> He has never withdrawn these forces from the area of the testimony, and so these creatures, although wanting in conscience and heart, are amenable to external pressure, and even to guidance and control.<a name=261:6></a> As a horse is kept in by bit and bridle in contrast to a man, so these powers are amenable to God through external pressure, and hence He forces them into His service with a view to the preservation of the testimony here.<a name=261:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So this fourth chariot, with its bay horses, representing what is strong, what is energetic, symbolises for us the great empire which, more than any other, has had to do with Christianity, first with our Lord, then with the apostles, and finally with the assembly as left here.<a name=261:8></a> These essayed to walk to and fro, and they were allowed to do so.<a name=261:9></a> The rise of that empire was not by divine initiative.<a name=261:10></a> The kingdom of God is by divine initiative; it was not 'Lo here' or 'Lo there' as in the great leaders of Rome; it did not come by observation.<a name=261:11></a> It came in as a babe, and so the Lord says, "The kingdom of God is in the midst of you" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17:21">Luke  17:21</a> It was there unobtrusively, unpretentiously, but, nevertheless, there.<a name=261:12></a> It was there, as I said, by divine initiative, and symbolises the divine intervention

	<div class="paragraph">
		in grace; whereas this chariot essays to move.<a name=262:1></a> The initiative was of man.<a name=262:2></a> It was man's greed and lust for power, but God took it in hand and controlled it, and the ordering came from Him; so that He permits this great power to walk through the earth.<a name=262:3></a> The great roads in this country and throughout Europe, and throughout the East, are all a standing witness to the meaning of this verse.<a name=262:4></a> They betoken arteries of walk, so that the legions find a way to traverse the earth, to march through; but as under God; beasts though they were, they were under God, and they continue.<a name=262:5></a> The powers that be, we are told, are ordained of God, and they are to be respected: "for it bears not the sword in vain" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:4">Romans  13:4</a> We pray for them; we are enjoined to do so.<a name=262:6></a> They are ordained of God for our good, and so they walk through the earth in the way of ordered government, in order that there might be peace, so that the people of God might lead "a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:2">1 Timothy  2:2</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, having said so much about the walk of these horses, I desire to proceed to speak about the Lord in this same judicial character.<a name=262:7></a> You find Him, in the book of Revelation, walking, not then as the vessel of grace, but, as we are told by the apostle who turned to hear or see the voice, as in the character of the "Son of man" The Son of man is very different from a horse; it is He who came into this world as cast upon God from the very outset of His being here.<a name=262:8></a> No external pressure, indeed, in His case: "My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work" <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:34">John  4:34</a> He is the Son of man.<a name=262:9></a> It is in <i>His</i> hands that judgment is.<a name=262:10></a> However much it may appear to be in other hands for the moment, yet all judgment has been committed to Him.<a name=262:11></a> Judgment is in His hands, because He is the Son of man.<a name=262:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, here in Revelation He is seen clothed with a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=263>[Page 263]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		garment reaching down to His feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.<a name=263:1></a> No longer that beautiful Form for love to outline, as in Canticles.<a name=263:2></a> It is not that.<a name=263:3></a> It is judicial.<a name=263:4></a> The outline cannot be traced here.<a name=263:5></a> He is not presented to affection here; He is clothed down to the feet with a garment, and His affections are pent up -- they cannot flow out.<a name=263:6></a> His hair is like wool; there is the experience of an elder, qualified to judge.<a name=263:7></a> "His feet like fine brass" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:15">Revelation  1:15</a> and "Out of his mouth a sharp, two-edged sword" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:16">Revelation  1:16</a> and "his voice as the voice of many waters" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:15">Revelation  1:15</a> This is no indirect action; this forebodes direct action, but judicially; and so, in addressing the first assembly, He presents Himself as He "who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamps" Walking is deliberate.<a name=263:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have running spoken of in Scripture, both in a good sense and a bad sense.<a name=263:9></a> We hear of many running to and fro, referring to the present time -- to the rapid means of travel, but walking is deliberate, and so the Son of man is seen here, walking -- not through the earth, but in the midst of the seven golden lamps, in the midst of those who have the responsibility of the testimony, but who have failed in it.<a name=263:10></a> A most solemn picture!<a name=263:11></a> His eyes are like a flame of fire, and as He walks about amongst the candlesticks nothing escapes His notice -- no thing or person.<a name=263:12></a> He is dealing, beloved friends, judicially.<a name=263:13></a> Nothing is passed over, and so, in these seven letters or addresses to the assembly, He pronounces the results of His inspection.<a name=263:14></a> Let no one for a moment assume that He can escape these eyes.<a name=263:15></a> He sees all; and not only so, but what He sees that needs to be judged He has a means of dealing with.<a name=263:16></a> He is the Lord, beloved friends.<a name=263:17></a> "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?<a name=263:18></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:22">1 Corinthians  10:22</a> -- a most serious matter.<a name=263:19></a> He deals with us directly as in the Revelation.<a name=263:20></a> It is direct action.<a name=263:21></a> He has a sword; He has the means by Him to deal with us.<a name=263:22></a>

		What I wanted to come to, however, is divine walking in grace, but I thought it would be helpful and perhaps needful for some of us to be reminded that there is judicial action at the present time.<a name=264:1></a> The history of Christendom is the result of this direct action of the Lord.<a name=264:2></a> Faith observes it.<a name=264:3></a> He has the means by Him of dealing with everything that is contrary to Him in the sphere of profession.<a name=264:4></a> He will deal with <i>all</i> presently, but at the present time this direct action progresses.<a name=264:5></a> "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:30">1 Corinthians  11:30</a> is an example of this direct action of the Lord.<a name=264:6></a> That was at the beginning of it.<a name=264:7></a> Judgment has begun at the house of God, and if it has begun at us, "Where shall the impious and the sinner appear?<a name=264:8></a>" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:18">1 Peter  4:18</a> It may be needful that, in a particular way, attention should be drawn to this -- the Son of man in His judicial garb, walking in the midst of the seven golden lamps.<a name=264:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I wanted, as I said, to speak particularly of His walk in grace.<a name=264:10></a> I believe that the present recovery of the assembly, the recent recovery of many of God's people is due, in very large measure, to the indirect action of God, for He has wrought governmentally among the nations; and then, too, it is due to the direct action of God in the midst of the profession, with the end in view that there might be a walking in grace -- that we might know what it is to walk as He walked.<a name=264:11></a> It says, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that announceth glad tidings, that publisheth peace" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#52:7">Isaiah  52:7</a> These are not feet going to and fro through the earth; they are the feet presented to us by Luke and John.<a name=264:12></a> I do not know of anything more attractive than the presentation of Christ by these two evangelists from this standpoint.<a name=264:13></a> Luke dwells, as if loth to leave the subject, on the feet of Jesus.<a name=264:14></a>

		One thinks of that moment of feeling.<a name=265:15></a> What depths of feeling those tears bespoke!<a name=265:16></a> Tears bespeak feelings within.<a name=265:17></a> They denote nothing external in the way of beauty; they rather disfigure; but they denote depths of feeling within, and those depths were there.<a name=265:18></a> These feet had carried grace to her.<a name=265:19></a> Grace had touched her to the very depths of her being.<a name=265:20></a> She washed His feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head.<a name=265:21></a> Every hair of that head was precious; but she devoted them to the wiping of those feet, and she kissed them.<a name=265:22></a> It was no mere formal act.<a name=265:23></a> She kissed them "ardently"; the Lord's own comment is, "She from the time I came in has not ceased kissing my feet" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:45">Luke  7:45</a> There were depths of feelings in her tears; there was depth of affection in her kisses.<a name=265:24></a> She had not ceased to kiss His feet.<a name=265:25></a> Would that our hearts could be moved thus!<a name=265:26></a> Depths of feelings!<a name=265:27></a> Superficiality, alas!<a name=265:28></a> is what marks the people of God even at their best, and I would not exclude myself.<a name=265:29></a> One is humbled about it.<a name=265:30></a> In meetings such as these, we are moved for a moment, but the effect passes away.<a name=265:31></a> What about tears?<a name=265:32></a> What about depths of feeling as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This would give support and energy in consequence of that holy service rendered.<a name=266:4></a> Do you not think the Lord was refreshed?<a name=266:5></a> He <i>was</i>, beloved.<a name=266:6></a> He drank of the brook by the way.<a name=266:7></a> That was refreshment to Him, untold.<a name=266:8></a> He says, "Seest thou this woman?<a name=266:9></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:44">Luke  7:44</a> Then He goes over all that she had done to Him, and His comment is, "She loved much" "her many sins are forgiven" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:47">Luke  7:47</a> As Christ had come to her, so He governed her, and so she ministered to Him.<a name=266:10></a> Thus it is that Luke gives us the feet, and so does John; hence, we find that Mary anoints them in John.<a name=266:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew and Mark He is anointed on the head, for it is a question in these gospels of His official dignity.<a name=266:12></a> We do well to notice that -- that there is One, officially -- there is one Man set up in heaven in whom all offices are vested.<a name=266:13></a> Every office is vested in Christ, so that Matthew and Mark relate that He is anointed on the head, while Luke and John record that He was anointed on the feet.<a name=266:14></a> We need both.<a name=266:15></a> The first two refer to His dignity -- His official dignity, the second two refer to His personal greatness -- Luke, what He is morally, John what He is personally.<a name=266:16></a> So that the woman, as Luke presents her, anointed Him as He comes into the world -- in His service, in His walk; Mary, according to John, anoints Him, as He goes out of the world; <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:3">John  12:3</a>.<a name=266:17></a> He came in as having those beautiful feet on the mountains -- publishing peace, and as anointed He walked to carry grace to men.<a name=266:18></a> In John He goes out.<a name=266:19></a> He is anointed six days before His burial.<a name=266:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		John, as I have sought to do of Luke.<a name=267:1></a> You find John the baptist "looking at Jesus as he walked" He did not come into this world, in any sense, to take His ease; it was a question of movement, and so, beloved, if we are recovered to the truth it is a question of movement.<a name=267:2></a> It is really in movement that light radiates, and so you find in this chapter that, as the Lord is seen moving, all those who are drawn to Him begin to move.<a name=267:3></a> It is the radiation of light.<a name=267:4></a> I think it is in movement that we begin to radiate the light that comes into our souls; it is not in settling down in a locality.<a name=267:5></a> The nearer we are to God the more universal we are, and the more ready to move, to walk, not to run to and fro, hither and thither, but to be deliberate -- to have a purpose.<a name=267:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the Lord walked, and John looked upon Him and said, "Behold the Lamb of God" The idea of the walking is brought in.<a name=267:7></a> It is a divine Person here -- "the Lamb of God" and so you find, throughout this chapter, that those who were drawn to Him, walked, they moved, as, for example, Nathanael.<a name=267:8></a> When Jesus saw him <i>coming to Him</i> He said, "Behold [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:47">John  1:47</a> Light radiated there.<a name=267:9></a> There is an expression of something under the eye of God -- "Truly an Israelite"!<a name=267:10></a> One would covet to be that; that it should be seen in one's walk, in one's movements, that we are not seeking after the things of this world, that we are not going to that city to trade and to get gain; but that our motives are pure, that they are unselfish, that they are governed by love, and that thus we answer to the Lord's estimate of Nathanael, "[one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:47">John  1:47</a> It says of the Lord, He did not walk in Jewry.<a name=267:11></a> There were dangerous places.<a name=267:12></a> He walked no longer openly among the Jews, for they sought to kill Him.<a name=267:13></a> He selected His area; but He walked.<a name=267:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was thinking, dear brethren, of that feature of the truth that we may call the <i>inner</i> feature.<a name=310:1></a> I have in mind, as illustrative of it, the record in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#2">2 Samuel  2</a>of the capture of Jerusalem by David.<a name=310:2></a> The Old Testament is designed to illustrate for us, in God's mode of illustration -- which is better than any we can devise -- the truth of the New Testament; so that the truth is not only presented spiritually in the New Testament, but is illustrated spiritually.<a name=310:3></a> Thus the servant is wonderfully furnished so as to be independent of what man, as such, may present or devise.<a name=310:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many of you will remember that, in that record in Samuel, Joab, David's captain, is omitted.<a name=310:5></a> His service is recorded in Chronicles, whereas Samuel, or the writer of that book, occupies himself solely with David's own exploit; that is to say, we have presented to us, in type, the direct work of Christ in our hearts.<a name=310:6></a> Not what is done mediately, but done directly, as if, in this book, he would take charge of the work Himself, all else depending on it.<a name=310:7></a> And so you will find, in the endings of the gospels, stress is laid on the Lord <i>Himself</i>; as we read, "He himself stood in their midst" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:36">Luke  24:36</a> It was not a representative, although He does operate through representatives.<a name=310:8></a> And so David, we are told, took the stronghold of Zion and called it the city of David.<a name=310:9></a> First it is stated it was the city of David, meaning that it had already acquired that character; a city which was marked as belonging to David.<a name=310:10></a> It is God's way that things are, and then they are named, so that the city -- for it was a city within a city -- is called by that name; it was evidently peculiarly David's city.<a name=310:11></a> In Chronicles we are told that Joab rebuilt the rest of the city;

		that is to say, the outer or governmental part -- Jerusalem, the great capital, from whence light and government radiated in Israel; but within that there was, as it were, another city called the city of David.<a name=311:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these are two great features running right through Scripture; that is, the <i>inner</i> and the <i>outer</i>.<a name=311:2></a> I want to speak of the former, for unless we understand the inner, however much light we may have, however much order, we shall not rightly represent God.<a name=311:3></a> And so it is added that "David took the watercourses" -- a term significant enough spiritually.<a name=311:4></a> For inner operations the watercourse is most essential.<a name=311:5></a> And then it says he fortified the citadel and built <i>inward</i>.<a name=311:6></a> There is the idea of a <i>fortified</i> sphere, making another most important side to our position, for if we value the inner working of Christ in our hearts -- and the sphere of His operations is our hearts -- if we value His building, His working there, we shall be concerned to preserve it intact, and hence the idea of fortification.<a name=311:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not now referring to fellowship, although fellowship does involve defence, corresponding with walls.<a name=311:8></a> Our fellowship is a defence, but I am not speaking of that, although fellowship may be spoken of as involving the inner and the outer.<a name=311:9></a> The outer is marked by death; as it is said, the fellowship of the blood of Christ, and the fellowship of the body of Christ; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>.<a name=311:10></a> We should have in mind what that means, and I refer to the Old Testament.<a name=311:11></a> In the outward appearance of the tabernacle, everything, I may say, as one looked at it, as it is described in Exodus, reminds you of death.<a name=311:12></a> The court of the offerings (when the law was complied with) was a veritable shambles.<a name=311:13></a> We are so accustomed to the terms that we take in little of what was there.<a name=311:14></a> It was death, and death in <i>volume</i>.<a name=311:15></a> Besides that, there were the second and outer coverings.<a name=311:16></a> Besides the actual slaying of the offerings, there was the standing

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=312>[Page 312]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		presence of the coverings indicative of death, that death had taken place.<a name=312:1></a> The outer covering denoted that death <i>had taken</i> place, the offerings as slain denoted that death <i>was taking</i> place.<a name=312:2></a> So it is that Christianity outwardly, as presented in Scripture, is marked not only by the fact that death <i>has</i> taken place, but that it <i>is</i> taking place.<a name=312:3></a> There is nothing inviting in that for man naturally.<a name=312:4></a> It is repugnant to him; he avoids it.<a name=312:5></a> But then, inside the sanctuary, as you know, there were other things; although the testimony of death entered in, there were other features, <i>positive</i> things.<a name=312:6></a> Outside, everything pointed to the judgment of God, what was due to God.<a name=312:7></a> Inside there was evidence of what was of God in a positive way -- the things made of gold.<a name=312:8></a> And there was what I may regard as answering to the fellowship of the Spirit -- the curtains of fine linen.<a name=312:9></a> What was inside touches on what I have in mind.<a name=312:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so David built inward, and as you value what is thus effected, you fortify it.<a name=312:11></a> As I have been saying, fellowship is fortification -- an outer one.<a name=312:12></a> The kingdom is a fortification, but that is God's matter.<a name=312:13></a> Fellowship is <i>our</i> matter.<a name=312:14></a> Fellowship implies that I am brought into a partnership with others.<a name=312:15></a> John speaks of it as fellowship <i>with</i> one another, whereas Paul treats of the character of the thing, the fellowship <i>of</i> the Son of God, <i>of</i> the blood of Christ, <i>of</i> the body of Christ, <i>of</i> the Spirit.<a name=312:16></a> It is thus our sphere, and it implies defence.<a name=312:17></a> But then there is the inner thing.<a name=312:18></a> As I said, David built inward, and as I value that, I fortify.<a name=312:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I hope you follow what I am saying, for it is of the very last importance in view of the mode of the enemy s attack.<a name=312:20></a> The constant tendency is to reduce the level, the standard, and so we find, in John's gospel, from the beginning to the end, stress is laid on what is inward.<a name=312:21></a> So you find, as an example, that the two who followed Jesus (chapter 1) abode with

		Him where He abode; and then as regards the individual, you will see in the woman of Samaria how stress was laid on what was inner.<a name=313:1></a> "The water that I shall give him" says the Lord, "shall become <i>in him</i> a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life" <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a> Then in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>you find living water flowing out from within.<a name=313:2></a> The inner thing is stressed throughout, and so in chapter 20, the final chapter (chapter 21 is an appendix) and the greatest, the disciples are in a certain place, and the <i>doors</i> are shut.<a name=313:3></a> There is a sense of something positive being there.<a name=313:4></a> What was there, beloved?<a name=313:5></a> They had just received the most wonderful message -- <i>heavenly</i> light.<a name=313:6></a>

		Mary Magdalene came to them in a most ordinary way, without any pretension.<a name=313:7></a> She told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her -- that He was ascending to His Father and their Father, His God and their God, they being His brethren.<a name=313:8></a> They had <i>that</i> light.<a name=313:9></a> Things were being presented spiritually.<a name=313:10></a> The possession of that light necessitated protection.<a name=313:11></a> The fortification was that the doors were shut; mark -- doors; it is a spiritual thing, referring to each of our hearts as the sphere of Christ's operations, involving most precious things, the most precious light.<a name=313:12></a> And are they not a guide for us?<a name=313:13></a> Yes, beloved, they are, and this is what I have in view, that we might all be on our guard at the present time as regards what we have received, what we have heard, and that <i>our</i> doors might be shut; that we might be free from fleshly intrusion, and thus be ready for the Lord to lead us inward into the holy and eternal things of God.<a name=313:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I bring forward this scripture in Timothy to enforce what I have said, and I want to point out that there is a particular relation between 2 Timothy and John's gospel.<a name=313:15></a> You will observe that the apostle here refers to himself as such in regard to the promise of eternal life.<a name=313:16></a> Now John begins with life almost at

		once; he speaks about the life being in Christ -- "in him was life" and then he adds, "And the life was the light of men" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a> In the spiritual operations of God he brings in the positive -- the source of light in life.<a name=314:1></a> The life was there first; God had promised it before the world began, we are told.<a name=314:2></a> I have no doubt that what God promises is in answer to desire -- in this case, anticipated desire, the desire for life.<a name=314:3></a> But then the promise took form; it took form in a substantive way; the life was in Christ down here.<a name=314:4></a> He was it, and as in Him down here, it was the light of men.<a name=314:5></a> He had anticipated it in view of becoming a Man; He dwelt in the habitable parts of God's earth, and His delights were with the sons of men (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>); now He is amongst them, and being here as the life, the light radiates.<a name=314:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish now to show you from this chapter in Timothy how this life works out in man; how that as in Christ it was "the old commandment" The apostle John says in his epistle, "I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning.<a name=314:7></a> The old commandment is the word which ye heard" And then he says, "Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:7">1 John  2:7</a>,8.<a name=314:8></a> Now, dear brethren, I would say this, that what tests us is the new commandment.<a name=314:9></a> Many shelter themselves under the old commandment and say it suffices.<a name=314:10></a> Well, John says, I will not take that away from you.<a name=314:11></a> It is the word which you have heard.<a name=314:12></a> We have all heard things; we ought to hold to them if they are of God.<a name=314:13></a> John would assure those to whom he wrote that he would not detract from what they had heard, which they had from the beginning.<a name=314:14></a> But he says, "Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is passing, and the true light already shines" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:8">1 John  2:8</a> And so the question with me is,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=315>[Page 315]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is this new commandment verified in me?<a name=315:1></a> Is the darkness passing from me?<a name=315:2></a> Is the true light now shining in me?<a name=315:3></a> For it is a question not only of what is true in Him, but in you and me.<a name=315:4></a> Thus I would stress that, whilst we should hold tenaciously to what we have heard, which was from the beginning, we should not put that between us and the new commandment.<a name=315:5></a> This latter refers to the work of God in us.<a name=315:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Paul here speaks of life as a promised thing, and that he was an apostle in relation to that remarkable feature -- the promise of life.<a name=315:7></a> Life is a substantive thing; it is not a theory.<a name=315:8></a> Many may theorise upon it, but the thing is there; it is substantive.<a name=315:9></a> It has come within our range in Christ, in a Man; and by the work of God it is in the Christian.<a name=315:10></a> The apostle Paul had that in view, for he says here that life and incorruptibility have come to light -- have been brought to light in Christ.<a name=315:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to speak briefly about Timothy in regard to all this, and what is to be said first of all about Timothy is that, although evidently he is the best and most advanced, yet there was a weakness, as we may see in the history of David in the latter half of 2 Samuel.<a name=315:12></a> He there typifies the work of God in the people of God, but throughout you have marks of weakness, yea, of sin.<a name=315:13></a> This is a humbling fact; we have to admit it; but having referred to that, I wish to speak of what was in Timothy.<a name=315:14></a> The chapter greatly stresses what was <i>in Christ</i>.<a name=315:15></a> You will notice how many things were in Christ; that is the balance to what I am now emphasising.<a name=315:16></a> It is a most steadying feature in our days to hold to what is in Christ.<a name=315:17></a> What is in Christ is fixed; it cannot be disturbed by any condition in us.<a name=315:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as I said, I want to speak of what was in Timothy, so that we may inquire how much this inward work is proceeding in us.<a name=315:19></a> The apostle speaks to him in the most endearing terms.<a name=315:20></a> One covets

		being so lovable as to draw forth expressions of affection.<a name=316:1></a> Again we are reminded of John, for he was the one whom Jesus loved.<a name=316:2></a> Timothy stands out here in a like position.<a name=316:3></a> He was a <i>feeling</i> kind of man.<a name=316:4></a> There are very few of us, I fear, who have spiritual feelings.<a name=316:5></a> Tears denote feelings, and so the apostle called to mind his tears.<a name=316:6></a> He was a lovable brother.<a name=316:7></a> The first thing spoken of as in him is <i>faith</i>.<a name=316:8></a> "Calling to mind the unfeigned faith which [has been] <i>in</i> thee, which dwelt first <i>in</i> thy grandmother Lois, and <i>in</i> thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that <i>in</i> thee also" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:5">2 Timothy  1:5</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved brethren and sisters, what about this?<a name=316:9></a> I do not wish to occupy you unduly with yourselves; but remember that the new commandment is that which is true in Christ and true in you.<a name=316:10></a> The new commandment is a present thing; the true light <i>now</i> shines.<a name=316:11></a> Now what about this faith?<a name=316:12></a> Hear again John, for John insists on believers <i>being</i> believers.<a name=316:13></a> It is a question of unfeigned faith, faith of a tried kind, faith of a hereditary kind, faith that has come down through two generations.<a name=316:14></a> It is a known faith.<a name=316:15></a> There is only one faith, but that faith takes different forms in different persons, and certainly this was a very unusual kind of faith -- a faith that had come down through two generations, and was now in the third.<a name=316:16></a> The apostle was persuaded that it dwelt actually in his beloved child Timothy; it <i>dwelt</i> there -- it was in him.<a name=316:17></a> It is the first great feature.<a name=316:18></a> Faith, beloved brethren, takes us out of this world into God's world, and I want every one to look into himself to see whether it dwells in him.<a name=316:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the second thing is <i>gift</i>.<a name=316:20></a> And what you will observe here is that it needed <i>rekindling</i>.<a name=316:21></a> There was no question about its being there.<a name=316:22></a> It is called "the gift of God which is in thee" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:6">2 Timothy  1:6</a> In how many of us is there gift lying dormant?<a name=316:23></a> In Timothy, wonderful brother though he was, gift was lying somewhat dormant.<a name=316:24></a> And so the apostle urges him to rekindle it, to stir it up.<a name=316:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=317>[Page 317]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what a wonderful history his gift had!<a name=317:1></a> So with every gift, not only is it a spiritual thing, but God prepares the vessel for it and then places the gift in it.<a name=317:2></a> This gift to Timothy, we are told in the first letter to him, is connected with prophecy, and it was conferred by the presbytery, showing that the mind of God went before in regard to this brother, and the gift was confirmed by the elders, by experienced persons.<a name=317:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a question of its history, and of its quality; I do plead for quality.<a name=317:4></a> God is much more concerned about quality than about quantity.<a name=317:5></a> The apostle here refers to the gift which was in Timothy by the laying on of <i>his</i> hands.<a name=317:6></a> It was connected with <i>Paul</i>; it had come through the one whose precious ministry was being given up on every hand, that which stands for the very highest quality.<a name=317:7></a> At that time it was being surrendered.<a name=317:8></a> Whole provinces were turning away from Paul, and he urged on Timothy that he had gift by the laying on of <i>his</i> hands, and that it was not to be dormant.<a name=317:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus I would urge the stirring up of gift, whatever it may be.<a name=317:10></a> It is a question of what you <i>have</i>; if you have got the thing in you it should come out.<a name=317:11></a> Rekindle the gift of God in you; it was a veritable gift of God that came by the laying on of the apostle's hands, a special quality, specially designed, and it should not lie dormant; it was too valuable, too precious, and so is every spiritual gift of God.<a name=317:12></a> So I would urge on the young brethren, and on all, to look in to see what we have -- what may have marked you in earlier days -- whether it is now dormant, when the need is so great.<a name=317:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, there is just the third thing, that is, "the good deposit" Timothy is enjoined to keep the good thing by the Holy Spirit, "which" says the apostle, not dwells in <i>you</i>, but "dwells in <i>us</i>" And here I come to unity -- to the inner thing in its universal

		J.T.<a name=319:3></a> I have been thinking of intelligence.<a name=319:4></a> In this section of the epistle to the Corinthians it is viewed as essential to the assembly.<a name=319:5></a> Some of us have been looking at the idea of being together in Acts, but the recurrence of the word 'assembly' or 'church' in this section is to be noticed, for what is required is not only that we should be together, but together intelligently, if we are to realise what is alluded to here -- the assembly.<a name=319:6></a> It would be observed that in chapter 10 the assembly is formally alluded to as a definite entity in this world standing over against the Jew and the Greek.<a name=319:7></a> It is 'the assembly of God'.<a name=319:8></a> In approaching the subject in verse 15 of chapter 10, the apostle uses the words "intelligent persons" <i>Such</i> are in view, not simply believers.<a name=319:9></a> Not that all believers are not of the assembly, but it is persons thoughtful and instructed who are contemplated.<a name=319:10></a> To be in the assembly according to God we have to be instructed and thoughtful.<a name=319:11></a> It is that in which God is to be known, and our very attitude, indeed, our very sitting, and the time at which we arrive, and what we say, all come under review; it is not only that we are together, but how we are together.<a name=319:12></a> What you get in the beginning of the Acts was that they were all together in one place.<a name=319:13></a> That is something to be noted -- that <i>no one should be absent</i>.<a name=319:14></a> Then those who believe were together; that is, in <i>heart</i>, not necessarily in one place, that is to be noted, too.<a name=319:15></a> It is a company of believers.<a name=319:16></a> First they were all there, and then, secondly, they were <i>believers</i>, marked as

		I was thinking of the way in which Scripture speaks of the feet of believers.<a name=331:1></a> Every part of the body of the believer, of a man, I may say, is used to represent some spiritual thought.<a name=331:2></a> One might speak of any one of these members, but I have selected the feet of the believer with a view to dwelling on the import of their use in standing, in walking, in running, and in leaping.<a name=331:3></a> These words are all used by the Spirit.<a name=331:4></a> One spiritual man referred to his feet as hind's feet; another is alluded to as dipping his foot in oil; again, we read of the beautiful feet of them that bring glad tidings; and again, it says God keeps the feet of His saints.<a name=331:5></a> So you see how wide is the use made of them in Scripture as figurative of spiritual things.<a name=331:6></a> One might indeed refer to God's feet, for they are referred to in a figurative way, speaking of the place of the soles of them in Ezekiel, and that brings one down to the holy subject of the feet of our Lord.<a name=331:7></a>

		Now I come to David for a moment.<a name=338:1></a> It is not now a question of young brethren but of old ones.<a name=338:2></a> Sometimes old age means a loss of balance, a loss of foot power, of leg power, and of eye power -- a loss indeed of the senses as they should be used.<a name=338:3></a> These things are common, not only in material things, but in spiritual things.<a name=338:4></a> One is exercised that in old age he should retain freshness.<a name=338:5></a> It is a good exercise, and God will respect it in us all.<a name=338:6></a> The whole chapter shows that it was a very great occasion.<a name=338:7></a> Our spirituality is tested by great occasions; can we rise to them?<a name=338:8></a> Here is an old man who assembled all his princes and mighty men, and who stood up on his feet to address them.<a name=338:9></a> In 1 Kings we have a very different picture; there we see a decrepit old man with little or no heat, apparently insensible to the machinations of his son Adonijah who sought the kingdom with his coadjutors!<a name=338:10></a> But not so in this book.<a name=338:11></a> This is the spiritual side.<a name=338:12></a> Possibly it comes in after he is revived by the word of Nathan.<a name=338:13></a> This is the David of God's mind.<a name=338:14></a> It is God intimating to us what he values in an aged saint.<a name=338:15></a> It is a great occasion.<a name=338:16></a> The great men of the kingdom are present as I have said.<a name=338:17></a> He assembled as we read "all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the princes of the divisions that ministered to the king, and the captains over thousands, and the captains over hundreds, and the comptrollers of all the substance and possessions of the king, and of his sons, with the chamberlains, and the mighty men, and all the men of valour unto Jerusalem" <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#28:1">1 Chronicles  28:1</a> Is David able for the occasion?<a name=338:18></a> There is a great occasion coming for us -- the coming of the Lord and our gathering together to Him.<a name=338:19></a> It will be a wonderful time, a great assembly of grandees!<a name=338:20></a> And we shall have part in it.<a name=338:21></a> In the same way, today, relatively, every time we come together in assembly it is a great occasion.<a name=338:22></a> One feels how little appreciation we have of the greatness, of the dignity

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, if you go into those chapters, you see what a man is who can maintain his balance right to the end -- standing upon his feet.<a name=340:10></a> Then David says in reference to God, among many other things, "Thou art exalted as head above all" <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:11">1 Chronicles  29:11</a> If you recognise that, you will have no complaint as to what God has done; it is in perfect wisdom, it cannot be improved upon.<a name=340:11></a> So David dies, full of days, riches and honour, and his life is written down by three great men, Samuel, Nathan, and Gad.<a name=340:12></a> Such was the value of that life!<a name=340:13></a> It says, "The acts of David the king first and last" <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:29">1 Chronicles  29:29</a>; and these last ones are the finest of all.<a name=340:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=342:10></a> Exactly.<a name=342:11></a> There was nothing in Him to deal with, but instead infinite complacency.<a name=342:12></a> The Spirit as a dove abode upon Him; that was in keeping with the voice from heaven announcing heaven's pleasure in Him.<a name=342:13></a> Here there is no voice, no articulation, but a sound, as of a rushing mighty wind, meaning that it was powerful, that which would deal in an unseen but in a felt way with all opposition.<a name=342:14></a> The operations of the Spirit are thus in connection with faith.<a name=342:15></a> I suppose the <i>wind</i> and faith go together.<a name=342:16></a> A cloud received the Lord out of sight, and so the faith period began; and the coming of the Spirit is in connection with that.<a name=342:17></a> Faith and the Holy Spirit go together.<a name=342:18></a> The power is in the form of wind.<a name=342:19></a> One of the great means by which God deals with things is the wind.<a name=342:20></a> The sound was there and it filled the house.<a name=342:21></a> That is where it should be heard -- in the house.<a name=342:22></a> It is a token that there should be irresistible power to deal with evil; fire to deal with it in a purifying way, wind to overthrow.<a name=342:23></a> Thus we have unmistakably an order of things here (the house where they were sitting characterising it) in which God would speak.<a name=342:24></a> He would use men to speak apart from corruption and there should be power to enforce what was spoken.<a name=342:25></a>

		I have been thinking, dear brethren, of substance, the substance that is acquirable, to use the figure implied in these scriptures -- tillage of the ground, for it is the divine thought that we should be thus enriched.<a name=365:1></a> There are two senses in which believers in Christ may be regarded as rich.<a name=365:2></a> The first is what may be called objective riches, riches that are available, but not always availed of.<a name=365:3></a> The Corinthian believers were of this class; their wealth was of this class; they were enriched in Christ, in all doctrine, in knowledge, in gift, but they were very poor subjectively, that is to say, they were unintelligent and unpractical in regard to the new commandment that is spoken of in the first epistle of John.<a name=365:4></a> You remember that there the apostle speaks of the old commandment, that which was from the beginning, "The word" he says, "which ye heard"; that is, all that had come out in Christ.<a name=365:5></a> There was substance in Christ.<a name=365:6></a> In Him was life we are told.<a name=365:7></a> It was not only that He spoke of God -- He did -- He declared God; all that was from the beginning, but besides what was spoken, there was the substance there.<a name=365:8></a> The life was there.<a name=365:9></a> Life was subsistent there, and it shone; it was the light of men.<a name=365:10></a> All that is involved in what was from the beginning, the old commandment; and the apostle says, "I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning.<a name=365:11></a> The old commandment is the word which ye heard" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:7">1 John  2:7</a> That must not be lessened or weakened in any way.<a name=365:12></a> The Corinthians had it.<a name=365:13></a> There was the presentation of the truth to them for a period of eighteen months at least; the truth in its objective features was presented, and they

		These features of life, treated throughout Scripture, all point to the incoming of Christ in whom life was.<a name=402:4></a> It was in Him as a source, so that the evangelist John, after stating the deity of our Lord in the most absolute terms, begins by saying, "In him was life and the life was the light of men" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>; not simply a light to men, but <i>the</i> Light.<a name=402:5></a> And then it says, "There was a man sent from God his name John.<a name=402:6></a> He came for witness that he might witness concerning the light" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:6">John  1:6</a>,7 Such is the character of this light, and the darkness into which it came, that witness had to be rendered to it; attention had to be called to it, and then it adds, "He was not the light" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:8">John  1:8</a> The true light is that which came into the world shedding its light on every man.<a name=402:7></a> It is not discriminating any more than the sun is.<a name=402:8></a> The sun shines on all kinds of men; it has no respect of persons, or nations, and so it is that this life in Christ becomes light to men -- to men, whatever their nationality or colour, or status in life; this light shines on all.<a name=402:9></a> It is indiscriminate.<a name=402:10></a> That is the true Light; a word that has to be noted.<a name=402:11></a>

		Now, I want you, beloved, to dwell on this in its universal bearing.<a name=404:6></a> But while the Scriptures do not contain all the words they contain enough to preserve and guard the truth, to be, as it were, banks between which the river of God, living, sparkling, life-giving, and refreshing, continually flows.<a name=404:7></a> We have from the pen of John, the loved disciple, that if all the things that Jesus did were written, the world itself would not contain the books.<a name=404:8></a> So that on God's part while there is no limit to what might be recorded, yet, what is written, need I say, is the most perfect, the most complete, the most forceful, the most searching in every respects of all books.<a name=404:9></a> In fact no book is worth the name save as based on the Bible.<a name=404:10></a> But it is not an attempt to be exhaustive, nor will any true minister of Christ attempt to be exhaustive; the truth is that the subject is inexhaustible; and so the Bible is not exhaustive, it is just enough; it is like the dimensions of the ark of the covenant, which was two cubits and a half, a cubit and a half both in breadth and in height.<a name=404:11></a> While you look at the ark you are reminded that there is something more, a half that way, a half this way, and a half the other way.<a name=404:12></a> Every way you look at it you are reminded that there is something more; as when the queen of Sheba came up and saw Solomon's grandeur and glory, she said,

		I have been thinking, dear brethren, of <i>blessing</i>, and I have selected the passage from Luke first of all, because of the bearing of that gospel.<a name=411:1></a> It has to do with the <i>public</i> position of God's people at the present time.<a name=411:2></a> John has to do with what we are inwardly through the work of God, but Luke deals with what is outward, and with which God can identify Himself morally, and so Luke works out his subjects in moral connections.<a name=411:3></a> He addresses what he has to say to one person, showing how God in grace takes account of each of us.<a name=411:4></a> It comes home to one that one person should be thus an object with God, and so you find throughout Luke illustrations of divine operations in individuals, all in connection with what is moral -- I mean in connection with public conduct -- what we have been as men and women here in this world; no matter how marked by ingratitude, or how dishonouring to God, yet God blesses us.<a name=411:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the saints, thus blessed, as gathered together, are seen in this gospel from this standpoint.<a name=411:6></a> Two of them had been on their way home after witnessing much of all the things which had happened.<a name=411:7></a> They had now turned their backs towards Jerusalem, towards the centre where God was about to carry on His testimony of grace, but they are followed up in spite of their unbelief, and then they return to Jerusalem.<a name=411:8></a> It is not that they are carried back as by a great shepherd, but there is a moral process in them; their hearts were made to burn; and they were addressed as "senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!<a name=411:9></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:25">Luke  24:25</a> The Lord went right into their house with them, and being at table with them, took the bread and blessed it and broke

	<div class="paragraph">
		it, and as He broke it, they recognised Him.<a name=412:1></a> Their recovery was a question of state, brought about through a moral process; their movement away from Jerusalem indicated a bad state of soul.<a name=412:2></a> At first their eyes were holden that they should not know Him.<a name=412:3></a> That was in keeping with the state they were in.<a name=412:4></a> Then their eyes were opened so that they recognised Him.<a name=412:5></a> When the two recognised Him they returned the same hour to Jerusalem.<a name=412:6></a> They went back sixty furlongs.<a name=412:7></a> When they arrived at Jerusalem they found the eleven.<a name=412:8></a> What <i>they</i> did was they <i>recognised</i> Him, they <i>returned</i>, and they <i>found</i> the eleven.<a name=412:9></a> They justified wisdom.<a name=412:10></a> What Luke brings out is that "Wisdom is justified by all her children" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:35">Luke  7:35</a> and this justification comes out in the way of movements and actions according to light received.<a name=412:11></a> It is not what we are told to do, but what we do as the outcome of light vouchsafed to us.<a name=412:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what was the company doing when these two reached them in Jerusalem?<a name=412:13></a> They found the eleven and those that were with them "gathered together" and they were saying certain things which had reference to Christ and that fitted in at that moment, not irrelevant matter.<a name=412:14></a> Our conversations ofttimes in our meetings are irrelevant, but here they were speaking together of things that referred to the then circumstances.<a name=412:15></a> People reaching things morally deal with known facts.<a name=412:16></a> They are saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:34">Luke  24:34</a> Perfectly relevant!<a name=412:17></a> It is not 'Peter', but one who has had a history, and a history that dates back to the moment he got that name Simon -- Simon son of Jonas.<a name=412:18></a> It was the name attaching to him as a <i>responsible</i> man in this world.<a name=412:19></a> He has been a sinner; as convicted he said, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:8">Luke  5:8</a> That is one of the finest things that he said about himself.<a name=412:20></a> It was not simply that his state was sinful, but he knew it by his conduct.<a name=412:21></a> He

	<div class="paragraph">
		had sinned.<a name=413:1></a> Even after he was converted and after he had been appointed an apostle he denied his Master.<a name=413:2></a> But now there he is, one of the eleven, an apostle, sitting there.<a name=413:3></a> These two who had been away had come back, and they find him with the others.<a name=413:4></a> The Lord had appeared unto Simon the sinner, he who had denied his Lord.<a name=413:5></a> His presence with the others was a wonderful testimony to the grace that was active in Christ risen.<a name=413:6></a> We need to keep this in view for we all are exposed to the power of sin.<a name=413:7></a> Simon's heart was no worse than mine or yours.<a name=413:8></a> Thus the remarks being made were perfectly relevant, they were practical, they were suited for that company.<a name=413:9></a> And so as we are together we are to converse about the things that convey an impression of Christ, and one of the greatest expressions of grace is, that the Lord Jesus, after He rose, selected Simon to appear to -- "And has appeared to Simon" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:34">Luke  24:34</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was what they were saying, and so these two also say something, and what they say is suitable, too; it fits.<a name=413:10></a> It is a public matter, and our conversation should be such as should be in testimony.<a name=413:11></a> The epistle to the Corinthians deals with this, the importance of saying things with the understanding and with the spirit, even if only five words, but it should be applicable to the moment.<a name=413:12></a> So the two told what things were done in the way, and how He had been recognised by them in the breaking of bread.<a name=413:13></a> The breaking of bread is a public thing.<a name=413:14></a> Its meaning should be understood.<a name=413:15></a> They understood it; they were speaking about it.<a name=413:16></a> The part that they contributed was that He had been known to them in the breaking of bread.<a name=413:17></a> It was no theory, it was a fact.<a name=413:18></a> They were relating facts that had a bearing on the public position of the assembly.<a name=413:19></a> And then the Lord came as they said these things and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace [be] unto you" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:36">Luke  24:36</a> Then He says, "<i>Ye</i> are witnesses of these things" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:48">Luke  24:48</a> that is to

		say, witnesses in the sense of having <i>seen</i> them.<a name=414:1></a> It is one thing to be a witness, it is another thing to <i>bear</i> witness.<a name=414:2></a> I may witness many things of which I say nothing.<a name=414:3></a> We are able to speak of the things that we see, and of the things that we know.<a name=414:4></a> The public assembly, beloved friends, should be marked by these features -- that you are speaking of what you <i>know</i>.<a name=414:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the final thought is that He <i>led them out</i>; they were a company that He could lead, and they do not go any further than the point which He intended they should reach.<a name=414:6></a> He led them out as far as to Bethany, because in Luke it is a question of God, and God bearing witness here publicly, and we must not go beyond the point that He has intended for us.<a name=414:7></a> One of the most important things in regard to the public position is to know how to be regulated by divine limitations.<a name=414:8></a> At times we may get depressed in thinking of the untold millions of men and women in the world to whom the gospel is not presented, and this extending backward now nearly 2,000 years.<a name=414:9></a> The explanation largely is divine limitation; God knows everything and He is not neglectful.<a name=414:10></a> And so while the Lord says, "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:47">Luke  24:47</a> yet He leads them out as far as to Bethany.<a name=414:11></a> He reminds them at once of leadership and limitation.<a name=414:12></a> He is to be Leader, and He leads on that principle.<a name=414:13></a> The field of testimony is the whole world; all the nations in Matthew and Luke, all the creation in Mark.<a name=414:14></a> We must on no account set aside levitical principles; those who preach are necessarily subject to the Lord's leading, and order, and government.<a name=414:15></a> The Lord knows the good soil from the bad; He knows where to send His reapers, so as to get fruit, hence we find that such an one as Paul could say the Spirit suffered us not, "having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:6">Acts  16:6</a> These are levitical touches.<a name=414:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I do not dwell upon that, but only to show you the conditions of blessing -- that they are moral -- and the final test is, can I submit to divine limitations?<a name=415:1></a> Thus it was He led them out as far as to Bethany and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.<a name=415:2></a> To understand the blessing is to understand the gospel, so that the Lord has a company He can lead, and who are subject to divine limitations; and they know what to do.<a name=415:3></a> They virtually say, we see what the Lord means; He wishes us to go back to Jerusalem.<a name=415:4></a> He did not take us very far away, fifteen furlongs off (not more than two miles) and then they went back to Jerusalem, and were there in the temple daily full of joy, praising and blessing God.<a name=415:5></a> There was thus in Jerusalem a positive testimony; not what they said, but what they <i>were</i> -- they returned with great joy, praising and blessing God.<a name=415:6></a> A wonderful contribution!<a name=415:7></a> They returned to Jerusalem and were there the expression of Christ.<a name=415:8></a> It is in movement in relation to divine limitations -- the commandments of the Lord -- that the blessing continues, and that we are consciously blessed, for "obedience is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams" <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#15:22">1 Samuel  15:22</a> Obedience brings in the blessing of God, the consciousness of divine favour.<a name=415:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having said that much, I want to review briefly these few scriptures in Genesis.<a name=415:10></a> Genesis is full of references to blessing.<a name=415:11></a> It speaks volumes as to what is in the mind of God.<a name=415:12></a> I selected these three passages only.<a name=415:13></a> The first has reference <i>to government</i>, which, as you can see, fits in with what I have said, but it belongs more particularly to the gospel of Matthew, as that gospel deals with government; hence it is "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:1">Matthew  1:1</a>; son of David first, then son of Abraham; it is a question of government, hence the king is mentioned first.<a name=415:14></a> Then the Gentiles come up from the East enquiring

		for One born king, pointing, I may say, to a coming day when the East would come in for the blessing.<a name=416:1></a> The Greeks (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>) do not ask for a king; they would see Jesus, but the Magi from the East ask for a king, He who was born King of the Jews.<a name=416:2></a> I have no doubt that that is an allusion to a coming day, when the East shall come in for blessing in Christ, not as the Son of man but as the King of the Jews.<a name=416:3></a> The Jews have the first place in the future.<a name=416:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the gospel of Matthew, as I said, is <i>government and blessing in that relation</i>.<a name=416:5></a> Some of us may not have any idea of having part in the government of God, but we have.<a name=416:6></a> We are told we shall judge angels, and so we should learn to judge and govern now.<a name=416:7></a> In order to govern, one must begin with oneself.<a name=416:8></a> He that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city.<a name=416:9></a> The ruling of one's own spirit is the first thing.<a name=416:10></a> Noah failed in this.<a name=416:11></a> He was unable to rule himself.<a name=416:12></a> He planted a vineyard and became drunk.<a name=416:13></a> He lost the sense of government while he was drunk: so that, to govern, I must judge myself; I must rule my own spirit, if I am to be blessed in relation to government.<a name=416:14></a> One could say a great deal about chapter 9 of Genesis, for not only is Noah blessed but his sons are blessed, and they are to multiply, and all the creatures of the earth are to be superintended by them.<a name=416:15></a> Man's hands and features are calculated to enhance his position in government, but we have to be blessed in relation to it, so that we may do it as God does it.<a name=416:16></a> We are not to be arbitrary in it.<a name=416:17></a> One is blessed in order to be a part of the great vessel of administration which the gospel of Matthew develops, for the assembly is the vessel of government at the present time.<a name=416:18></a> The trespass of an unrepentant brother is to be told to the assembly, and it is said, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:18">Matthew  18:18</a> If one does not hear the assembly, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.<a name=416:19></a>

		I am thinking, dear brethren, of the continual necessity of adjustment; for even when we are prompted by the most praiseworthy motives we are continually in need of it.<a name=434:1></a> God, having brought in a standard in Christ, never withdraws His eyes from that standard, having it in view for everyone, particularly for us, so that we should be presented perfect, and should all arrive at the full-grown man.<a name=434:2></a> There are the two thoughts; on the one hand the responsibility of those who would minister to us, whether Paul or others, to present every man perfect in Christ, and on the other hand that everyone should arrive at the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, having in view the standard God has before Him that all should arrive at.<a name=434:3></a> The need, to say the least, is that we should not be babes; some are that; some were that when Paul wrote his letter to the Ephesians.<a name=434:4></a> It is normal to be a babe when one is converted, but there should be steady growth to manhood.<a name=434:5></a> It is to abnormal babes that the word, that we should be no longer such, comes.<a name=434:6></a> Every normal babe is delightful.<a name=434:7></a> What is normal is always pleasing in the things of God, and so you find that the Lord was always normal, whether as a Babe, or as a Boy, or as a Man.<a name=434:8></a> He was always as normal, delightful to God.<a name=434:9></a> Abnormal never refers to Christ but, alas, generally to us.<a name=434:10></a> And it is such a class that is especially in view, when the word is given that we may be no longer babes tossed and carried about by every wind of that teaching which is in the sleight of men, in unprincipled cunning with a view to systematised error.<a name=434:11></a> All undergrowths are peculiarly exposed to this jugglery, and we are warned of it so that we

		I wish now to illustrate from Solomon what I have in mind.<a name=446:8></a> I hope young believers especially will follow what I have to say, so that they may know the interest that God has in them from the very outset.<a name=446:9></a> Solomon is taken up, representing one in relation with the father as adopted.<a name=446:10></a> God said of him "I will be his father, and he shall be my son" So that although Solomon was chosen, he was not adopted as he was born; but he was loved as he was born.<a name=446:11></a> I need not say that God could not adopt what He could not love; He adopts what He can love; and certainly He cannot adopt the man after the flesh.<a name=446:12></a> There is that which is of God, and God, I may say, loves one, not only in the general sense in

		which it says God loves the world, but He loves what is lovable.<a name=447:1></a> God loves what is lovable, as we get Moses saying, "Yea, he loveth the peoples" <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:3">Deuteronomy  33:3</a> "When Israel was a child then I loved him" <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:1">Hosea  11:1</a> He was lovable.<a name=447:2></a> And so it is that God loves you, and He adopts what He loves; and so with Solomon.<a name=447:3></a> He is called Solomon by his father, meaning 'peace' or 'peaceful', and I may say a young man or woman is of no practical value until he, or she, becomes "a son of peace" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:6">Luke  10:6</a> All the troubles among the people of God arise from those who are not sons of peace -- like Absalom.<a name=447:4></a>

		Well, as Solomon was born, and peace marked him prophetically, God comes in and indicates as to him more than peace, he is lovable.<a name=447:5></a> These are the traits of the initial work of God in us, and the greatest care is required lest damage happens between that and the time when the believer should say, "Abba, Father" God sees the end from the beginning, and so Solomon as a child is loved by Him, and he was called Jedidiah because of the Lord.<a name=447:6></a> "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a> and "God is a Spirit" <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:24">John  4:24</a> But then adoption comes in; the believer gets the Spirit of adoption whereby he cries "Abba, Father" Every believer should be assured that he has the Spirit of God.<a name=447:7></a> "Ye have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received a Spirit of adoption" God has marked me off and sealed me; He has anointed me; He has given me the earnest of the Spirit in my heart; I have received the Spirit of adoption, and I cry "Abba, Father" God has worked in me, and now I am come into the region of family relationship; I am consciously in sonship, having liberty to call God, Father.<a name=447:8></a> That is the great line in Solomon.<a name=447:9></a> As David is before the great assembly in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#28">1 Chronicles  28</a>, he "stood up upon his feet" and said that he had had it in his heart to build a house for the Lord, but he was a man of war and had shed blood; but as divinely instructed he

		Well now, proceeding in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29">1 Chronicles  29</a>, I want to show you how much fell to Solomon in early age.<a name=449:5></a> Some of us assume that certain work may be done by the elder brethren only.<a name=449:6></a> God intimates plainly that it is His province to select the workers.<a name=449:7></a> Age has its own value, but it may be blemished as in David's case; at any rate, God must be allowed to choose.<a name=449:8></a> David bowed with all his heart and said, God has chosen Solomon, my son.<a name=449:9></a> Solomon was a very young man, about twenty -- certainly not much more; anyway, David says, "Solomon, my son, the one whom God has chosen, is young and tender" Did the Lord not know that he was young?<a name=449:10></a> He did.<a name=449:11></a> He knew every day of that child's life, every moment of it.<a name=449:12></a> No one knew better than Jehovah how old Solomon was, and David knew.<a name=449:13></a> He was his father's son, tender and beloved.<a name=449:14></a> May we not learn from this what divine sympathy with the young brothers and sisters is?<a name=449:15></a> Are they to be kept always in the nursery?<a name=449:16></a> God has chosen them; He knows their age.<a name=449:17></a> "Solomon, my son, the one whom God has chosen, is young and tender" and yet the work given him to do was great.<a name=449:18></a> What is the work?<a name=449:19></a> A <i>palace</i> is to be built.<a name=449:20></a> The palace is being built now, and all those young people are needed, but they are young and tender; they need much care.<a name=449:21></a> One generation passes away and another comes, and God has the tenderest consideration for the young generation.<a name=449:22></a> Think of the magnitude of the work resting upon their shoulders!<a name=449:23></a> Being young and tender, they need

		But I want to show just in closing how we reach the idea of the greatness of God, as seen in the passage I read from Ephesians.<a name=450:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, in relation to the unity of the Spirit, we have a fixed order of things, beginning with the body -- a very remarkable fact, for instead of beginning with God, the fixed order of things begins with one body, which means the saints.<a name=450:14></a> "One body, and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:4">Ephesians  4:4</a>,5 These things exist.<a name=450:15></a> They are a fixed order of things before God, and immutable as the heavens and the earth are.<a name=450:16></a> And finally, there is "one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all" Now you see how the believer, beginning with "Abba, Father" develops
