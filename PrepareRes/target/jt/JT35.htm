	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> Those who have read the book of Kings with attention will discern that this chapter begins a section, in which is worked out the thought of God's rights; as conditions reached their worst in Israel.<a name=1:3></a> Then further, we have the thought of His patience, Ahab and Jezebel affording examples of the worst influences that had been in Israel, for in them is developed the greatest wickedness -- and yet God uses Ahab, and helps him against the Syrians, and then ultimately saves Jehoshaphat, although he was in a false position when, as allied with Ahab, he went to war.<a name=1:4></a> These chapters, therefore, afford much instruction for us; and the first feature of the instruction is in the discipline and formation of the vessel through whom God spoke and wrought.<a name=1:5></a>

		W.H.<a name=1:6></a>M.<a name=1:7></a> Elijah says, "Jehovah .<a name=1:8></a>.<a name=1:9></a>.<a name=1:10></a> before whom I stand", but he had something else to learn.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:12></a> Yes, he had come into the attitude of service; so that a secret, untold history is suggested.<a name=1:13></a> The epistle of James throws light on the first verse, because James tells us that Elijah was a man "of like passions to us" (chapter 5: 17), so that he was not anything extraordinary in that sense, thus bringing the service of God within the range of anyone.<a name=1:14></a> "He prayed with prayer", it says, meaning that he was a man who had learned how to pray, which must precede all useful service.<a name=1:15></a> His was not only a formal prayer, but that which is really prayer.<a name=1:16></a> The result was that "it did not rain upon the earth three years and six months; and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to spring forth".<a name=1:17></a> We are reminded in the first prayer, of what is secret in the history of God's servants, for there is no

		allusion to it in the Old Testament.<a name=2:1></a> God will not identify Himself with any servant save as he has a secret history with Himself earlier, and has learned how to pray; that is, prayer means that I depend on God, not on myself.<a name=2:2></a> "The surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:7">2 Corinthians  4:7</a>.<a name=2:3></a> The position is thus clear enough as applicable today.<a name=2:4></a> The previous chapter depicts the darkness of the state that prevailed in Israel, but at the darkest hour God brings forward an unlikely man, a man hitherto unheard of, but who had had relations with Himself and had learned how to pray, to depend on God.<a name=2:5></a> He takes him up and puts him through certain exercises, and then uses him in the most striking manner, as a vessel of His power.<a name=2:6></a>

		T.G.<a name=2:7></a> Is that why he is said to be "of the inhabitants of Gilead" -- he was not known till God called him, he was in secret with God.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:9></a> Yes, he was from a territory that was under reproach spiritually; Gilead was under reproach as the territory of the two and a half tribes -- the sovereignty of God is evidenced in that.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=2:11></a> Would that come in as a rebuke to those in the land, that one from that territory should be chosen?<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:13></a> Yes.<a name=2:14></a> The nine and a half tribes would assume they had special spiritual advantages, but God is not restricting Himself to those who make claims; as soon as we begin to make claims, God shows He is not under obligation to us on those grounds; He acts on account of what He is in Himself.<a name=2:15></a>

		P.L.<a name=2:16></a> The early ministry of the great Prophet, the Lord, in Mark's gospel is much in Galilee.<a name=2:17></a> Is the place of it a rebuke to apostate Israel?<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:19></a> That is the thought in the Lord's great activities in Galilee in the synoptic gospels; it is to bring out that God is slighting the claims of Jerusalem.<a name=2:20></a> Elijah's subsequent history shows that he had relations with God.<a name=2:21></a> Our relations with God should arise, not from any specific feature of God's work or ways, but from our

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Yes, it is <i>that</i> God.<a name=3:5></a> "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth", that is, it is the covenant God, which implies all that He is, in so far as He may be known.<a name=3:6></a> Paul says, "God, who .<a name=3:7></a>.<a name=3:8></a>.<a name=3:9></a> called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:15">Galatians  1:15</a>, 16.<a name=3:10></a> It is the full thought of God.<a name=3:11></a> Service ought to be based on the full thought of God.<a name=3:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> Yes, but it is a fuller thought; he refers to more than is recorded of his experience outside Damascus.<a name=3:16></a> The revelation of God's Son <i>in</i> him includes more than that, his commission is involved -- "That I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations".<a name=3:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:20></a> The withholding of blessing in a disciplinary way is with a view to blessing, so that we might be prepared to enjoy it.<a name=3:21></a> The two prayers viewed together imply blessing; discipline has blessing in view.<a name=3:22></a> The shutting up of the heavens for three years and six months seems severe, and Elijah had to go through the experience himself.<a name=3:23></a> We must bear in mind that, if we pray for anything, we cannot escape the consequences.<a name=3:24></a> If our prayers have to do with the people of God, we must go through the thing we pray for, with them; if it be disciplinary, we must go through it with them.<a name=3:25></a> The thing is with a view to blessing -- he prayed again: it is all of one piece, we must have the <i>two</i> prayers.<a name=3:26></a> If we are with God, we learn God has blessing in view.<a name=3:27></a> Jehovah the God of Israel implies the covenant God.<a name=3:28></a> God is true to His covenant.<a name=3:29></a> If the servant sees that discipline of this severe kind is necessary and asks for it, God accedes to his wish; and then he has to go through

		the thing with the people, but he goes through it with great advantage.<a name=4:1></a> He is with God, and God knows where the torrent is, but the servant has to go through the discipline.<a name=4:2></a> That is the teaching of this chapter.<a name=4:3></a> It is a question of going through things with God, so that there is a feeling with us about them.<a name=4:4></a> It is all very well to pray that a brother might be disciplined, seeing that he needs it, but going through the thing is another matter; in going through it, you have power as to it.<a name=4:5></a> It is a certainty that in praying for a brother I shall have power with him in time, if I go through things myself.<a name=4:6></a> Elijah is immediately sent -- "The word of Jehovah came to him saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the torrent Cherith, which is before the Jordan".<a name=4:7></a> This position, the torrent Cherith in the neighbourhood of the Jordan, has a great deal in it for faith: as there, I am in the presence of something that may dry up, a very solemn matter.<a name=4:8></a> Plenty of water at a given moment may not always last.<a name=4:9></a> God has a means of drying up the brooks, and Elijah had to go through the experience of seeing the means of his supply dry up; that is a solemn matter!<a name=4:10></a> Then moreover, he had to learn God's power in the creation.<a name=4:11></a> We, perhaps, overlook that, in intervening for us, God wishes us to understand Him, not only in redemption but in creation; the servant has to learn God in creation.<a name=4:12></a> He is a faithful Creator, and He has great resources in the creation.<a name=4:13></a>

		P.L.<a name=5:1></a> Would the turning eastward suggest that, while you humbly thank God for the brook, you can survive the drying up of it?<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:3></a> Yes, 'eastward' is a region of hope.<a name=5:4></a> Elijah had not a word of complaint so far, but the education of a brook drying up is important for those who serve, we may have been drinking from other sources, depending on other brothers, or other ministry, but that may come to an end.<a name=5:5></a> Elijah has to go through that experience, and it would result for us in this, that one can say: As far as I am concerned, the brooks will not dry up; that is to say, one relies on the Spirit of God oneself and thus <i>I</i> become a means of supply.<a name=5:6></a> Then the creational resources of God have to be apprehended; He is a faithful Creator and has agencies He can employ.<a name=5:7></a> If men are not available to Him, He is not without resource, and the agency used here is the raven.<a name=5:8></a> Nature teaches us, we are told, and the teaching of the ravens here would be unselfishness.<a name=5:9></a> A raven is a carnivorous bird, and why should he deny himself to bring flesh to Elijah?<a name=5:10></a> Why does he not devour it himself?<a name=5:11></a> It would be unselfishness; and that is what the woman had to learn.<a name=5:12></a> Elijah learned from the ravens the principle of unselfishness, and now the woman of Zarephath has to learn that principle too -- "make me thereof a little cake first".<a name=5:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:13></a> It is important for the servant to learn to hide himself, especially if he has great gift; it is the teaching of Colossians; when God enjoins it, it is the more important.<a name=6:14></a> "Get thee hence and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the torrent Cherith, which is before the Jordan".<a name=6:15></a> He is hiding himself in a good place, there is refreshment -- bread and flesh.<a name=6:16></a> These things are amplified in Christ -- bread and flesh.<a name=6:17></a> He is the bread of God, and He gives His flesh for the life of the world.<a name=6:18></a> It may be humbling to learn from a creature, from nature, but it is important that we should not miss the lessons of nature, for "the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:20">Romans  1:20</a>.<a name=6:19></a> That encourages us as to the whole race of mankind in all its history; God has not left Himself without a witness in creation.<a name=6:20></a> He has His ravens and asses.<a name=6:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=7:7></a> Is there something akin to Philadelphia in this?<a name=7:8></a> Elijah, having learned the resources of God through so many different agencies, would connect with the "opened door".<a name=7:9></a> Then the Lord speaks of "the word of my patience" and there is the "little power".<a name=7:10></a> Everything is small here: the brook -- a "little water" -- "a morsel of bread" -- "a handful of meal" -- "a little oil", and so on.<a name=7:11></a> Is this like Philadelphia?<a name=7:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:13></a> Yes, I think it is the setting of the whole Apocalypse.<a name=7:14></a> "I, John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and <i>patience</i>, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>.<a name=7:15></a> He was equal to the service put upon him, to write "what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these".<a name=7:16></a> He is to write as the Lord touches him.<a name=7:17></a> He puts His right hand upon him; he is under the touch of Christ; but he is "in the .<a name=7:18></a>.<a name=7:19></a>.<a name=7:20></a> kingdom and patience in Jesus", he is a brother and companion of the saints in tribulation.<a name=7:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:3></a> Yes, that is the lesson, to be hidden; not to seek to make a show by preaching immediately, or taking a reading, or a special meeting, as we say, but to learn in secret with God, knowing fully the actual situation which you are in; a situation which you have brought about by your prayers, as it were.<a name=8:4></a> Then, being regulated by God in that very situation which you have yourself brought about by prayer, God follows you up to see that you do not get elated by the great place you have, but that you are hidden away, and kept in the enjoyment of these positive things, all coming about in the most unlikely way; a humiliating way indeed.<a name=8:5></a> The ravens were under reproach, but they are doing this work well, morning and night, and every time they come, you would say, 'Thank God for the unselfishness of those birds': they would become great in your eyes.<a name=8:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:13></a> Quite so: a very unclean one to begin with -- a jailor.<a name=8:14></a> This learning from nature is humiliating, it would be so to Elijah, that an unclean bird should be feeding him; but he would begin to see through the mere letter of the law; to see that after all we have to connect God's creatures with Himself, and not to regard them as unclean and detach them from God; that would be misleading.<a name=8:15></a> They are <i>God's</i> creatures; as already said, the type shows there <i>had</i> been divine cleansing.<a name=8:16></a> Then the saints have to come to see that we are to be servants like the ravens, that is a lesson for every saint.<a name=8:17></a> This

		THE RIGHTS AND PATIENCE OF GOD IN TESTIMONY (2)

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#18:1">1 Kings  18:1</a> - 46
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=22:1></a> Our subject this afternoon is public service.<a name=22:2></a> Elijah had spoken to Ahab, according to verse 1 of chapter 17, saying, "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except by my word".<a name=22:3></a> The position was thus made clear, it was one in which the word stood, an important principle in public ministry that the servant's word stands; as it is said of Samuel that none of his words fell to the ground, <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#3:19">1 Samuel  3:19</a>.<a name=22:4></a> Jehovah saw to that, and the position being made clear, the servant has to go through certain experiences, so as to fit him for showing himself to Ahab; this time not merely to announce the mind of God, but to express it in power, so that we have "the word of Jehovah came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the face of the earth".<a name=22:5></a> The commission of the servant is thus accompanied by the assurance that the blessing is coming.<a name=22:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=22:7></a> Do you think that the public service, by his showing himself, has not only the word of the Lord through the servant in view, but that there is to be the personal representation of what is in the mind of God?<a name=22:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=22:9></a> That is what I was thinking, that the person himself enters into the testimony.<a name=22:10></a> So Luke calls attention to the Lord as in the synagogue, how they wondered at the words of grace that were coming out of His mouth, and every eye was fastened on Him; attention is called to the Vessel of grace.<a name=22:11></a> As we see in the type, the light was to shine over against the candlestick -- meaning that the candlestick itself was to be in evidence.<a name=22:12></a> It says here, "Elijah <i>went</i> to shew himself to Ahab" -- that is the point.<a name=22:13></a> Then there are other movements which enhance this, the movements of Ahab and Obadiah; they
	</div>

		<a name=23>[Page 23]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are occupied profitably with a view to positive good.<a name=23:1></a> That is to say, as the servant moves under divine direction, other conditions come into evidence ordered of God, which enhance the service.<a name=23:2></a> The enemy's power is checked in that Ahab at the moment is occupied in looking for grass, with Obadiah, the steward of his house; that is to say, we are to take account of every movement in Christendom, that has good as its end, as so far in our favour.<a name=23:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=23:4></a> The position of hiding is now over when you speak of his showing himself to Ahab?<a name=23:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=23:6></a> Quite so.<a name=23:7></a> We read in the New Testament of "the day of his showing to Israel", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:80">Luke  1:80</a>.<a name=23:8></a> God indicates a suitable time when the servant is fit for it and the circumstances are ordered of God so as to make the service effective, so in serving God we are to have our eye abroad on the whole sphere of profession.<a name=23:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=23:10></a> Is not the desire for food among the people of God the great opportunity for this kind of service?<a name=23:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=23:12></a> I thought that, even although it is food of a very low order, it is still food.<a name=23:13></a> So that the circumstances are favourable, and it says that "Elijah went to shew himself", and then in verse 6, "Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself".<a name=23:14></a> It is well that they are separated for the purpose in view, so that it goes on to say, "as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him".<a name=23:15></a> It was much more advantageous for the purpose in view that he should meet Obadiah first, Obadiah forming a link between Elijah and Ahab.<a name=23:16></a> There is thus a modification which is ordered of God between what is wholly of God and the opposite.<a name=23:17></a> God does not order sudden clashes, He brings in the principle of modification.<a name=23:18></a> "Obadiah was on the way", it says, which is an expression having its own meaning in Scripture, beginning with the servant of Abraham, who said, "I being in the way .<a name=23:19></a>.<a name=23:20></a>.<a name=23:21></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:27">Genesis  24:27</a>.<a name=23:22></a> He was occupied under orders with a profitable end in view.<a name=23:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:3></a> Yes, that is the thought.<a name=24:4></a> What is of God in the service, however insignificant it may appear, is to be taken account of as of God.<a name=24:5></a> Then the Spirit of God records what marked him; we are told, "now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly; and it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and maintained them with bread and water".<a name=24:6></a> The Holy Spirit tells us about it, to remind us that, if we are set to serve, He will put us in touch with the interested element, with what is of Himself, however small in measure.<a name=24:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:11></a> That is what I had in mind, that we might see the setting of service today, that we are not to serve in a corner but in relation to the whole area of christendom, to take account of what is of God.<a name=24:12></a> Even an Ahab if he is moving with a good end in view is not to be despised.<a name=24:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:16></a> I thought that.<a name=24:17></a> That is his first concern, to write to the assemblies; the whole area of christendom is in mind, so that we take account of what is good: the Lord does that in each address.<a name=24:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=25:7></a> I think that is right.<a name=25:8></a> The eunuch was reading the Scriptures, and Philip was enjoined by the Spirit to join himself to the chariot, which is really more than what you get here.<a name=25:9></a> Elijah would not join himself to Obadiah in what he was doing, but he was doing something; he was working under the orders of Ahab, and Elijah says "thy lord", referring to Ahab.<a name=25:10></a> Ahab was not Elijah's lord in that sense.<a name=25:11></a> The Holy Spirit tells us about Obadiah, he was a remarkable man; God will love to bring into evidence the fruit of His own work, even though it was in a false setting.<a name=25:12></a> A man who hid fifty prophets in a cave from Jezebel's wrath is not one to be despised.<a name=25:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=25:16></a> Just so.<a name=25:17></a> Whatever was good with him God would bring into evidence.<a name=25:18></a> Obadiah, I think, in what he says, in his anxieties, represents that weakness of faith that marks those who are the subjects of the work of God in these circumstances, that is, it is the work of God in a set of circumstances that is inimical to it, but still it is the work of God, and God loves to bring out His own work.<a name=25:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=40:1></a> It seems as if it is required that we should pay special attention to the vessel in whom God intervened in a positive way, so that the Spirit brings us back to the history of Elijah, personally, in this chapter, though alas!<a name=40:2></a> to record his failure.<a name=40:3></a> This is a feature of the subject that enters into our own times; for God graciously brought about a state of things through which He intervened in christendom in great power, bringing about the exposure of all its features and ramifications.<a name=40:4></a> But there was failure, as in the case of Elijah, yet not irretrievable failure, for, through grace, the testimony still goes on in conditions more or less suitable to God: and, as we see in Elijah, we may look for a triumph at the end, for he is received up into heaven.<a name=40:5></a> The culmination of the present activities of the Spirit in the saints will be their catching up into heaven.<a name=40:6></a> Elijah's history furnishes light as to this, and encouragement; but it also rebukes us, and that is seemly, so that saints should feel the terrible failure that has come in in that which God raised up, and through which He spoke and acted towards the whole of christendom.<a name=40:7></a> As we have part in the revival that continues, through grace, we have also our part in the failure; and, if there is to be any culmination according to God of the present service, we must be cast upon God and His faithfulness and patience with us.<a name=40:8></a> He has to bear with us every day, He suffers our manners, but He goes on with us.<a name=40:9></a> So this chapter begins with Ahab's disloyalty as to what had come about -- he told things to Jezebel; and her true character comes out for she "sent a messenger to Elijah saying, So do the gods to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time!<a name=40:10></a>" She makes no allusion to Ahab, it is what <i>she</i>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=85:1></a> As was pointed out this morning, in chapter 1 one man falls; and in chapter 2, another is taken up to the heavens.<a name=85:2></a> The first, that is the king of Israel, representing in our own times the responsible element in the sphere of profession, falls through the lattice, which could not afford great support, nor is it intended for this, and he becomes sick.<a name=85:3></a> The responsible element is thus marked by moral disease, and is fallen; the full expression of it will be in Babylon -- "Great Babylon has fallen".<a name=85:4></a> Indeed the book of Revelation is marked, in a sense, by certain things falling, and others being elevated.<a name=85:5></a> We are to consider now the thought of what is taken <i>up</i>, and what will be observed is not only the fact of Elijah's translation to heaven but the <i>time</i> of it; it says, "<i>when</i> Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens .<a name=85:6></a>.<a name=85:7></a>.<a name=85:8></a>"; the time of the rapture of the assembly is, we may say, <i>now</i>: that is, since the revival of the truth, the thought of the Lord's coming, the rapture of the assembly, was regarded and rightly so, as just pending, as imminent.<a name=85:9></a> What follows is in view of the rapture of the saints, and, in order that the significance of the chapter may be clear, we should see that it is not only the rapture of the assembly, it is a type of Christ's ascension too, and this enters into the ascension of the assembly: because undoubtedly the man child caught up to God and His throne, includes His body, the assembly (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12:5">Revelation  12:5</a>).<a name=85:10></a> So that it is "<i>when</i>" Jehovah would take him up -- <i>the time of it</i>, and what follows in view of that.<a name=85:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=86:6></a> That is right, and you will observe that Elijah went with Elisha.<a name=86:7></a> It is a credit to Elisha that it is not said, 'Elisha went with Elijah', but that "Elijah went with Elisha"; there was already a move in Elisha's soul in that direction.<a name=86:8></a> Resurrection and ascension are by the way of death; we must go that way.<a name=86:9></a> There are many who talk much about the coming of the Lord, but who have no thought of moving to Gilgal.<a name=86:10></a> The word is that "when Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal", so Elisha is already moving in his mind from the place of death.<a name=86:11></a>

		From these scriptures I intend, by the Lord's help, to say something about His sonship, having in mind to point out that the knowledge of Him as the Son is dependent on our being in the circumstances in connection with which that knowledge is disclosed.<a name=116:1></a> It will be found in the Scriptures, and by experience, that, in the unfolding of the truth, each part has its own setting, and the clear apprehension of it depends on our being in that setting.<a name=116:2></a> Defectiveness as to the truth is largely accountable to the fact that we do not get into the circumstances in which any particular truth is disclosed.<a name=116:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One would illustrate this important principle by pointing out that the light of the purpose of God was disclosed to Abraham as he was in the land, not in Mesopotamia; and so the light as to God and His name was disclosed to Jacob when he was in Bethel, not in Padan; and the light as to the divine dwelling in the tabernacle was not disclosed to Israel until they were in the circumstances of it, that is, in the wilderness.<a name=116:4></a> One could multiply illustrations of this principle; and the principle is intended to test us as to whether, if we apprehend any truth, we are ready to move into the circumstances in which it was primarily disclosed.<a name=116:5></a> Christianity is not an armchair matter, it requires movement, and sometimes movement involving the most humiliating and painful experiences, but we shall always prove that these experiences and these sacrifices are worth while.<a name=116:6></a>

		John is not here now, but the Lord is not without someone like him.<a name=139:2></a> For instance, the Lord takes a little child and sets him by Him.<a name=139:3></a> Never did that little child look so beautiful as when he was set beside the Lord Jesus!<a name=139:4></a> You might say that the glory of Christ would eclipse whatever glory there was in the child, but no, the glory of the feeblest of us, and we are "vessels of mercy .<a name=139:5></a>.<a name=139:6></a>.<a name=139:7></a> before prepared for glory", will not be eclipsed by the glory of Christ.<a name=139:8></a> We reflect His glory, in fact.<a name=139:9></a> So that the little child is set <i>by</i> the Lord, and He refers to him.<a name=139:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:2">Matthew  18:2</a> it says, "Jesus having called a little child to him", meaning that the child was amenable to the Lord's will; he was not a wayward child, that is, not a wayward saint.<a name=139:11></a> He says to the disciples, "Unless ye are converted and become as little children .<a name=139:12></a>.<a name=139:13></a>.<a name=139:14></a>" And then in verse 4 He says, "as <i>this</i> little child".<a name=139:15></a> So that the Lord has someone at all times amenable to His will, and suitable for any specific purpose that He may have in mind, so that He can point to him.<a name=139:16></a> Now, I can understand that every lover of Christ would aspire to that -- to be in such a state of subjection and moral beauty that the Lord can say of him, as He did in the Pharisee's house -- "Seest thou" this person?<a name=139:17></a> You might say, Well, if I were in other circumstances I could shine better, and be more for Christ.<a name=139:18></a> But here is a woman, in the most withering circumstances as far as she was concerned, a woman of the city, but the Lord turns to her, and says to Simon, "Seest thou this woman?<a name=139:19></a>" There was something there as corresponding to Himself that the Lord could call attention to.<a name=139:20></a> She illustrates a feature of the personnel of the assembly; that is, of that vessel in which God sets out His testimony at the present time.<a name=139:21></a> There are many features among these persons; she is one to whom

		CHRIST'S SONSHIP IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (1)

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=149:2></a> It was thought that we might consider the sonship of Christ as seen in the gospel of Matthew, as found in six settings.<a name=149:3></a> The first in chapter 2; the second in chapters 3 and 4; the third in chapter 11; the fourth in chapter 16; the fifth in chapter 17 -- the mount of transfiguration; and the sixth in chapter 28.<a name=149:4></a> There are other references to sonship in the gospel, but these are the main passages, and I believe the Lord will help us in looking at them as affording a subject which, needless to say, is of immense moment at the present time.<a name=149:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object in mind is not only that we might get the truth by itself as presented in these passages -- that is, the truth abstractly, and perfectly presented in Christ -- but that we might see the bearing of it on our own present position, because what may be remarked as to Matthew's gospel as a whole is that it bears on the assembly, not only as seen at Pentecost, or even as Paul presents it at Corinth and Ephesus, but right through to the present time.<a name=149:6></a> It contemplates the whole history or sojourn of the assembly here on earth, and views it as being the vessel of the testimony and the object of incessant opposition; therefore we may look in Matthew's gospel for provision to meet this opposition with the kind of endurance that is needed for it.<a name=149:7></a> With this in view, it may be further remarked that chapter 1 bears on our present position as regards the question of its <i>legality</i>: whether the ground taken today by the saints who are seeking to do the will of God is legal, that is, right according to divine requirements as before

		God and men; whether the position is tenable from that standpoint.<a name=150:1></a> This is the point of view in chapter 1 in regard of the position of Christ, as it is said, "Jesus, who is <i>called</i> Christ" (verse 16).<a name=150:2></a> He had acquired that name rightfully -- given to Him, of course -- but He was <i>called</i> Christ.<a name=150:3></a> The genealogy and the whole of the chapter are to establish incontestably the position thus taken up by those who called Him Christ.<a name=150:4></a> It was necessary that this should be established, not only as needed to meet current exigencies, but to prove the link with the outset of God's intervention sovereignly in Abraham.<a name=150:5></a> I think the brethren will see the bearing of this as we proceed, for the effort of the enemy is to discredit what God is supporting.<a name=150:6></a> External circumstances are so beclouding that the position occupied by those who seek to do the will of God is peculiarly exposed to attacks.<a name=150:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.E.<a name=150:8></a>S.<a name=150:9></a> Have we here the setting forth of what is available for maintaining what is of God at any moment?<a name=150:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=150:11></a> Yes, at any given time from the outset, and right through.<a name=150:12></a> That is, Matthew has no fear as to meeting the enemy; Luke, being the gospel of grace, has more consideration for opposers.<a name=150:13></a> Matthew has no compunction about speaking out and exposing that from which the saints had to separate in his day; but obviously it is important that the position taken in separating should be established as legal, or in other words, as accredited, as supported by Scripture; and not only that, but that there are evidences on the line of generation.<a name=150:14></a> So, as most of us know, certain of the kings which had sprung from Jezebel are omitted from the genealogy, this corresponding with the history of the assembly; reproach is attached to these spiritually, as we may say, and hence, Jezebel and all she stands for are in principle eliminated, as having no part in this evidence of the legality of the position, she has no voice in it.<a name=150:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=150:16></a> Do we get something similar to this in Nehemiah,

		where they had to establish purity in relation to the genealogy?<a name=151:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=151:2></a> That bears on the chapter, so that the position is not only scriptural, but the evidence of the line is present in its moral features, and hence much is made of Joseph.<a name=151:3></a> It is said he was "the husband of Mary", he is called a righteous man, and he is one amenable to divine direction, which is a very important character to bear in the presence of current attacks.<a name=151:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=151:5></a> Does he suggest a combination of firmness in regard of what is due to God's throne, and at the same time, of tenderness in regard to Mary, the one mentioned -- "unwilling to expose her publicly"?<a name=151:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=151:7></a> Yes.<a name=151:8></a> Matthew's account makes the birth of the Lord much more vulnerable to attack than Luke's, and Joseph's attitude is suggestive of what is needed.<a name=151:9></a> He was characteristically a righteous man, a tender, feeling man, a sacrificing man -- all necessary features, so that the position should be secured and the enemy have no advantage.<a name=151:10></a> Righteousness, therefore, and feeling are of great importance at the present time in view of the efforts to discredit what is well known to be supported of God.<a name=151:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=151:15></a> We shall see later in our inquiry the part revelation has in the present position when we come to chapter 16.<a name=151:16></a> It is not only that our position is to be legal, that is, as set out plainly in Scripture, but there are immediate communications from God.<a name=151:17></a> Such are given to those who are in the position of Joseph, those marked off as doing the will of God and following righteousness.<a name=151:18></a> The dreams here are of that character; God coming in to fortify us against giving way to darkness in our minds.<a name=151:19></a> We shall find the principle throughout Scripture, that God anticipates the danger that may arise in the conflict owing to ignorance, or

		darkness, or weakness, it may be.<a name=152:1></a> As in the case of Ananias in Damascus, the Lord anticipated that he could not meet the situation, and so He came to him and instructed him, so that he could meet the requirements of the moment.<a name=152:2></a> If we are righteous, the Lord will not leave us in the dark about anything.<a name=152:3></a> Joseph was a righteous man, that is the point, and he had no preconceived thoughts; he was amenable to divine adjustment.<a name=152:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.G.<a name=152:5></a>H.<a name=152:6></a> As a righteous man he was careful not to jeopardise the testimony in any way; he "pondered on these things".<a name=152:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=152:8></a> Quite so.<a name=152:9></a> He was a righteous man, and that is what is needed.<a name=152:10></a> Righteous men are ready for adjustment, they have no preconceived thoughts, so that Joseph here was amenable to adjustment.<a name=152:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=152:12></a> Is that why it emphasises the thought of righteousness as the first principle we have to follow in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>?<a name=152:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=152:14></a> Yes, righteousness is the first principle involved.<a name=152:15></a> This is a matter of the greatest practical importance today because of what has occurred in many parts among the brethren in the way of inability to meet obligations.<a name=152:16></a> Then there is righteousness in other ways as to whether we have wills, motives or fleshly aspirations in the things of God; these all interfere, so that Joseph is an excellent example for us to begin with -- a righteous man amenable to adjustment.<a name=152:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=152:21></a> I do not think the righteousness of Zacharias equals that of Joseph.<a name=152:22></a> Whilst Zacharias was a righteous man, he was not a believing man; he had prayed for things, but did not expect answers; and when the answers were proposed, he was unbelieving.<a name=152:23></a> There is nothing of that kind with Joseph.<a name=152:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=153:3></a> It is legal in that the Jewish law confirmed what Jesus was called.<a name=153:4></a> He was "called Christ"; He was the Anointed; so that the genealogy was according to the law governing these matters, in accrediting the thing to Him as the Christ.<a name=153:5></a> I do not use the word 'legal' in any common or religious sense, but rather as what is scripturally required.<a name=153:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=153:7></a>R.<a name=153:8></a> How does that bear on the thought of sonship in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1">Romans  1</a>?<a name=153:9></a> It says, "his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God .<a name=153:10></a>.<a name=153:11></a>.<a name=153:12></a> )".<a name=153:13></a> How do they link together?<a name=153:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=153:15></a> Well, sonship is a matter of power: "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead".<a name=153:16></a> We get it in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2">Matthew  2</a>, not as a matter of power, but as carrying forward the Old Testament thought: "Out of Egypt have I called my son".<a name=153:17></a> That is to say, Matthew builds us up in the truth of sonship, as I may say, <i>informally</i>, which is the most effective way; the thing is brought in as I am ready for it.<a name=153:18></a> So also as regards the deity of the Lord, which <i>His</i> sonship implies.<a name=153:19></a> You have it introduced here in an informal yet emphatic way: "<i>he</i> shall save his people from their sins".<a name=153:20></a> A spiritually exercised person will say the "he" and the "his" refer to Jehovah, to none other.<a name=153:21></a> Then again, "they shall call his name Emmanuel", and we have the interpretation, "God with us".<a name=153:22></a> All this becomes an element in the soul, according to Matthew's way of presenting the truth, and this will abide.<a name=153:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=153:24></a> Is this condition of righteousness with Joseph a moral necessity on our part as making us ready for this further light?<a name=153:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=153:26></a> That is what I thought.<a name=153:27></a> God did not take up merely any man; He took up a man who was betrothed to a woman, the man being righteous.<a name=153:28></a> That was not accidental; it was important in view of the legality of

		the position, that he was truly the son of David and bearing the character of David.<a name=154:1></a> So we have much more about Joseph here than elsewhere; he is called the "son of David".<a name=154:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D'A.<a name=154:3></a>C.<a name=154:4></a> It does not say that Emmanuel means 'God with him', but "God with us", which would surely involve that He is God.<a name=154:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=154:6></a> "God with us" is a great fundamental element in the soul, brought in informally, as one might say.<a name=154:7></a> As we read Matthew in a spiritual way we are prepared for all that may be said informally about the deity of Christ in such statements as this.<a name=154:8></a> God was truly with Him, as Peter says (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>), but His presence here is "God with us", and that runs right through the gospel: "behold, <i>I</i> am with you all the days, until the completion of the age".<a name=154:9></a> He is no less than God.<a name=154:10></a>

		S.J.<a name=154:11></a>B.<a name=154:12></a>C.<a name=154:13></a> Jesus is the Greek name for Joshua, which means Jehovah the Saviour; He is a divine Person.<a name=154:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=154:15></a> The original word Joshua is somewhat enlarged upon by Moses in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#13:16">Numbers  13:16</a>, to bring out this point.<a name=154:16></a> It is "Jehovah [is] Saviour": that could never be said of Joshua himself.<a name=154:17></a> So here, only God Himself could be in mind where the "he" and the "his" are brought in in this way.<a name=154:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=154:26></a> As has often been remarked.<a name=154:27></a> John gives us the history of His Person, not informally as in Matthew, but abstractly, in view, no doubt, of meeting later conditions.<a name=154:28></a> I apprehend Matthew wrote for earlier conditions, with a view to the extrication of the saints from judaism; but the Spirit of God in John had the early part of the second century more in mind, the early introduction of Greek and Jewish philosophy, and the introduction of false thoughts about Christ almost immediately after apostolic times.<a name=154:29></a> That was anticipated

		in John's gospel, and so, of course, it is the great foundation gospel as regards the Person of the Lord.<a name=155:1></a> Matthew builds up his gospel more from the Old Testament -- John does not do that -- so that the first formal reference to sonship in Matthew is from the Old Testament: "Out of Egypt have I called my son".<a name=155:2></a>

		H.M.<a name=155:3></a>S.<a name=155:4></a> Why is it that the divinely given title Emmanuel in this chapter is not again used in Scripture?<a name=155:5></a> We might have thought the very quotation from Isaiah would have greatly supported the truth of sonship.<a name=155:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=155:7></a> I suppose the Spirit of God considered that the quotation was so well known, and brought in here so definitely, that it would stand throughout.<a name=155:8></a> The title Emmanuel has a peculiar place in the minds of the saints, and its interpretation, "God with us", has a searching effect, too; Corinthians works out the thought that "God is indeed amongst you", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:25">1 Corinthians  14:25</a>.<a name=155:9></a> It is a question of whether God is indeed with us, and I believe Matthew has in mind to work out in our souls what that means.<a name=155:10></a> So the position is not only accredited by Scripture, but accredited, that is, proved to be legal by the presence of "God with us".<a name=155:11></a> What can overthrow that?<a name=155:12></a>

		Galilee and the disciples are viewed as the poor of Israel's flock.<a name=264:1></a> The Lord deliberately goes to Galilee, and it is a question whether it does not look on to a future day, the disbelieving nations -- not the persons of the nations, but the nations -- a very great undertaking.<a name=264:2></a> Of course, the persons must be involved, but the nations as such are in view.<a name=264:3></a> Matthew has in mind that the nations are to be brought into blessing; in chapter 25, indeed, he pictures the Lord when He comes sitting on His throne with the nations gathered before Him, and some go into everlasting punishment, and others into everlasting life; they are treated according to their treatment of His brethren, that is, the Jewish brethren.<a name=264:4></a> Now in these verses it looks at those brethren -- they are His disciples here, not called apostles -- as having power, not simply to enlighten the nations, but to <i>make</i> disciples of them -- a very great matter!<a name=264:5></a> Whilst there is no evidence that the commission here was ever carried out, it will yet be carried out, and it bears on the position of the assembly, in that the Lord expects power to be amongst His people to influence others, to make disciples (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:21">Acts  14:21</a>).<a name=264:6></a> Aside from the fact that they were a broken number, eleven not twelve, and that some of them doubted, it was an imperfect state in the disciples.<a name=264:7></a> But He does not stop to repair the position; the Lord simply goes on, and says, "All power has been given me".<a name=264:8></a> That never fails; it never can fail, and He proceeds to say, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=264:9></a> It contemplates, even in that broken state, that there is to be power to disciple people.<a name=264:10></a>

		Paul again, in writing to the Corinthians, brings forward this side that there are things which "eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him", and that they are "revealed to us by his Spirit", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a>, 10.<a name=288:2></a> The Holy Spirit has revealed them, who, as it is further said, searches "the depths of God".<a name=288:3></a> Thus, dear brethren, you can see how God comes down, as we believe, to our level, however low it may be, and graciously and tenderly furnishes us with every item -- every legitimate thing that may be useful in our deliverance and in our maintenance and preservation in running the race that is set before us.<a name=288:4></a> Later in the christian experience, <i>God</i> becomes entirely regarded as an inheritance; and, when I say 'later', I do not mean necessarily a great number of years, for in the progress of souls, some are much more rapid than others.<a name=288:5></a> Indeed, God looks for quick results; I do not think He has any pleasure in the slothfulness of some of us; not that He does not appreciate any little bit of movement in our souls, but He indicates that, if room is made for Him, He can bring about quick results in us.<a name=288:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, for instance, in the Thessalonians, remarkable results after a few weeks, and so in many other instances that one might furnish.<a name=288:7></a> God looks for quick results, and, where they are found, He does not fail to notice them and to approve and reward by a sense of His pleasure in those who are moving on rapidly, but steadily.<a name=288:8></a> When I say <i>rapidly</i>, beloved brethren, I would speak especially to the young; God looks for regular, steady proportionate movement, not only in intelligence but in affection and in the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<a name=288:9></a> He looks for perfection, which implies that all the senses spiritually are developed.<a name=288:10></a>

		of as to the slothfulness of the saints in coming to the great end that God has in mind, namely, that He is to be all in all, I would refer to Abraham, the great father of believers.<a name=289:1></a> As Jehovah said to him, "I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:1">Genesis  15:1</a>), immediately Abraham says, "Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me?<a name=289:2></a>" And God got down to his side at once.<a name=289:3></a> He will never fail to respond to any legitimate claim on our side, whatever it be, and we ought to take notice of this, especially young christians.<a name=289:4></a> Indeed, God would not shrink to take the ground of obligation towards us; He loves to be tested in that way, and, as I said, comes down to the lowest level of faith -- <i>not lower than that</i>.<a name=289:5></a> And so He takes Abraham out and asks him to look at the stars.<a name=289:6></a> I suppose no astronomer ever got such a view as Abraham did; God was beside him, not to occupy him with the great orbs and their distance from one another -- they are there just provisionally for us, and when the need is over they will be disposed of, and astronomy will cease to be of any use.<a name=289:7></a> But He says, "number the stars, if thou be able to number them".<a name=289:8></a> It is God graciously getting down alongside the man of faith, and He says virtually, 'If I am not enough for you, then I will give you something that you will value, some legitimate thing': and the legitimate thing was a great posterity, plenty of it.<a name=289:9></a> God never stints us in things that are legitimate, although guarding us from what might damage us; but He gave promise to Abraham of plenty of what he saw -- He said, "So shall thy seed be!<a name=289:10></a>"

		Having said all that so that you might see clearly what I have in mind, I come to the book of Joshua, which is the great inheritance book for faith; and I have in mind to show that the Levites are just <i>all</i> the saints, only viewed as refined; quality taking the place of quantity -- that is the idea.<a name=289:11></a> That is to say, Judah is Levi; Reuben is Levi -- and so all the tribes, as in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>; Benjamin, Joseph, Zebulun, Issachar,

	<div class="paragraph">
		To refer to the book of Joshua, I may say -- as no doubt many of you know -- that the inheritances given to the tribes, with the exception of Levi, are what I might call territorial.<a name=290:7></a> I use that word so as to help you to follow what I have in mind, and you will see, I think, before I have done, that the more you come to the knowledge of God the less territorial you are -- the less geographical you are.<a name=290:8></a> I find it extremely difficult to get rid of geography; in one sense, we should not; in another sense, we should.<a name=290:9></a> I have used the word 'territorial' -- the Spirit of God indicates it -- so that the brethren can follow intelligently.<a name=290:10></a> The territorial inheritance comes under three heads: first, what Moses gave -- which every true believer has -- to the two and a half tribes.<a name=290:11></a> This typically is what comes under the authority of Christ, it alludes to the kingdom, and involves His lordship.<a name=290:12></a>

		Well now, dear brethren, I want to just show briefly, from the four passages in Joshua, what attaches to the movements of the Levites, that is, ourselves, viewed as having the priesthood.<a name=294:12></a> The first shows that the inheritance is the priesthood, and the question arises, who will take it up?<a name=294:13></a> You will notice that Levi, in the book of Joshua, is almost synonymous with priesthood, indeed, the only service of the Levites, I might say, in the book of Joshua, is in connection with carrying the ark; and what a glorious position to be found in; carrying the ark in the presence of the power of evil closing in around us on every hand!<a name=294:14></a> In Joshua the ark is the power of God; what else will stand by us, beloved brethren?<a name=294:15></a> We read in chapter 8 that as they bore the ark, all Israel and their elders and their judges were on

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the priesthood is the first thing I had in mind as to inheritance.<a name=295:7></a> It is an inheritance for every brother and sister here and everywhere.<a name=295:8></a> Mark you, it is an <i>inheritance</i> -- it contemplates present and millennial conditions.<a name=295:9></a> Priesthood is a mediatorial thought; when there is no evil to contend with, no corruption, priesthood will be no longer in view; but for the moment it is an inheritance, and it is to be valued.<a name=295:10></a> The saints are viewed as having this great function as over against a territorial inheritance.<a name=295:11></a> Do we all take it up, beloved?<a name=295:12></a> God is urging it.<a name=295:13></a> He is urging that the service should continue whatever the external conditions, and it can only continue as Levi accepts his inheritance, that is, the priesthood: it belongs to every christian.<a name=295:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next I would mention are the sacrifices of Jehovah made by fire.<a name=295:15></a> We do not feed on priesthood, but we do feed on the sacrifices, and what a great thing it is, dear brethren, to feed on the food that God feeds on -- that is the idea -- and we thus become accustomed to God, and thus our constitutions are built up after God, and we find ourselves at home with Him, and strong in His inheritance; for we are living on the sacrifices of God made by fire, that is, the sacrifices ascending to God in all the savour of Christ.<a name=295:16></a> It is the side of the inheritance that furnishes food.<a name=295:17></a> If we are to function as priests, we must partake of priestly food, and priestly food is that on which, speaking reverently, the blessed God feeds.<a name=295:18></a> It is a question of Christ, of the

		Finally, in the end of the thirteenth chapter, we have the statement that the Lord God of Israel is the inheritance of Levi.<a name=296:2></a> Now that is the great end, dear brethren, that I have in mind.<a name=296:3></a> In addition to this, in the next chapter, He gave them cities, it says, to dwell in.<a name=296:4></a> Whilst we have no territorial inheritance, there are dwelling-places: some of us can happily speak of these dwelling-places; they are for the moment provisional, but they are very happy dwelling-places; as we move about, beloved brethren, we find cities to dwell in.<a name=296:5></a> The more we apprehend our heavenly calling, the more will our houses be, as it were, dwelling-places for the levites, and the more will the local companies, our gatherings, be happy spiritual dwelling-places for the saints -- cities to dwell in, provisional indeed, but heaven brought down; the levites represent what is heavenly.<a name=296:6></a> They had cities to dwell in, cities suitable to God.<a name=296:7></a> The cattle were outside, as it reads, "suburbs for their cattle and for their substance".<a name=296:8></a> The two and a half tribes on the other side of the Jordan thought more of their cattle than themselves; not so the levites of God, their cattle have no part here.<a name=296:9></a> God provides for the cattle and the substance: the dwelling-places of the levites, the cities, are spiritual realms, places where heaven is brought down; so that as there, we become accustomed, dear brethren, to heaven, and when we get there we are not away from home.<a name=296:10></a> One longs for the experience of the place designed in eternal counsels, where one shall be quite at home, no stranger; and I believe all this is brought about as we understand that the "cities to dwell in" are just provisional, but no less in principle than what we are coming into, for the blessed Spirit of God here is the earnest of all that is above -- our inheritance.<a name=296:11></a> Then what is above?<a name=296:12></a> Let us learn to dismiss material thoughts and to be spiritual.<a name=296:13></a> The thought of heaven requires the greatest attention by

		In the thirty-third verse of <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#13">Joshua  13</a>it says, "Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance".<a name=297:3></a> Have we come to that, dear brethren, in the assembly?<a name=297:4></a> When the tabernacle was set up, and anointed, the glory filled it and the cloud covered it.<a name=297:5></a> What was that glory?<a name=297:6></a> Who could define it?<a name=297:7></a> No one, it is beyond us.<a name=297:8></a> It is God saying to us, I want all this place for Myself.<a name=297:9></a> Not that He shuts the saints out -- it is that God may be all and in all.<a name=297:10></a> There is nothing to intrude, and God would say, I want the whole sphere, and He fills it; the glory filled the tabernacle, and the temple too; for as the temple was finished the ark was brought in, and the priests sounded with the trumpets to make one sound, and the glory filled the temple, and the priests could not enter.<a name=297:11></a> You say, Why could not the priests enter?<a name=297:12></a> It is just this, dear brethren, as I understand it, that the official side is unnecessary where God fills all.<a name=297:13></a> If God fills us completely there is nothing official needed; God is all and He fills all -- that is the great thought.<a name=297:14></a> So that it says, "that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:19">Ephesians  3:19</a>.<a name=297:15></a> Marvellous thought!<a name=297:16></a> There is no need for authority to be brought forward there (not that it is not there), and there is no need for the official priesthood.<a name=297:17></a> God is there; He is there as the supreme object of the heart and mind, and He fills all -- God is all: as it says, "that God may be all in all".<a name=297:18></a>

		In reading these scriptures, dear brethren, I have in mind to speak about <i>power</i>, but in thinking of 'power' we have to be discerning so as not to mistake the power of Satan for the power of God.<a name=298:1></a> The antichrist coming in presently -- the way being prepared for him now -- will be marked by power, but the power that is from beneath; nevertheless, such power as shall deceive men, except the elect of God.<a name=298:2></a> All shall be deceived, for he comes "with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:9">2 Thessalonians  2:9</a>, 10).<a name=298:3></a> These lying wonders are apparent at the present time in a limited way, so that the world is becoming accustomed to them and admires them.<a name=298:4></a> Hence in undertaking to speak on this subject of power, it is perhaps excusable if I warn the brethren, so that we may be able to distinguish between the power of God which works in us, and the power of Satan which works in the world.<a name=298:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We learn in 1 Corinthians that the christian assembly was invaded, even in those early days, by the power of the devil, so that the apostle had to give instruction to the saints as to how that power was to be discerned, and how the power of God was to be discerned.<a name=298:6></a> He says, "no one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus; and no one can say.<a name=298:7></a> Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:3">1 Corinthians  12:3</a>.<a name=298:8></a> We do well to become accustomed to the Spirit in this respect, so that, in addressing the Lord, we do so feelingly and with affection.<a name=298:9></a> The Spirit will never fail us as we are thus governed in speaking to the Lord, and in speaking to Him He ever comes in to lend power to our use of those adorable words, "Lord Jesus"!<a name=298:10></a>

		So God says, Now I am testing this matter out.<a name=307:4></a> But in doing this how considerate He is of His servant!<a name=307:5></a> He said, Gather seventy men known to you to the door of the tabernacle and "I will come down and talk with <i>thee</i> there".<a name=307:6></a> That is, God will always make the most of His servant.<a name=307:7></a> He may have to humiliate him or rebuke him, but He will duly respect him.<a name=307:8></a> He will be the last to say an unkind word as to a servant; He will be the first to defend the servant.<a name=307:9></a> The knowledge of this saves us from looking elsewhere and encourages us to leave ourselves entirely in His hands.<a name=307:10></a> So He says, "I will .<a name=307:11></a>.<a name=307:12></a>.<a name=307:13></a> talk with thee there".<a name=307:14></a> He does not say He would speak to him and the seventy, although they are to be the joint sharers of the power; He says, I will speak to you.<a name=307:15></a> That is like God and very beautiful.<a name=307:16></a> But while He honours His servant, He would show that He has furnished him liberally for the service; that His measurements were exact; they must be exact.<a name=307:17></a> The physical universe is a testimony to the exactness of God's measurements -- and so, too, the tabernacle.<a name=307:18></a> So, in meting out to Moses what he needed for his service, God measured with the utmost accuracy, and, we may be sure, gave him more than was necessary; it was, indeed, the Holy Spirit as the passage shows.<a name=307:19></a> As to ourselves the power that works in us is the same power that wrought in Christ when God raised Him from the dead.<a name=307:20></a> So, the power is taken from Moses and put on the seventy elders.<a name=307:21></a> We cannot assume that these seventy men were equal to Moses; they were not, but the power given them was taken from him.<a name=307:22></a> It is as if God were to say; Moses, you have misjudged Me, I am not bringing in one atom of power more than I gave to you at the beginning.<a name=307:23></a> So it is, beloved, we must not misjudge God, He has furnished us with all

	<div class="paragraph">
		These chapters speak of revival, and that is why I have read from them, having in mind to show that, in revivals according to God, persons and things are in their places.<a name=428:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of revival in itself arouses interest, and opens up a wide field of inquiry, and as one inquires one notices that the need of revival is always current in the history of God's people.<a name=428:2></a> Even though there be a revival in a general way, the need of it in detail is always current, and is now.<a name=428:3></a> Although we have part in a general way in a great revival which has lasted a century (the most important perhaps in the history of the assembly) and which will, I believe, last until the end, it is a question of sustenance, and for this, <i>individual</i> revivals are constantly needed.<a name=428:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To illustrate, you find in a man like Timothy -- a devoted servant of Christ -- that he needed to have revival.<a name=428:5></a> He had to <i>rekindle</i> the gift that was in him; it had become dormant, and that is a word for all such as have served well, and yet not to the full measure.<a name=428:6></a> God looks for results and values them, however few, but He looks for <i>full</i> measure.<a name=428:7></a> In Timothy there was need for revival in regard of his gift.<a name=428:8></a> It had burned but now it had become dormant and needed to be rekindled.<a name=428:9></a> Also a spiritual assembly like the Philippians -- an assembly that is almost without peer for devotedness (according to the record) -- needed revival at a given time in regard of the great servant through whom the light had come to it.<a name=428:10></a> He says, "ye have <i>revived</i> your thinking of me", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:10">Philippians  4:10</a>.<a name=428:11></a> It had lagged.<a name=428:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in a man like Jacob, a spiritual man, who had weathered storms, and stood well at the time of the great exercise at the supposed death of Joseph; and what followed in the dreaded loss of Simeon and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=429>[Page 429]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Benjamin.<a name=429:1></a> His spirit evidently had drooped, however.<a name=429:2></a> An old brother is capable, indeed most liable to this; old age coming on with its discomforts tends to droopiness, and hence the need of revival.<a name=429:3></a> So that in Jacob we have an instance of one who was capable of revival.<a name=429:4></a> "And the spirit of Jacob .<a name=429:5></a>.<a name=429:6></a>.<a name=429:7></a> <i>revived</i>", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#45:27">Genesis  45:27</a>.<a name=429:8></a> It had not been what it used to be, but now it comes back and in power.<a name=429:9></a> His spirit revived as he saw the waggons, witnesses of Joseph being alive.<a name=429:10></a> So that, dear brethren, you see how the need of revival is constant with old and young, and I believe it is as this is recognised and felt, that there will be the sustenance of the <i>great</i> revival, the general revival.<a name=429:11></a> We do not want <i>it</i> to droop.<a name=429:12></a> I believe God has allowed many sorrows during the past hundred years to this very end, that the revival should be sustained.<a name=429:13></a> And it is obligatory upon us to maintain it, especially young ones coming on.<a name=429:14></a> The heavy burden, but the great honour, will soon be upon them to sustain the rich heritage that has come down in the way of revival, so that it should not taper out and be lost as the revival in Israel through Josiah was, after his death.<a name=429:15></a> It is to be continued, and to this end each one is to see to it that he is not losing in his soul.<a name=429:16></a> One has to look back from time to time on one's spiritual history, right back to the very beginning of it, and see whether there has been any retrogression -- any loss sustained that has not been repaired.<a name=429:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in this case we find that the revival began with the young.<a name=429:18></a> Josiah is a young person; he is on the throne at eight years of age -- an elevation which would tend to harm a boy apart from the preserving hand of God.<a name=429:19></a> A like case is Joash.<a name=429:20></a> He came into power at seven years of age, but he needed careful watching, which he had under God, and was preserved during the days of Jehoiada.<a name=429:21></a> God provides persons who care for us; they watch for our souls, and it is well for young people to recognise them.<a name=429:22></a> It is altogether out of the question to think that God would have lambs without shepherds,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		so that we may be sure, as young, that there are those that are watching for our souls.<a name=430:1></a> So under Jehoiada's influence all went well for Joash, but he failed when Jehoiada's influence was removed.<a name=430:2></a> We do well, dear young people, to find our feet and learn to accept responsibility when we have such an advantage.<a name=430:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Josiah did not have that advantage as far as the record shows.<a name=430:4></a> He was eight years of age when he came to the throne, and he went on for eight years with little or nothing eventful.<a name=430:5></a> Nothing against him, thank God!<a name=430:6></a> Then he began to seek after the Lord.<a name=430:7></a> Then, at the age of twenty, after he had reigned twelve years, he thinks of purification -- of putting things right in his circumstances as the king of Judah; he purged Judah and Jerusalem, extending even to the territory of the ten tribes.<a name=430:8></a> At the age of twenty-six be began to think of cleansing the house of Jehovah and repairing it -- a most interesting phase in a young man at the age of twenty-six!<a name=430:9></a> How many there may be here who are about that age!<a name=430:10></a> It is well for you to take account of it and see what place the house of God has in your mind and calculations.<a name=430:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this exercise he comes into a great discovery.<a name=430:12></a> That is, as we progress in the things of God, we are constantly recompensed, constantly enriched.<a name=430:13></a> So the high priest finds the book of the law.<a name=430:14></a> Had it been found earlier in Josiah's history it might not have received the same attention.<a name=430:15></a> He was not equal earlier to accord to it the attention that he was equal to at the age of twenty-six.<a name=430:16></a> The book was read to him and he rent his clothes.<a name=430:17></a> An important matter, and very necessary at such a juncture, that one rends one's clothes.<a name=430:18></a> There must be a cause for it in my circumstances.<a name=430:19></a> Things are not right.<a name=430:20></a> Things had gone well indeed, but the law was the assertion of the rights of love.<a name=430:21></a> God waits His opportunities for that -- to assert the rights of His love.<a name=430:22></a> But what could be more desirable, dear brethren, than that God should make known to us that He has rights

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		over us, and that these are not arbitrary, but the rights of love -- rights that will do the very best for us?<a name=431:1></a> And Josiah felt that things were not yet right -- after such a history of faithfulness.<a name=431:2></a> He rent his clothes.<a name=431:3></a> Rending one's clothes implies that one's circumstances are not right.<a name=431:4></a> Is it not wise to look around and see whether my circumstances comport with increased light?<a name=431:5></a> If God has caused the light to shine more clearly, and it has caused me to see things that I had not seen before in my circumstances, it is well then to change them.<a name=431:6></a> That is, in principle, what the king did.<a name=431:7></a> He got light, he would have a full understanding of this book.<a name=431:8></a> "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:7">2 Timothy  2:7</a>.<a name=431:9></a> These meetings are not merely for the few days we have spent together, but they are opportunities for the Lord to speak to us.<a name=431:10></a> What is said is to be considered, and the Lord gives understanding.<a name=431:11></a>

		Now I want to go to the Old Testament, as one always feels encouraged, in serving the saints, to turn to the Old Testament for detail and expansion.<a name=442:5></a> There is a certain exhilaration of spirit as one contemplates that what we are speaking about from the New Testament was thought of long before, and a certain setting was laid down in view of these things being brought in by the Spirit of God sent down from heaven.<a name=442:6></a> The Lord Jesus came down from heaven of His <i>own</i> volition; the Holy Spirit is said to have been "sent" down from heaven.<a name=442:7></a> He is here therefore -- wonderful fact!<a name=442:8></a> -- in entire subjection to the divine will, and provides us with the means of understanding, and gives us these terms that belong to the New Testament; but He also reminds us that He had been speaking about them long before.<a name=442:9></a>

		The uprising that I allude to is really the great hierarchical uprising of christendom, dating back, I might say, to the second century.<a name=442:10></a> One of the most solemn things in Scripture is this great uprising of man in a methodical, systematic rebellion against the authority of the Lord Jesus and against His priesthood, by the assumption that, because men are nominal levites, or servants, because they have gift and because they teach or preach, they must be priests.<a name=442:11></a> It is a fallacy; and intended to deny the holy priesthood God has ordained, and which applies to every believer who has the Spirit of God.<a name=442:12></a> You can see how far-reaching it is, and how God would bring us back to this exclusive

		I want to show you how this altar, representing the worship of God, began, for initial ideas always give the key to the fulness of the thought.<a name=443:3></a> Noah was the first to build an altar; and I may say the altars of Genesis were not formally required of, nor were they specified for, by God.<a name=443:4></a> God is honouring His own work in the souls of men and women, in those early days; He honours the movements of their hearts towards Him.<a name=443:5></a> From the incoming of sin, God began the testimony; and immediately men began to respond towards God: a very beautiful thought appearing from the beginning of Genesis.<a name=443:6></a> This response began to increase, but in Noah there is a sort of ending to one course of exercise, and this is seen in the verses I have read.<a name=443:7></a> The history of Noah is one of the most interesting from this point of view, because it is a question of manhood, of maturity; the worship of God is connected with maturity, not with an infantile condition.<a name=443:8></a> And so what you find in Noah is a man that was perfect in his generations; not only perfect in a potential way in the mind of God, but <i>in his generations</i>.<a name=443:9></a> A man who had a family, a man who could do things and could face great matters.<a name=443:10></a> Think of the greatness of one man who could face on God's behalf the state of wickedness in a world which God was about to overwhelm in the deluge.<a name=443:11></a> He is called upon to do something that would bring down the ridicule of his fellow men, and he faces that; the building of the ark was a continuous matter for many years, but he undertook it.<a name=443:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was no small matter, the ark was a great vessel, concerning which God had spoken to him, and of which He had given him the specifications, and so forth, and Noah unhesitatingly undertook the work.<a name=443:13></a> What God is looking for is men and women who face matters.<a name=443:14></a> Christianity was never intended to be an armchair order of things, it is marked by energy, it is

		a question of energy and purpose, of facing and overcoming difficulties -- and that is seen in Noah.<a name=444:1></a> There he was, day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, year in and year out, for many years, working away at something that must have brought down on him the ridicule of the men of his time during the building of the ark.<a name=444:2></a> But he completed it, and went into it.<a name=444:3></a> What you find is that all the circumstances connected with the ark suggest maturity, there are no young children or young creatures of any kind, said to be in the ark; the idea is of completeness; things were carried over in maturity, and that is set forth in Noah.<a name=444:4></a> He was a long time in the ark, and as he comes out of it he is thinking of God.<a name=444:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are remarks that have a great deal to do with our worship; they are initial thoughts in regard to worship, that is, in regard to the altar.<a name=444:6></a> One of the most important things to notice about Noah is that he had discernment, he could tell between a clean and an unclean animal.<a name=444:7></a> There is nothing said about clean or unclean animals at the creation, nor is there any hint that God told him what was clean and what was unclean; the point is, he knew.<a name=444:8></a> And apart from this ability to discern between what is clean and what is unclean, there is no possibility of the worship of God.<a name=444:9></a> This was the condition into which the Hebrew christians had lapsed, in that they were unable to use their senses for the discerning between good and evil (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:12">Hebrews  5:12</a> - 14).<a name=444:10></a>

		In coming out of the ark.<a name=444:11></a> Noah took of every <i>clean</i> animal -- of every one of them.<a name=444:12></a> He had discernment; and then he is whole-hearted in his sacrifices, there was nothing selfish about him; selfishness retards and interferes generally with the worship of God amongst His people; liberal consideration of what is due to God, whatever it may cost us, will always be honoured of Him.<a name=444:13></a> We can well understand, as Noah looked out from Ararat -- what a vista he had!<a name=444:14></a> Naturally, he would say, What a number of cattle are needed, what

		Now, I want to refer to Exodus for a further feature of this subject, that is, in chapter 20.<a name=445:11></a> The altars of Genesis, as I said, were voluntary; but in taking His people out of the world, that is, God disposing of us as taking us on to be His people.<a name=445:12></a> He would give us to understand that He loves us.<a name=445:13></a> He says, "I have borne you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself".<a name=445:14></a> He would impress upon us what He thinks of us; but then He would suggest to us, It is time for you to begin to think of Me; not only that I should be worshipped, but that I should be worshipped according to <i>My mind</i>.<a name=445:15></a> That is an immense thought for our days, that God has His own thoughts, and if He is to be worshipped, the worship must be according to these thoughts.<a name=445:16></a> Now that is Exodus: so that the first suggestion in these verses is the altar of earth.<a name=445:17></a> We do not get God's terms in Genesis, we get them in Exodus: and when we come to His requirements, the first thing is an altar of earth.<a name=445:18></a>

		Moses had built an altar before, according to this book, which meant that the Lord was His banner, that he was to carry on warfare with Jehovah as his banner.<a name=446:1></a> But now Jehovah says, "An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me", He gives no dimensions, only just the material, as if He is calling attention generally to the kind of humanity that must underlie the worship of God.<a name=446:2></a> He says, "Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar"; this going up by steps is a very subtle thought; it gives you more prominence, you can call attention to the fact that you are worshipping.<a name=446:3></a> Every church steeple, every cathedral, every prominent system in christendom illustrates this; men distinguishing themselves humanly in the worship of God.<a name=446:4></a> But God has no pleasure in that; men's nakedness is exposed in it.<a name=446:5></a> "An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me .<a name=446:6></a>.<a name=446:7></a>.<a name=446:8></a> in all places where I shall make my name to be remembered".<a name=446:9></a> Wherever there is that humble acceptance of what God requires, which is only seen perfectly in Christ as Man, God comes there.<a name=446:10></a> How blessed that is!<a name=446:11></a> 'Where I record My name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee'.<a name=446:12></a> God thinks nothing of imposing buildings; He thinks of what came out in Jesus, the humanity of Jesus presented in this way, and He records His name in that connection.<a name=446:13></a> That is where God's name is honoured: He says, I will come there, and I will bless you <i>there</i>.<a name=446:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He says further, "if thou make me an altar of stone".<a name=446:15></a> The "if" makes a difference there, meaning that christians may go forward in their worship; that it is not only a question of the humanity of Christ, what He was here on earth, for it is said He was "in the form of God", and "thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:6">Philippians  2:6</a>, 7.<a name=446:16></a> That is, He was an ordinary man outwardly, making no claim to distinction; "taking his place in the likeness", not of <i>man</i>, but "of

		Well now, you see how all these things enter into the altar which we have.<a name=447:13></a> It is not an altar by itself, it is an altar that carries with it all the divine thoughts entering into the divine worship; we must not leave one out.<a name=447:14></a> And I would urge this in the worship, the thought of <i>if</i> you make an altar of stone; <i>if</i> you do it, do not add anything to it, do not use a sharp tool upon it.<a name=447:15></a> It alludes to the soul being brought into the apprehension of Christ as <i>He is</i>, man could never make Him anything.<a name=447:16></a> It is Christ as He is.<a name=447:17></a> We do not want Him otherwise.<a name=447:18></a> We are told in the gospels they took Jesus "as He was" in the ship; you do not want to add to Him,

		It is a very wide and great subject, but I am confining myself to certain initial features, that must of necessity enter into the exclusive altar we have.<a name=448:11></a> God has recovered everything for Himself in principle; and Moses and Aaron going into the tabernacle, the service is to be continuous.<a name=448:12></a> Before passing on to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16">Numbers  16</a>, I would remark on the further specifications as to the altar in Exodus.<a name=448:13></a> For, as we come to chapter 24, we have an opening up of the covenant; I mean we have it opened up in volume -- the volume of God's love is presented to us in the blood in the basins.<a name=448:14></a> It is on the ground of that we have the remaining part of the book.<a name=448:15></a> The book of Exodus, after chapter 24, is practically occupied with the tabernacle; except the chapters which relate to the golden calf, the whole book is a question of God speaking to the people of their giving, and how He would have them build a house for Him, and how He would like to dwell with them.<a name=448:16></a> In the specifications that He gives, He tells them He wants an altar, and

		<a name=449>[Page 449]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that this altar is to be made, of acacia-wood.<a name=449:1></a> This is a greater thought -- if I may make a comparison -- than the altar of earth.<a name=449:2></a> The altar of earth is humility, lowliness; but the altar of acacia, or shittim wood, suggests strength or bearing power.<a name=449:3></a> And it is a humanity of its own kind, there is no other like it.<a name=449:4></a> Then the altar is to be five cubits square -- a large thought -- and three cubits high, and it is to be overlaid with brass.<a name=449:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can see, in the measure in which you apprehend these symbols, how it points to Jesus, not merely now in His lowly humanity, but in the strength of it.<a name=449:6></a> The acacia is a very strong kind of wood.<a name=449:7></a> So the mind is led on to Jesus in His power of endurance, and oh, how Gethsemane and the cross present that!<a name=449:8></a> How it draws out our hearts to Him, as we think of Him facing alone all that was involved, without any comforters -- forsaken of God -- what moral power was there!<a name=449:9></a> Then it was three cubits high, denoting death and resurrection; the power of resurrection was in it.<a name=449:10></a> Then, another thing we should bear in mind in our worship is, that the brazen altar was anointed with the other utensils of the tabernacle; but in addition to that, it is said that it was sprinkled with the anointing oil seven times.<a name=449:11></a> Now, if we follow these thoughts, and hold them in our souls by the Spirit as we sit down in the presence of God, we shall profit by them, and we shall be more powerful in our worship, more reverential and more holy.<a name=449:12></a>

		Then finally, this uprising of Korah introduced the wrong thought, typically, that the priesthood of God should be in the hands of certain men; there was Korah and his band, the word "band" is used, having its own significance.<a name=449:13></a> There were two hundred and fifty men "of the children of Israel, princes of the assembly", "men of renown": typically men who in the later history of the assembly acquired great reputation in its councils, men noted in church history.<a name=449:14></a> Now these men arrogated to themselves the priesthood, they

		In answer to all this "the glory of Jehovah appeared" -- there was nothing else for it.<a name=450:4></a> Moses could not cope with it -- the <i>glory</i> met this wicked uprising.<a name=450:5></a> Terrible judgment was meted out on these men, and then it says, as I have already remarked, "Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting", the way is opened for the resumption of the worship of God.<a name=450:6></a> And moreover it says, "the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared" -- as if God were to say, in the presence of all this, I have Myself taken charge of the testimony today; I have taken charge of the <i>whole</i> of it.<a name=450:7></a> It is not a partisan matter, it is a question of the tabernacle of testimony.<a name=450:8></a> Then Moses and Aaron came before the tent of meeting, so that the service goes on.<a name=450:9></a> And these sinners who forfeited their lives are for ever after to be a testimony to the sin of man in the flesh in assuming the priesthood; and so these broad plates are to cover the altar.<a name=450:10></a> I mention them because they are worthy of careful attention in our meetings, for this uprising of Korah finds an answer in every one of our hearts; it is not in these men only, it is in the natural, religious heart: if I allow my natural proclivities, if I allow myself to aspire to a position amongst the brethren, this is what in principle ensues: I want to take priestly things over because I have gift, because I have ability, and these broad plates are to testify against that.<a name=450:11></a> They

		Now I want for a moment to bring all that forward into the passage in the New Testament in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13">Hebrews  13</a>-- "We have an altar"; among many things we are said to have in Hebrews is the altar.<a name=451:2></a> It may be there are some here who have never taken up their privilege at the altar, it may be there are some here who have to do with the tabernacle, that is, with the current system of worship I have spoken of; but, if you are a christian, it belongs to you, the "we" in Hebrews is the "we" of <i>real</i> christians: "We have an altar of which they have no right to eat .<a name=451:3></a>.<a name=451:4></a>.<a name=451:5></a>" -- it is an exclusive one.<a name=451:6></a> And then we have, as I was remarking, the solemn allusion to the day of atonement particularly, when our Lord Jesus was seen typically as made sin for us.<a name=451:7></a> The sin-offering offered, the blood was taken into the holiest and put upon the mercy-seat, the carcase was burnt "outside the camp".<a name=451:8></a> What a solemn, touching allusion, dear brethren, to the atoning sufferings of Christ!<a name=451:9></a> God would remind us that there can be no toleration of sin, no quarter for it, in the assembly; that it must not be permitted in relation to His service.<a name=451:10></a> And so a new thing comes in -- "let us go forth to him without the camp" -- He "suffered without the gate".<a name=451:11></a> One would follow Him as He wended His way with His cross through those streets of Jerusalem.<a name=451:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=453:1></a> The subject of the household of God may, under the Lord, be of help to us.<a name=453:2></a> We have the truth in this respect presented as the believer's household, and the household of faith, and the household of God; the first two merging in the household of God.<a name=453:3></a> The first, the household of the believer, may be connected with Noah; the second may be connected with Abraham, who indeed is said to be the father of all believers; and the third is, as we see in these chapters, connected with Jacob: and the Lord may help us to arrive at an understanding of the passage in Ephesians by our consideration of the subject.<a name=453:4></a> It is written in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:18">Ephesians  2:18</a> that through Christ, "we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" and that "ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God".<a name=453:5></a> This being the case, it is obvious that each of us should inquire as to whether he has practical part in the household of God, for that is where our blessings are in this provisional time; it is where the music and the dancing are, where the brethren are apprehended in their heavenly relations although upon earth, and where the Spirit is thus free to bring in the joys of heaven.<a name=453:6></a> And I thought that the section in Genesis, well known to most of us, beginning with chapter 32, would help us to see how conditions that hinder our entrance into house-conditions and house-enjoyment are overcome, for chapter 35 is intended to show that the believer finally reaches the house, and reaches it as pleasing to Him whose it is -- pleasing to God; the drink-offering denoting the divine pleasure in the believer.<a name=453:7></a>

		Now Saul in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>is a young convert, and the Lord is giving him every possible advantage that there is among the brethren.<a name=519:5></a> If there is any young person wishing to place himself among the brethren, the Lord is waiting to give you every possible advantage.<a name=519:6></a> If you were to go up to heaven with Him today, He would make the most of you, but it may be the brethren <i>here</i> are not ready to make the most of you, perhaps they are making the least of you.<a name=519:7></a> Brethren are apt to think more of the debits than of the credits in a young believer; but there must be a balance.<a name=519:8></a> God is infinitely fair in taking account of His children, and He would give us all due credit.<a name=519:9></a> If anyone think little of himself, it is wholesome, but on the other hand some of us are hindered by thinking too little of ourselves.<a name=519:10></a> If you are a converted person, a believer in Jesus, you are a great personage, not as in the flesh surely, but according to divine reckoning -- you have already made an impression in heaven!<a name=519:11></a> Your first movement towards Christ in repentance was the cause of joy in heaven, and has given you a status in heaven, and all that has followed in the way of faith has increased that impression in heaven.<a name=519:12></a> You began by causing joy in the presence of the angels of God, and every movement since in faith has increased that impression.<a name=519:13></a> So it is well to be balanced, and to understand that the work of God makes you something which is pleasing to God, and which is going to abide for ever.<a name=519:14></a> You say with the apostle Paul, you do not over-estimate or under-estimate, for

		Ananias was a brother, it would appear, not specially distinguished, but as we say a leading brother, in Damascus, and it would appear that the Lord regarded him in that way, and was determined that Ananias should not belie the confidence He was about to place in him.<a name=520:4></a> In local companies of brethren there is the idea of representation of Christ: we are of no moral value otherwise.<a name=520:5></a> We must be representative of Christ when called upon to act for Him, especially in regard of the "little ones", because the brother who helps you -- through whom light comes to you -- will probably be the ideal of your mind at the outset, and hence the importance for the brother who seeks to help another to be truly in the spirit of Christ, and devoid of mere officialism.<a name=520:6></a> As representative of Christ, he must have "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ".<a name=520:7></a> The Lord has all this in mind here, for this convert is to be properly cared for.<a name=520:8></a> If Saul had been taken up to heaven at that moment, how wonderfully he would have been treated!<a name=520:9></a> The Lord says "It is hard for thee" -- He had sympathy with him.<a name=520:10></a> Angels would attend on him up there -- he would get a wonderful reception -- and that should be reflected here.<a name=520:11></a> It makes the position of service to those who are coming in amongst us a very solemn matter as to how we act towards them, how they are treated, because their first impression will be derived from the persons who are serving them.<a name=520:12></a>

		Ananias is put right and the Lord commends the convert, and says to Ananias, "Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus, for, behold, he prayeth", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:11">Acts  9:11</a>.<a name=521:19></a> No doubt, if Ananias as he met Saul were to ask him whether he prayed.<a name=521:20></a> Saul would say he did; and this is a good question to ask young people.<a name=521:21></a> I was having to do with a soul a short time ago who got light from the Lord after the preaching, and I asked her, "Do you pray?<a name=521:22></a>" "Yes", she said, "I do", and yet she was dark in her soul at the time and did not know her sins forgiven.<a name=521:23></a> "What do you say?<a name=521:24></a>" "Our Father which art in heaven", etc.<a name=521:25></a> "Your Father?<a name=521:26></a> Where did you get the thought of God being your Father?<a name=521:27></a>" I inquired.<a name=521:28></a> She had just borrowed it from religious custom; and that is how matters stand with thousands of souls.<a name=521:29></a> She had no idea of the Father in

		It is very encouraging for young people when the Lord commends them; and He has His own way of telling the brethren that you enter into your closet and speak to Him.<a name=522:6></a> Every word that goes out from your heart is presented to God by Him.<a name=522:7></a> He is our Great Priest at the golden altar, every true prayer is made efficacious by Him there.<a name=522:8></a> Thus the Lord takes the matter in hand, and the Holy Spirit too, indeed it is <i>through</i> the Holy Spirit, of whom the Lord says He is another Comforter -- meaning One that is by your side, who takes charge of every item of your case, whether in regard to the brethren or in regard of God, and sees to it that the brethren know about you -- because it has to do with them, too.<a name=522:9></a>
