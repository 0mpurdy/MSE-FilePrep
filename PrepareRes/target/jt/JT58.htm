		I rose to speak of experience.<a name=1:1></a> Our brother who has just prayed said to the Lord that He was always ready to be with us -- and He is.<a name=1:2></a> We can speak experimentally of this.<a name=1:3></a> One can say truthfully that he hardly recalls the time in which he has been with the brethren, as we are now, when he has not proved the Lord with us.<a name=1:4></a> This is a matter of experience, and experience is one of the elements of guidance.<a name=1:5></a> Only this very day, speaking with brethren at the house of our brother near by here, certain questions arose as to procedure in assembly service, and it occurred to me that experience helps us in regard to assembly service.<a name=1:6></a> There are certain methods and forms that are prescribed, others are left, but, according to the principles of Matthew, the Lord saying, "Behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:20">Matthew  28:20</a>) is honouring the assembly, as if He had confidence in her and assures her that He is with her.<a name=1:7></a> He is with us, even saying "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them"; (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>) then again, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them …" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>).<a name=1:8></a> And so, much is left to us, within certain latitudes or limits, for the Lord loves to think of us and to look on us as moving according to what He has made us, according to the instincts He has given us, and, of course, according to His teaching and the examples He has set.<a name=1:9></a> And all this involves experience, which affords guidance to a point as to methods amongst us, experience enabling us to prove what may be the best; and I have selected this chapter in Ezekiel, well known to us, but read now in view of what has been remarked.<a name=1:10></a> Ezekiel treats,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		among other things, of life and he affords us an example of an experience of life.<a name=2:1></a> The thought of life is full in Ezekiel, which could be shown from the pages of the prophet, and it reminds is of what the Lord said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it abundantly", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:10">John  10:10</a>).<a name=2:2></a> Hence the great advantage of experiencing life and proving how abundantly it is.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I have read this chapter because it affords an experience of life, what is said of the river indicates that wherever it moves it brings life, and another thing about it is that, as the prophet has experience in the river, indicating whence it comes and the way by which it flows and the point to which it flows, he shows that it affords life, and instead of one river it becomes a double one, as verse 9 tells us, showing that, as we move on in experience in what is afforded to us through the death and resurrection and ascension of Christ -- that is to say, what is in Christianity, we prove that, as the Lord says, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it abundantly" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:10">John  10:10</a>).<a name=2:4></a> So that we need not fear, dear brethren.<a name=2:5></a> Much has happened that might cause us to fear, but from the positive side there I nothing to fear.<a name=2:6></a> We shall always come out victorious, but increasingly so.<a name=2:7></a> Hence in these verses the prophet, as most of us here know, had experience first of the river covering his ankles.<a name=2:8></a> It is a question of experience, and experience implying certain parts of the body which are intended to be active, to afford activity, as in the book of Acts the man at the gate of the temple his has ankle bones affected, so that he walked and he leaped and he praised God.<a name=2:9></a> That involved, not only his ankles, but his knees -- indeed his whole body.<a name=2:10></a> The human body is made in that sense to be used.<a name=2:11></a> But the ankles are noted here in the experience in the river.<a name=2:12></a> It says, "And he brought me out by the way of the gate

		northward" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:2">Ezekiel  47:2</a>).<a name=3:1></a> If we are conversant with the significance of the points of the compass, this would suggest to us what is severe; it becomes known, the north wind and the effect of it, and then it is said, "When the man went forth eastward, a line was in his hand; and he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the ankles.<a name=3:2></a> And he measured a thousand cubits, and caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the knees" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:3">Ezekiel  47:3</a> - 4).<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One might speak much of these points, but one only desires to be concise and brief, as we should be at these meetings, affording something, even if it is but one point brought home to us.<a name=3:4></a> And so knees surely points to severe exercise, especially in regard of prayer, as we see with Elijah -- he put his face between his knees, and we know the result, how the cloud was seen rising like a man's hand.<a name=3:5></a> I am only just referring to this one point.<a name=3:6></a> "For this reason", says Paul, "I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a>).<a name=3:7></a> That is a second experience -- the ankles first, and then the knees, the second.<a name=3:8></a> And then again afterwards "he measured a thousand and caused me to pass through: the waters were to the lions".<a name=3:9></a> We may, in speaking thus, refer to anatomy -- of which one knows but little, but there is such a thing as spiritual anatomy, and so the Lord Jesus, speaking reverently, says, "A body hast thou prepared me" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:5">Hebrews  10:5</a>), and again we read, "Many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:52">Matthew  27:52</a>).<a name=3:10></a> We can see the importance of our bodies, and the Lord is going to bring us up out of our graves in bodies, and not only bodies in an ordinary sense, but bodies like unto His glorious body, His body of glory.<a name=3:11></a> One feels affected in speaking thus, dear brethren, because it reminds us
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of what is coming, and the portion of the saints in our high places and walking in our high places then and even now in a spiritual sense.<a name=4:1></a> And then too -- something that has now been before us already lately -- the Lord appearing to certain ones.<a name=4:2></a> It would be Himself, just Himself, but in His body.<a name=4:3></a> Then it is said further, "And he measured a thousand: it was a river that I could not pass through" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:5">Ezekiel  47:5</a>).<a name=4:4></a> Thus we learn what is beyond us by experience, and we do well to be governed by the sense of limitation that we cannot just speak of everything as if it were common; there is such a thing as mystery, which we should learn and be subject to and say we do not know at times, and not venture to explain everything.<a name=4:5></a> Here the waters were risen -- and they are apt to rise in the principle of which it is spoken of here.<a name=4:6></a> And I think they are rising -- to be very simple -- and it would be wholesome if we learnt that we are limited by the rise and that we cannot compass things, that we have to bow and regard everything reverently, and yet be in the sense of liberty, not overcome.<a name=4:7></a> But we find here the prophet says, "It was a river that I could not pass through" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:5">Ezekiel  47:5</a>) -- not "that could not be passed through", but that "I could not pass through".<a name=4:8></a> That would indicate the limitations of the creature.<a name=4:9></a> And so he goes on, "For the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through".<a name=4:10></a> That spells limitation, not only for Ezekiel, but for all, for every creature -- it could not be passed over.<a name=4:11></a> Well, it is well to have an experience like that, finding out that you cannot pass over, that you are limited, that others are going through, and that we do well to learn our limitations.<a name=4:12></a> Hence the apostle in Ephesians speaks of the breadth and the length and the depth and the height.<a name=4:13></a> All that speaks of limitation, but what blessed limitation, and we have the addition "and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses

		knowledge" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:19">Ephesians  3:19</a>) -- which cannot be passed through.<a name=5:1></a> I do not refer to it in this way as if it is presented just as I am saying, but it is really implied that the love of Christ is known -- "to know the love of the Christ" -- that is within the range of a Christian, of all of us, and how much it is needed -- to know the love of Christ.<a name=5:2></a> John says, "Hereby we have known love because he has laid down his life for us", (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>); but then it is the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.<a name=5:3></a> It is an experience and an experience that one would urge on all and on oneself, the idea of knowing the love of Christ.<a name=5:4></a> The brethren from the beginning of Christianity have known the love of Christ.<a name=5:5></a> Paul could say, "Who has loved me …" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=5:6></a> I do not know that anyone else says just that, but he says it -- He "loved me", not that He 'loves me', but He "loved me".<a name=5:7></a> Of course it implies that He loves me, but the point is what is historical, that experience had been in Christianity from the outset; Peter could say it no doubt, but Paul says it.<a name=5:8></a> "Waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through".<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then I just wish to touch on another thing, which I think is important for us on this point of experience.<a name=5:10></a> Brothers and sisters may learn, or have it before them to learn, by experience.<a name=5:11></a> It is in the limits of guidance; you know so-and-so because you have experience.<a name=5:12></a> Of course you may say, 'I have proved it and I know scripture teaches it', but then there are things that are not formally taught, and so the need of experience as one said, "I have been young" -- he had that experience -- "and now am old!<a name=5:13></a>;" he did not speak of middle age, he spoke of old age; and he had not seen certain things, and that fact was a guide to him.<a name=5:14></a> That is what I am speaking about.<a name=5:15></a> So here in verse 6 someone is saying something to Ezekiel -- which is another point that is to be expected and looked for and found as we look for it -- that is someone who
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		says something.<a name=6:1></a> He says it of himself, and he is not asked; one who say things because it is important they should be said -- as we might say, a word from the Lord, but it is rather that this man was saying it.<a name=6:2></a> "He said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this?<a name=6:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:6">Ezekiel  47:6</a>).<a name=6:4></a> Another thing is that "Son of man" is a remarkable expression.<a name=6:5></a> We have already together here spoken of man, what a place man has with God, and how Wisdom -- which is another suggestion -- says "My delights were with the sons of men" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:31">Proverbs  8:31</a>).<a name=6:6></a> There is something very beautiful in that suggestion -- the "sons of men"; sons, but sons of men.<a name=6:7></a> Angels are called sons of God, I suppose in a provisional sense -- "all the sons of God shouted for joy" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>).<a name=6:8></a> But Wisdom does not say her delights were with the sons of God, the angels, but with the sons of men, and it brings out a point of importance as to what is lovely, what is peculiarly attractive in a youthful sense; life as it were, at its prime, in its beauty.<a name=6:9></a> As the Lord says, "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.<a name=6:10></a> And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:28">Matthew  6:28</a> - 29).<a name=6:11></a> It is a question of what life is and the youthfulness of life, and, as applied to life in a spiritual sense, of which I am speaking, it is most attractive, and the sons of men would be a suggestion of what life is as Wisdom saw it.<a name=6:12></a> And so I touched on verse 6 -- "Son of man" -- not 'son of men'.<a name=6:13></a> It is a term found in Ezekiel many times; much used by the Lord as to Himself.<a name=6:14></a> But "sons of men" is a beautiful expression, and I have already touched on it.<a name=6:15></a> But here it is, "Son of man, hast thou seen this"?<a name=6:16></a> It is a question of experience -- had he seen it?<a name=6:17></a> He had seen much up to this point.<a name=6:18></a> And it says, "And he led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river".<a name=6:19></a> That is, you have had remarkable experience, but the man has more for

	<div class="paragraph">
		you and I believe that is one point in our meetings, dear brethren, how much there may be yet, how much is possible.<a name=7:1></a> And so here, "he led me and brought me back to the bank of the river".<a name=7:2></a> It is a great matter in scripture to be led: there is a great need for it too.<a name=7:3></a> It says, "And he led me and brought me back to the bank of the river.<a name=7:4></a> When I returned, behold on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other".<a name=7:5></a> Now this is the point, as many of us perhaps have noticed; he had not seen this when he saw the river first.<a name=7:6></a> He had gone through the river and he speaks of it being impassable, but he saw nothing of the trees; reminding us of the importance of waiting in the divine realm -- how much there is to be seen, even surprises!<a name=7:7></a> In fact you might say this was one of them.<a name=7:8></a> So it says, "When I returned, behold on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other".<a name=7:9></a> Why did he not see them before?<a name=7:10></a> He is not reproved; he reproves himself by implication, as if he were to enlarge on what is in mind.<a name=7:11></a> He could tell us about the depth of the water, to the ankles and the knees and the loins, and the impassableness of the river, but not a word about the trees.<a name=7:12></a> If the river is the Spirit, the trees are the brethren; that is simple -- I am not forcing the passage.<a name=7:13></a> We may talk much of the Spirit, and we should, but do not forget the brethren.<a name=7:14></a> If they come into view in this sense of surprise, how beautiful they are!<a name=7:15></a> We ought to learn the beauty of the brethren -- "Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us".<a name=7:16></a> The beauty of the Lord, but set upon us, in the sense of what can be on man -- put on man, put on the brethren.<a name=7:17></a> Well, he said he returned, meaning that the point is the returning, the coming back to a thing; not being sure that everything is exhausted or looked into or thoroughly known.<a name=7:18></a> It is hard to say much about anyone who knows much, except Paul as a

		teacher he says, "Ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:4">Ephesians  3:4</a>) as though the Lord put him forward as an ideal of acquiring knowledge, and if Paul, why not others?<a name=8:1></a> He says, "I returned", and "behold on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other" -- on both sides.<a name=8:2></a> No doubt John had this in mind in his book of the Revelation.<a name=8:3></a> I believe he had read it and that the Lord intended him to know something of the book of Ezekiel and of course we can get enlargement on the subject by reading the book of the Revelation.<a name=8:4></a> "And he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east district, and go down into the plain, and go into the sea; when they are brought forth into the sea, the waters thereof shall be healed" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:8">Ezekiel  47:8</a>).<a name=8:5></a> That is what I am coming to, the power of the life in the sense of healing -- how much that is needed; how much laceration, dear brethren, has come about with us and what need for healing!<a name=8:6></a> -- "Rather it may be healed".<a name=8:7></a> And there is the power for that in life; the Spirit is life and the saints become living too.<a name=8:8></a> But it is a question of the river here and the trees are on both sides of the river, unseen at first but now seen.<a name=8:9></a> "And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live" -- the double river, that is, it is a plural idea now.<a name=8:10></a> It is a question of the things that live already that are in mind now, the increase of life, life more abundantly.<a name=8:11></a> So that there is abundance as we come on in the truth and get to know one another, finding our home in the assembly.<a name=8:12></a> The Lord will be with us, as our brother said in his prayer, according to Matthew.<a name=8:13></a> Matthew gives us no account of the ascension, he is an assembly man and he is stressing the fact that the Lord is here to support us in it; not to take charge of it exactly, but to support us in it.<a name=8:14></a> "There am I …" -- not because of what He does -- of course He does

		things -- but He is there, and that is the thing to have before us.<a name=9:1></a> The Lord is greatly enlarging special meetings, as we call them, and it is a sign of the moment, it is a sign of life that the brethren like to be together.<a name=9:2></a> The thing is increasing.<a name=9:3></a> The devil is, of course, against it; but there it is, there is the increase, the word "double" implies that, the increase, what there is.<a name=9:4></a> Hence it says, "And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live.<a name=9:5></a> And there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters shall come thither, and the waters of the sea shall be healed; and everything shall live whither the river cometh" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:9">Ezekiel  47:9</a>).<a name=9:6></a> There is the idea of living and moving, but now there is something additional -- there is life in abundance, a very great multitude of fish, that is, living things; John could speak of them one hundred and fifty-three great fishes.<a name=9:7></a> That is, the fish are there on account of this, for the waters shall be healed whithersoever the double river cometh.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I thought I would call attention to this in view of experience that, dear brethren, we might be experimental in things and find guidance in experience and prove what comes about under certain conditions, and do not have to ask so many questions.<a name=9:9></a> Hence the point is to get the conditions, then we know what comes about, it is sure to happen.<a name=9:10></a> We are urged to come together, to assemble ourselves, but there are needed conditions; hence the point is to bring these conditions about.<a name=9:11></a> <br>J.<a name=9:12></a>T.<a name=9:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=10:1></a> The object in reading these scriptures is to call attention to the Levites, first viewed as a family -- all being included, and then to their work.<a name=10:2></a> There are actually fewer engaged in the work than are counted in chapter 3.<a name=10:3></a> It is thought that we should profit by dwelling first on the family side in chapter 3 in which the sons of Levi are reckoned according to their birth, and then the work or service side in chapter 4 in which they are regarded according to the sovereignty of God, Kohath being the first mentioned.<a name=10:4></a> The subject begins in the early part of chapter 3 -- "And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai".<a name=10:5></a> The fact that Moses was Aaron's brother is especially in mind according to what was said by Jehovah earlier when He called the attention of Moses to Aaron for the first time saying, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=10:6></a>" Then Aaron did certain things, which indicate that he was a real brother.<a name=10:7></a> God said "He goeth out to meet thee; and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart".<a name=10:8></a> That refers to the brotherly side -- the family side, and ought to be remembered so that we might have a right view of the Levites.<a name=10:9></a> "And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.<a name=10:10></a> And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.<a name=10:11></a> These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, who were consecrated to exercise the priesthood.<a name=10:12></a> And Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah when they offered strange fire before Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no sons; and Eleazar and Ithamar exercised the priesthood in the presence of Aaron their father".<a name=10:13></a> Two

		J.T.<a name=23:1></a> As has been remarked, it is not simply learning that is in mind, but quick learning.<a name=23:2></a> This gospel makes much of learning, and properly speaking, teaching precedes learning.<a name=23:3></a> The Lord Himself in the prophets says "He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed", (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:4">Isaiah  50:4</a>).<a name=23:4></a> So that it is in the mind of God that we should all be learners, but particularly those of us who serve in a special way.<a name=23:5></a> The Lord, too, in this particular gospel, quoting from the prophet (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#54:13">Isaiah  54:13</a>) says "They shall be all taught of God", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:45">John  6:45</a>), although that refers to the millennium when there will be widespread learning of God.<a name=23:6></a> In chapter 3 we have a special result of the work of God; Nicodemus is a slow learner, although a true believer, and it is thought that chapter 1 furnishes a quick learner -- that is Nathanael -- a learner by observation, not so much listening to teaching.<a name=23:7></a> Then in chapter 9 we have in the blind man who had his eyes opened, one who learned quickly, but who learned in order, the order in which the truth comes to us, until he arrives at the Lord Jesus and the Lord arrives at him.<a name=23:8></a> The Lord had met him earlier, but now he finds him and says "Dost thou believe on the Son of God", and the man replies "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him"?<a name=23:9></a> So that he has been learning and as the chapter shows is even able to teach others.<a name=23:10></a> Now he is still learning, and I suppose he may be regarded as representing us all, for while we are down here we are to be learners.<a name=23:11></a> So I thought this scripture in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>would help us on this point.<a name=23:12></a> The chapter 20 would help us as extending the thought to sisters.<a name=23:13></a> Sisterhood usually includes more in number than with brothers, but I am afraid the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:5></a> Well, the Lord, when He saw Nathanael coming to Him says "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.<a name=24:6></a> Nathanael says to him, Whence Knowest thou me?<a name=24:7></a> Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.<a name=24:8></a> Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel".<a name=24:9></a> He said that because of what the Lord had said, and it is because he observed that the Lord was there that the Lord could say what he did to him.<a name=24:10></a> He acquired a knowledge of the son of God very quickly.<a name=24:11></a>

		Ques.<a name=25:17></a> Would the absence of guile in Nathanael account for his ability to learn quickly?<a name=25:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=25:19></a> Well, the Lord's remarks would indicate it was constitutional, which is a thing to be counted on.<a name=25:20></a> If we see one who has some marks of the work of God, however small, God has effected that.<a name=25:21></a> The truth is that the whole man is born again -- not partially so.<a name=25:22></a> In (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:5">John  3:5</a> - 7) it says "Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=25:23></a> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit".<a name=25:24></a> Nicodemus queries that because he is natural, and yet he had the distinct marks of the work of God, only the work in him was sluggish.<a name=25:25></a> You do not get anything very much of him until the nineteenth chapter, and even then he provides spices for the embalmment of the Lord's body.<a name=25:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jno.<a name=26:1></a>G.<a name=26:2></a> Do you think that we see a contrast to Nathanael in Nicodemus, in the fact that he discloses the ability to learn quickly and the Lord recognises that in saying "Thou shalt see greater things than these"; whereas Nicodemus was not able to learn quickly, hence it says -- "If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe"?<a name=26:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=26:4></a> Well, of course, you must remember that the teaching is progressive, and what you say is a bit beyond the beginning.<a name=26:5></a> The Lord is really meaning to encourage Nathanael and says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these".<a name=26:6></a> It is a progressive thought.<a name=26:7></a> He had already said, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel".<a name=26:8></a> Think of a man being able to say that in such a short time from the truth being brought to him!<a name=26:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=26:10></a> When you speak of quick learning being constitutional, do you mean normally to each person who is a believer -- one who is born again -- or is it to a selected person?<a name=26:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=26:12></a> Well, anyone who is born again, or course, is selected, but some are sluggish.<a name=26:13></a> Others are quick.<a name=26:14></a> There are many examples in the scriptures, but I have picked out these two as the best that could be found -- especially Nathanael.<a name=26:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=26:18></a> The word "constitutional" is good, because it implies (speaking of it on natural lines) what one is by birth.<a name=26:19></a> The principle is in the person -- the principle of learning, the ability to learn; that must be there.<a name=26:20></a> Even in natural things you would get capacity for instruction in a man or woman, a boy or girl; you could not get ability to learn in a dog, no matter what means may be employed.<a name=26:21></a> It might appear in a small way in a detail, but in general it is

		J.T.<a name=41:1></a> What I have in mind is to call attention to the assembly.<a name=41:2></a> This is the gospel which speaks of it directly as the custodian of the testimony of God in this world.<a name=41:3></a> It is well-known that the gospels are intended to confirm the epistles, and this gospel supports Paul's letters to Corinth.<a name=41:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>tells us that God has set certain gifts in the assembly including the gift of government, which is an important item, to preserve and support what is of God; and to exercise needed discipline and correction.<a name=41:5></a> It is thought, therefore, that the Lord my take account of us as we are and of our history in this city and grant us such help as is needed, so that the assembly may have its place in all that relates to the testimony in this city, inclusive of the persons in the assembly.<a name=41:6></a> They are especially in view, particularly in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>which supposes that difficulties would arise and it provides light as to how they are to be met.<a name=41:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=41:11></a> Well, I think it is a divine system calculated to fit in with conditions as they are, meeting every exigency that may arise, whether it is by teaching, or preaching, or ministry generally.<a name=41:12></a> It is not the assembly in its heavenly relations which is before us.<a name=41:13></a> That is dealt with in Ephesians and is in mind generally in the Pauline epistles, but what is before us here is the assembly militant as having to do with adverse circumstances in the wilderness where evil has to be met.<a name=41:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=42:2></a> Well that is just what is in mind.<a name=42:3></a> But they reach the land.<a name=42:4></a> The tabernacle, of course, represents the assembly in the wilderness, although as in the land the tabernacle was set up at Shiloh, which was a provisional position until the temple was built, as it is said "Solomon built him a house".<a name=42:5></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:47">Acts  7:47</a>) So what we are dealing with now and what Matthew contemplates is the assembly in the wilderness.<a name=42:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=42:9></a> Well, that is a good way of putting it because independency has been the instrument in the hands of the devil whereby damage has been caused and requiring a change as indicated in verse 19 of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=42:10></a> The earlier part of that chapter beginning at the 15th verse contemplates the assembly in order, but the 19th verse contemplates a change as the word "again" implies.<a name=42:11></a> The Lord had said "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven", and then He adds "Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens.<a name=42:12></a> For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=42:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=43:4></a> Well it is.<a name=43:5></a> In the 12th chapter of 1 Corinthians the gifts of government are referred to but the earlier part of the chapter deals with spiritual manifestations, running down to the end of the 27th verse "Now ye are Christ's body, and members in particular".<a name=43:6></a> Then it adds, "And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles: secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments".<a name=43:7></a> I thought of calling attention to that because where difficulties arise involving the persons of the saints, the matter of government and the discernment of conditions that have caused the difficulties is so necessary.<a name=43:8></a> Solomon would represent that side typically.<a name=43:9></a> In his realm he had to deal with the persons of the Israelites and right and wrong amongst them, hence we have the judgement between the two harlots.<a name=43:10></a> He discerned who the mother of the child was and that idea may be extended to the assembly and the saints as in it.<a name=43:11></a> The motherly spirit would care for the life of the child, or as we might say, the lives of the brethren, their general welfare, and hence if conditions exist which involve the brethren, perhaps their imprisonment or their being deprived of their liberties, all that has to be dealt with.<a name=43:12></a> We cannot be healthy if any members are, so to say, in hospital.<a name=43:13></a> I do not know that the idea of a hospital applies to the assembly but certainly if any of the saints are deprived of their true position, then there is the need for adjustment, and I should think the idea of governments -- persons who understand government -- then comes into action.<a name=43:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=44:3></a> Well, the question of history comes up in such an enquiry because of what may have happened, as, for instance, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#13">Luke  13</a>the woman who was bent over for eighteen years.<a name=44:4></a> The Lord dealt with that, of course, but the assembly also has power to deal with conditions like it, and it is a question of administration, I would say, and what is discerned in my history by certain persons who can deal with such matters.<a name=44:5></a> We learn by history.<a name=44:6></a> We have already noticed that elsewhere.<a name=44:7></a> Troubles arise, as for instance in Israel, when Moses was enjoined to choose out seventy men to take part with him in the government.<a name=44:8></a> In the New Testament also the apostles according to the 6th chapter of the Acts suggested to the people that they should choose out seven men full of the Holy Spirit, persons who would be capable of meeting the emergency, which was a question of complaint on account of certain widows being neglected.<a name=44:9></a> The apostles said it was not for them to leave the word of God and serve tables, and they put it on the multitude to choose out seven men, well reported of and full of the Holy Spirit who could take on the matter of administration, but they were men who could be known historically as fit for the service.<a name=44:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=45:8></a> Well, we are dealing now in this chapter with the primary thoughts of God, what you might call the inaugural thoughts of the assembly, what the Lord had in mind as to it.<a name=45:9></a> He was speaking before it actually existed, because it did not actually exist until He went up to Heaven, having died and risen and the Holy Spirit having been given, because it is the descent of the Holy Spirit which constitutes the assembly.<a name=45:10></a>

		P.H.<a name=45:17></a>H.<a name=45:18></a> In the second half of chapter 18 it is contemplated that there is a spirit of reckoning.<a name=45:19></a> Would that enter into these matters of brethren and their difficulties?<a name=45:20></a> Half of the section speaks about one sinning against another and so on, then later it speaks about the king who would reckon with his bondmen.<a name=45:21></a> Would that spirit enter into it in a practical way in regard to government?<a name=45:22></a> Verse 23 says "For this cause the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who would reckon with his bondmen".<a name=45:23></a> Does what you are saying about governments assume that there is ability to reckon things in the assembly?<a name=45:24></a>

		It will be observed, dear brethren, that the apostle in all these passages speaks of his coming.<a name=64:1></a> He is not speaking of the Lord's coming but of his own, which in some sense is like the Lord's coming for he peculiarly represented the Lord both in love and in intelligence.<a name=64:2></a> We read of Samuel in his day that he had a circuit.<a name=64:3></a> He is a similar servant, though perhaps in a way not so great, and he covered his circuit annually.<a name=64:4></a> His coming to a certain place would in a way represent Jehovah.<a name=64:5></a> We know from the narrative of his life and ministry that coming to any place he would cause a stir, cause an interest, and so it was that the land in principle was influenced for good and for order and all that was becoming to the kingdom by the annual circuit made by the prophet Samuel.<a name=64:6></a> God had given him a great place amongst the people so that it says "… Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.<a name=64:7></a> And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah".<a name=64:8></a> (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#3:19">1 Samuel  3:19</a> - 20) A prophet is not simply one who can foretell future events, but one who can bring God into localities and bring His mind to persons.<a name=64:9></a> Now the apostle Paul is not formally said to have a circuit, yet he reminds the Corinthians and he tells Timothy of his coming and I have read these verses in this connection.<a name=64:10></a> The first scripture bears upon the order of the Lord's Supper, the apostle having said much as to it in this chapter which ends up with the word "And the rest will I set in order when I come".<a name=64:11></a> Thus they were to understand that Paul would come not as an ordinary brother, an ordinary visitor or as an ordinary servant, but as an

		Now you will understand by what I have said as to similar persons how a man like Paul, an apostle, would affect the saints as he came to a place.<a name=67:13></a> He had been to Corinth and had remained there for eighteen months, and yet after he left he had to write as he does.<a name=67:14></a> Things had arisen in his absence that had not come to light when he was there, for if they had he would have restrained and restricted them.<a name=67:15></a> So he writes this first epistle and the second half of this 11th chapter refers to the Lord's Supper.<a name=67:16></a> If there are those within the sound of my voice who are partaking of the Supper, one would urge you to look into the matter and see if there are not some things to do in

		The next word is exhortation -- it would, of course, have peculiar force in the case of a man like Timothy, but we should all learn to be in exercise in relation to the meeting for ministry, learning to give a word of exhortation on such occasions.<a name=76:18></a> God has been pleased to revive meetings of this character where prophecy is ministered.<a name=76:19></a> No one need say that it is not so, for I know it is and have heard ministry on such occasions which brought God to our souls in spiritual power.<a name=76:20></a> In connection with meetings of this kind we are told in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>that some unbeliever or simple person coming into a Christian assembly and hearing prophetic ministry, falls down and does homage to God in the presence of it.<a name=76:21></a> "He is judged of all"; it says, "the secrets of his heart are manifested".<a name=76:22></a> He is searched through and through like the woman of Samaria, who says as to the Lord "Who told me all things I had ever

		J.T.<a name=82:5></a> Well, I think in the mind of God it works out in a modified sense.<a name=82:6></a> It softens the masculine side.<a name=82:7></a> This appears too in the history of the nations.<a name=82:8></a> The idea of the feminine in government runs right through many nations.<a name=82:9></a> It is seen in Israel "upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir", and in many instances we find it in the history or government of the world as Israel is set aside.<a name=82:10></a> The feminine is carried down as in Esther.<a name=82:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=83:12></a> Hence the service of the assembly in the millennial day is clearly modified, although we have an allusion to so many cities yet the assembly is feminine as related to Christ; the bride arose by herself, as we see in the book of Proverbs; she arose in the absence of her husband, but of course the millennial day does not suppose the absence of Christ, but the present day does.<a name=83:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=95:1></a> What I have in mind is to consider the Lord's Supper as presented in the gospels and then in the first epistle to the Corinthians in order to call attention to the fact that the mind is more in view than other features in us.<a name=95:2></a> Luke corresponds with what is recorded in the epistles but I thought that we should also consider Matthew (representing Mark also) because he stresses eating.<a name=95:3></a> That would involve the lower organs -- digestion and assimilation -- what is constitutional in that sense, but Luke contemplates the mind, and the passage in 1 Corinthians contemplates both the mind and the digestive organs.<a name=95:4></a> It is assimilation too, and perhaps we do not give sufficient thought to the eating side in the Lord's Supper, suggesting what is needed to sustain us spiritually.<a name=95:5></a> At the same time Luke and 1 Corinthians make much of the mind, that is, it is a memorial which is contemplated.<a name=95:6></a> It seems as if the Lord intends that we should be built up so as to acquire and retain strength in the testimony and then to be clear in our minds historically.<a name=95:7></a> We have to bear history in mind too.<a name=95:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=97:7></a> Well, it refers to the passover, and it is clarified for us in Corinthians where it says "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a> - 8.<a name=97:8></a> This is the view of the Lord's Supper in the 11th chapter, but the passover is clearly the eating.<a name=97:9></a> It is Christ sacrificed, not Christ as having died alone, but sacrificed, alluding to the word in Exodus, the idea of sacrifice is there and it is a striking illustration of what the antitype is.<a name=97:10></a> The spiritual thoughts, however, are in the antitype.<a name=97:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=97:14></a> Well, I think that is what is implied.<a name=97:15></a> Scripture is linked together for us and made intelligible so that we can read Exodus in the light of the New Testament.<a name=97:16></a> The 12th chapter of Exodus speaks of "the beginning of months"; the young believer starting to break bread and partake of the Lord's Supper is beginning.<a name=97:17></a> His earlier days may be recorded, of course, but in truth he begins as he commences to take the Supper.<a name=97:18></a> It is the "beginning of months", and hence the beautiful account we have in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>and continuing on to the tabernacle system.<a name=97:19></a> What is to be kept in mind is that the young believer is taken account of, for the matter is reduced to a few verses by Moses.<a name=97:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>we have a long account of the passover and all that is connected

		with it in relation to the unleavened bread; but then beginning with verse 21 we have Moses passing the matter on to the elders and he condenses the account.<a name=98:1></a> I think it suggests that God considers for us; meetings may be too long, or other things may be prolonged unnecessarily.<a name=98:2></a> God would take account of what we are capable of, so that Moses reduced the account and I believe it is for the young believers, for they have to be considered.<a name=98:3></a> They cannot take in too much nor can they sit too long, and they have to be considered even as to time.<a name=98:4></a> "And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Seize and take yourselves lambs for your families, and kill the passover" and so on.<a name=98:5></a> It is to be noted that there are words included in this paragraph that are not in the general account.<a name=98:6></a> "And Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to smite you.<a name=98:7></a> And ye shall observe this as an ordinance for thee and for thy sons forever.<a name=98:8></a> And it shall come to pass, when ye are come into the land that Jehovah will give you, as he has promised, that ye shall keep this service.<a name=98:9></a> And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean ye by this service?<a name=98:10></a> That ye shall say, It is a sacrifice of passover to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses.<a name=98:11></a> And the people bowed their heads and worshipped.<a name=98:12></a> And the children of Israel went away, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they".<a name=98:13></a> That paragraph is really an epitome and it is concise and intelligible and I think it is well to have that in mind in looking into 1 Corinthians because the passover is introduced there in chapter 5 to prepare us for the Lord's Supper in chapter 11.<a name=98:14></a> The

		In order to proceed and not to miss what we have in mind, I would remark that in general Matthew gives us the eating side; it is a question of mastication, digestion and assimilation -- these are all thoughts that connect with building up the constitution, but Luke is not concerned so much about that; he is more concerned about our minds.<a name=99:17></a> We are to remember, and the word according to the note on <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:24">1 Corinthians  11:24</a> is "For the calling of me to mind" -- as if one had the power to do it, not that it is an accident, but he has the power to do it.<a name=99:18></a> He has power over his mind and uses it for one purpose and that is to contemplate what is presented in the Lord's Supper, especially in the bread, but 1 Corinthians speaks of the same idea in regard to the cup, and we do not get that anywhere else.<a name=99:19></a> The gospels do not refer to it.<a name=99:20></a> It is evidently what the Lord Jesus gave

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=114:1></a> This last verse shows the end that should be reached, viz.<a name=114:2></a> that the minister is known to be a man of God.<a name=114:3></a> It is an important thing that we represent God in our service, as it says "the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth".<a name=114:4></a> Not simply 'the truth' but "truth".<a name=114:5></a> That is the end to be reached.<a name=114:6></a> Another thing to be noted is that the minister of the truth has the gospel and the assembly in mind, and particularly as to the assembly he will have to do with houses in his ministry, and with families in houses.<a name=114:7></a> The service requires that he is to be identified with a house in so far as it may be needed in view of exigencies that arise in households, so that he is not merely a visitor, but identified with a house and all that enters into it from God.<a name=114:8></a> And another point, of course, is the word of God -- that is, the idea of prophecy which God has brought into particular prominence in recent times amongst His people, and how the prophet or the minister is to be in accord with his ministry in every way and accepting the word of God.<a name=114:9></a> Hence we have extraordinary circumstances in Elijah's history, such as we get earlier here in the portion of the chapter which we did not read, how he was fed by ravens and the brook carried water to him, and then how he was to be changed into circumstances in which not ravens but a widow is commanded to maintain him, showing how God moves in dignity with His servants and would have them to be in dignity in obeying Him and proving what He can be if we obey and are subject to whatever circumstances may arise in the service.<a name=114:10></a> The fact that it is said that Elijah was a man of like passions to ourselves makes these remarks very applicable to such a meeting.<a name=114:11></a> We are all, in a certain

		J.T.<a name=148:2></a> What is in mind is to speak about the assembly in her wifely relations, and it is thought that Moses should be considered first, and then David, especially as these two servants of God are engaged in great things, and the marital matter is brought in evidently in relation to these things; Moses in view of the law on Mount Sinai (or Mount Horeb), and David in view of the kingdom which he was about to receive.<a name=148:3></a> The assembly is viewed thus in the testimony of God as in relation to Christ in view of things happening on earth, but originating in heaven.<a name=148:4></a> It will be seen that the types of the assembly in a feminine, wifely, sense treat of Christ in type as engaged with great things, nothing, as it were, being in mind save that she is in evidence.<a name=148:5></a> What is in mind in heaven is that the saints now forming the assembly are to have part in these great things.<a name=148:6></a> Thus Zipporah comes in here after she had been sent back, the Exodus having taken place; she is here evidently in view of the beginning of the law, with all that might be implied typically as to the assembly's part in this.<a name=148:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=148:11></a> It would be what is set out in the New Testament, the epistles to the Corinthians particularly, involving also the ministry of Paul recorded in the Acts.<a name=148:12></a> I think it would be seen by examination of the Acts that the book has in mind the complete position of Christianity, the complete position of the assembly down here in testimony, not only what was set out in the twelve, but in Paul's ministry; the appearings of the Lord after He rose were to impress the disciples with Himself and continued historically

		J.T.<a name=149:9></a> Yes, and a softening influence; the feminine influence was intended to be modifying and softening, involving the gospel being applied in a more gracious and tender and sympathetic way, as we see for instance, in women like Lydia and Phoebe and the influence they exerted.<a name=149:10></a> Other similar references, too, are to be found in the epistle to the Philippians -- the peculiarly tender consideration for the apostle; he says that they had fellowship with him in the gospel from the beginning.<a name=149:11></a> The Corinthian ministry specially requires the presence of the assembly, because the assembly is there called "the Christ" in the first epistle, as if she exerted great influence in view of the continuance of the position in testimony, and much is made of woman's service, her silence stressed at the same time, and yet her influence.<a name=149:12></a> What is said in chapter 11 as to the headship of God, and of Christ, and of man is notable, as though that headship would greatly augment the service of sisters

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=151:4></a> That is right.<a name=151:5></a> Whether Phoebe or Lydia had husbands I am not prepared to say, but they certainly fit in with the sisterly qualities needed amongst us.<a name=151:6></a> I alluded to Terah's family because that family was to furnish the wives for the men of faith, in principle at least, and suggests the idea of kindred relations with Christ, that we are of the same kindred as Christ; the foreign element is excluded, all mixture is excluded.<a name=151:7></a> Zipporah is not specially honoured in the position, but she fills out what is needed in regard of the mediator, and therefore can be brought down to the idea of the opening up of the epistles to Corinth, bringing out the assembly's place, and how comely it is supposed to be, so as to give weight to the authority of the apostle.<a name=151:8></a> Zipporah never shone very much, but she is a wife, and Corinth did not shine either, but the wifely principle was there.<a name=151:9></a>

		I have read this chapter because it refers to <i>food</i>, and because of other things, too, but especially because of the food question, and because of the three manifestations of the Lord spoken of in the chapter, verse 14.<a name=165:1></a> The first manifestation alluded to is in chapter 20, beginning at verse 19: the second is in the same chapter, beginning with verse 26, and the third is in this chapter.<a name=165:2></a> These manifestations are in mind in the chapter being read, because the chapter really deals with the last days, and implies that the Lord intends to show Himself in a very real way to His people in the last days.<a name=165:3></a> The word 'manifestation' or 'manifest' would imply that.<a name=165:4></a> It is not simply an ordinary coming to us, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, but it is a wider thought, and the idea of three makes the more impression.<a name=165:5></a> We have the idea of three in a certain sense similar to this in the first chapter: this is in the 21st chapter, but the first chapter gives the idea of three in regard of days, really in regard of the Lord's gathering.<a name=165:6></a> The numeral there runs on to the second chapter, referring to the millennial period.<a name=165:7></a> We have to be simple, and, in order to get the true bearing of the numeral as applied to days, we have to begin with the last, that is, chapter 2, and read backwards; but we get the numeral in that way, and how it begins, and how the Spirit of God calls attention to the peculiar gatherings of the Lord at the beginning.<a name=165:8></a> We will all remember how the disciples of John left John and followed Jesus, and so the gathering began.<a name=165:9></a> The greatest born of women was there, and he had disciples, and two of them left John and followed Jesus, and so the gathering began.<a name=165:10></a> There is no one here on earth like John now for the saints to gather to.<a name=165:11></a> There are those who draw to

		themselves, and make disciples for themselves; but the centre of gathering is now the Lord.<a name=166:1></a> So the gathering began, and the days ran on to the reference in the second chapter.<a name=166:2></a> The same principle applies in this chapter, chapter 21; that is, we really need to begin with the third manifestation, and read backwards, so as to get a clear view of what the Lord had in His mind as He talked with the disciples, and hence what He has in His mind now.<a name=166:3></a> It is a time of manifestation, not so much a time of gathering, although there is gathering, thank God.<a name=166:4></a> Most of us here doubtless are among the gathered -- a very precious fact, a victorious fact, too, that there should be so many in this city or near it, who are gathered among the children of God.<a name=166:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as I said, we should begin with the third manifestation, the one I read of, and then revert back to the verses I alluded to in chapter 20, into which certain persons come who are distinctive, and who are to be kept in our minds.<a name=166:6></a> I do not intend to pursue the subject of the 20th chapter, although it is one of the most precious in scripture, and especially because of the Lord's appearing to Mary Magdalene, and calling her "Woman", and then calling her "Mary", and then regulating her as to Him, that she was not to touch Him, because He had not yet ascended to heaven.<a name=166:7></a> So that we can see that we are now in the time in which ascending to heaven applies.<a name=166:8></a> In truth it is a time of going to heaven: it is as if the time had come, the days of going to heaven.<a name=166:9></a> We read in Luke of the <i>days</i> of the Lord's receiving up to heaven.<a name=166:10></a> Already the days had come, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:51">Luke  9:51</a>.<a name=166:11></a>

		And so it is now: the days of ascending to heaven have come; not simply of the Lord Himself, but of <i>our</i> ascending: the days have come, and what days, dear brethren!<a name=166:12></a> What opportunities of learning how to go to heaven!<a name=166:13></a> You may say, 'If we die, we shall go there';

		Well now, I have said all that in the way of preface, and I do not intend to enlarge on chapter 20, but certainly what I have said should be taken note of.<a name=167:5></a> Probably some of us have thought as I have said, but I would suggest that the brethren should begin, if they have not already done so, with the idea of going to heaven.<a name=167:6></a> The Lord said to the thief on the cross: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise".<a name=167:7></a> That applies to many even now.<a name=167:8></a> That man had not received the Spirit: Christ had not died: He had not gone to heaven: the Spirit had not come; and yet the Lord said to him, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise".<a name=167:9></a> The man did not seem to have any doubt about it.<a name=167:10></a> There are many who have fallen asleep this very day and have gone to be with Jesus.<a name=167:11></a> Do not think I am fanciful or stressing the thing unduly: I am speaking of what is actually true: there are many who have fallen asleep <i>today</i>, and have gone to be with Jesus, gone to be with <i>Him</i>.<a name=167:12></a> He said to the man, the thief, "Today shalt thou be with <i>me</i> in paradise"; and Paul had an addition to that: "To depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:23">Philippians  1:23</a>.<a name=167:13></a> The thief did not say that, but the language of Christianity is that: "To depart, and to be with Christ; which is <i>far</i> better" -- better even than the very best thing here; and Paul had learned to say that, and has taught us to say it too.<a name=167:14></a> How often we do say it, and say it victoriously, at the grave's mouth; and we can continue to say it, until the Lord is pleased to take us to Himself.<a name=167:15></a>

		But I am now speaking of going to heaven in the principle of it, of learning not only to go to heaven, but learning the Jordan, to cross the Jordan; for the word is very rightly stressed in the prophets: "How wilt thou then do in the swelling of the Jordan?<a name=168:1></a>" <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#12:5">Jeremiah  12:5</a>.<a name=168:2></a> It is a matter, dear brethren, for everyone of us to think of, and especially the older ones; for we are to be taught to number our days that we may acquire a wise heart, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90:12">Psalm  90:12</a>.<a name=168:3></a> So when the swelling of Jordan is touched, we are victorious: we are not afraid.<a name=168:4></a> It is the learning time in that sense.<a name=168:5></a> All that we get as to the passage of the Jordan is to instruct us as to this very matter: how we are to go through, and how we are to be victorious in going through.<a name=168:6></a> It is a question of testimony, dear brethren, of how we die.<a name=168:7></a> We do not say, "man goeth to his long home", <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#12:5">Ecclesiastes  12:5</a>: we say we go to heaven when the Lord comes; but rather now we go to be with Jesus.<a name=168:8></a> I do not know that we should be too free in designating the place we are going to, but rather the Person we are going to.<a name=168:9></a> We are going to be with Jesus.<a name=168:10></a> It is a real matter, and a real testimony to the truth.<a name=168:11></a>

		Well now, I have touched on the manifestations, and I wish to speak about this third one, and to show that it involves food.<a name=168:12></a> Great importance is attached to food at the present time: it is so physically.<a name=168:13></a> I need not say that the food question is one of the most urgent; but now I must not be speaking of that: it is a question of food in a spiritual sense, and this third manifestation is in relation to food, but it is also in relation to seven disciples who were going astray.<a name=168:14></a> I say they were <i>going</i>: one says, "I <i>go</i> a fishing".<a name=168:15></a> He did not imply that he was going astray, but we can see that he was, for had not the Lord come in, who can say what would have happened?<a name=168:16></a> "I go", he says, with determination: "I go a fishing", and the others say, "We also go with thee".<a name=168:17></a> There were six of them

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, this dinner is what I intended to come to, and what I hope will be used of the Lord to help us as to the tenderness of His solicitude for us for our recovery if we have gone astray, or are about to, or if we are thinking of going astray.<a name=172:11></a> How tender He is!<a name=172:12></a> As one said, how he longed for the "unrebuking gaze" of the Lord Jesus.<a name=172:13></a> Even although there may be cause for it, He knows when the rebuke may be left out, and causes the gaze to be an unrebuking one.<a name=172:14></a> And so here: the way of the Lord was perfect: "Come and dine", He says.<a name=172:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I could have said considerably more about the passage, but time fails, I now want to refer to some verses lower down.<a name=172:16></a> The Lord had asked them to dine in verse 12, and He had said to them in verse 10, "Bring of the fish which ye have now caught".<a name=172:17></a> That is, He would say, 'I want you to be mutual.<a name=172:18></a> I want you to understand that I am mutual, and that I can act mutually with you, and that I

		can help you to do things; but I want you to do them'.<a name=173:1></a> That is the principle, and Matthew especially is worked out on that principle.<a name=173:2></a> The Lord says there, "<i>I</i> am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", chapter 28: 20, meaning, 'I am ready to work with you on mutual lines, but I want you to do things -- not wait on me always, or on the brethren'.<a name=173:3></a> The Lord is ready to help us: "I am with you", He says, not 'you with me', but "I am with you alway".<a name=173:4></a> So in this beautiful way He says now, 'I have got everything ready, but I want you to have part with me in that which you have contributed'.<a name=173:5></a> So in verse 10 He says, "Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.<a name=173:6></a> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three; and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken".<a name=173:7></a> Now this is another point that I must touch on, that is the non-breaking of the net; just as we have it in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>that the sheet was knit at the four corners, meaning that it was secured: there was no possibility of breaking.<a name=173:8></a> It was let down once, and twice and thrice, and drawn up into heaven again.<a name=173:9></a> The sheet was not broken, and so here: the net was not broken.<a name=173:10></a> What I would suggest, dear brethren, is that we have come to the time of the real system of Christianity coming to light and being proved.<a name=173:11></a> It is being proved: many of us are proving it every week and every day.<a name=173:12></a> Christianity is a real, abiding matter, an immutable thing; it is all going up to heaven.<a name=173:13></a> The sheet comes down three times and goes up three times, and goes up for ever.<a name=173:14></a> It is the power that is in the system that we may rely on.<a name=173:15></a> So the net was not broken here, and we arc told how many fishes there were.<a name=173:16></a>

		If I had more time I should like to say more about the matter of the unbreakableness of the sheet and of the net, meaning that it is the unbreakableness of the system into which we have come, in which the Spirit is, throughout the dispensation, from the moment He came down at Pentecost till now.<a name=174:15></a> He is actively in it, and the system is unbreakable.<a name=174:16></a> So we may be sure, dear brethren that all is well.<a name=174:17></a>

		But then I come to the matter of Peter and food.<a name=175:1></a> I was speaking of the food question, and now Peter is to be active in the food matter, and so the Lord says: 'Before you touch the food matter, I want to touch the love matter'.<a name=175:2></a> That is what comes out now, this love matter; and the word comes to me: "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>.<a name=175:3></a> Those in fellowship, those who are genuinely in fellowship, are to be marked by love among ourselves.<a name=175:4></a> And so the question of the food and the sheep comes into the Lord's mind.<a name=175:5></a> Of course, they were always in His mind, but I speak of the order in which things are stated.<a name=175:6></a> The Lord says to Peter: "Lovest thou me more than these?<a name=175:7></a>" "These" would be, I suppose, all the apostles.<a name=175:8></a> The Lord would have some persons in His mind when He said that; but anyway, there was enough in His mind to challenge Peter as to whether he had more love for Christ than the others.<a name=175:9></a> And so I would say, dear brethren, as to the matter of administration, it is a very urgent matter -- the question of love must come up first.<a name=175:10></a> Who is worthy of being entrusted by the Lord with administration, and especially with His own lambs and His own sheep, meaning His own young believers and His own old believers: who is to be entrusted with them?<a name=175:11></a> This is a most serious matter.<a name=175:12></a> Of course we have our care-meetings, and we can thank God for them, because the Lord is with us in them.<a name=175:13></a> It is a question of caring for the saints.<a name=175:14></a> The word is in the letters of Paul to Timothy, <i>caring</i> for the assembly, <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:5">1 Timothy  3:5</a>.<a name=175:15></a> That is the word that governs the care-meeting.<a name=175:16></a> It is a question of care, rightly used, and who is worthy to have to do with the matter.<a name=175:17></a> Well, "Lovest thou me more than these?<a name=175:18></a>" I would say that is a challenge to every brother who attends the care-meetings, because I believe the Lord is with us in this particular matter

		J.T.<a name=179:1></a> It is hoped that we shall see as we proceed that this chapter contemplates the gospel, but properly the gospel of heaven, alluding to the passage in Numbers where we have recorded the spying out of the land of Canaan by those whom Moses sent out, alluding to, not what we might call the gospel of our salvation, but the gospel of the land.<a name=179:2></a> The gospel of our salvation touches more on deliverance from Egypt, but this gospel we are alluding to refers to the land.<a name=179:3></a> Then it is thought we also might see in connection with this the word of God and the danger of not hearkening to it, and thus not entering into the rest of God; and then the priesthood of Christ, which is evidently added in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>to support us as in the light of this gospel, so that we may not draw back or become hardened: as it is said in the 3rd chapter: "Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; where your fathers tempted me, by proving me, and saw my works forty years", verses 7 - 9.<a name=179:4></a> So that it is hoped that we will reach these points to our profit, first to see that the land is in question in reference to the gospel here: chapter 4: 2.<a name=179:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=181:6></a> Yes, one would think so: "To me", says the apostle, "less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ"; and it goes on to the mystery: "and to enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God", and so forth, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a> - 9.<a name=181:7></a> So that Ephesians clearly relates to the heavenly calling which the land answers to, and the gospel of the unsearchable riches is linked up with the mystery.<a name=181:8></a> I mean, we do not want to evade the greatest things if we can rightly or legitimately touch them, and yet have understanding as to how the truth reaches down to earth; just as the expanse in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, the expanse which is specifically called "heavens", evidently reaches down to earth, because it includes the atmospheric heavens.<a name=181:9></a> So the link is there between the heaven and the earth, and God says, "The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#66:1">Isaiah  66:1</a>, linking them together.<a name=181:10></a> Clearly the thought of eternal life is in relation to the millennium, as it says, "The righteous (shall go away) into life eternal", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:46">Matthew  25:46</a>.<a name=181:11></a> Clearly that is on the earth, but then we should be careful as to linking it up with the heavenly, the whole scheme of truth, because the Spirit is here to guide us into all the truth, and that includes eternal life.<a name=181:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=183:1></a> Well, I would say that, Colossians being the lesser of the two, Ephesians being the full thought of the calling, the calling of God.<a name=183:2></a> Colossians is on lower ground really, because I would say that the word that would cover it most accurately is "entering", not "having entered", but "entering".<a name=183:3></a> It is a period or a territory on which we enter first as crossing the Jordan: there it is that we touch the old corn of the land, but there it is, too, that the circumcision is applied.<a name=183:4></a> I think that the word "entering" would be more accurate than to say we have entered, whereas Ephesians contemplates that we have entered: we are raised up together and <i>made to sit down together</i> in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, in Ephesians; whereas Colossians is on lower ground, that we are "risen with Christ": it does not go further than that.<a name=183:5></a> It has heaven in view, but it is, "raised with him (Christ) through faith of the working of God who raised him", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=183:6></a> So that what we are saying now is of the greatest importance to us in our subject as to the land and as to entrance, and then the full thought of having entered.<a name=183:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=187:8></a> I would say that, the glory being there.<a name=187:9></a> Quite so.<a name=187:10></a> It would be a link with Ephesians, what has just been remarked.<a name=187:11></a> We have had glad tidings presented to us: the question is whether the truth has been mixed with faith.<a name=187:12></a> Of course, we have it in our bookcases, but then faith is not there: it is a question of our souls.<a name=187:13></a> "The word of the report did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard".<a name=187:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=188:9></a> Well, it is a beautiful expression, God entering into His rest.<a name=188:10></a> We have to go back to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, for it: it is beautifully linked up with <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#31:17">Exodus  31:17</a>: "On the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed", showing what is before us -- the blessedness of the rest of God.<a name=188:11></a> It has been pointed out that the idea of the sabbath with Israel would probably include about a quarter or more of their time, if the sabbaths were kept according to the instructions, showing how important the thing is in the mind of God; and it begins with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>.<a name=188:12></a> God rested and was refreshed, we are told in Exodus.<a name=188:13></a> So here, what is in mind is the rest of God.<a name=188:14></a> "For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from the foundation of the world.<a name=188:15></a> For he has said somewhere of the seventh day thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works: and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.<a name=188:16></a> Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word .<a name=188:17></a>.<a name=188:18></a>.<a name=188:19></a>" that is the point: the refusal to hearken to the word, and hence deny ourselves the greatest blessing.<a name=188:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=190:11></a> That is what I should say, because we touch on God's rest.<a name=190:12></a> He has nothing less than that, and it is involved in what the Lord says to the disciples: "In my Father's house are many mansions: I go to prepare a place for you" -- that is, the saints of this dispensation -- "and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:2">John  14:2</a> - 3.<a name=190:13></a> That will take place when the Lord comes; but what we see here is the light involved in that, laid hold of now in the power of the Spirit: that is the faith mixture.<a name=190:14></a> Do we understand that commodity?<a name=190:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=193:11></a> Well, just so, only that John is divided as to this point into two sections; chapter 10 is in the first, chapter 20 is in the second, and the second begins properly with the 13th where the Lord has in mind that we should have part with Him, and then chapter 14, and then chapter 15, and then chapter 16, and then chapter 17, where He lifts up His eyes to heaven and says, "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee".<a name=193:12></a> Now in chapter 9, the blind man had come to the knowledge of Christ as the Son of God: "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=193:13></a> He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?<a name=193:14></a> And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he.<a name=193:15></a> And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage", verses 35 - 38.<a name=193:16></a> He is the characteristic man in that section, and it runs on to the end of chapter 12, involving the Jewish side of the position.<a name=193:17></a> Chapter 13 begins with the heavenly side, part with Christ, and it involves what we read in chapter 14, as to His coming to us, and also that in His Father's house are many mansions.<a name=193:18></a> So we are led into the heavenly side in that section, ending with the Lord's prayer in chapter 17.<a name=193:19></a> Then we have chapter 20, which is the climax of the

		I have in mind to speak about the walk suitable to Christians.<a name=231:1></a> Much is made of walk in the scriptures.<a name=231:2></a> It is said to Abraham "walk before me and be thou perfect", and he did -- he walked before God.<a name=231:3></a> And so Israel, the seed of Abraham, was called upon to walk through the wilderness, and it is said that Jehovah "taught Ephraim to walk", meaning that Ephraim was the leading tribe (though not at the beginning but in later days, for the birthright was Joseph's), but in Hosea, in the days of the prophets, it is said that Jehovah "taught Ephraim to walk" -- chapter 11: 3, and this is in view in Numbers, as I hope to show.<a name=231:4></a> Israel was not simply told to go into Canaan, he was led, taken up in leadership, and taught to walk.<a name=231:5></a> There was no way in the wilderness, and yet Israel had to go through, but as going through, taught to walk, and obviously according to Numbers, taught to walk together.<a name=231:6></a> We read that their shoes did not grow old on their feet, and their clothes did not grow old.<a name=231:7></a> There was no need of shops on the way, nor of shoemakers or tailors.<a name=231:8></a> They started out with one suit of clothes and shoes and they lasted; they are spoken of at the end of forty years as still in existence, and therefore they have become types for us.<a name=231:9></a> We are to learn too that our shoes and our clothes and the like may last longer, in the goodness of God, as they are hard to get, for God takes account of circumstances to prove to us what He can be to us.<a name=231:10></a> So He proves to Israel that they could get along with one suit of clothes in forty years, and one pair of shoes.<a name=231:11></a> I am not speaking thus just to be odd, but it is a fact of great importance.<a name=231:12></a> We may not look for miracles exactly in the times we are in, times of great need, and dearth of everything, but we know there

		What I am speaking of now is what belongs to Christianity, and that which has the first place -- 'priority' to use a well-known word.<a name=233:4></a> Priority belongs to the writings of the New Testament, and particularly to what the apostles taught and did.<a name=233:5></a> We are not told much of the writings at the beginning, it was a matter of what they were saying, and we are told that the converts adhered to what they said.<a name=233:6></a> "They persevered", we are told, "in the teaching… of the apostles".<a name=233:7></a> There was no priority given to the Old Testament in the early days; it was recognised, of course, for you soon find it as you read the book of Acts, but the early disciples began with and accorded priority to the apostles -- "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles".<a name=233:8></a> They persevered in these things, and so I begin with the New Testament, and in speaking of the apostles I would say that Paul has apostolic priority, and I read from his epistle to the Thessalonians -- a very touching letter, full of freshness.<a name=233:9></a> He visited Thessalonica, according to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17">Acts  17</a>, and preached there three sabbath days.<a name=233:10></a> Apparently preaching through the week was not available or convenient, for he was in heathen territory, but he preached at least three sabbaths one after the other, "opening and laying down", that is to say, presenting things in the sense of opening them up and laying them down, making them authoritative, and worth listening to and adhering to, so the assembly at Thessalonica was formed.<a name=233:11></a> Afterwards this epistle was written to it, and this verse is in it.<a name=233:12></a> "Furthermore then we beseech

		Citizenship refers to politics and our politics are in heaven.<a name=235:1></a> We have politics but they are in heaven.<a name=235:2></a> We belong to heaven.<a name=235:3></a> These Christians are called Thessalonians and they are said to be "in God the Father".<a name=235:4></a> That is a most precious fact.<a name=235:5></a> Whilst they <i>are</i> Thessalonians they are in God the Father!<a name=235:6></a> God the Father had priority in every respect.<a name=235:7></a> He has the priority of a Father; He is our Father, for "to us there is one God, the Father" and He is everything to us.<a name=235:8></a> So the Apostle intended to encourage these young Christians.<a name=235:9></a> I do not mean they were all young people literally, but they were all young Christians.<a name=235:10></a> I should say they were a few months old at the time this epistle was written, and they are held in the apostle's heart in a precious way, as "in God the Father".<a name=235:11></a> Not simply born of God, but "<i>in</i> God the Father".<a name=235:12></a> He is concerned about many things, as we know, including their walk, and he exhorts them "as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more".<a name=235:13></a> There is apparently no limit in his mind to the increase that may be made on the line of walk.<a name=235:14></a> We may walk in heaven, for the writer of the hymn we have just sung spoke about walking in heaven, and I think it is a precious thought too.<a name=235:15></a> We talk with the Lord there too.<a name=235:16></a> In the case of Elijah and Elisha, "they went on and talked".<a name=235:17></a> Two men by the Jordan who could be seen from heaven going on in the will of God, "they two went on".<a name=235:18></a> So the apostle has this in mind that the Thessalonians should go on -- should walk.<a name=235:19></a> The word, of course, implies not only the use of one's feet and limbs, but general deportment and conduct, and the apostle had in mind that the Thessalonians to whom he is writing should continue to walk.<a name=235:20></a> They were to walk together, and not only so, but as he says "as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God".<a name=235:21></a> That is to say he was a model for them

		in the matter of walking.<a name=236:1></a> The word "walking" has a peculiar place here, showing how the walk of the Thessalonians, who were young Christians, became pleasing to God.<a name=236:2></a> I do not remember a time when the term 'young Christians' had more force, and was more important than it is now.<a name=236:3></a> They are greatly increasing in numbers and the burden of the testimony is coming on them, and it is most urgent that they should abound more and more, instead of slackening, and that the walk in these young Christians, as "in God the Father", should reflect the Father.<a name=236:4></a> Paul was a model, and he was a model father.<a name=236:5></a> He said to the Corinthians, "yet have ye not many fathers", though they had many instructors, and I would say, dear brethren, we have far more preachers and teachers (and I rejoice in them) than we have fathers.<a name=236:6></a> We have very few fathers, and we are in great need of fathers, that is persons who know God, and who are eye-witnesses of what God was in years past.<a name=236:7></a> They can tell us what God was, teaching us from what they have learned.<a name=236:8></a> Paul was a father, and he speaks of himself most touchingly.<a name=236:9></a> He had regarded them and cared for them as a nurse her own children.<a name=236:10></a> He had the skill and tenderness of a nurse, and the affections of a mother and a father, so that they were held in peculiar regard in heaven and in the ministry.<a name=236:11></a> So he would exhort them, "that ye would abound still more".<a name=236:12></a>

		Then the verse in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5">Galatians  5</a>came to my mind in looking through the scriptures, and in thinking of what should be spoken of.<a name=236:13></a> We should think beforehand of what we intend to say.<a name=236:14></a> Not verbatim, but the principal thoughts should be in our minds.<a name=236:15></a> We are so constituted as to need such preparation for it is very important to have something to say and to be sure of it.<a name=236:16></a> This verse then came into my mind as following the verse in Thessalonians, "This I say then,

		And now we touch Galatians, another of Paul's products, who were causing him great agony, for the Spirit of God was affecting him profoundly because of the retrogression of the Galatian assemblies, and because of the truth being affected adversely.<a name=238:2></a> The devil had damaged the universe, and he began to damage the assembly even in Paul's days, and he is damaging it now.<a name=238:3></a> I am speaking soberly now, as I am speaking of the big things men have been handling lately in the war.<a name=238:4></a> Satan would make much of them, and of what he can do, and move and control, and there is always the danger of the devil finding a way to stir up sedition on the earth against God, which he directs against the assembly and against the scriptures, for that is his fine work.<a name=238:5></a> These big matters are rough ones.<a name=238:6></a> He does not avoid the big things, but he is concerned, dear brethren, about our little selves, a few of us in this town or that town.<a name=238:7></a> I do not think we should ever begin to count up our numbers at all.<a name=238:8></a> We can number the assemblies, but not the persons.<a name=238:9></a> Keep the number out of sight, because it is a day of small things, but a day of quality.<a name=238:10></a> And so the devil would spoil us, our little selves as I was saying, in these little meetings.<a name=238:11></a> These meetings are nothing at all in the eyes of the big men of this world, but they are everything in the eyes of heaven just now.<a name=238:12></a> I say everything because heaven is engaged with these meetings.<a name=238:13></a> They are the very centre of the divine operations.<a name=238:14></a> I do not hesitate to say that at all, and it is in order to stimulate us that we might be thoroughly in them, never avoiding them and always understanding that we should make the most of them and to give priority to these meetings because they work out the purpose of God.<a name=238:15></a> The defeat of the devil is a great matter which is now in view, and our

		"This I say then, walk in the Spirit".<a name=239:3></a> I would extend the idea of walking to what I have said, and you will readily see that it implies how we get on together.<a name=239:4></a> It involves the way we meet and come together, because it is important to meet each other, and to greet each other, as the apostle says, "greet one another with a holy kiss".<a name=239:5></a> Holy, affectionate greetings, that is the idea.<a name=239:6></a> Then we are to sit down together and deal with the things of God in the solemnity and decorum that becomes us, with due consideration for one another, loving one another, and above all learning to be subject one to another.<a name=239:7></a> The most efficient or able of us must learn how to be subject.<a name=239:8></a> I may say one's age ought to give me priority; so it should, but at the same time it does not preclude that an old brother should be subject.<a name=239:9></a> Subjection enters into what this passage speaks of, "This I say then, walk in the Spirit".<a name=239:10></a> The Spirit is the greatest governing principle of all walk and ways, the sure guarantee for everything that God requires of us, so that we are pleasing to God.<a name=239:11></a> If the Spirit is recognised and we do not grieve the Spirit, we please God.<a name=239:12></a> If we grieve the Spirit we do not please God.<a name=239:13></a> If we quarrel with one another we do not please God.<a name=239:14></a> If we wrangle over things we do not please God, and this would extend to our business affairs, our household affairs, and our family affairs.<a name=239:15></a> The Spirit is here ready to serve us, dear brethren, in all these matters, so as to bring about a heavenly condition here on earth, and in spite of the contrariety there is much that pleases God.<a name=239:16></a>

		These scriptures are read with a view to speaking of Luke from the standpoint of elevation, but since coming here this afternoon the thought came to me, not at once to speak of elevation, but of the plain, the moral plain first, so I will read chapter 3, verse 10, "And the crowds asked him saying, What should we do then?<a name=255:1></a> And he answering says to them, He that has two body-coats, let him give to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise.<a name=255:2></a> And tax-gatherers came also to be baptised, and they said to him, Teacher, what should we do?<a name=255:3></a> And he said to them, Take no more money than what is appointed to you.<a name=255:4></a> And persons engaged in military service also asked him saying, And we, what should we do?<a name=255:5></a> And he said to them, Oppress no one, nor accuse falsely, and be satisfied with your pay".<a name=255:6></a> This came to me with peculiar force as entering into what had already occupied us; but characteristically Luke avoids creating trouble, and shews us how the saints can serve on the level of the plain, in that sense, that is, on the level of ordinary conduct, for the government of God enters into it.<a name=255:7></a> I feel that attention should be called to it, to see how they can explain these words of John, because of the external circumstances around today; so much being asked, leading to legislation by rulers; and then other things are mentioned, tax-gatherers, soldiers, and the like.<a name=255:8></a> The enquiries all make up or tend to the burden of the legislation.<a name=255:9></a> And the question arises how the government of God may not be involved by the brethren by their avoidance of what is correct, and the brethren fail in unselfishness, "He that has two body-coats, let him give to him that has none".<a name=255:10></a> I say that as a preface, as to

		The brethren will have observed that I called attention to the better translation in the first scripture read, and that calamity in the house of Ephraim is mentioned, evil is calamity, and vice versa, but the word 'evil' has a moral meaning, whereas 'calamity' may not be blameworthy, especially in the household alluded to.<a name=275:1></a> I have read of calamitous conditions in these two houses.<a name=275:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9">Mark  9</a>it is a matter of lunacy (though not called it in Mark, but in Matthew, but I need not comment on it), a most sorrowful matter for any house.<a name=275:3></a> But I proceed now, and as I have read, the first is death by murder; not an uncommon thing alas just now for human life is so cheap; it is nothing more in some peoples' eyes than that of an animal; but it was not so in Ephraim's house.<a name=275:4></a> He is one of the sons of Joseph, who was favoured as being beloved by his father, Israel, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37:3">Genesis  37:3</a>.<a name=275:5></a> So we have to look for much in the history of Joseph of instruction and interest; it is a love matter, and as most know the history implies sovereignty, peculiar sovereignty on the part of God.<a name=275:6></a> So it is that when Joseph came to Jacob he brought in his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim; they were born in Egypt, but Jacob claimed them as his sons, meaning that they were to be elevated to full tribal status.<a name=275:7></a> Scripture always provides its reasons and explanations for what is done, so when Joseph came to his father, it is because he heard that his father was sick; and when a man of distinction is sick, like Elisha in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#13">2 Kings  13</a>, it is serious; sick men in the service of God may die; therefore God has His own reasons.<a name=275:8></a> Jacob went down to Egypt and stayed there seventeen years; then he becomes sick in view of death, and Joseph is told of it.<a name=275:9></a> He was a great man in Egypt now, but he was not

		One more word as to <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#7">1 Chronicles  7</a>; Ephraim's wife bore him a son, "and he called his name Beriah, for he was born when calamity was in his house"; his name means "calamity"; it is prophetic; "Beriah" would always remind him of the sorrow that had come into his house; as he grew up, and as he looked at him, he would never forget it; and shall we ever forget our Beriahs over these last six years.<a name=278:4></a> God may change the calamity, for He can do it; and so it was, he not only had this son, but he also had a daughter, Sheerah, a builder, like Ruth and like Rachel and Leah, the builders of the house of Israel -- <a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#4:11">Ruth  4:11</a>.<a name=278:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=292:1></a> It is hoped the Lord will help us to see something in the history of Samson that will help us to understand the "crown of life" given to Smyrna -- <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:10">Revelation  2:10</a>.<a name=292:2></a> "Tribulation ten days" means ten series of persecutions or tribulations for the truth.<a name=292:3></a> Samson, although he had an extraordinary history, and there was much that could be condemned, was a man of faith, he judged Israel twenty years; that is said of him twice; a very considerable time.<a name=292:4></a> Jehovah gave him a great victory at the end, which came after the growth of his hair; it should never have been cut, for he was a Nazarite.<a name=292:5></a> It seems to me that the growth of hair in this connection is an evidence of life; it always is, but especially so when it has been cut off; it would also refer to the crown of life, which would be Samson's.<a name=292:6></a> There are other crowns, the crown of righteousness, suffering for the truth, and so on.<a name=292:7></a> But Samson was brought in miraculously; an angel from heaven coming in to announce his birth, and much is done by him, that is the angel.<a name=292:8></a> All this bears on the service of God.<a name=292:9></a> And then after his birth, he is seen as moved by the Spirit of Jehovah at the camp of Dan, Chapter 13: 25.<a name=292:10></a> The Spirit of God has to do with him early, and also at the end of his life, in his great victory.<a name=292:11></a> As we bow to the claims of the service of God in humility we become victorious.<a name=292:12></a> It seems to me a matter of considerable importance at the present time, when Philistine conditions prevail, and other such conditions, to accept the failure, so that we may come in for the crown of life.<a name=292:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, as I said, among these things is the matter of sowing; seed-time and harvest; it is a question of the time.<a name=333:2></a> The Spirit of God uses the idea of sowing very prominently throughout the Scriptures and I call attention to the matter now to show how it applies to persons; persons sown.<a name=333:3></a> What is in the passage read refers doubtless to cereals and the like, vegetables, what is sown to produce a crop for men's benefit; but then the thought is enlarged in the prophets, as you will see, in the passages read, to apply to men; men, women and children.<a name=333:4></a> And so in this remarkable passage in Zechariah Jehovah says, "And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children and return".<a name=333:5></a> This is remarkable, dear brethren.<a name=333:6></a> It has a peculiar sort of application today, although not literally, because this is prophetic and we are not living in the age of prophecy in this sense; not that prophecy has not got light for us, nourishment and food for us, but it strictly belongs to the earth and God's purposes as regards the earth and this passage is included in that.<a name=333:7></a> The time is coming when the Jews, to be simple, will be sown.<a name=333:8></a> It does not say they sow themselves, nor does it say they are sown in a goodly position, but it is "among the peoples".<a name=333:9></a> God will proceed on these lines presently and we who are instructed in the scriptures and who know something about prophecy, which we should, everyone of us, we know something about the prophetic map, to use a familiar phrase, a good one; so that we can put our finger on the part of the earth that any prophecy alludes to, because it does certainly allude to the earth, and we can put our finger on any part of it to which prophecy may refer.<a name=333:10></a> But here the allusion is very general.<a name=333:11></a> "And I will

		The proposal is to look at salvation as it is presented in Titus, and to look at the passage in Matthew, which says, "But he that has endured to the end, <i>he</i> shall be saved"; that is to say, the need of salvation is stressed in these verses, and then in the well known chapter in James, what is stressed is the works of faith -- the doctrine of justification by faith is among the best known, and attested to in the scriptures; at the same time the doctrine of salvation by works is also attested to, in other words, works are needed.<a name=345:1></a> It is said in the last verse of the chapter, "For as the body without a spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead".<a name=345:2></a> It is hoped that it would be helpful to have our minds run over these scriptures together and see how plain on the one hand Titus is, and other passages, but especially in Ephesians and Romans, and then while stress should be laid on endurance of salvation, the passage read from Titus is very full and varied, especially in the verses we have mentioned -- "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which <i>we</i> had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour", notice the word Saviour both as to God and to the Lord.<a name=345:3></a> And then "having been justified by <i>his</i> grace", that is three great terms are introduced here -- the love of God, and the mercy of God, and the grace of God.<a name=345:4></a> These are outstanding words or terms, and introduced because of salvation, that by which we are saved.<a name=345:5></a> The three terms are noticeable, and then as over against these and others like them, in Ephesians

		I have read these two verses to speak of what they speak of, and that is fear.<a name=364:1></a> Fear is a great element.<a name=364:2></a> It is the beginning of wisdom, we are told.<a name=364:3></a> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the fear of the enemy is another matter, and that is more what is in mind.<a name=364:4></a> Abraham and David are taken up in these verses; taken up to some extent at least, because they are divine favourites.<a name=364:5></a> It may he said by some that all are favourites, and there is truth in that too; although we can clearly understand that there is a difference between a person saved so as by fire and saved by the activity of love.<a name=364:6></a> So heaven has its own way of denoting its favourites, and it would stimulate what leads to favouritism in this sense; favouritism to heaven.<a name=364:7></a> The best example I can get of favouritism of divine persons is the apostle Paul.<a name=364:8></a> There must be many not especially mentioned, but beginning the list, if one might mention it, is Enoch.<a name=364:9></a> He was not, we are told, for God took him.<a name=364:10></a> God did not take him because he was displeased with him in any sense.<a name=364:11></a> On the contrary he pleased God.<a name=364:12></a> He had this testimony that he pleased God before he was taken.<a name=364:13></a> And Noah may also be mentioned, but I have more now in mind to stress Abraham a good deal, because he is a family man.<a name=364:14></a> Hence, to be the heads of families is a great aspiration; not the least because it tests us to be heads of families, and the test brings out what there is of God in the head whoever he may be.<a name=364:15></a> Paul himself calls attention to the fact that among the ministers of the word of God there were not many fathers, Ten thousand instructors is a wide range as applied to the instructors as compared with fathers.<a name=364:16></a> He said there were not many; not 'not any' but there were 'not many'.<a name=364:17></a> So John speaks about fathers.<a name=364:18></a> "I write

		So I venture to speak of Abraham as a prominent person among the favourites of heaven.<a name=365:2></a> Others I might mention, such as David, such as Moses, a peculiar favourite, of whom it is said, "the form of Jehovah doth he behold".<a name=365:3></a> He would excel even prophets.<a name=365:4></a> Moses had a peculiar place, therefore, among the servants of God.<a name=365:5></a> "Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?<a name=365:6></a>" So that God is against all those who are against the favourites of heaven.<a name=365:7></a> Moses is regarded as a leading person in that sense and then David too, without coming into the New Testament.<a name=365:8></a> But I linger around this thought because I believe God is bent on bringing about favourites, heavenly favourites at the present time, such as He will have liberty in translating to heaven.<a name=365:9></a> Enoch is the great prototype of all of them.<a name=365:10></a> Before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God.<a name=365:11></a> I do not have anything to commend more to the youth here tonight than that they should seek to please God.<a name=365:12></a> And so with Abraham in this peculiar chapter.<a name=365:13></a> I say peculiar because it is the first chapter in which the word of God is formally presented.<a name=365:14></a> It is said here, "After these things the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision".<a name=365:15></a> It is the word of Jehovah.<a name=365:16></a> In having gone over favourites one has in mind the word of the Lord; not the commandment but the word; and Abraham is the first to have it presented to him.<a name=365:17></a> Therefore he is outstanding in that sense, and it came at a time before which he had been through trial.<a name=365:18></a> He had been through trial with his nephew Lot.<a name=365:19></a> Lot is a

		remarkable man, but his uncle brought him along as he was called out.<a name=366:1></a> Jehovah said He called him alone, but he brought Lot anyway.<a name=366:2></a> You might say, He was his nephew.<a name=366:3></a> Well, we have to be on our guard against our nephews or nieces.<a name=366:4></a> So the sequel showed that Abraham had good cause for regretting that he brought his nephew along with him.<a name=366:5></a> God had called him alone; and here Abraham is signalized as having been the first to whom the word of the Lord came.<a name=366:6></a> I mean formally, because the word of God was there at the outset from the time light shone.<a name=366:7></a> God spoke, we are told, and it was done.<a name=366:8></a> That was the word.<a name=366:9></a> He commanded and it stood fast.<a name=366:10></a> That is akin to the word.<a name=366:11></a> And then, "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine".<a name=366:12></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>.<a name=366:13></a> He commanded and spoke that light should shine out of darkness; but there is no formal reference to the word of Jehovah until this chapter.<a name=366:14></a> And it is quite significant that it should be in this chapter and that there should be a fear attached to it.<a name=366:15></a> Fear in the sense that we should not be affected by it.<a name=366:16></a> And what is in mind in speaking thus is the danger that fear may hamper us in our testimony; not the fear of the Lord, of course.<a name=366:17></a> That is the beginning of wisdom; but the fear of man; the fear of circumstances, the fear of hostility.<a name=366:18></a> Our testimony may be damaged by it, even the fear of physical harm; but especially circumstantial harm, such as might arise from personal circumstances.<a name=366:19></a> It is one of the greatest things that comes to many dear brethren, that we should be above the fear of man.<a name=366:20></a> "What can man do unto me?<a name=366:21></a>" it says.<a name=366:22></a>

		In reading these scriptures I have in mind to bring forward one who is a concrete example and expression in measure of Christianity, and in using the word Christianity I refer to what it is essentially; that is, in persons.<a name=379:1></a> It is not a mere system of teaching, but a system of ways and qualities in persons.<a name=379:2></a> It is, therefore, to be distinguished from all other religions -- I use the word 'religion' because it is in a sense a religion, in the sense of what is pure and what is in love.<a name=379:3></a> It has this distinction that it is expressed in qualities, in characters, in ways.<a name=379:4></a> I think it right to make these remarks at the outset so that we may all have in mind that we belong to what is to be taken account of in the sense of personalities, in the sense of persons; not merely of doctrines or principles but of persons.<a name=379:5></a> And, of course, persons come and go.<a name=379:6></a> We are told that one generation passes away and another comes, and as each one comes we have to take notice of the qualities that there are, and how much the Spirit of God has had to do with them, for this is the whole point -- what is effected by the Spirit of God.<a name=379:7></a> It is really a most wholesome and interesting study that Christianity is thus constituted -- not set up as, say, for one thousand years and the same people continuing on in it.<a name=379:8></a> There will be something like that in the millennium, and, of course, in the eternal state of things that is all that there will be.<a name=379:9></a> There will be no generations coming and going there.<a name=379:10></a> It will be a happy state of things in which love will find its rest; in which God will find His rest.<a name=379:11></a> But now we have the coming and going, and hence the constant exercises, for we cannot say that any two or any four or any great number of persons must be alike and

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have taken up Timothy because the Spirit of God has taken him up and because he was taken up in a crisis.<a name=380:11></a> Christianity is largely composed of crises.<a name=380:12></a> Some of us may pass through them without knowing they are there, but those who are with God know, and it is essential that we all should know what the nature of the crisis may be and why and whether we are contributing to it, or whether we are alleviating it.<a name=380:13></a> And so Timothy came in at a crisis.<a name=380:14></a> Indeed, he had a companion in service, a most likeable man.<a name=380:15></a> He is one of the best examples, we might say, of the early servants; a most likeable man; a most valuable man; that is, Barnabas, a man that was ennobled, I may say, knighted by the apostles.<a name=380:16></a> I use the word 'knighted' because it is a well understood title.<a name=380:17></a> It is a matter of title because of merit.<a name=380:18></a> Timothy was like Barnabas but Barnabas was older, more experienced.<a name=380:19></a> He had a great place with the apostles and used his influence too, to help others.<a name=380:20></a> That is another point I would seek to make, that whatever influence I have, not to hold it for myself or use it for myself but use it

		for others, to promote the spiritual growth of others.<a name=381:1></a> And so Barnabas took Paul to Jerusalem and introduced him to the apostles, and when there was a great servant needed he went and sought out Paul.<a name=381:2></a> He did not promote his own interests or offer his own nomination or promote it.<a name=381:3></a> He went to Tarsus and sought out Saul; not Paul yet but Saul, and he found him; not that he was hiding like his namesake of olden times, he was hidden among the stuff.<a name=381:4></a> That was Saul of David's time, or at least, of the time of the kings.<a name=381:5></a> He was the first king of Israel; he was hid among the stuff.<a name=381:6></a> It was no great recommendation for him to be king, for the idea of a king is the man that is able, and he needed to be able to overcome the Israelites' antagonists in those days, but he was hid among the stuff.<a name=381:7></a> But Saul of Tarsus was not hid among the stuff; not that he was in the front to promote his interests.<a name=381:8></a> He was away in Tarsus and that was all the more creditable, that Barnabas went afield to find Saul and he found him and brought him to the field where the work was going on.<a name=381:9></a> There he and Barnabas laboured for a year.<a name=381:10></a> I should like to have been a companion of Paul or Barnabas in those days.<a name=381:11></a> It was not my lot to know much of the earlier servants but I did know a little.<a name=381:12></a> It is a great advantage to know the servants of God.<a name=381:13></a> So it was that Paul and Barnabas toiled for a whole year in Antioch; that is, Antioch of Syria outside Israel.<a name=381:14></a> And they taught the assembly.<a name=381:15></a> The assembly needs teaching and they taught the assembly for a whole year.<a name=381:16></a> No doubt it was the basis of the usefulness later of the assembly at Antioch.<a name=381:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, having said that about Barnabas, he and Paul had a feeling between themselves.<a name=381:18></a> The word 'feeling' is used and, dear brethren, it is well that those of us, at any rate, who do any special service, should watch for feelings arising in our hearts toward each

		other.<a name=382:1></a> They are most baneful even if they be in a Paul or in a Peter or in a Barnabas.<a name=382:2></a> And they were separated; they separated from one another, and it was because Barnabas would have his nephew John Mark go with him in the service; whereas John Mark had left the work.<a name=382:3></a> He had gone into it and left it.<a name=382:4></a> He was restored, thank God, and so was Barnabas, but for a while they were divided and these things are written of them so that we might learn as in relation to our fellow-labourers and fellow-brethren so that we may have right feelings toward each other and have not any atom of adverse feeling or feeling of rivalry.<a name=382:5></a> And so it was that they were separated and Paul was left to labour with Silas as far as we see, but presently he found Timothy and the verses I read in chapter 16 are to show what a find it was.<a name=382:6></a> He was a young man whose father was a Greek; he had this disadvantage.<a name=382:7></a> His mother was a Jewess.<a name=382:8></a> There is something said about his grandmother too; something very worthy is said of her and it was a great advantage to Timothy that he had her as a grandmother.<a name=382:9></a> So he is spoken of thus and he was well spoken of among the brethren, which is another important matter if we are dealing with young brothers, as to what the brethren think of them.<a name=382:10></a> What is the brethren's estimate of them?<a name=382:11></a> Especially if they are to be used as he was -- a gifted man but a young man.<a name=382:12></a> He got his gifts from God but he got gift through Paul too; a remarkable thing.<a name=382:13></a> Gifts were in those days, in the rich times of the dispensation, through others; in Timothy's case by the laying on of Paul's hands, which would mean that he would leave some impression on this young man, and doubtless the young man would not be slow to take on what he saw in the elder brother, in the more able.<a name=382:14></a> But I am speaking now of him coming in in a crisis and filling up a gap, a void that had taken place, and that would have caused some weakness in the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		work in those parts were it not that Timothy was found.<a name=383:1></a> Paul found him and set him up.<a name=383:2></a> So I am speaking thus to young brothers and sisters that you are to be on the lookout for voids created, because there is always a danger in a void.<a name=383:3></a> Hence, if a brother or sister dies, if the Lord is pleased to take a brother or sister, we are told something about one baptised for the dead.<a name=383:4></a> It is an expression that we have to understand, which would mean that if a brother or a sister dies there may be a void, as I said.<a name=383:5></a> There may be a loss sustained in the service.<a name=383:6></a> And so each of us is to be on the alert to come forward and do what can be done, so that there may be no weakness caused by the departure of a brother or a sister.<a name=383:7></a> A departure, of course, is not their own doing -- departing to be with Christ.<a name=383:8></a> The Lord takes us one after another and how interesting all that is.<a name=383:9></a> One generation passes away, the Lord taking them, and another coming.<a name=383:10></a> Presently they will be taken and another one coming; but then the voids come in in those cases.<a name=383:11></a> One is taken out of Plainfield, one is taken out of Philadelphia, and one is taken out of Baltimore.<a name=383:12></a> There are voids created in the present generation, I may say, and we have to rush, as it were.<a name=383:13></a> Nature would do so in our bodies to meet a crisis and so it is that in the body of Christ there is, as it were, what would rush to meet the need.<a name=383:14></a> It is a question of life.<a name=383:15></a> That is, the void is to be filled out by what is living, because it is a question of the body of Christ and that requires what is living.<a name=383:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as I said, we have this and that one falling out, dying, as was remarked, but some departing, turning away as if they knew better than all that came into the assembly since Pentecost and they turn away; a most solemn thing.<a name=383:17></a> But then if they do turn away there is a void and the point is to fill that void; not with the one that left or one like him, because if he

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next thing is, as I said, how the thing is to be met, and so Timothy is the best example I can set out, or one of the best, and especially because he is a young man, and this passage contemplates him, as you might say, converted and well spoken of; not simply one foot in the meeting and the other out; he is well spoken of.<a name=384:5></a> He is a good brother already; he is worthy of mention.<a name=384:6></a> And so we have him in this passage, and Paul goes on with his work.<a name=384:7></a> There is no void, so to speak.<a name=384:8></a> That is what we find in chapter 16: "who had a good testimony of the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.<a name=384:9></a> Him would Paul have go forth with him, and took him and circumcised him".<a name=384:10></a> Notice he was not begging Timothy; he would have him; it was urgent according to the wording.<a name=384:11></a> He was to be Paul's companion.<a name=384:12></a> Well, that is enough to set us on our way in this inquiry, for we can visualize the great apostle in the height of his labours left by Barnabas and Barnabas' nephew, or cousin.<a name=384:13></a> And Paul finds Timothy.<a name=384:14></a> He would see a lovely picture; a lovely tiro; a young brother taken up and well spoken of by the brethren in the place and Paul would have him to go with him.<a name=384:15></a> What an honour -- a young man such as he, that he is honoured to be a companion of the great apostle Paul!<a name=384:16></a> Well, you can see that these are things to be sought after, to be desired, and if we seek after such an honour then there must be something else.<a name=384:17></a> There must be a purchasing to ourselves a good degree and much boldness in the faith.<a name=384:18></a> That is to say, one has to turn to himself and see what he is able to do and fill out what is needed.<a name=384:19></a> So that he is not a detriment to Paul nor to the company because it is said of Paul, "Paul and his company" as if God would

		Well now, the next thing I want to bring before you, this being so, is what Paul says of him in the great epistle to the Philippians.<a name=385:10></a> I am confining myself to the verses I read; there are others I could read only I tried to reduce the text as much as possible.<a name=385:11></a> I do not like to use too much scripture.<a name=385:12></a> A little of it goes a long way.<a name=385:13></a> Let scripture speak for itself.<a name=385:14></a> You do not want to read out yards of scripture, because scripture can do a lot in a little time and with a little of itself.<a name=385:15></a> So I read these verses one by one, and the second one is written to the Philippians.<a name=385:16></a> I need not comment on them.<a name=385:17></a> They are one of the most delightful circles of brethren that we have in the Scriptures.<a name=385:18></a> I scarcely put any before them.<a name=385:19></a> Their history is unique.<a name=385:20></a> But I am not going to be diverted by that, but Paul is writing to them.<a name=385:21></a> This is one of the letters that we spoke of today; one of the three letters that have a unique place in the scriptures.<a name=385:22></a> They are the finish; Paul's letters are the finish of scripture; in fact, he says so.<a name=385:23></a> He says in Colossians that God had given to him to complete the word of God and he did complete it.<a name=385:24></a> He completed the scope of scripture, and these three epistles -- first Ephesians, then Philippians and then Colossians are especially to be noted, as

		filling out the idea of scripture.<a name=386:1></a> This thought has come to mind, I might say, lately.<a name=386:2></a> I commend it to the brethren, that we must read everything from the standpoint of the epistles, especially the Pauline epistles.<a name=386:3></a> If you look into them you will see that Paul is asserting that what he has written is final; even the gospels are not final in the sense in which his letters are final.<a name=386:4></a> The gospels are, of course, more copious and luminous but not so final as Paul's letters.<a name=386:5></a>

		And so he is writing to these Philippians, and he is telling them about his beloved Timothy, and he does not hesitate to use the word 'beloved'.<a name=386:6></a> Paul had a beloved brother.<a name=386:7></a> I would conclude that at any time Paul would look around -- Is Timothy there?<a name=386:8></a> That is the way I feel about it.<a name=386:9></a> He would say, where is Timothy?<a name=386:10></a> That is the way I would understand that Paul would feel about this young man.<a name=386:11></a> How valuable he was; how useful he was.<a name=386:12></a> And so he says here (this is a good opportunity to speak about Timothy): "But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly", as if it were a great matter in his mind and calculations that his beloved Timothy should be sent to a certain company of Christians, and that company were the Philippians.<a name=386:13></a> And so the reading is, "But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly, that <i>I</i> also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on".<a name=386:14></a> You ask, Why did he say that?<a name=386:15></a> Why is he going to be comforted by sending Timothy?<a name=386:16></a> Timothy will not be with him when he is sent to the Philippians, but he will be comforted because the Philippians will be comforted.<a name=386:17></a> They needed the comfort more than Paul did and they get it in Timothy.<a name=386:18></a> That is what I want to point out, and I urge on the brethren to be able to comfort their brethren, old and young.<a name=386:19></a> How much comfort can we extend to our brethren, because that is what he says about Timothy.<a name=386:20></a> "That <i>I</i> also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on".<a name=386:21></a> He

		would be comforted because he would get the word from Timothy.<a name=387:1></a> I want to be like that.<a name=387:2></a> If I am going across to England as I hope to, I want to be like that; doing a little in the sense of comforting the brethren.<a name=387:3></a> They need it over there; they do indeed.<a name=387:4></a> You can hardly realise what our brethren have been through for the last five or six years.<a name=387:5></a> It is hard to keep from weeping at times according to what one saw and heard, and so the need of comfort.<a name=387:6></a> Therefore Paul says, "that <i>I</i> also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on".<a name=387:7></a> When I came back to America last December I found three brethren turning away from the meetings in New York.<a name=387:8></a> They did it themselves.<a name=387:9></a> They did not tell us why.<a name=387:10></a> Well, is that Christianity?<a name=387:11></a> It is not.<a name=387:12></a> Not that I am belittling the brethren.<a name=387:13></a> But I am telling you the truth.<a name=387:14></a> There is no Christianity in that; there is no comfort in it.<a name=387:15></a> Paul says, "that <i>I</i> also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on".<a name=387:16></a> That is to say, one knows, and Paul did know the state of the Philippians and they had a good reputation.<a name=387:17></a> We might say, you do not need to ask about the Philippians, but Paul needed to ask about them.<a name=387:18></a> That is what he was accustomed to do.<a name=387:19></a> When the Thessalonians were converted he says he was afraid that Satan would hinder them.<a name=387:20></a> Satan is ever ready to damage when there is a convert.<a name=387:21></a> Paul thus regards the Philippians.<a name=387:22></a> He was concerned, and so he would like to know their state and wanted Timothy to go and comfort them and bring back a report to comfort him, which he did.<a name=387:23></a> Then he goes on, "For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on".<a name=387:24></a> He says, "For <i>I</i> have no one".<a name=387:25></a> Why did he not say the Lord did not have another?<a name=387:26></a> But he did not say that; he is speaking of himself and Timothy -- the beautiful links that were between himself and Timothy; links which belong to Christianity, which ornament Christianity and are

		Well now, I go on to the next passage and that is <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4">1 Corinthians  4</a>.<a name=388:2></a> Now he is writing to the Corinthians and they were not the equals of the Philippians nor of the Ephesians nor even of the Colossians.<a name=388:3></a> I need not say a word to belittle the dear Corinthians, but the apostle says enough to enable us to judge there was a very, very low state there.<a name=388:4></a> And so Paul says, I cannot go myself but I am sending Timothy.<a name=388:5></a> If I could I would go myself just to show you what Christianity is and what it should be in your circumstances.<a name=388:6></a> And so I say this to this meeting here in Plainfield.<a name=388:7></a> I have to consider Plainfield as to what their Christianity is, and New York, and all the places where there are meetings.<a name=388:8></a> It is a question of the Christianity we are going on with, whether it has enough in itself to be a testimony to heaven and to earth.<a name=388:9></a> The Corinthians did not have that; they did not, indeed.<a name=388:10></a> Some of them were falling asleep; some were actually dying because of their conduct; a most solemn thing to have to say.<a name=388:11></a> "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep".<a name=388:12></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:30">1 Corinthians  11:30</a>.<a name=388:13></a> They did not all die; all the refractory ones did not die, thank God.<a name=388:14></a> No doubt they were held and recovered not only physically but spiritually too.<a name=388:15></a> But still they were dying.<a name=388:16></a> How terrible that was, and how sorrowful too; but it only reminds us of what we were saying today.<a name=388:17></a> It was a large assembly; it was a great result as to numbers, but numbers are not all.<a name=388:18></a> But yet the numbers came to something in Corinthians because the second epistle shows that great results in the way of recovery had taken place.<a name=388:19></a> The second letter is most encouraging.<a name=388:20></a> So happy was Paul about it that he says, I am speaking about you everywhere.<a name=388:21></a> In effect

		who in any sense are in his position and have gift and that is what he says.<a name=389:1></a> The restoring work of God had brought about such an effect in that assembly, and Paul says exultingly, I am speaking about you everywhere.<a name=389:2></a> You say, how do you know he said that?<a name=389:3></a> Well, I do know; You are in my heart, he said, and you are known and read of all men because of what is in my heart about you.<a name=389:4></a> I tell the brethren; I love to do it.<a name=389:5></a> At dinner tables or tea tables, I am sure it often came out in Paul's remarks.<a name=389:6></a> He would love you to go to Corinth.<a name=389:7></a> He would say, a great change has taken place there; and a great change had taken place.<a name=389:8></a> He says, there are others who have not judged themselves yet, but I am waiting until your obedience is entirely completed and then I will deal with them.<a name=389:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so here in our chapter 4 he says, "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ".<a name=389:10></a> See how he spoke of him again; how refreshed he would be as he thought of Timothy when he would write such letters as these to Corinth.<a name=389:11></a> "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ".<a name=389:12></a> Now notice, dear brethren, "of my ways".<a name=389:13></a> He could hardly say anything about their ways in any praiseworthy sense.<a name=389:14></a> He would say it at times: I do not praise you here -- I praise you here.<a name=389:15></a> That is the way he wrote to them, so careful he was and so fair too, in his judgment about them.<a name=389:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, here he says, "who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly".<a name=389:17></a> What I want to say about that is as to a brother like Timothy -- any of us ability and means to get about, whether he is able to correct conditions among the brethren and whether he
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=390>[Page 390]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is able to correct them authoritatively, to point out what is wrong and to show why he is saying it is wrong.<a name=390:1></a> These are the most important things I know of in brethren who minister and who go about among the saints, and whom Paul would, if he were here, entrust with messages.<a name=390:2></a> So that it is not as it is now, that a brother can go about and say what he likes.<a name=390:3></a> Pardon me, but there is a good deal of this.<a name=390:4></a> We are saying too much without consulting scripture.<a name=390:5></a> The apostle would not have sent Timothy to Corinth to correct Corinth and to show in Corinth what his ways were elsewhere if he did not count on Timothy going by scripture and giving scripture for everything.<a name=390:6></a> And so he sent Timothy, "who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ".<a name=390:7></a> It is not a question of Timothy's ways but Paul's ways; the one that Paul had entrusted with the truth.<a name=390:8></a> In fact, later we are told that Paul had committed the truth to Timothy to be entrusted to faithful men, able to instruct others also -- such confidence he had in him.<a name=390:9></a> Although a young man, he could rely on him to hold to the truth when he ministered as Paul ministered, because he would minister just as Paul did in a way.<a name=390:10></a> He and Timotheus and Silvanus preached the Son of God.<a name=390:11></a> I might venture to say that if I were there and could have, perhaps, three nights there, I might find Paul preaching the first night, Timotheus the second night, and Silvanus the third night and they would all preach the Son of God.<a name=390:12></a> They would all have the same points to insist on.<a name=390:13></a> There would be no divergence, no disunion in the ministry.<a name=390:14></a> Indeed, we are enjoined in Philippians to say the same thing; not only saying the same thing but thinking the same thing.<a name=390:15></a> That is the point in ministry.<a name=390:16></a> And so Paul would have every confidence that if he sent Timothy to Corinth, whatever came up, whatever matter might come up for discussion in a meeting in Corinth,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=391>[Page 391]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Timotheus would insist on the truth as taught by Paul.<a name=391:1></a> I can visualize the position, and I think it is right that we should visualize what Scripture presents to us so that we might realize the thing now and work it out now amongst each other.<a name=391:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So he says, "who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly".<a name=391:3></a> Not simply his ways, Paul's ways, but what he taught, what Paul taught everywhere in every church.<a name=391:4></a> That is, there is no divergence.<a name=391:5></a> His doctrines were always the same.<a name=391:6></a> I would say, of course, he would get new thoughts, but all would be in keeping with what he had before.<a name=391:7></a> It is quite right to have new thoughts.<a name=391:8></a> It is a characteristic of a Christian's ministry that it is fresh, but not necessarily different from what has been done before.<a name=391:9></a> I am stressing this.<a name=391:10></a> We do not need to go in for novelties in order to make our addresses important.<a name=391:11></a> There is nothing in that at all; nothing to be relied on either.<a name=391:12></a> It is a question of the truth.<a name=391:13></a> The thing must be according to truth.<a name=391:14></a> Paul speaks expressly of persons who love the truth, and love of the truth is, I might say, as important as love of the brethren; I would say, of more importance -- love of the truth.<a name=391:15></a> Well, Timothy could be trusted, as Paul would say, for this matter: Paul's ways in the truth as they are in Christ.<a name=391:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then Paul's words in his letter to Timothy himself; it is <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3">1 Timothy  3</a>and I will read it.<a name=391:17></a> "These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee more quickly".<a name=391:18></a> That is another thing with Paul.<a name=391:19></a> He was always holding out the thought that he would come.<a name=391:20></a> Sometimes he almost suggests that the Lord was coming.<a name=391:21></a> And, indeed, He does come; even if He does not come corporeally he comes into the assembly in the power of the Spirit.<a name=391:22></a> He comes Himself, too.<a name=391:23></a> So here he says, "These things I write to thee,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=392>[Page 392]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hoping to come to thee more quickly".<a name=392:1></a> I have often thought of Samuel.<a name=392:2></a> He went around everywhere; he had a circuit and you can understand if he were coming to a place they would have some fear about the great prophet Samuel.<a name=392:3></a> Indeed, they would fear when they heard that he was coming, and so here Paul says, "hoping to come to thee more quickly; but if I delay".<a name=392:4></a> He may delay and you may get weary of waiting as Saul did of Samuel.<a name=392:5></a> He got weary waiting for Samuel.<a name=392:6></a> But I do not want to get weary waiting for the Lord, or ministry either, because ministry will come if we are patient.<a name=392:7></a> It may come next year if it does not come this year, but the Lord is fresh and full and loving.<a name=392:8></a> He has plenty and deals it out to us, as we are told in the gospels, "Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus".<a name=392:9></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:46">Matthew  24:46</a>.<a name=392:10></a> To minister a portion of meat to the household; a ministry to the household of Christ.<a name=392:11></a> The Lord has great store set on that, and when He comes He will set us over all that He has if we are doing that.<a name=392:12></a> And so we have to be on our guard as to what the Lord finds us doing, as to whether we are serving the saints a portion of meat in due season.<a name=392:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul says, "but if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth".<a name=392:14></a> That is the last word I have to quote.<a name=392:15></a> It is a matter of waiting for the Lord to come.<a name=392:16></a> That is really what is meant.<a name=392:17></a> If he delay that you may know in the meantime how to behave yourself in the house of God, even Timothy.<a name=392:18></a> That is what the apostle meant -- that his beloved Timothy should not be misbehaving when the Lord came.<a name=392:19></a> We are apt to slip into misbehaviour, especially young people -- and old ones, too.<a name=392:20></a> The Lord is looking out; He is watching.<a name=392:21></a> "What I say to you
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say to all, Watch".<a name=393:1></a> He has a great lookout.<a name=393:2></a> The prophet Habakkuk says, "I will stand upon my watch", and he says, "though it tarry, wait for it; for it will surely come, it will not delay".<a name=393:3></a> That is a passage quoted two or three times in the New Testament.<a name=393:4></a> It is a word for us, that the Lord will come.<a name=393:5></a> "Yea, I come quickly".<a name=393:6></a> He means that, but we are to understand what He means by the words.<a name=393:7></a> It is eighteen hundred years now and yet it is true that He is coming quickly.<a name=393:8></a> I speak now to the young men and young women to behave in the meeting, to behave at the desk, to behave at the workshop, to behave in the house.<a name=393:9></a> "What I say to you I say to all, Watch".<a name=393:10></a> And then the apostle says here again, "but if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth".<a name=393:11></a> How serious it is to misbehave there.<a name=393:12></a> I have already pointed out that people died because they misbehaved.<a name=393:13></a> You say, that is serious.<a name=393:14></a> Well, it is serious.<a name=393:15></a> If they were Christians they went to heaven.<a name=393:16></a> It does not mean they were unbelievers; not at all.<a name=393:17></a> The application to unbelievers would be when the Lord comes, Anathema Maran-atha, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:22">1 Corinthians  16:22</a>.<a name=393:18></a> That is, a curse will be pronounced when the Lord comes.<a name=393:19></a> It is not while He is away; it is while He is away we may be taken to be with Him for misbehaviour, as 1 Corinthians tells us.<a name=393:20></a> I do not proceed further.<a name=393:21></a> May the Lord bless the word.<a name=393:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=404:1></a> We have here the idea of sons.<a name=404:2></a> The principle of the kingdom indicates that the sons are begotten of that principle, and hence the word of God is spoken of as sown, but here it is the persons themselves.<a name=404:3></a> They represent the brothers or sisters who believe, whom the Lord would have in mind for maintaining His testimony in the positions in which He would set them.<a name=404:4></a> Hence they would prove characteristic persons, whoever they were, selected and sown; serving and taking on all that relates to the Lord's affairs in the sense of the kingdom.<a name=404:5></a> So that if we are alive to the situation, we know that we can count on such in all emergencies, and know that the Lord's things will be cared for.<a name=404:6></a> The devil sowing his sons shews what will work in the opposite way.<a name=404:7></a> These two kinds are together, not in the assembly, but in the sense of physical contact, allowed to grow up and ultimately dealt with as we shall see.<a name=404:8></a> This gospel does not deal with us as being taken up, that is with the ascension, but as continuing and holding the ground; holding God's testimony, and the removal of whatever offends; it all eventuates in the millennium.<a name=404:9></a> These remarks will be intelligible because they come from Matthew, who does not deal with the ascension or the rapture; these are found elsewhere.<a name=404:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=405:4></a> That is right, what is implanted in our hearts; it is the word of God, and what we are as thus formed, and as serving the Lord in the kingdom.<a name=405:5></a> Therefore we are to look for such, each in certain positions, and as time went on they would be recognized as those locally "in each assembly", as <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:23">Acts  14:23</a> speaks of them.<a name=405:6></a> Paul and Barnabas chose elders, who would be set in the assemblies to rule.<a name=405:7></a> I give this as an illustration.<a name=405:8></a> In this town there are certain who are known as caring for the Lord's interests, and it is known throughout the world in the same way.<a name=405:9></a> His interests are not left.<a name=405:10></a> David left the sheep with a keeper; that is the idea.<a name=405:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=405:14></a> Well, the truth of the kingdom is seen in each gospel, and the same can be said of the epistles; each has its own particular view.<a name=405:15></a> Matthew gives this particular view; so scripture is seen fitting to scripture; we have to go to the epistles; hence Romans is formally said to be the kingdom of God, and teaching the fundamentals of the kingdom, with the gospels also, so Matthew ends with "And behold, <i>I</i> am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:20">Matthew  28:20</a>.<a name=405:16></a> So this particular parable contains the end of the age.<a name=405:17></a> The point to bring out is that the Lord would have His interests cared for, taught and governed too.<a name=405:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=406:5></a> Just so; when Paul went to Troas in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, there were seven brothers who accompanied him, "And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater son of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus", verse 4.<a name=406:6></a> In each position these men, who held Paul's doctrine, would hold the ground.<a name=406:7></a> Paul here discoursed as if there was something needed, something they had to learn before they could break bread, and so it is today.<a name=406:8></a> I feel that the breaking of bread is not well understood.<a name=406:9></a> Anyone wanting to know could have asked any one of these men.<a name=406:10></a> "Many lights" (verse 8) means spiritual lights, men who could teach.<a name=406:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=407:15></a> Yes; it is culpable, "while men slept"; it is a man who works by imitation, as the note suggests; hence the need of watching; there is no need to be an elder to watch.<a name=407:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=407:17></a> Paul speaks of such activities in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:29">Acts  20:29</a> - 30, and ends with, "Wherefore watch".<a name=407:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=462:1></a> We can see in chapter 2 how the Lord's supper has a place from the outset of the dispensation.<a name=462:2></a> It became the subject of division and controversy, as is well known, and, no doubt, the Spirit intended the truth governing it should have a place from the very earliest.<a name=462:3></a> It had a place with the Lord Himself before He died.<a name=462:4></a> Matthew, Mark and Luke all give records of it, but it did not become the subject of doctrine till the Lord went to heaven, and the Spirit having come, we are told after Peter's address, "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers.<a name=462:5></a> And fear was upon every soul, and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles' means.<a name=462:6></a> And all that believed were together, and had all things common, and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as any one might have need.<a name=462:7></a> And every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God", -- verses 42 to 46, so there is the proof that the Lord's supper is placed among the brethren, and according to chapter 20, had a steady place, not only in their doctrine and their faith, but in the celebration of it.<a name=462:8></a> It had become a sign of Christianity.<a name=462:9></a> It had a place in the minds of the brethren, that is, the celebration of it.<a name=462:10></a> We all know how desecrated the thought became through the idolatry of Rome, and still remains so; but the Lord has revived the truth, and since then there has been almost steady controversy, which still remains; but the Lord is helping the brethren, and this will continue till the end.<a name=462:11></a> Chapter 20 of this book,

		J.T.<a name=463:5></a> I think that some progress had thus been made, and this is still open to the saints; we may have certain thoughts as to it to get adjusted even now.<a name=463:6></a> Paul must have been impressed with that fact, seeing that he discoursed till midnight.<a name=463:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=463:10></a> Yes, that is quite appropriate, for the book of the Acts is progressive.<a name=463:11></a> Luke began his second treatise by saying "all things which Jesus <i>began</i> both to do and to teach"; that is, the Lord Jesus had not finished doing them, so that the second treatise completes the matter, and besides we have Paul's communication as to it in 1 Corinthians.<a name=463:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=464:1></a> Exactly.<a name=464:2></a> If Paul were here now he might have to correct some of the things that we say.<a name=464:3></a> They did not seem to meet by any definite arrangement at Troas, but it was all in accord with the systematic movements implied in verse 2, "And having passed through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse, he came to Greece"; whether the discourse was as to the Lord's supper, we cannot say; "And having spent three months there, a treacherous plot against him having been set on foot by the Jews, as he was going to sail to Syria, the resolution was <i>adopted</i> of returning through Macedonia".<a name=464:4></a> That word "adopted" refers to the administrative way in which the apostle moved.<a name=464:5></a> Then we have these seven brothers from Europe and Western Asia, which we had yesterday, "And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater son of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus".<a name=464:6></a> There was evident deliberateness centring in Paul.<a name=464:7></a> And further, "These going before waited for us in Troas; but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and we came to them to Troas in five days, where we spent seven days.<a name=464:8></a> And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, about to depart on the morrow".<a name=464:9></a> He was evidently moving in haste, yet with method, observing the time there might have been; so he remained seven days, then it says, "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, about to depart on the morrow.<a name=464:10></a> And he prolonged the discourse till midnight".<a name=464:11></a> It is quite clear things in his hands were spiritual and governed by right principles, for he was seven days there, and apparently seized the opportunity to celebrate the Lord's supper.<a name=464:12></a>
