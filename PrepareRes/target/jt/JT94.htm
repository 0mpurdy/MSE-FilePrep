		Tonight I should like to speak of Christ in relation to the kingdom, believing that <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>stands for the kingdom.<a name=7:1></a> So, beloved friends, I feel free to touch on the two passages in the Old Testament because the first one indicates what the king is like, what kind of person the king is, and the second indicates what the kingdom is for.<a name=7:2></a> And then in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>we get the kingdom enlarged in its reference to christians.<a name=7:3></a>

		Now, beloved friends, I think I have indicated what I should like to dwell upon by the Lord's help and one feels that one always carries the sympathies of God's people in speaking directly of Christ.<a name=7:4></a> David does speak of Christ.<a name=7:5></a> You will all remember that the passage begins "Now these be the last words of David".<a name=7:6></a> David was a wonderful speaker, a wonderful singer.<a name=7:7></a> He was said to be the sweet psalmist of Israel.<a name=7:8></a> He had wonderful things to say in his psalms; wonderful things to say about Christ.<a name=7:9></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>in an especial way indicates the substance of the Psalms in that respect; he gives an account of what is going on in his heart and of what he said concerning the king, and what he said was in perfect accord with what he thought.<a name=7:10></a> His thoughts and his words had Christ as their theme.<a name=7:11></a> He said "My heart is welling forth with a good matter".<a name=7:12></a> It was spontaneous, his heart welled forth with a good matter and his affections were stirred as he was led to see Christ, which he did; for all the men of faith saw Christ.<a name=7:13></a> David saw Christ and in occupation with Him he said, "My heart is welling forth with a good matter .<a name=7:14></a>.<a name=7:15></a>.<a name=7:16></a> my tongue is the pen of a ready writer".<a name=7:17></a> His tongue was in perfect keeping with his heart and his heart was full of Christ, and his heart welled forth with a good matter.<a name=7:18></a> It is not always with us that our hearts well forth with a good matter, for out of the heart of man everything proceeds which is

		corrupt and bad.<a name=8:1></a> A new source had entered into his heart and welled forth with a good matter and what he spoke about was the King.<a name=8:2></a> He says, "I speak of the things which I have made touching the king".<a name=8:3></a> Now that to my mind sets before us what you get from David, he was the sweet psalmist of Israel, he spoke of Christ, and he goes on to say, "My tongue is the pen of a ready writer".<a name=8:4></a> He then goes on to expatiate on the beauties of the King.<a name=8:5></a> That was what David was engaged with; therefore, when you come to his last words you may depend upon it that they are not in any way inferior to the words that marked him in his lifetime.<a name=8:6></a> As the psalmist he was engaged with Christ and he is going to speak his closing words, and what were they about?<a name=8:7></a> About the King.<a name=8:8></a> I take it that David was perfectly qualified to give an account of the King and it appears to me that christians should become acquainted with the King.<a name=8:9></a> David gives us an account of the King and he goes on to tell us what the King should be, not only from his own experiences, but from what Jehovah had told him.<a name=8:10></a> He says, "The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.<a name=8:11></a> The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me".<a name=8:12></a> What did He say?<a name=8:13></a> "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.<a name=8:14></a> And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds".<a name=8:15></a> Now you get not only David's personal estimate but God's conception of the King.<a name=8:16></a> He says, He must be just and must rule in the fear of God.<a name=8:17></a> I do not dwell on it -- my thought is simply to seek to indicate to you what the King is.<a name=8:18></a> I wish to engage you with Christ viewed as the King.<a name=8:19></a> The Lord is just and is the very embodiment of justice.<a name=8:20></a> He rules in God's fear and His rule is marked by infinite justice.<a name=8:21></a> I only bring that forward so as to encourage you to consider Christ as viewed as the King.<a name=8:22></a> You can come to Christ with the utmost confidence that He answers in every respect to God's King.<a name=8:23></a> David did not answer as he did not rule always in justice.<a name=8:24></a> There were very many discrepancies in his rule but there are no shortcomings with Christ.<a name=8:25></a> The Lord Jesus Christ answers perfectly to God's requirements

		I read these few verses mainly because they contain the voice of faith: On the one hand the voice Of God, and on the other hand the voice of faith.<a name=28:1></a> The voice of faith is first introduced in this chapter, but I suppose that before there can be the voice of faith, the voice of God must be heard in our souls.<a name=28:2></a> The Lord causes His voice to be heard in our souls to the intent that there should be an enunciation Of faith Godward.<a name=28:3></a> Now, if God speaks to us, He speaks very pointedly.<a name=28:4></a> Many seem to think that God is very indefinite, but those who have heard His voice testify that He is very direct and very pointed.<a name=28:5></a> He goes to the root Of the matter, and it is not at all likely that He should speak to you about things that are beyond you.<a name=28:6></a> It is more than likely that if God speaks to you, He will remind you of things that are immediate, that need calling attention to, things that are obviously of moment.<a name=28:7></a> That was the service the prophets rendered to the people.<a name=28:8></a> Their office was to call the attention of the people to certain things then existing, and it was essential that they should be noticed.<a name=28:9></a> Is that clear to you?<a name=28:10></a> "Have I hewed them by the prophets".<a name=28:11></a> That is a remarkable expression.<a name=28:12></a> The figure is that of hewing down trees.<a name=28:13></a> When we come to the Scriptures we find that the instrument by which God cuts is the word.<a name=28:14></a> "The word of God is quick and powerful .<a name=28:15></a>.<a name=28:16></a>.<a name=28:17></a> to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=28:18></a> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:12">Hebrews  4:12</a>, 13.<a name=28:19></a> In other words, if God speaks to your soul through a vessel, a prophet, your soul is brought into direct touch with God.<a name=28:20></a> The vessel is Of no importance in that respect.<a name=28:21></a> When God speaks to you, everything is exposed.<a name=28:22></a> The dissecting instrument Of God is so keen and so sharp that everything is rooted out.<a name=28:23></a> Let

		Now I wish to dwell for a moment on that, before I go on to the thought of Wisdom.<a name=35:6></a> I think it is exceedingly important to us who are interested in the gospel, to see that the one who is in charge of the preaching is also the anointed King.<a name=35:7></a> There are several preachers spoken of in the Old Testament, but I think that you will find that Solomon is the only one who is formally designated as "the Preacher"; and in introducing himself as the Preacher he tells us that he was also king -- not that the king was preacher, but that the preacher was king.<a name=35:8></a> In other words, the power vested in Christ as King or as Lord is to underlie the preaching.<a name=35:9></a> Hence you have universal preaching, because the power of Christ is of universal bearing.<a name=35:10></a> Exalted to God's right hand, Christ is in a position from whence He can affect any part of the earth below.<a name=35:11></a> He is in a position to carry out His designs in any part.<a name=35:12></a> So that the evangelist Mark, who presents to us Christ as the Preacher, tells us at the close of his gospel that Jesus sat at the right hand of God, and that His disciples went everywhere.<a name=35:13></a> They went "everywhere", which meant that every part of the earth was now at the disposal of Christ and His ministers.<a name=35:14></a> There were none who could stand in the way for the reason that Christ was on high, having all

		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>refers to what God found in Christ as having wrought out redemption.<a name=37:11></a> It is the celebration.<a name=37:12></a> It says, "A certain man made a great supper".<a name=37:13></a> The Lord had been discoursing in the Pharisee's house, and when one of the company said it was blessed to eat bread in God's kingdom, it gave the Lord the opportunity of unfolding the present gospel moment.<a name=37:14></a> He says -- "A certain man made a great supper and bade many: and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready".<a name=37:15></a> Now what do you think the Lord has in His mind?<a name=37:16></a> The Lord looked on to the moment when He should have accomplished redemption and in every way carried out the will of God in regard to sin; when He should have glorified God on the earth where God had been disowned by men.<a name=37:17></a> I do not know anything to compare with that passage from a gospel point of view.<a name=37:18></a> It implies that God is free, and that there is now nothing in the way.<a name=37:19></a> He has Christ out of death, righteousness is accomplished; and God celebrates it.<a name=37:20></a> It is a question of what He finds in Christ as He is now.<a name=37:21></a> Not what He was, but what He is as having accomplished redemption.<a name=37:22></a> It is as if God was saying,

		If you ponder that, it will convey to you the character of the present moment, and that is what is unfolded in the gospel that Christ is charged with.<a name=38:2></a> He is the Preacher as having accomplished redemption; and God has translated Him from earth to heaven.<a name=38:3></a> It was due to Christ that He should be translated; but according to the gospel of Mark, who presents the Preacher, He took His seat in heaven so as to superintend the gospel here upon earth.<a name=38:4></a> In Luke He is carried up, and as He is carried up His hands are extended in blessing.<a name=38:5></a> That is, we have a man up there whose hands are extended in blessing for humanity below.<a name=38:6></a> In John, He goes up on account of His people, He ascends to His Father and their Father.<a name=38:7></a> But in the gospel of Mark, He takes His seat in the place of power on high, and the preaching goes on everywhere.<a name=38:8></a>

		So in the 15th chapter the same is true, for the merriment is in the hearing of the elder brother who was in the field.<a name=39:15></a> It is therefore what men can take cognizance of.<a name=39:16></a> He heard it and he did not appreciate it, in spite of the fact that the Father appeals to him on the ground of relationship.<a name=39:17></a> He says, "It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found".<a name=39:18></a> That is, it was as if God was appealing to the Jew that he should rejoice in the return of the gentile.<a name=39:19></a>

		Well, I have referred to all that to indicate what is involved in the preaching.<a name=39:20></a> I wish now to say a word in regard to the way in which wisdom is evidenced in the preacher; and here again, Solomon is a type of the Lord Jesus.<a name=39:21></a>

		You will all recall how he sought wisdom.<a name=40:1></a> As made king, the one great desire of his heart was that he might be endowed with wisdom.<a name=40:2></a> Now wisdom is one of the most wonderful things that Scripture speaks of.<a name=40:3></a> Indeed we might say it is the only attribute that is personified.<a name=40:4></a> I need not refer you to the book of Proverbs, for we are all acquainted with chapter 8 in which Wisdom is personified.<a name=40:5></a> And as personified what we find is that Wisdom is intensely interested in men.<a name=40:6></a> I believe that is the great point in writing the chapter.<a name=40:7></a> Wisdom gives us its own history.<a name=40:8></a> It tells us it was with Jehovah "before his works of old" -- before anything was made; and it tells us moreover that it was by Him when everything was made.<a name=40:9></a> And then it goes on to say that it rejoiced in the habitable parts of God's earth.<a name=40:10></a> In that we see that Wisdom was engaged with humanity; and then it says, "My delights were with the sons of men".<a name=40:11></a> That shows that we all are subjects of Wisdom's interest; and the reason is that we are men -- that is what commends you to Wisdom.<a name=40:12></a>

		Now I wish to show you that what comes out in Solomon is ability to discern what is going on in the heart of each individual.<a name=40:13></a> As I said, he sought wisdom; and after he had received it he is put to the test.<a name=40:14></a> These two women present themselves before the king, and the question that was to be answered was -- did Solomon really possess wisdom?<a name=40:15></a> The result was the triumphant evidence that he possessed wisdom such as none had ever had before.<a name=40:16></a> I want you to note how it came to light.<a name=40:17></a> There were two women, and there was one child in dispute; there was the dead child and the living child; and the question was to whom the living child belonged.<a name=40:18></a> Now there may be one here tonight who is passing through exercise; you are wholly unable to settle it yourself, and no one can settle it for you.<a name=40:19></a> What I wish to impress upon you is that the Lord Jesus can; He is the Wisdom of God.<a name=40:20></a> It was that wisdom that came to light in Solomon's ability to discern the heart of a mother; it is capable of reading a mother's affections.<a name=40:21></a> Now, I think a mother bereft of her child is a type of humanity destitute.<a name=40:22></a> Now you may not think yourself destitute, but you are

	<div class="paragraph">
		Every true believer in Christ has been enlightened inwardly by the light of God, and by that light he has been enabled to take account of these circumstances, to look at death as it is upon humanity, at his own condition as it really is; and the moment that takes place in your heart, the Lord Jesus is engaged with you.<a name=41:7></a> This woman to whom the child really belonged is a type of a truly exercised soul.<a name=41:8></a> She yearns for her child, she was the true mother.<a name=41:9></a> Whatever else might be said about her she had the heart of a mother, and Solomon decided the case by showing that she truly owned the child because she yearned after it.<a name=41:10></a> But look at the other woman, the wicked woman.<a name=41:11></a> She had no mother's heart, she says -- "Divide it".<a name=41:12></a> That is not the heart of a mother; it is a wicked heart; and that is the heart of the unsaved who is under the domination of the wicked one.<a name=41:13></a> Satan is a murderer from the beginning, and all who are under his influence have the same spirit.<a name=41:14></a> I do not say that everyone is a murderer, but the spirit of the world is a murderous spirit.<a name=41:15></a> Now Solomon refers to this spirit and says, "So are the ways of everyone that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#1:19">Proverbs  1:19</a>.<a name=41:16></a> That is, the spirit of the world has no regard for human life.<a name=41:17></a> And so the woman who was not the mother of the living child did not have a mother's heart, the other did.<a name=41:18></a> And I bring it forward for the comfort of any one who may be exercised, who may have soul need.<a name=41:19></a> The Lord Jesus is interested in your soul, and He reads what is going on there.<a name=41:20></a> God's wisdom is evidenced in Him.<a name=41:21></a>

		this morning of such a scene that John records.<a name=42:1></a> John records for us the death of one of God's people, the death of a member of the divine family, and he shows how Christ was moved and how He wept at the graveside of Lazarus.<a name=42:2></a> But the death scene that Luke presents has no reference to the family of God.<a name=42:3></a> It has reference to man.<a name=42:4></a> That is, Luke is, an evangelist, and the evangelist is engaged with the race -- with men; engaged with them because they are men.<a name=42:5></a> Now it does not appear that the Lord ever knew this widow, nor does it appear that He knew the young man, whereas in the gospel of John, the Lord knew Mary and Martha and Lazarus.<a name=42:6></a> And in calling Lazarus out of the tomb, He called him by name; He says, "Lazarus, come forth", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:43">John  11:43</a>.<a name=42:7></a> Now here in contrast to that it says -- "When he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out".<a name=42:8></a> It was a man.<a name=42:9></a> The next thing we are told is that he was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.<a name=42:10></a> There is a point to take note of.<a name=42:11></a> What was it that elicited the Lord's sympathy?<a name=42:12></a> It was the widow's heart.<a name=42:13></a> The widow in Luke is a type of the race, and what elicits the sympathy of Christ is the need of the human heart.<a name=42:14></a> As found in the midst of humanity the scene draws out His sympathy on account of the widow.<a name=42:15></a> It says, "She was a widow".<a name=42:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the Lord touches the bier.<a name=42:17></a> In the case of Lazarus He simply said, "Lazarus, come forth".<a name=42:18></a> Here He says -- "Young man, I say unto thee, Arise".<a name=42:19></a> Apparently He did not know his name.<a name=42:20></a> The point was that he was a man.<a name=42:21></a> It is of no moment whether you regard yourself as known to Christ, or otherwise.<a name=42:22></a> If you have need in your heart, you belong to humanity, the Lord Jesus is set for your relief.<a name=42:23></a> And notice, He did not take the young man to Himself.<a name=42:24></a> If you think of Lazarus you will remember how the Lord said, "Loose him, and let him go".<a name=42:25></a> Now, what will Lazarus do?<a name=42:26></a> What will a member of the divine family do when he is released from death?<a name=42:27></a> Will he go back to his own relatives?<a name=42:28></a> No.<a name=42:29></a> Suppose you are released from death and let go, what will you do?<a name=42:30></a> The Lord gives you, as it were, an opportunity.<a name=42:31></a> Where will you go?<a name=42:32></a> Well, we are told that

		Much more might be said, for the gospel not only presents an object in Christ, but a range of things in connection with Him, even as we are told, the unsearchable riches of Christ.<a name=43:25></a> All that is bound up in the gospel.<a name=43:26></a> But for the moment I would press upon you how the Lord Jesus knows what is going on in your soul, and that He knows how to bring in the remedy.<a name=43:27></a>

		For a complete understanding of these Scriptures, it is essential that we should know something about the assembly.<a name=44:1></a> I have no doubt that the apostle Paul may be likened to David in his exercises: there was a point beyond which David's prayers did not extend, and I assume that Paul's prayers would end as he saw the assembly in heaven.<a name=44:2></a> It would be the great end of his exercises.<a name=44:3></a> What a man cherishes he desires, and what he desires he prays for, spiritually.<a name=44:4></a> Now David had a great conception of royalty and of rule.<a name=44:5></a> He is the man whom God took up to set forth that idea, and he had a great conception of it; his prayers were ended as he saw that Solomon had been provided by the Lord to be his successor, as he saw a man endued divinely with wisdom to occupy his throne, and as he saw that man in his throne fill it according to God, his prayers were ended.<a name=44:6></a> So that the great end of his exercises is seen in Solomon.<a name=44:7></a> I have no doubt, beloved friends, that the apostle Paul had such desires in regard to the assembly.<a name=44:8></a> In fact no one could read Ephesians without perceiving that.<a name=44:9></a> That was the great end, that the Lord Jesus who had appeared to him on the way to Damascus, the one man who filled his vision afterwards, should have a companion.<a name=44:10></a> It is the outcome of affection for Christ, that is the secret of all ministry.<a name=44:11></a> That Man became the controlling object of Paul's life, and as he saw the assembly afterwards in its beauty, his reproaches were unmeasured that he ever persecuted it.<a name=44:12></a> He had been exceedingly mad against it, and would have obliterated it, member by member; afterwards as he saw all these members as members of Christ in their beauty, his reproaches against himself were unmeasured.<a name=44:13></a> Thus, beloved friends, he saw to it that it was the great aim of his life to bring in every member -- to present every man perfect, that there should be nothing lacking; and I do not suppose that while the apostle was here he ever

		Well, as I was remarking, there are twenty years between the 28th and 30th chapters, and during all those twenty years God saw to it that there was one great end to be reached in that man's soul; that end was the house.<a name=57:15></a> Jacob had said, "If God will be with me .<a name=57:16></a>.<a name=57:17></a>.<a name=57:18></a> so that I come again to my father's house".<a name=57:19></a> Ah no!<a name=57:20></a> Jacob, it is not that, you left your father's house in disgrace, you are not going there; you may go there incidentally, but you are coming to Bethel now.<a name=57:21></a> Thus would God address him, for remember you may go into the world and make a name -- and you will suffer -- but God never withdraws His eyes from you <i>never</i>.<a name=57:22></a> He will follow you for years, and directly you are on the way back He will meet you.<a name=57:23></a> It is wonderful to be met by God!<a name=57:24></a> Two hosts met Jacob: what a reminder!<a name=57:25></a> But it was only the beginning of something much more wonderful, for in the same chapter we find that God meets him.<a name=57:26></a> All he has -- the result of the achievements of his life -- go over the brook, his wives, his cattle -- <i>they</i> are not going to the house of God, his cattle are not wanted there -- and he is left alone.<a name=57:27></a> He was no insignificant man, he was a man of means; but he was alone -- alone with a man who wrestled with him.<a name=57:28></a> The only thing I would emphasize in this connection is that in result Jacob said, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:26">Genesis  32:26</a>.<a name=57:29></a> Ah, he has reached it now!<a name=57:30></a> He wants the blessing now; he must have it.<a name=57:31></a> Mark, it was Jacob who said this, not the One who wrestled with him.<a name=57:32></a> He wanted to go -- it was the Lord Himself, and He wanted to go, but it was only in order to bring out what was in the heart of Jacob.<a name=57:33></a> The Lord has

		THE PERFECT SERVANT

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8:22">Mark  8:22</a> - 26
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What one specially sees about the evangelist Mark is a recovered servant -- a servant who had turned aside from the path and who was restored; as restored he is enabled by the Spirit to portray for us the service, walk, and ways of the perfect Servant.<a name=59:1></a> If you think of it in the divine ways of grace that God should honour a servant who had failed by allotting him such important work you can only say the grace of it is wonderful.<a name=59:2></a> Further, what is characteristic of his gospel is increase; with most of us there is a tendency to decrease and to retrogression.<a name=59:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#29">Numbers  29</a>which sets forth in figure the best period in the ways of God as to the earth -- the millennium -- we see that even that is characterized by decrease.<a name=59:4></a> Its brightest period is the beginning.<a name=59:5></a> The feast of tabernacles, the last great, feast is typical of the millennium, and we find in verse 13 of that chapter that the offering begins on the first day with thirteen bullocks, the second day twelve, the third day eleven, the fourth day ten, the fifth day nine, the sixth day eight and the seventh day seven.<a name=59:6></a> That is decrease!<a name=59:7></a> But a perfect number remains -- seven.<a name=59:8></a> The millennium is not typical of complete breakdown, but things are at their best in the beginning.<a name=59:9></a> This is a sad picture.<a name=59:10></a> The number, however, does not go below seven, and all the sacrifices that refer to the Lord Jesus remain.<a name=59:11></a> Mark is different from this.<a name=59:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew begins, when giving us the parable of the sower, with the best soil producing a hundred fold, then it decreases to sixty, and finally to thirty; whereas Mark begins with thirty and advances to sixty, and finally reaches a hundred.<a name=59:13></a> Mark increases.<a name=59:14></a> That is very encouraging for us.<a name=59:15></a> You should never allow the number to go below thirteen, which the feast in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#29">Numbers  29</a>begins with.<a name=59:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature Of his narrative is the sympathy present where the Lord is operating.<a name=60:4></a> For example -- a man "borne of four" (chapter 2).<a name=60:5></a> That man had sympathizers in his paralysis.<a name=60:6></a> There is plenty Of paralysis spiritually.<a name=60:7></a> I believe in gospel meetings and I love to have the Lord's people at them; they support me and give me their sympathy.<a name=60:8></a> In this chapter you find sympathy with this man who is blind; Mark says they "besought him", there was sympathy with the blind man.<a name=60:9></a> If you put a notice outside the door, that board has no sympathy, nor has the notice; but if you go and invite a man to hear the word he is impressed with your sympathy.<a name=60:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One great feature in Mark is that there is an air Of sympathy in the operating room (so to speak).<a name=60:11></a> It is one thing to carry on your labours surrounded by hostile critics and another thing to have sympathizers; the latter is what Mark gives us.<a name=60:12></a> Mark brings in houses.<a name=60:13></a> Households are places Of sympathy, places Of relationship marked by affections.<a name=60:14></a> In the house into which you are born there are relationships in which you are cared for.<a name=60:15></a> If you grow up in these you get the idea Of God's house.<a name=60:16></a> Relationships carry affections.<a name=60:17></a> Had the paralytic been carried by two it would have been an evidence that there was sympathy, but when there are four it indicates that there is sympathy everywhere; four signifies universality.<a name=60:18></a>

		If you do not want the Lord Jesus you are apt to turn your back on the Lord's people.<a name=60:19></a> If you have to attend a meeting you look for the end more than for the beginning; but let me tell you those christians are your friends, they are your only true friends; your unconverted relatives are not nearly such good friends as they.<a name=60:20></a> A christian relationship is the best.<a name=60:21></a>

		Now we come to chapter 5, a remarkable passage well known to many here; I have read it to bring out one principle, for it indicates how a man went to his house in power, carrying his bed, and in so going he glorified God.<a name=75:7></a> That is another matter; besides that he was sent there by the Lord Jesus.<a name=75:8></a> As if the Lord would say, 'I can commit myself to that man, he will represent me in his house'.<a name=75:9></a> It is incumbent on me to be righteous without being told to be; it is the normal result of righteousness in my soul.<a name=75:10></a> As I am sent to my house by the Lord, it is that I am to represent Him there, not only God in righteousness, but to represent Him as I take my place as head in my house.<a name=75:11></a> How remarkable, it is God's thought that there should be in the house not only the acknowledgment of what is right but the headship of Christ effected in the head of the house.<a name=75:12></a> This man was paralytic, he was a kind of head who had to be attended on, he never did anything for anyone, he could not, for he was without strength.<a name=75:13></a> He was a sinner in his house and therefore unrighteous: no unconverted man can be righteous before God.<a name=75:14></a> It does not appear either that he was specially marked by faith.<a name=75:15></a> If there are those here who think a person cannot be saved on the faith of others, I would call your attention to this chapter, "When he saw their faith".<a name=75:16></a> It is great encouragement to have faith about precious souls, especially about our children; one is encouraged to have faith because it says "When he saw their faith".<a name=75:17></a> I am not denying that the man had faith; he did have it, and the Lord forgave his sins.<a name=75:18></a> He also said, "Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house"; the Lord empowers him and then sends him to his house.<a name=75:19></a> Am I so in the dignity of the power of Christ bestowed on me that I can rightly represent Him in my house?<a name=75:20></a> For

		I desire to show that at the end of the days the divine thought is to bring about what is in keeping with the beginning of the days, that there should be a correspondence between those who are found at the end and those at the beginning; when I speak of the beginning I mean Christ, according to the principle of service which is found in Him: "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!<a name=125:2></a>", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:1">Isaiah  42:1</a>.<a name=125:3></a> God began with that, and He intends to end with that, and so I selected this passage to seek to develop how God will bring about at the end that which corresponds to what He began with.<a name=125:4></a>

		I have in mind to speak tonight on spiritual intelligence, having in view that it is one of the great essentials for believers to be spiritually intelligent.<a name=249:1></a> It will be observed by those who read Scripture that the Holy Spirit emphasizes the importance of spiritual intelligence throughout.<a name=249:2></a> The prophet Hosea speaks about God's people being destroyed for lack of knowledge.<a name=249:3></a> And then the same prophet, having spoken of the resurrection of the saints, says, "And we shall know".<a name=249:4></a> In that remark one is reminded of John's epistle which speaks in large measure on this subject.<a name=249:5></a> In it he says, "We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding".<a name=249:6></a> The Son of God has abolished death.<a name=249:7></a> Indeed the mark by which He was marked off as Son was the resurrection of the dead and He has given to us an understanding, "that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=249:8></a> He is the true God and eternal life", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=249:9></a> We might say that there is the culmination in the believer of all knowledge in so far as knowledge may be possessed by a finite being, the knowledge of the true God in a Man and the knowledge of eternal life in a Man.<a name=249:10></a> In speaking thus of John's epistle one is led to refer to the gospels for a moment.<a name=249:11></a> You will recall how in that passage in Hosea the prophet says "we shall know".<a name=249:12></a> As raised up, the saints come into the apprehension of the resurrection.<a name=249:13></a> We are not literally raised.<a name=249:14></a> It is by faith of the operation of God: He raised Him from the dead.<a name=249:15></a> As we are risen by faith of the resurrection the road is clear for knowledge.<a name=249:16></a> "We shall know, -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah".<a name=249:17></a> And so one is led to speak of the gospels because in them we have the presentation of knowledge, or rather we have everything presented from the divine point of view.<a name=249:18></a> It is true that we know in part.<a name=249:19></a> We do.<a name=249:20></a> But there is such a thing as seeing the parts put together.<a name=249:21></a> One bit is added to another and so

		In referring to the Book of Proverbs it may be of service that we should be reminded of the nature of the Old Testament and of the ministry of its early prophets, lest we should be in any way misled as to their apprehension of the truth.<a name=258:2></a> They did not know as much as we are prone to accredit them with.<a name=258:3></a> Peter tells us, "holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:21">2 Peter  1:21</a>), and that they "searched out; searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these.<a name=258:4></a> To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things, which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, which angels desire to look into", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:10">1 Peter  1:10</a> - 12.<a name=258:5></a> Mark you, these same things are now announced to you, and it is they that the prophets desired to look into; God revealed to them that the things they ministered were not for themselves, they were for us.<a name=258:6></a> It was the Holy Spirit by whom they spake, and so the things spoken were spoken anticipatively in view of Christ becoming flesh, the Son becoming flesh; and so this book anticipates the assembly.<a name=258:7></a> Not that the speaker could open up to you and tell you what this chapter meant.<a name=258:8></a> He could not.<a name=258:9></a> It was revealed to him that the things he ministered were for the future, even for us.<a name=258:10></a> And so he is made to enquire here by the Spirit, "Who can find a woman of worth?<a name=258:11></a>" The same writer in the book of Ecclesiastes says, "one man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all those have I not found", <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#7:28">Ecclesiastes  7:28</a>.<a name=258:12></a> Now, in a

		way, the book of Ecclesiastes does not require the woman, because it announces the preacher -- a preacher who speaks and writes, and the theme for the preacher is the man.<a name=259:1></a> If you have found a man you can preach.<a name=259:2></a> Thank God, preaching goes on in this world by many who have no knowledge of the assembly at all, but who have some knowledge of Christ.<a name=259:3></a> They can preach accordingly in fact, the preaching is about Christ.<a name=259:4></a> As it is said, "God's glad tidings .<a name=259:5></a>.<a name=259:6></a>.<a name=259:7></a> concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead) Jesus Christ our Lord", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:1">Romans  1:1</a> - 4.<a name=259:8></a> So that in the man we have the subject of the preaching, but then the book of Proverbs is the counterpart, really, of the book of Ecclesiastes and the more you become acquainted with Christ as the subject of the preaching the more will be the necessity for the woman to appear.<a name=259:9></a> For "it is not good", it says, "that Man should be alone".<a name=259:10></a> God brought the animals to Adam and among them there was not found one his like.<a name=259:11></a> Doubtless they exhibited remarkable variety of instinct and intelligence but there was not found one his like; and so God would provide her.<a name=259:12></a> And she must be his like.<a name=259:13></a>

		In reading this verse I wish to call attention to the thought of the inheritance.<a name=267:1></a> I hope to refer to other scriptures later on.<a name=267:2></a> I read this because it contains the Lord's opening words to Paul, and in that word He announces His thought of the inheritance and too, that it should be among the sanctified.<a name=267:3></a> One has a sense that many receive the light of the gospel and fall short of the thought of the inheritance, hence they do not find that compensation which the Lord intended they should, for that is a present position.<a name=267:4></a> We have in Colossians that the Father hath "made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:12">Colossians  1:12</a>.<a name=267:5></a> We need that portion, and I would suggest that there is that which is provisional for us, and that which is eternal, and what impresses me is that we largely miss what is provisional and that is a portion now of the inheritance.<a name=267:6></a> "Our inheritance", that which is peculiarly our own, is opened up to us in Ephesians, and of that inheritance we have but the earnest now.<a name=267:7></a> "In whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>, 14.<a name=267:8></a> I need not suggest that the earnest of a thing is not the thing itself.<a name=267:9></a> But then there is that which we have now, and that does not need an earnest.<a name=267:10></a> The inheritance of which we have an earnest is one which is peculiarly ours, and which is not shared by others; but then we come into an inheritance which others can share in, and in the meanwhile, so as to furnish us by the way we have this inheritance.<a name=267:11></a>

		What has chiefly occupied us during these meetings is what the assembly is to Christ.<a name=357:1></a> The most prominent feature is that the assembly should be the companion of Christ for eternity, as we see in Eve as a type, and then we have different features in other types, presenting the assembly as His companion in connection with the testimony.<a name=357:2></a> The way the truth of the assembly has been recovered means that it is the Lord's mind that these features should be found with us, so that he still may be able to "drink of the brook in the way".<a name=357:3></a> So we saw how the assembly in Philadelphia, although in weakness, corresponded to God's original thought, and how the Lord, as a result of the decline that had come in, must clothe Himself as a judge and in this manner walk in the midst of the seven assemblies, which refers to the whole professing body.<a name=357:4></a> From <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:16">1 Samuel  7:16</a> we saw in type how the Lord as judge examines the different features in the assembly, and yesterday we saw how the Lord in His love comes to us to receive that which He longs for.<a name=357:5></a> We see this especially at Bethany, and likewise in the local assemblies which were found in Tyre and Caesarea (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#21">Acts  21</a>).<a name=357:6></a> We considered Caesarea, where Philip the evangelist lived.<a name=357:7></a> An evangelical feature came out in the assembly at Caesarea, and the Lord desires in these last days to awaken our interest in the gospel.<a name=357:8></a> Particular memories are linked together in this meeting in Caesarea.<a name=357:9></a> It was there that the gentiles were first received through Peter (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>) and in chapter 21 we read that Philip had four daughters who were virgins and prophesied.<a name=357:10></a> Then it mentions that the prophet Agabus came there, so we find in this place two very important features of the Spirit's operations in the assembly, namely, an evangelical spirit and a prophetic spirit.<a name=357:11></a> There came out in the assembly in Caesarea a very important side of the assembly's place in the testimony down here.<a name=357:12></a> Last evening

		Before we go on to our subject of the Lord's supper, I would like to ask if we can say the candlestick remains, although the Lord spoke in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:5">Revelation  2:5</a> about removing it out of its place.<a name=358:2></a> Does the Lord walk now in the midst of the seven candlesticks?<a name=358:3></a> I believe that what the Lord says of the candlestick in the letter to Ephesus involves that it is now taken away.<a name=358:4></a> It would be removed out of its place if they did not repent, but we have no further allusion to it; therefore I think that the assembly is no longer recognized as a public testimony for God.<a name=358:5></a> This position was lost in Thyatira.<a name=358:6></a> Since that time only a remnant is recognized and the testimony is thereafter linked with a remnant.<a name=358:7></a> Although this remnant ought to be characterized by the features which marked the assembly at the beginning, yet it cannot claim to be the assembly as originally presented.<a name=358:8></a>

		But instead of being occupied with His suffering, the Lord had the disciples in the thoughts of His heart.<a name=360:11></a> He said, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you".<a name=360:12></a>

		It was not just that it was usual for a Jew to eat the passover at this time, as the Lord said this, but because the Lord wished to eat this passover supper <i>with them</i>.<a name=360:13></a> I believe that the Holy Spirit in Luke's gospel emphasises the great place the saints had in the Lord's heart as He gave them the Supper.<a name=360:14></a> Therefore He says, "This is my body which is given for you".<a name=360:15></a> In Matthew He says only, "This is my body".<a name=360:16></a> He does not add there, "which is given for you", neither do we get there the thought of remembrance; thus I believe that Luke in his gospel especially has Paul's ministry in view.<a name=360:17></a> Paul says that he had received the Supper from the Lord.<a name=360:18></a> His ministry was not for the Jewish remnant, but for the assembly, and so we have the inauguration of the Lord's supper in Luke's gospel, and the Lord's own feelings in connection with it mentioned.<a name=360:19></a>

		Yes.<a name=367:15></a> How serious it is that this party spirit should come out as they were gathered together.<a name=367:16></a> The state of christendom is only an extension of this, and many of the people of God think that such conditions are unavoidable.<a name=367:17></a> It is therefore of special importance that we judge all party thoughts, because sect conditions can exist without any public break being apparent.<a name=367:18></a> There was no public break in Corinth, and it is because of this the apostle speaks of parties among them.<a name=367:19></a> He says, "When ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit to it.<a name=367:20></a> For there must also be sects among you, that the approved may become manifest among you".<a name=367:21></a>

		of Mary are available to the Lord, and so, as I said, if one comes into a locality, one of the most important of questions that comes up in one's mind is what ear there is It enters into what I may call 'local furnishings', of which chapters 10 and 11 of Luke deal.<a name=415:1></a> You will observe that in the earlier part of chapter 10 the Lord had sent out seventy, two by two, into every city and place to which He was about to come.<a name=415:2></a> He was about to come to one city after another, and one place after another, but ere coming or visiting these places, He sent seventy out, thirty-five pairs of men representative of Himself, into these cities; so that as He came into any of these cities or places, He would look for results of the previous ministry.<a name=415:3></a> Has the previous ministry satisfied you?<a name=415:4></a> Are you content with what you have got or are you prepared for more?<a name=415:5></a> He comes into a certain village as we have here and a certain woman received Him into her house; her house is available.<a name=415:6></a> We may thank God for that, but your house is not so important to the Lord as your ear.<a name=415:7></a> If one had all the money of a millionaire, one's money would not be as valuable to Christ as one's ear.<a name=415:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What He seeks is one's ear, and so whilst He entered into the house of Martha, He found as He entered it that she did not hear.<a name=415:9></a> Her ear was not available to Him, but over against her is her sister, Mary, and it says she sat at His feet and was listening to His word.<a name=415:10></a> I can understand Mary considering what may have come to her during the visit of two of these seventy men, if indeed they came to Bethany.<a name=415:11></a> I suppose the thought is that Bethany is a representative village and I can understand how Mary would go over the things that she heard from these two, precious things, doubtless; they could have told her much about Christ, but now He has come Himself.<a name=415:12></a> He has come Himself, beloved.<a name=415:13></a> At the present time, the Lord Jesus is speaking to His people; it is what marks the dispensation, as the apostle, the writer of the Hebrews says, "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son".<a name=415:14></a> The Son is the speaker and He continues to speak to us -- it is a wonderful time, the present time.<a name=415:15></a>

		I am now seeking to exercise our hearts, not simply to hear ministry but to hear Christ, because if the voice of Christ is not recognisable, then it is not ministry from Christ.<a name=416:1></a> It is a question of hearing what He has to say.<a name=416:2></a> Peter says, "Going he preached".<a name=416:3></a> See the immense link backward.<a name=416:4></a> He went and preached to the spirits now in prison which were sometime disobedient in the days of Noah.<a name=416:5></a> Coming He has preached.<a name=416:6></a> He has come to us gentiles.<a name=416:7></a> He has preached the glad tidings of peace to those that are afar off and those that are nigh.<a name=416:8></a> It is the ministry of Christ and it is a question of how you hear -- whether you are looking for His voice or whether you are simply occupied with some person or persons whom He may be using.<a name=416:9></a> The Corinthians were occupied with the ministers -- they were setting one over against another, whereas a truly exercised ear is listening for Christ.<a name=416:10></a>

		And so, as I said, Mary was sitting down; she was restful, she sat at His feet and was listening to what He was saying -- listening to His word.<a name=416:11></a> And oh, what a fountain there is, beloved, of divine thoughts in the heart of Christ!<a name=416:12></a> He has many mouths through which He speaks now, but He speaks.<a name=416:13></a> The ministry is His.<a name=416:14></a> The apostle Paul spoke of himself -- and others -- as new covenant ministers, that means that he was employed by Christ.<a name=416:15></a> He was taken into the service, but the ministry was Christ's -- the ministry is Christ's.<a name=416:16></a> It is a question of disclosure of what is in His mind.<a name=416:17></a> She was listening to His word.<a name=416:18></a>

		Well, now, in closing I do not enlarge on what He said to Martha, but I would just remind you of another word later in this gospel, in chapter 19, where the Lord has been speaking to Zacchaeus, pointing out that He was a son of Abraham, and it says, "As they were listening to these things, he added and spake a parable".<a name=416:19></a> There you have another touch -- that is, if there is continuity of attention to Christ, He will add.<a name=416:20></a> How much there is before us, and what I have in mind is the availability of our ears, how we hear.<a name=416:21></a> And then the ministry will be added to as hearing and interest as to what the Lord is saying at the present time to the assembly are sustained.<a name=416:22></a> May God bless the thoughts to us.<a name=416:23></a>

		I wish to speak this evening about representation.<a name=417:1></a> God intends to be represented, and I apprehend that the gospel of John has this specially in view.<a name=417:2></a> Coming in, as it does, at the end, it brings about life.<a name=417:3></a> It brings in conditions of life, for God is the living God, and therefore He must be represented by those, and by those only, who are living.<a name=417:4></a> So that in order to have the idea of representation, which is conveyed in the word "image", we must have first the idea of likeness.<a name=417:5></a> It is said in the first chapter of Genesis that God created man in His image, but in the fifth chapter it is said: "In the likeness of God made he him".<a name=417:6></a> This comes in, as you all remember, after the dark history recorded in the fourth chapter, a chapter full of disaster.<a name=417:7></a> It is a chapter in which, after the death of Abel, you look in vain until Seth appears for any person qualified to represent God.<a name=417:8></a> But on the birth of Seth, who himself became the father of Enos, we have the element of recovery, for in naming his son Enos, Seth indicated that he had light.<a name=417:9></a> He discerned that his son was born to die; that he was a failing mortal man as the name given indicates.<a name=417:10></a> And so it is said that men then began to call on the name of the Lord.<a name=417:11></a> "The name of the Lord" -- what did that mean in those days?<a name=417:12></a> It meant what it means now, only that now we have it in a fuller way.<a name=417:13></a> It meant in those days that God had come in and met in grace the situation that Adam and Eve had created by their disobedience.<a name=417:14></a> God had come out and He had provided a covering, or clothing, and in the light of that Adam calls his wife's name Eve, meaning that she was the mother, not of all <i>dying</i>, but of all <i>living</i>.<a name=417:15></a> Light had come into his soul, obviously, and he saw that there should be a living line, so that as men began to call on the name of the Lord they would have in mind how He had come in for Adam, and for Eve.<a name=417:16></a>

		God had said to Adam: "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:17">Genesis  2:17</a>.<a name=418:14></a> Seth said, in effect: 'I own that'; and so men called on the name of the Lord.<a name=418:15></a> It is indeed what the gospel announces at the present time, that death is passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.<a name=418:16></a> But the name of the Lord involves that God has found a means whereby men may live and not die, so that Enoch, who is said to be the seventh from Adam, lived.<a name=418:17></a>

		Well now, I have said all that chiefly because I wish to point out the danger of undue haste, especially in young people, catching up things and not going the whole way; not waiting patiently for the development of light that has come into one's own soul.<a name=422:8></a> So I come now for a moment to the passage I read, and the Lord puts things on a very high basis.<a name=422:9></a> He says: "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=422:10></a> You will observe here there is no official title.<a name=422:11></a>.<a name=422:12></a> The person who has the greatest light is a woman, and those who are to represent the Lord, as He represented the Father, are not said to be apostles, but just disciples; but what kind of disciples are they?<a name=422:13></a> There are classes of disciples in Scripture.<a name=422:14></a> These are disciples who have light in their souls about their relation with Christ as His brethren.<a name=422:15></a> They belong to Him, and they are the brethren of a Man who is ascending into heaven, the Son of God; His Father is their Father, His God is their God.<a name=422:16></a> He has just spoken to them, shown them His hands and His side, and spoken peace to them.<a name=422:17></a> You say: is that all?<a name=422:18></a> No, not at all; all that is light and precious light, but light in itself is not enough, however great.<a name=422:19></a> We must have life.<a name=422:20></a> And so, having said these things, "He breathed into them"; a most intimate transaction, and He says: "Receive the Holy Spirit".<a name=422:21></a> As if to say: 'You must have My Spirit if you are to represent Me, and you must be like Me before you can be My image'.<a name=422:22></a> Likeness is in nature, and the image is consequent upon that.<a name=422:23></a> We are to be the representatives of Christ, as like

		Now, having said all that about the passage in John, I want to show the confirmation of it in the Old Testament.<a name=423:2></a> I always find it effective to see confirmations, and amplifications indeed, of New Testament statements in the Old Testament.<a name=423:3></a> It is thus that we have things new and old combined.<a name=423:4></a> And so in Jacob you have a remarkable exemplification of the principle of representation in life.<a name=423:5></a> I understand that Jacob represents in the Old Testament a believer in the development of life.<a name=423:6></a> What marks one in whom God has begun a work, according to John's gospel, is that he begins to disallow the flesh, and so Jacob in his infancy, we are told, took hold of Esau by the heel; that is, he was a supplanter of the man born after the flesh.<a name=423:7></a> And then again he wrestled with God and he prevailed.<a name=423:8></a> He is marked on the one hand by the endeavour to set aside the man born after the flesh, and on the other by energy with God.<a name=423:9></a> He prevailed over the angel, it says, and he wrestled in his strength; he wrestled with God.<a name=423:10></a> He is a representative thus of the believer in the energy of life.<a name=423:11></a> He would have blessing.<a name=423:12></a> He says: "I will not let thee go except thou bless me", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:26">Genesis  32:26</a>.<a name=423:13></a> I do not know of anything finer than that in the way of energy.<a name=423:14></a> God respects it, so Jacob got the blessing, and he is now in a position, at the close of his life, to represent God, for we have to view Jacob as typifying the believer, and as also typifying the Lord Jesus Christ as representative of God.<a name=423:15></a> So, relatively, with every one of us as we come into the full development of life -- in the possession of it consciously -- we are qualified to represent God.<a name=423:16></a> I want to dwell on Jacob because it is a unique passage, and he was an old man come to the end of his time on earth.<a name=423:17></a> He was already sick, as it says, and Joseph came to him, and it says as Jacob heard of Joseph's arrival that he strengthened himself and sat up.<a name=423:18></a> You see the energy of life as he is about to die naturally; he strengthened himself and he sat up.<a name=423:19></a> It does not say he was supported by anybody as an invalid would be, because the Spirit of God causes it to stand out, in its greatness, the energy of spiritual life,

		J.T.<a name=428:5></a> I think so.<a name=428:6></a> The star is what is outside; it is the testimony of the heavens whereas the Spirit on earth is implied in the man bearing a pitcher of water; so you follow him.<a name=428:7></a> It is most interesting to see in Matthew how the first house mentioned suggests that the Lord is cared for -- "the little child with Mary his mother".<a name=428:8></a> It is not that personally He needs care now, for He cares for all things.<a name=428:9></a> He created everything; He upholdeth all things by the word of His power.<a name=428:10></a> But in regard to His interests on earth He is cared for, and it is the concern of every christian that He is cared for, and that His rights are looked after, and that conditions are suitable to Him.<a name=428:11></a> So in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2">Matthew  2</a>emphasis is laid on the mother, "the little child and his mother".<a name=428:12></a> He was then a little Child, our Lord Jesus, and He was in the care of one who was best suited for the service, His mother; but He is always mentioned before His mother.<a name=428:13></a> It is not the mother and the little Child, but "the little child and his mother".<a name=428:14></a> The mother served Him and cared for Him.<a name=428:15></a> So that these wise men are set up in Matthew as a model for us; they are governed by the light that they had, and when the star stood over the place where the little Child was they rejoiced with great joy.<a name=428:16></a> Then they came into the house, and when they came in they worshipped Him.<a name=428:17></a> I think that is a suggestion that the Spirit of God would expand and work out later in a spiritual way.<a name=428:18></a> It is mentioned in the very beginning so that we may understand what God values.<a name=428:19></a> It is not a mere historical incident, but an incident of great value to heaven, and God intends that it should be reached in a spiritual way.<a name=428:20></a>

		My exercise, dear brethren, in reading these scriptures is that the Lord may help us so that through what is said we may become more spiritual.<a name=441:1></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:46">1 Corinthians  15:46</a> that that which is spiritual was not first, but that which is natural, and <i>afterward</i> that which is spiritual.<a name=441:2></a> What is referred to is what is now established in our Lord Jesus Christ as risen up from among the dead and ascended up into heaven, therefore the "afterward" spoken of in the passage I referred to is now in effect.<a name=441:3></a> The spiritual order of things has come to pass and has supplanted the natural order.<a name=441:4></a> Our Lord Jesus Christ came into the natural and recognised it.<a name=441:5></a> "He came unto his own", as we are told, and as in the midst of His own after the flesh He recognised all that entered into that legitimately.<a name=441:6></a> But then there came a time in His ministry in which He said to His mother, when she intimated that she knew something which He did not know: "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=441:7></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:4">John  2:4</a>.<a name=441:8></a> He announced in that remark to His mother that as His own had rejected Him He was now entering upon the spiritual order of things, and in that order of things the natural was superseded.<a name=441:9></a> It is the sense I have, dear brethren, that with us there is the need of being reminded of these facts, that has led me to read these scriptures, because it is God's thought that we should be brought into what is spiritual, and that we should be in it intelligently as judging the relative superiority of the spiritual to the natural.<a name=441:10></a>

		Well now, from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>I just wanted to show that being on Olivet with the Lord, as ascended into heaven, enabled the disciples to act on the words of these private communications.<a name=447:2></a> They were not deceived.<a name=447:3></a> The first communication is, "Take heed lest any man deceive you".<a name=447:4></a> You know the world around us is saturated with the lie.<a name=447:5></a> Every 'ism that springs up is based on a lie.<a name=447:6></a> One knows the sources of some of the most potent of them, but all are based on lies.<a name=447:7></a> So the word of the Lord is: "Take heed lest any man deceive you".<a name=447:8></a> Let us be on our guard against deceptions.<a name=447:9></a> Many lie in wait to deceive.<a name=447:10></a> As they went back to the city of Jerusalem they were not deceived.<a name=447:11></a> They did not go to the structure which the Lord said would be thrown down.<a name=447:12></a> I quite admit that they went later, but that is in connection with another line of things.<a name=447:13></a> They did not go to the temple for their associations; they went to it in testimony, for God in patience bore long with the Jewish system.<a name=447:14></a> As coming from Olivet to Jerusalem, instead of going to the temple, they went to the upper room, and here there is light for anyone seeking it.<a name=447:15></a> If you have come to the recognition of the Spirit you will not go to any of those imposing structures; you will seek the upper room.<a name=447:16></a> But then it is not simply the upper room!<a name=447:17></a> We need more than the room; we need the people who are in the room.<a name=447:18></a> Who are they?<a name=447:19></a> "Where were staying both Peter, and John, and James", and all the apostles.<a name=447:20></a> Well, you say, there are none of these now!<a name=447:21></a> No, quite true, but their doctrine remains, and what you look for in the upper room is their doctrine, their testimony.<a name=447:22></a> The apostles represented the authority of Christ, and as you recognise the Spirit, as you come under His influence, you will seek the upper room where those are who recognise the authority of the Lord; you will not go elsewhere.<a name=447:23></a> I am not theorising, I am speaking of what I know exists.<a name=447:24></a> I know that of which I am speaking exists at the present time.<a name=447:25></a> There is the upper room and there are those in it who respect the authority of Christ; moreover, the women are there, including the mother of the Lord,

		Well, I read the two passages in judges to point out that in a day of brokenness, such as the book of judges depicts, we have the idea of divine visitations.<a name=448:19></a> These things are written for our learning, as we read, and the book of Judges shows a state of things such as we have to do with, and notwithstanding the brokenness there are divine visitations.<a name=448:20></a> As the Lord says: "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>.<a name=448:21></a> You see there that He promises manifestations to those who keep His commandments, who love Him, and so He comes to Gideon who was amongst those who loved Him and kept

		Now I want to show you, just for a moment, with what beautiful intelligence Gideon comes out with his present.<a name=449:9></a> "Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it".<a name=449:10></a> How delightful to heaven all that was!<a name=449:11></a> Then the angel directs Gideon, and as he touches it with his staff the fire goes out of the rock and consumes the offering.<a name=449:12></a> What was all that for, beloved?<a name=449:13></a> It was to impress Gideon with what is spiritual.<a name=449:14></a> It was a spiritual matter; it was intended to form him and fortify him for the divine warfare which was ahead of him.<a name=449:15></a> "We wrestle not against flesh and blood", as we read, "but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:12">Ephesians  6:12</a>.<a name=449:16></a> And so we are to understand what it is to be spiritual to meet all these things.<a name=449:17></a> Gideon has this wonderful visitation, and then he saw the angel no more.<a name=449:18></a> It does not say here that the angel ascended to heaven, but when we come to chapter 13 we have a fuller thought.<a name=449:19></a> There is not time to go into it beyond calling attention to the fact that the angel "did wondrously", and doing wondrously he would impress Manoah and his wife with what is spiritually wonderful.<a name=449:20></a> And so at the present time

		J.T.<a name=458:1></a> In chapter 6 we have a divine appearing.<a name=458:2></a> The angel of God came to Ophrah and sat under an oak and then appeared to Gideon as he threshed wheat in the winepress, and said to him, "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour" -- God always gives us a record of the feature He is pleased to regard, or able to record in any person or locality.<a name=458:3></a> He takes account of willingness and comforts those who are thus engaged by appearing to them.<a name=458:4></a>

		This book links up with the springs spoken of in chapter 1, and is parallel with John's gospel, in which the ideas of springs and of divine appearings are emphasised.<a name=458:5></a> Springs are for the energy of life.<a name=458:6></a> Appearings obtain for us that our energies should be according to God.<a name=458:7></a> The impressions of appearings should characterise us so that what is of God is maintained here.<a name=458:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 6 deals with Gideon, one who was to be immediately used, but this chapter treats of an appearing to the parents of a man to be used later, and therefore bears somewhat on the households of the people of God.<a name=458:9></a> Households and parentage necessarily have in view the continuation of the testimony of God.<a name=458:10></a> Children have always been regarded, potentially at least, as eligible for the testimony, and, in order that they should come into it, it is important that parents should have divine impressions, and divine impressions are by divine appearings, because the main idea in parentage is to pass on things.<a name=458:11></a> The great representative parent, Abraham, is one who had an appearing.<a name=458:12></a> He represents in Scripture the idea of a father.<a name=458:13></a> It is a primary thought that God would have passed on from generation to generation.<a name=458:14></a> The true idea of fatherhood is in Himself, but Abraham is said to have commanded his children after him, and in order to secure that he dwells in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise, so that his own interests would be passed on to his children, not only

		to Isaac but to Jacob.<a name=459:1></a> So I thought this chapter would help us in regard to household responsibility, with a view to the testimony being continued, so that what is in our hands should not deteriorate as we pass on, but be enhanced; every appearing is intended to increase our spiritual power.<a name=459:2></a>

		Ques.<a name=459:3></a> Are the manifestations in John's gospel on similar lines?<a name=459:4></a> The Lord says "He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him", and further, "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>, 23.<a name=459:5></a> He comes to such a one.<a name=459:6></a> There is a manifestation, a devotedness of affection.<a name=459:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=459:20></a> I think they are essential to bearing a divine impression.<a name=459:21></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>gives us a record of six distinct manifestations of Christ after He arose; there were more than that if we compare the ends of the gospels and the beginning of Acts, but in that record we have six, and I think the number given is intended to be constructive.<a name=459:22></a> First He appeared unto Cephas, meaning that, as the name is given, the material of the assembly should be enhanced as the structure was in building; then he appeared to the twelve, meaning that the administrative vessels should bear His impress in their souls.<a name=459:23></a> There should be an immediate impress of Christ on the spirit in consequence of His appearing; and then He appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, conveying that the relationship of brethren should

		not be a mere term, and not become hackneyed or stale without the spirit that underlies the relationship, and without the appearance or reflection of Christ.<a name=460:1></a> Gideon said as to those who were slain at Tabor, 'What were they like?<a name=460:2></a>' 'They were like you, every one as the son of a king'.<a name=460:3></a> They were like Gideon.<a name=460:4></a> That is the idea of brethren, and I think the Lord, in appearing to five hundred brethren at once, would impress Himself upon them.<a name=460:5></a>

		Then there was the appearance to James, as if the Lord would remind us in that that one man can do a lot.<a name=460:11></a> James, I have no doubt, suggests the idea of what one man can do, like Elijah, who by prayer shut up the heaven for three years and six months and then prayed again and the rain came down, and the earth brought forth its fruit.<a name=460:12></a> One man can do that, so that even if you are reduced to yourself, you can do a lot, if you have a manifestation from the Lord.<a name=460:13></a> Then, so as to check any one man from becoming too influential among the brethren, He appeared to all the apostles.<a name=460:14></a> It might seem a repetition that at first He appeared to twelve and then to all the apostles.<a name=460:15></a> It is one thing to appear to an authoritative company, those who represent the authority of God, the rule of God.<a name=460:16></a> Having had such an appearing the apostles would assert His authority, but they would assert it according to Himself, as He would do it, by an immediate appearing.<a name=460:17></a> Then Paul says, "Last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to <i>me</i> also" -- last but not least!<a name=460:18></a> But he says then, "Not I, but the grace of God which was with me".<a name=460:19></a> The Lord had appeared to Paul earlier and said, "for this purpose have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee to be a

		J.T.<a name=469:1></a> It occurred to me that it would help to call attention to this feature of life, that it is marked by energy.<a name=469:2></a> There is a correspondence between John's gospel and Judges in that we have at the outset of Judges this reference to springs, and it is as if this woman represents the underlying feature of the book.<a name=469:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of the breakdown the book contemplates that the springs of water would ensure the maintenance of what is of God; so that you have, at the end of the book of Judges, Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the high priest, with whom a covenant was made; this son was identified with the testimony at the end (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#20:27">Judges  20:27</a>, 28).<a name=469:4></a> So I think John's gospel ensures the true priesthood at the end, that which shall stand by the testimony.<a name=469:5></a> The maintenance of this at the end is ensured by the principle of the springs.<a name=469:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of judges, as many of us doubtless know, makes frequent references to life in its energetic feature.<a name=469:7></a> For instance, those that divide the spoil do so "in the places of drawing water", <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#5:11">Judges  5:11</a>.<a name=469:8></a> And in chapter 14 we have a swarm of bees in the carcase of the lion, suggestive in a peculiar way of the energy of life in its results, that is, in the honey.<a name=469:9></a> Then in chapter 15 we have Samson thirsty, and he prays: "and God clave the hollow rock which was in Lehi .<a name=469:10></a>.<a name=469:11></a>.<a name=469:12></a> And he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived".<a name=469:13></a> It says then "he judged Israel .<a name=469:14></a>.<a name=469:15></a>.<a name=469:16></a> twenty years", as if the secret lay there, in the spring.<a name=469:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Things are not complete unless there be the accompaniment of the spring; that is to say, we have not only to apprehend Christ as presented in the gospels but there is also the Spirit, so that there should be correspondence with the light, correspondence in an energetic way, because it is a principle that a state of things such as we have to do with requires spiritual energy.<a name=469:18></a>

		Isaac was one who knew the value of water, and he dug wells but the Philistines stopped them.<a name=470:5></a> Stopped wells are equivalent to no wells at all.<a name=470:6></a> It is no use knowing what our fathers had if we have not got the water.<a name=470:7></a> Then finally the servants come to him and say, "We have found water", and he calls that place Beersheba, that is, the well of the oath.<a name=470:8></a> He is settled now, he has got supply in having the wells of water.<a name=470:9></a>

		Energy is a great feature in Scripture; only in the young christians it is apt to be in the flesh; young people are apt to be energetic but in a mixed way, the flesh in some way harnessed up along with the Spirit.<a name=470:10></a>

		In the offerings you have energy represented by the ram, but alongside the ram you find the oblation or meat offering.<a name=470:11></a> That is the check on the flesh.<a name=470:12></a> The energy is there in the ram, but there must be also that which the meat offering suggests.<a name=470:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Accordingly in John's gospel the beginning of chapter 3 makes it clear that "ye must be born again"; flesh is flesh, whether it is in the christian or in the unconverted, it is the same thing and it must be disallowed so that all must be born again.<a name=470:14></a> "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit".<a name=470:15></a> There is the suggestion that the man -- the whole being -- is affected in that way.<a name=470:16></a> It is not simply ye must be born again: "except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God".<a name=470:17></a> The water, I suppose, indicates the entire removal of the flesh, so that what is of the Spirit may remain.<a name=470:18></a> After all, this chapter, <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, is but the continuation of the third; the third gives

		J.T.<a name=509:1></a> We are considering the subject of the house of God as suggested in this gospel.<a name=509:2></a> Whilst in chapters 2 and 14 the Lord definitely refers to His Father's house, the former refers to what is now past, namely the material house at Jerusalem, and the latter is future.<a name=509:3></a> The passages before us have in view the house as it is known and entered into at the present time.<a name=509:4></a> John, in referring to what pertains to the present time, avoids naming things formally and officially.<a name=509:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He refers to them in such a way as to make it clear that they exist, so that his gospel applies peculiarly to our own day, a day of declension in which we are to avoid assuming things in any formal or official way; nevertheless we have to cleave to the things that are existent here through the presence of the Spirit, so that we have the reference in chapter 2 to the temple.<a name=509:6></a> The Lord says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up", meaning, as the Spirit through the evangelist reminds us, the temple of His body.<a name=509:7></a> One feature of the house that is suggestive of the temple may be found in Corinthians as applicable to the Lord's people as having the Spirit, and then in chapter 8 of John's gospel He says, "The servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.<a name=509:8></a> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed".<a name=509:9></a> There again we have a reference to a very precious feature of the house, namely that the Son abides in it, not as over it as elsewhere, but in it.<a name=509:10></a> In chapter 12 reference is made to the house, that it is filled with the odour of the ointment, a very precious suggestion as to what may be realized even in our times as brethren are together in the recognition of Christ.<a name=509:11></a> What is spiritual comes to light and fills the house.<a name=509:12></a> The house is said to be filled in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>by the sound from heaven, but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>it is what comes from the saints -- the house is filled with the odour of the ointment.<a name=509:13></a> That chapter is the end of the course of instruction which
