		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> This gospel is somewhat marked by the prominence given to children.<a name=1:3></a> These scriptures I have suggested are illustrative of this and show how the perfection of praise is seen in them.<a name=1:4></a> In the last Scripture read, the one thought in the prominence given to children seems to be to set aside traditional religious influence.<a name=1:5></a> Anything of the kind, however small, entering into a meeting tends to weaken the service of God and the liberty that belongs to us as sons of God.<a name=1:6></a> The idea of children and what marks them characteristically would be set over against a fixed condition already existent in older ones, especially in Matthew, because of the assembly's place and function as developed in that gospel.<a name=1:7></a> A condition brought about by traditional teaching and influence must be inimical to the service of God, however orthodox it may be or according to accepted principles.<a name=1:8></a> The people had gone out to see John, which of course was so far right, but then the Lord challenges them as to what they went out to see, in order to bring out what John really was, and the condition among the Jews was so apathetic to what was fresh and direct from God at the moment that the Lord has recourse to this parable.<a name=1:9></a> He said: "It is like children sitting in the markets, which, calling to their companions, say, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced: we have mourned to you, and ye have not wailed.<a name=1:10></a> For John has come neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.<a name=1:11></a> The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a man that is eating and wine-drinking, a friend of tax-gatherers, and of sinners -- and wisdom has been

		W.F.<a name=2:3></a> Is that the thought of another generation, wisdom's children, "To whom shall I liken this generation"?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:5></a> Quite so.<a name=2:6></a> It is a new beginning.<a name=2:7></a> Verse 25 brings it down to babes.<a name=2:8></a> It is a new thought being inculcated at the very lowest growth so as to be entirely unsophisticated by traditional influences.<a name=2:9></a> Hence the importance of the children being with us in our readings and imbibing the right thoughts, breathing the right atmosphere from the beginning.<a name=2:10></a> The Lord gives His own example by calling one such in chapter 18.<a name=2:11></a> It is significant as coming in after the assembly is introduced, and as the disciples, seemingly disregarding the wonderful teaching of chapter 17, which shows the status on to which they are brought as sons, have their minds imbued with rivalry or ambition in verse 1, so that the Lord calls a little child to Him and sets it in their midst, saying, "Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven".<a name=2:12></a> So that it is brought in there as the exclusive way into the kingdom of heaven.<a name=2:13></a> It requires conversion, resulting in this character of little children.<a name=2:14></a> Then finally in the temple where the service of God should be prominent, the praises of Israel are only found in the children, and the Lord defends them and points out from the Psalms that it is a divine thought that the praise of God should be perfected in them, a most interesting thought now, because we are getting near the end, and God is perfecting us in this way.<a name=2:15></a>

		A.H.<a name=2:16></a>G.<a name=2:17></a> Would what is traditional render them insensible to ministry as indicated in the first scripture read, the piping and mourning?<a name=2:18></a>

		their companions in the parable would point to persons listening to the ministry of John the baptist and the ministry of Christ.<a name=3:1></a> It was a real feeling appeal in both persons -- in John the baptist and in Christ -- but there was no response at all, save the worst kind of opposition.<a name=3:2></a> John the baptist, they said, had a demon, and the Son of man, because He ate and drank, was a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners.<a name=3:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:7></a> I mean anything that has come down to us that we are clinging to as over against what is fresh and current.<a name=3:8></a> Many are hindered by the traditional side from going in for and appropriating what is current by the Spirit and fresh, because the traditional feature cannot be the perfecting of the thing, inasmuch as it is past and gone.<a name=3:9></a> It has not perfected anything.<a name=3:10></a> The children in chapter 21 are spoken of by the Lord as perfecting praise.<a name=3:11></a> God is perfecting the thing in them and if we hold back from that we shall never be perfected.<a name=3:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:1></a> Quite so.<a name=4:2></a> "If ye will receive it, this is Elias, who is to come".<a name=4:3></a> There was Something there that any Jew or Israelite should recognise, that is Elias.<a name=4:4></a> He is past but his ministry has the character of continuance and may be taken on by others.<a name=4:5></a> So that John the baptist was that, if they would receive it.<a name=4:6></a> If they did not, it would have to be deferred.<a name=4:7></a> The little children were there current, not a reincarnation of Elijah or of his ministry, but what is current, the natural growth of the moment.<a name=4:8></a> Elijah must go forward and, according to the prophets, will reappear; that is, he presents a full thought, but to take form in another than himself.<a name=4:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> That is the thought, the children; the word in that particular verse carries the thought of dignity, of growth; it is not of little children such as the earlier reference to the little children in the markets.<a name=4:15></a> Children of wisdom is a full thought.<a name=4:16></a> The thought of children is, of course, in relationship to the father, but it might apply to persons of very advanced years.<a name=4:17></a>

		Ques.<a name=4:20></a> You were speaking about the full thought to be reached in chapter 21 in relation to the praise and service of God.<a name=4:21></a> I was wondering if it begins by the getting of wisdom: "Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding", so that we might understand what is spoken to us in relation to these things, as over against all this tradition.<a name=4:22></a> Is that what is in your mind?<a name=4:23></a>

		sonship earlier in the book, but the Son of David was a note developing out of the work of God.<a name=5:1></a> In chapter 20, the two blind men did not speak in an orthodox sense, but from their own feelings and spiritual intelligence.<a name=5:2></a> The Lord was entering on His own territory at Jericho and without anyone telling them they say, "Lord, Son of David".<a name=5:3></a> That was a note for that particular time, and the children carried that note forward.<a name=5:4></a> It lasts, it is carried through, and it is perfected in the temple, in the children.<a name=5:5></a> So that I think the teaching for us would be that whatever is the note for the moment, whatever phase of the truth is coming out, whether the outcome of the work of God in His people, or whether by the teaching of the Spirit, whatever is the note or theme for the moment, what the Spirit is saying, that is what enters into the perfecting.<a name=5:6></a> The word the Lord uses, the perfecting of praise, is in relation to the note that began with the two blind men, who were of no religious status at all, but it came out through them and was carried through into Jerusalem by way of the ass and the colt.<a name=5:7></a> These children are taking it up and they are perfecting it; they are carrying it forward; <i>they</i> had to do it, the perfecting must involve that, not what had preceded.<a name=5:8></a> That is the point, I think, at the beginning of chapter 18.<a name=5:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=5:10></a>S.<a name=5:11></a> Would the truth of sonship as at the end of chapter 17 be the note for the moment?<a name=5:12></a> In chapter 18 we read: "In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?<a name=5:13></a>", as though there was something in them which was hindering them from apprehending just what was being presented at that moment.<a name=5:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:15></a> They missed it.<a name=5:16></a> It was spoken most clearly, the Lord bringing Himself into the matter to fill out the truth, "Take that and give it to them for me and thee".<a name=5:17></a> It is most palpable that though Peter

		W.S.<a name=6:2></a>S.<a name=6:3></a> Does the Lord taking the little child indicate the way in which we are brought into the truth of Sonship?<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:5></a> Yes, whatever the truth be that is in mind.<a name=6:6></a> The truth of sonship is in chapter 17 and, of course, that brings in the assembly because chapter 17 is the filling out of chapter 16, to show the personnel, the kind of persons that form the assembly.<a name=6:7></a> The subject is really finished in that sense at the end of chapter 17, but chapter 18 shows that the disciples were not up to it and hence the little child shows them that they could only learn as taking that attitude.<a name=6:8></a> But chapter 21 stands in another relation.<a name=6:9></a> It is not the Son of God but the Son of David.<a name=6:10></a> That is the truth for that time because the Lord was entering His capital, Jerusalem, and bringing in the question of His rights to it as the Son of David.<a name=6:11></a> The blind men inaugurate that principle and the little children are not behind.<a name=6:12></a> The thing comes down and is perfected.<a name=6:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.F.<a name=6:14></a> Was it in your mind to connect the response of praise with the revelation to babes in the verse we had in chapter 11?<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:16></a> Just so.<a name=6:17></a> The Father began at the bottom with the babes.<a name=6:18></a> In chapter 21, it is now the Person of the Lord entering into His capital, but the little children are in the temple, and you have this thought in verses 15 and 16, "When the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David .<a name=6:19></a>.<a name=6:20></a>.<a name=6:21></a>" they did not go beyond that; the crowds added from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118">Psalm  118</a>, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord" (verse 9), but the little children kept to what the blind men said in the end of chapter 20.<a name=6:22></a> They cried out

		saying, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David".<a name=7:1></a> Why did they say that?<a name=7:2></a> They are blind men and evidently not men that would have much learning as had the Pharisees and scribes, but they say the words, bringing in just the note according to the position; it is what belonged to that particular position that Christ was in.<a name=7:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:11></a> Yes.<a name=7:12></a> So that the word in chapter 21: 5 is a quotation from the prophet Zechariah: "All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass".<a name=7:13></a> And then the crowds in verse 9, who went before Him and who followed, cried, saying, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=7:14></a> The scriptures therefore were fulfilled at that time in principle, but the little ones carried what the blind men said, and that is the note the Lord is specially interested in now.<a name=7:15></a> What comes out in that way is being perfected, and we want to be in that.<a name=7:16></a> We want to be amongst those who are perfecting praise.<a name=7:17></a> That is what the Lord is helping in relation to, that His praise might be perfected.<a name=7:18></a>

		also the ass and the colt are in Matthew instead of the colt as in Luke and John.<a name=8:1></a> So that it is the testimony carried through in a full way, not simply in one but in two, and then eventuating in children; that principle is suggestive of a fresh energetic state in the saints, a readiness to take on what is current by the Spirit, because that is the perfecting of the thing.<a name=8:2></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:6></a> It may be one or the other.<a name=8:7></a> There are several words which are used for children.<a name=8:8></a> The one used in Luke is rather the diminutive, but this one would point to a state ready for instruction, the state in the saints ready for taking in things that are current.<a name=8:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=10:8></a> It applies to all unconverted christians, a very paradoxical phrase, but there is meaning in it, for we all need conversion from time to time.<a name=10:9></a> If we have been held, for instance, in traditional things, we need conversion.<a name=10:10></a> If we are rivals one of another, we need conversion.<a name=10:11></a> Conversion is going on all the time among the saints, but sometimes we do not admit of it, and hold on to old things.<a name=10:12></a> 'Which of us shall be the greatest?<a name=10:13></a>', anyone who says that needs conversion.<a name=10:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=10:21></a> Yes, all those remarks in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>lead on to perfection, for he says, "to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".<a name=10:22></a> That is the perfection of the thought of sacrifice, and the spiritual house is the perfection of the thought of house, and praise is the perfection of the thought of worshippers or offerers.<a name=10:23></a> Then Peter himself is the best illustration you can get of a man converted after he was a believer; and he must have needed conversion to some extent when he came under the influence of judaising teachers at Antioch.<a name=10:24></a>

		Well, having said all that by the way, I come to <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a> to show that there is another order of things inside of the physical, dependent on the physical, for, as far as we are externally concerned, the physical serves the spiritual, but the spiritual is within the range of the physical for the moment, and so you have the Father and the Son, which we do

		What I wish to show in what I have been saying, is the result, that we are secured through the economy on the principle of faith, we are made immediately part of it.<a name=22:11></a> That is the impression I would like to leave with all; many have it already doubtless, but I should like all to have it, that as secured by the economy, by the operation of it, we are made part of

		it; what is called popular evangelism is short of the truth; persons are converted and allowed to go as they will and where they will, and link themselves up with religious bodies which in no way represent the economy of God, whereas the true gospel, which this book of John implies, is that we are brought into the thing through which the light of the cross and the power of the deliverance have come to us.<a name=23:1></a> We are brought into that, and we are imbued with the spirit of it, so that we seek that others should be brought into it.<a name=23:2></a> So the first chapter is marked by an evangelical spirit.<a name=23:3></a> John the baptist presents Christ as moving, as active.<a name=23:4></a> Spiritual inactivity is abhorrent to the spirit of this gospel.<a name=23:5></a> John is active, he sees Jesus active, and as he sees Him coming to him he says, "Behold the Lamb of God", and others move to the Lamb of God.<a name=23:6></a> Jesus becomes the centre, and those who come to Him first address Him as Teacher, because what I have been saying requires teaching.<a name=23:7></a> The most urgent need, dear brethren, is teaching, divine teaching.<a name=23:8></a> So in this book the Lord (quoting the prophet) says, "They shall be all taught of God", and I do not want to be outside of that divine teaching.<a name=23:9></a> No true christian would be outside of it, "they shall be all taught of God".<a name=23:10></a> They called Him Teacher and asked Him where He abode, and He said, "Come and see".<a name=23:11></a> That is the next thing.<a name=23:12></a> It is what exists today, that is the point that John has in mind, it is what exists; what is of God is worthy of observation.<a name=23:13></a> No one who is of God is ashamed to call attention to what is of God, however little it is, for as of God, it is worth seeing, it is a testimony, "come and see".<a name=23:14></a> They came and "abode with him that day.<a name=23:15></a> It was about the tenth hour".<a name=23:16></a>

		told who the other one was, I have no doubt it was John himself, but that is only a conjecture, save that we arrive at it by his way of referring to things that refer to himself.<a name=25:1></a> He keeps himself in the background; it is a question of adequate testimony as to where Jesus abides.<a name=25:2></a> Andrew went and found his brother Simon; he is potentially of the system that I am speaking of; he and John together according to Acts could say "Come and see", but Andrew found Simon and brought him to Jesus, and the Lord named him in relation to the system; He named him Cephas, and the Spirit of God tells us it means a Stone.<a name=25:3></a> The Lord had in His mind a structure, and there it is in Simon.<a name=25:4></a> "Thou shalt be called Cephas"; that is, in the testimony people would call him that; he would be known as a stable, reliable man, and there can be no structure without reliability and stability, and that is what the word 'stone' would indicate.<a name=25:5></a> The Lord found Philip and Philip found Nathanael, and Philip says to Nathanael, "Come and see".<a name=25:6></a> He might say, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?<a name=25:7></a>", but Philip would say, 'Well, do not be too sure'.<a name=25:8></a> It is a very unsafe thing to judge at a distance either persons or things or places; hence the word is "Come and see".<a name=25:9></a> Do not have preconceived thoughts as to what is of God, come and see; Nathanael did come, and the Lord saw him coming.<a name=25:10></a> It is now a question, not of what Nathanael is to see, but what the <i>Lord sees</i> in Nathanael.<a name=25:11></a> The matter is turned round, because if you are coming with any interest at all, you must come under the eyes of the brethren, under the Lord's eyes, for examination.<a name=25:12></a> It is not all one-sided; it is not that you are patronising the Lord if you come to hear the gospel or hear the word of God, there is another side, that you have come under His eye, and He has to carefully look over you.<a name=25:13></a> You may think it is an optional thing with you, but it is not, the Lord says, I have to pass My eyes over

		you; so He scrutinises Nathanael, but not until he began to move.<a name=26:1></a> It is a question of movement, and so when He saw Nathanael coming to Him he said, "Behold an Israelite indeed".<a name=26:2></a> That is another testimony: how few there are in whom there is no guile!<a name=26:3></a> They are very rare.<a name=26:4></a> The Lord saw that.<a name=26:5></a> He named Peter and called him Cephas, and He named Nathanael "an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile".<a name=26:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is how the matter stands in John, so that Nathanael is part of the structure, because he is a guileless man, but he is an Israelite indeed; that is a spiritual thought.<a name=26:7></a> He is not an unsteady sort of man, he is a real person, and he is recognised by the facts that the Lord knew as to him, for He judged him right through, and His judgment brings out Nathanael's confession that the Lord was the Son of God and the King of Israel.<a name=26:8></a> You can see what a delightful man he would be in the system.<a name=26:9></a> The Lord is looking for such, for stable people, people that do not waver in their thoughts, not unduly critical in questioning, but submissive, for men like Nathanael; he is an Israelite indeed, a genuine man, a transparent man, there is no guile in him.<a name=26:10></a> The Lord says, 'You will see greater things than these'.<a name=26:11></a> People who are questioning all the time never see anything, never learn anything, "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth".<a name=26:12></a> But not so Nathanael for the Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these", and he had said that Christ is the Son of God, the King of Israel.<a name=26:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have perhaps said too much on that line, but it is in order to make clear what is in view, that there is an economy composed of such persons and that the Son of God is the great central thought.<a name=26:14></a> If you read down the first chapter of John you will see the many titles by which He is known, all bearing on His glory, His glorious Person.<a name=26:15></a> He is worthy of our attention: He says later, "I, if I be lifted up out of

		Now in verse 35 the position is defined.<a name=27:4></a> It is a question of love.<a name=27:5></a> The Father loves the Son.<a name=27:6></a> Why should this be said, because it is already said that He dwells in the bosom of the Father?<a name=27:7></a> Surely He is loved there.<a name=27:8></a> It is not that He <i>was</i> in the bosom of the Father; it is the present tense, as we have often noticed, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father".<a name=27:9></a> It is a question of what He is as Man, the delight the Father has in Him, and it is expressed in that unmistakable way, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him".<a name=27:10></a> It is a position of love, that is what it is.<a name=27:11></a> The Son <i>is</i> in the bosom of the Father, and now in order to make that applicable to the economy that God has set up, it says here, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand".<a name=27:12></a> It is the singular, to set out the official position, as you might say.<a name=27:13></a> Everything is to be in His hand.<a name=27:14></a> It is the general position, but it is given over in love; it is a question of the Father loving the Son.<a name=27:15></a> The next verse says, "He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him".<a name=27:16></a> That is a most solemn word, because it alludes to the Jews, the reprobate Jews, which this gospel contemplates, the Jews suffering; in fact nothing could be more severe than this verse, that the wrath of God <i>abides</i>, not 'will abide', but "abides".<a name=27:17></a> Paul confirming this says that "wrath has come upon them to the uttermost", a most pitiable thought, because we see it, dear brethren, all around us at the present time.<a name=27:18></a> God has put a mark upon them as He did on Cain, and He will see

		Chapter 4 is to work that out and to show how those brought into the system are brought into it livingly.<a name=28:2></a> There is no question here of the forgiveness of sins; that, of course, is implied, but the point in the administration of chapter 4 is that the person who believes is brought into the system in a living way.<a name=28:3></a> Many are brought into the system outwardly, merely by baptism, and in that respect I wanted just to say a word as to those who are, or were then, the official servants of Christ, that they are out of this whole chapter 4 as to their work, a most solemn thing.<a name=28:4></a> We may have the reputation of holding things and being near the Lord, and yet the real living thing and the result He is securing are outside of us; we are not used at all.<a name=28:5></a> The disciples were doing something, but what were they doing?<a name=28:6></a> They baptised; we are told that the Lord did not do that Himself; the disciples did it.<a name=28:7></a> It is not very much (understand I am not disparaging anything that the people of God may do for the Lord) but it is not very much to be baptising.<a name=28:8></a> They were doing that, it says that Jesus Himself baptised not but His disciples.<a name=28:9></a> That is they carried on the outward thing.<a name=28:10></a> There is no life in that for life is not communicated by baptism, whatever orthodoxy says; it is but an outward thing which admits me outwardly into the profession, but it does not in itself admit me into the spiritual realm.<a name=28:11></a> I need the Holy Spirit for that, I need new birth for that, and all that the gospel proposes I need for that; an unconverted man may be baptised; we all know that.<a name=28:12></a> We are in the midst of the profession of millions and millions of people who have been baptised.<a name=28:13></a> Well, there is no credit to be attached to any baptism in that sense.<a name=28:14></a>

		Another thing they were doing was that they were providing provisions for the Lord; at least it does not say they were for Him, but why should they <i>all</i> go to buy bread, or whatever they needed.<a name=29:1></a> It says, "A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water.<a name=29:2></a> Jesus says to her, Give me to drink (for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions)".<a name=29:3></a> Where the money came from to buy the provisions it does not say; it was there, they simply were buying the provisions, there is not much in that.<a name=29:4></a> If it be only baptising and buying provisions then the system is not being built up at all, but the Lord is building up the system, that is the point, a new system of things; He is building it up livingly, that is the word.<a name=29:5></a> He would do it Himself; it is remarkable how much He has to do Himself in this gospel: here He talked to the woman.<a name=29:6></a> They did not understand it; they wondered why she was there.<a name=29:7></a> Why not?<a name=29:8></a> She was, as it were, the symbol of the harvest; 'the fields are ripe', He said, but they did not see it.<a name=29:9></a> I am speaking thus that we might be on the alert that whatever we are doing must be a living matter or it is nothing, a mere outward official work without the Spirit is nothing.<a name=29:10></a> That is what marked these disciples here; I am not saying a word against them otherwise, but the Spirit of God gives us this remarkable picture, they baptised and bought provisions, and they did not understand why the Lord should be speaking to this woman!<a name=29:11></a> They were spiritual men, of course, the great founders of the system, but for the moment John is presenting them in this light.<a name=29:12></a> In the last chapter he presents seven of them in another light to bring out that the official position is not trustworthy in itself, it must be in the energy of the Spirit; that is why we get the living water here, to bring out the living character of things, otherwise we have nothing.<a name=29:13></a>

		So the Lord raises the question about drink.<a name=30:1></a> He had in mind to bring out this living thing, that the Father loved Him and the Father had given everything to be in His hand.<a name=30:2></a> Well, He says, I will bring about something for the Father, for everything must be for God; if there is no result for God, what is there?<a name=30:3></a> There is nothing morally.<a name=30:4></a> Hence you get sonship in this chapter, statements that you get nowhere else, and they are spoken to a despised Samaritan, a wicked woman.<a name=30:5></a> So the Lord goes on to speak about the living water, I cannot say much more, but it says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=30:6></a> What is needed, that is virtually what He is saying, is that, to work out what is in the mind of the Father; it is a living system and a living system must have a living state of things, and as we come into it we are made part of it.<a name=30:7></a> How wonderful it is to have part in this living system!<a name=30:8></a> The woman did not understand; she has to be instructed, that is another point, to be led out of the channel of her own natural thoughts, religious thoughts; she had no reputation really, she did not deserve any recommendation religiously, but she had religious thoughts, and she refers back to the father Jacob; such people always refer to the past: I have not anything myself, but my forefathers were something.<a name=30:9></a> But it is a question of what I am <i>now</i>; that is the thing in the new system, and so the Lord proceeds to enlighten her, to lead her out of the channel of her thoughts.<a name=30:10></a> I can never be in the new system without that, I judge everything, the thoughts I have been engaged with whether morally or religiously; and ultimately the Lord discloses everything to her, exposes her to herself, not to anyone else, and she says, "I see [for that is the word used] that thou art a prophet".<a name=30:11></a> I wonder if everyone here

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=35:1></a> What is in mind is to call attention to prophetic ministry as bearing on the servants of God and on the service of God.<a name=35:2></a> We are all servants, but those more particularly in mind are those engaged in the divine service.<a name=35:3></a> Prophetic ministry is, of course, part of God's service, but in Nathan it assumes a Davidic character.<a name=35:4></a> According to the record his ministry has David in mind, and eventuates in Solomon, who is indicated in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>, although not named.<a name=35:5></a> This is the first important service of Nathan, and his message has in mind the limitation of David in his service, and the introduction of a son.<a name=35:6></a> The result with David was that he went in and sat before Jehovah, so that the service, whilst limiting him, added to him qualitatively.<a name=35:7></a> He sat before the Lord, implying that he had gained through the message and moved in the light of the liberty of sonship.<a name=35:8></a> Then the next message, or service of Nathan, eventuates in the actual son, Solomon; but, although it dealt with a most grievous crime, David himself increases in spiritual power and becomes a worshipper again through Nathan's service under God.<a name=35:9></a> Then Nathan is employed to give the supreme touch to the event, in that he is said to name Solomon, the son already intimated, Jedidiah, which means that Jehovah loved him, so that we have quality again.<a name=35:10></a> Finally, we have, through Nathan's service, Solomon on the throne.<a name=35:11></a> It is clear, therefore, that this prophet's service, according to the records, is almost entirely engaged with David and Solomon, and the service eventuates in the worship of God in the greatest quality hitherto seen.<a name=35:12></a> He writes of David after his

		death, and he writes of Solomon too, and we are told that he had part in the very ordering of the service of God in conjunction with the king.<a name=36:1></a> So that it seems to me that this line of thought in connection with Nathan would elevate our thoughts as to prophetic ministry which God is stressing, how that it reaches high, so to say, and produces spiritual quality amongst those who are serving.<a name=36:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=36:3></a>C.<a name=36:4></a> Would you say that it implies conditions that are not quite suitable to God to begin with, but which are adjusted?<a name=36:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=36:6></a> That is right.<a name=36:7></a> Nathan seems to be honoured in that he is dealing with the remarkable effect of the work of God.<a name=36:8></a> We may regard David as outstanding as representing the work of God, but he showed himself in these instances as adjustable.<a name=36:9></a> The more the work of God has effect in us the more adjustable we shall be.<a name=36:10></a> Nathan showed at the outset that he was thoroughly sympathetic with David; he was not a critic or a complainer; David too had confidence in him.<a name=36:11></a> If one is seeking to serve the saints as subjects of the work of God, it is a great matter to ensure their confidence.<a name=36:12></a> Normally, if one is sent of God he would inspire confidence in the brethren, and I think David clearly had confidence in Nathan, for he told him what was in his heart.<a name=36:13></a> In the earlier verses it says, "And it came to pass when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest round about from all his enemies, that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedars, and the ark of God dwells under curtains.<a name=36:14></a> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee".<a name=36:15></a> He has no criticism to make, he is with the king, evidently having his confidence, and hence, David would all the more readily receive his message.<a name=36:16></a> If we have the confidence of the brethren, we shall have power with them.<a name=36:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=37:15></a> It seems to me that David must have encouraged the prophetic ministry.<a name=37:16></a> Samuel occupied a different position from either of those three, he was never regarded as one of David's prophets, but we see how David valued him.<a name=37:17></a> I think those three allude to the spirit of encouragement which David accorded to the prophets and the liberty with him that he clearly afforded them.<a name=37:18></a> The influence of the king was so great that it was of all importance he should be kept right, and so today it is of all importance that those who are serving in a prominent way should be kept right.<a name=37:19></a> Their influence is necessarily great.<a name=37:20></a> The bearing of such a ministry is qualitative; it results in quality such as is needed in the service of God.<a name=37:21></a> Hence the Lord is helping us to steer away from Philistine methods, such as the saints suffered from

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=38:4></a> Exactly; that is what I was thinking, and if there is mutual confidence in the prophets the bearing of the message will be to increase spirituality.<a name=38:5></a> There is a beautiful confidence between David and Nathan.<a name=38:6></a> I suppose his thought was that David was on the right line.<a name=38:7></a> His judgment was right that there should be a house, "Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee".<a name=38:8></a> There was no doubt about the thought being right, and that Jehovah was with him, for it was a fact that Jehovah was with him.<a name=38:9></a> Nathan's name means a gift, and at a time like this David would value such a man, especially after this message.<a name=38:10></a> David would feel himself a greater man after he received Nathan's message than he was before, for we never read of his going in and sitting before Jehovah before, and we have to attribute it to Nathan's message.<a name=38:11></a> So, Nathan would be more lovable to David henceforth.<a name=38:12></a>

		Now I make a few remarks in regard to this woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=52:4></a> It is one of the chapters that perhaps yields the most, certainly evangelically, in John's gospel.<a name=52:5></a> And coming to the reaction with her, a blessed reaction, what is to be pointed out is that the Lord dealt with her by herself.<a name=52:6></a> There were those who had the distinction of being His servants, namely the apostles.<a name=52:7></a> They are not mentioned as apostles here, but are called disciples.<a name=52:8></a> Sometimes the term is used as denoting disciples who were distinctive, as it is said in chapter 2: "His disciples believed on him".<a name=52:9></a> They are distinctive as having part in the service, and what comes out is that they are said to be baptisers; they were baptising, a matter that does not require much spirituality.<a name=52:10></a> It is a necessary service, something that should be done by a brother in the locality, which is scriptural as I understand it.<a name=52:11></a> Others make much of a distinguished brother, that he should do it, but in either case it is not a matter requiring spiritual intelligence or spirituality.<a name=52:12></a> But they were accredited as doing it, and they are also said to be buying provisions at this particular juncture, another service that requires but little spirituality, so they are evidently out of this matter, one of the finest bits of spiritual work recorded in this gospel.<a name=52:13></a>

		I speak, no doubt, to those who serve especially, for we do not want to be in any sense out of what is going on spiritually.<a name=53:1></a> Local matters, of course, in each gathering, include material affairs, necessary things, but let no one confine himself to those things.<a name=53:2></a> Even the deacons appointed to ordinary service of this kind soon graduated, and two of them, Stephen and Philip, "purchased to themselves a good degree".<a name=53:3></a> Of course, there is the hewing of wood and drawing of water for the congregation of the Lord, but then there is promotion in the realm of God, and promotion implies what is spiritual.<a name=53:4></a> The disciples in this chapter seem to be missing; indeed they were missing; they were out of the current of the spiritual activities of Christ in their relation to the living water.<a name=53:5></a> Hewing of wood and drawing of water is hardly up to this.<a name=53:6></a> This woman had come to draw water, but she had connected it with an ordinary vessel, a water-pot, and rightly too, but the Lord's instruction led on to living water.<a name=53:7></a>

		I can only say very little on the subject, because of the other scriptures, but she listened.<a name=53:8></a> She was very natural in her thoughts at the beginning, extremely so, and pretentious too, but the skilled hand of the Master brought her on to the spiritual line.<a name=53:9></a> That is what everyone who serves Christ would seek to do, to bring the saints on to a spiritual line, and one of the surest evidences of this is that one says, as this woman did, "I see that thou art a prophet".<a name=53:10></a> He did not say He was; He told her He was the Christ later on, which was a very remarkable thing, but she began to exercise spiritual faculties.<a name=53:11></a> The subjective work of God, of course, is required for this to come into action, and chapter 3 lays that basis.<a name=53:12></a> The basis may be laid, and yet worldliness coming in often hinders its normal operation, but in this case she reacted very quickly to what the Lord was saying to her, and she said, "I see that thou art a

		So she left her water-pot.<a name=55:6></a> We have often spoken of it, but I only mention it to show how the truth reacted upon her.<a name=55:7></a> She said, in effect, This water-pot is not the idea.<a name=55:8></a> The disciples in their state at that time were ready to speak about that sort of thing, but the Lord had been speaking to her in a spiritual sense and she appropriated the significance of His ministry, and she "left her water-pot and went away into the city, and says to the men, Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?<a name=55:9></a>" -- and they came.<a name=55:10></a> It was not, Go, see a man; the Man is, as it were, in her heart; He was not at a distance from her; Jesus was in her heart, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>), and that was exactly the case with her.<a name=55:11></a> That vessel is left; what she is naturally is discarded for what she is spiritually.<a name=55:12></a> The Lord had introduced the thought of a spiritual containing vessel, and she says, I am going to be that.<a name=55:13></a> That is reaction, and how useful anyone is who reacts like that to the truth of the gospel.<a name=55:14></a> If I react in that sense, the Lord can take me on and use me in the gospel, as in her case.<a name=55:15></a> The point is that the reaction has constituted her a vessel for living water.<a name=55:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		and she became a son of light.<a name=56:1></a> It is not children of light, but sons, developed persons, and so, in the next scripture I read, we have a class of nobles, a veritable galaxy of nobles, sons of light.<a name=56:2></a> They have reacted to the light; they have believed in it.<a name=56:3></a> It is not simply something to be admired and spoken about, but believed in: "Believe in the light", and then you become sons of light.<a name=56:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the reaction in chapter 12 is of a group of sons of light; the whole scene is radiant with light.<a name=56:5></a> Jesus came to the town; that was the reaction in Him, so to say, speaking reverently.<a name=56:6></a> He had ministered to them and raised Lazarus, and He had in mind to come back.<a name=56:7></a> That is a lovely thought in Jesus.<a name=56:8></a> If He causes something to take effect in my soul He will come back as regards it.<a name=56:9></a> It was a question of what was effected in Lazarus -- "Where Lazarus was", as it says, and the reaction with them was that "they made him a supper".<a name=56:10></a> But it is not that He is going to have it alone.<a name=56:11></a> It is what He is looking for.<a name=56:12></a> The wonderful light had been shining; they had believed in it, and now they are sons of it.<a name=56:13></a> See how nobly they acted.<a name=56:14></a> They acted like grown persons; there is no longer any bitter complaint on the part of Martha, everything is in perfect order; they are governed by the light; they are sons of light, and they made Him a supper.<a name=56:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this matter becomes progressive if an event of this kind takes place as we are together.<a name=56:16></a> The table was laid, Martha was there serving, and Lazarus was sitting at table with Him.<a name=56:17></a> It is a glorious scene.<a name=56:18></a> The matter is His, but Lazarus is there.<a name=56:19></a> Lazarus never shone better than now; Martha never shone better than now, and Mary never shone better than now, and conversely Judas never shone worse.<a name=56:20></a> Evil is also exposed, but this beautiful scene brings out Mary.<a name=56:21></a> She is the one the Spirit of God has in mind, and the very scene produces reaction in her.<a name=56:22></a> She

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is all I should say there, and I go on to Luke.<a name=57:2></a> John shows spiritual energy at work in Christ, outside of the official class, and that there is positive result, but Luke, being a priest, would show us how reaction takes place where restoration is necessary.<a name=57:3></a> It may be there are those in this audience who have wandered from Christ.<a name=57:4></a> They may be attending the meetings as yet, but in heart they have wandered.<a name=57:5></a> Luke, being priestly, would show the reactive effect of the kind of grace needed for restoration, the Lord intimating that when He said to Peter, "When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren".<a name=57:6></a> I suppose Peter was more useful after his restoration than before.<a name=57:7></a> The divine intent with us, however serious the defection may be, is that the will of God may be accomplished through it, that we are to be made better through it, and Luke would depict the reaction of restorative grace.<a name=57:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is that the Lord had gone after these two and walked along with them without letting them know it was Himself.<a name=57:9></a> It is a wonderful priestly touch that we get in this chapter.<a name=57:10></a> And presently He expounds to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.<a name=57:11></a> Think of the wonderful patience and tender care of the Lord, unfolding the scriptures about Himself, about Christ.<a name=57:12></a> If one is to be restored it must be a question of Christ, not to turn now to prophetic or other subjects.<a name=57:13></a> No, those are not the things for restoration.<a name=57:14></a> I believe John's gospel is the great gospel for that.<a name=57:15></a> He begins with Christ and persons who were alienated, from religious influence and the like.<a name=57:16></a> If they are christians at all they will listen to a word about Christ.<a name=57:17></a> So the Lord, "beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself".<a name=57:18></a> What glories He brought before them, one

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of how far the Lord will go to restore.<a name=58:11></a> Mark tells us that "he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country".<a name=58:12></a> Why should the Lord put Himself to the necessity of taking another form to restore two persons?<a name=58:13></a> They were going to the country, another thing to be noted, dear brethren.<a name=58:14></a> Beware of going into the country in the days of christianity.<a name=58:15></a> But they constrained Him, and He went in and sat down -- what a lovely scene that was -- and took the house-father's place.<a name=58:16></a> He had that; not that He wanted to shine in any way, but to get at them, and He broke the bread and vanished.<a name=58:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the reaction is that they returned the same hour to Jerusalem.<a name=58:18></a> There was immediate reaction, and what a blessed one it was; and the Lord knew it, as He anticipated the effect of restorative grace.<a name=58:19></a> If God is working in the recovery of souls in this hour, John would give the prophetic or spiritual side of the position, but Luke would show that the reaction to the ministry of Christ in restoring grace is that you come to the public position, that there is something

		J.T.<a name=96:1></a> What is in mind is to show from these scriptures how life, whether in Christ, or in any one of us, or in a company of saints in any locality, is the source of light.<a name=96:2></a> The verses in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>were read to show that life in Christ was light, but light in a circumscribed sense as referring only to men.<a name=96:3></a> The ordinary physical light of the sun, the moon and the stars, serves a wider area; for spiritual life as light has men only in view.<a name=96:4></a> So it is thought that the passage in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4">Matthew  4</a>illustrates how light appears in a locality in this sense: it sprang up.<a name=96:5></a> The Lord, as we are told in the passage, left Nazareth and dwelt in Capernaum; it was not simply that He visited the place, but that He dwelt there; so that He represents that of which we are speaking, light in a locality, for it sprang up, we are told.<a name=96:6></a> Then the passage in Isaiah helps as to the development of life in christians; it is a vegetable figure, but used not only here but elsewhere to set out life, first the yield of the earth without cultivation, and then with cultivation.<a name=96:7></a> Finally, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, life is seen in persons, but as a group characterised by Lazarus whom Christ raised from the dead.<a name=96:8></a> It is thought that the passage represents the point in question in the most intelligent and intelligible form as in persons who had had a comparatively long history with Christ, and came under His influence and culture.<a name=96:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=114:1></a> It is thought that, by comparing these scriptures, often read amongst us, we may see in Luke the assembly in its public aspect and in John the assembly viewed in its more spiritual unseen relations, particularly suggesting the assembly as coming out of Christ, coming out of His side, that is, in the Eve character, speaking typically, Mary Magdalene having her part leading into this position, the feminine side bearing on it.<a name=114:2></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>undoubtedly may be linked up with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, the heading of which is the hind of the morning, the feminine thought, pointing to the spiritual agility that is seen in this chapter as evidently in the mind of the Lord as He entered into death, that He would have such a result.<a name=114:3></a> The feminine thought runs through this chapter in Mary Magdalene, she carrying the message to the disciples; it says, "Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her".<a name=114:4></a> The Lord comes in following the message, and following not only the message but the one who bore it, who represented an element in herself which will develop into the assembly in its more spiritual aspect.<a name=114:5></a> In the Canticles we have, "I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse" -- the Lord would have her in mind coming in, whether she was present or otherwise the element was there in the message carried by her and would be in His mind in relation to His side; it says, "He shewed to them his hands and his side"; in Luke it was the feet.<a name=114:6></a> The side would mean love and therefore the highest feature of the assembly as come out of Him.<a name=114:7></a>

		Luke is the public position, the two came there before the Lord came in.<a name=115:1></a> It seems as if we should regard them as special; He had them in His mind that they would be there.<a name=115:2></a> They do not represent such an exalted thought as Mary Magdalene, for they had been straying; they are viewed as restored.<a name=115:3></a> It would be a man and his wife, the public side, for the assembly publicly is composed of such, but corresponding somewhat to Zipporah, the assembly viewed in a somewhat unlovable or unlovely aspect.<a name=115:4></a> In a way the conditions do not draw out the Lord's affections as do those recorded in John; He said, "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is <i>I</i> myself"; it would be the wilderness position more, but if we follow the feminine thought as in the types, Zipporah represents the public side as to the assembly in an outward sense; and Eve is a more exalted thought as representing the assembly before sin came in.<a name=115:5></a> These are the general thoughts I had in mind to be considered, hoping the brethren will be quite free about it.<a name=115:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=118:2></a> That is a good thought, for there are three houses in Samuel, the house of Abinadab on the hill, which would suggest a place of elevation as distinctive because the ark was there, but then there is no evidence that his household gained by the presence of the ark; like many of us who go on with the truth, have morning reading and the like, but are we taking on thoughts governing the ark, governing the testimony?<a name=118:3></a> When the time came for the movement of the ark, they put it on a cart; that would show they had not gained by the presence of the ark in the house.<a name=118:4></a> Then the next house is that of Obed-Edom.<a name=118:5></a> He had the ark only three months and it was a makeshift on the part of David, not pre-arranged -- the ark was turned aside into this house.<a name=118:6></a> It seems as if Obed-Edom represents a person who valued the presence of the ark, whatever his name may mean; if it means a foreigner it makes it all the more notable that here is a man who is taking things on quickly and God is blessing him quickly; there is a change, it is a different house.<a name=118:7></a> And finally David brings the ark to Zion, the city of David, to the place he had prepared for it, and he blesses his house.<a name=118:8></a> Obed-Edom is blessed; David is able to bless; although he is despised by his wife, by Michal, he makes everything of the ark now and is able to bless his house.<a name=118:9></a> But Abinadab and his family are not learning at all.<a name=118:10></a> So what has been suggested fits into <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>, what we are in our houses, whether the ark, that is, the testimony today by the Spirit, is in our houses; nominally we may have it and yet not be learning, whereas someone comes in suddenly and gets blessing and light and takes his place amongst us, and he is blessed because of the ark, evidently valuing the ark in his house.<a name=118:11></a> He is making no show of it; it is just put in there by David, but God is blessing him.<a name=118:12></a> There

		What is in mind this evening is to speak about <i>grace</i>.<a name=131:1></a> This book sets it out in general, but these passages in particular, Mephibosheth being selected for the purpose.<a name=131:2></a> The book of 2 Samuel has a unique place in the inspired records, beginning with grace in the believer: the song of the bow, as it is called, embodying magnanimous feelings in the believer toward an enemy, for in christianity we are enjoined to exhibit grace in this way, "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:20">Romans  12:20</a>); that is complete victory of good over evil.<a name=131:3></a> The song of the bow is like a pillar at the beginning of the book, as embodying David's feelings towards Saul and Jonathan; and then we have the song of Jehovah's deliverance at the end of chapter 22.<a name=131:4></a> On the one hand, what the believer is through grace, how magnanimous he can be, how forgiving he can be, how gracious he can be, how able to overcome evil with good, at the same time exhibiting dependence on God in the most beautiful manner; and, on the other hand, the song of God's deliverance, for that is chapter 22, sung to Jehovah in the day that He had delivered His servant out of all his trouble and from all his enemies.<a name=131:5></a> These are like two pillars on which the whole book stands; a book which, at the same time, records the most serious sins of David.<a name=131:6></a> He is one in whom God would set out His grace, on the one hand, so that it is exhibited in him; and, on the other hand, God's deliverance.<a name=131:7></a> His faithful power in deliverance, which the believer can always reckon upon; power too in himself in the deliverance, as he could say, "By thee I have run through a troop; by my God have I leaped over a wall".<a name=131:8></a> What can a

		This book develops these thoughts and in so doing brings out the house of Saul.<a name=132:3></a> Saul is dead, signalised, as I said, in grace by David, but <i>dead</i>, and yet his house remains -- a very important thing to bear in mind.<a name=132:4></a> The house of Saul remains; it is all around us, dear brethren, at the present time.<a name=132:5></a> But David, not his house, we are told, grew continually stronger.<a name=132:6></a> That is the position.<a name=132:7></a> Of course the house of Saul had great influence, and has now; the official religious dominance all around is not to be overlooked, but, at the same time, David is becoming continually stronger.<a name=132:8></a> That obviously is to be in our souls, dear brethren, for the grace period is the faith period, and the faith period is the period in which Christ is allowed to come in so as to be <i>in us</i>.<a name=132:9></a> "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>.<a name=132:10></a> How can Christ but become continually greater, continually stronger, as scope is given to Him in the disallowance of the flesh, the body being dead?<a name=132:11></a>

		David does not ask Mephibosheth if he is Mephibosheth; he says to Ziba, "Art thou Ziba?<a name=135:9></a>" -- but "Mephibosheth", just Mephibosheth.<a name=135:10></a> David experienced this himself, his introduction to us is just "David", without any notice as to whence he is -- <i>David</i>.<a name=135:11></a> Of course he was Jesse's son, but I mean it is just "David", not "his name was David"; and Mephibosheth is "Mephibosheth"; he has a fixed place in the annals of grace.<a name=135:12></a> David calls out the name, that is all, known in heaven, just as everyone who repents is known in heaven, "Behold thy servant!<a name=135:13></a>".<a name=135:14></a> David loses no time, he proceeds at once

		David acts nobly; it is one of the brightest chapters in his history.<a name=136:4></a> The chapter is well known; it is a great gospel chapter, and rightly.<a name=136:5></a> What I want to show now is that Mephibosheth, as a subject of grace, maintains the dignity that grace accords to him.<a name=136:6></a> We all assume to be subjects of grace, but I want to show how Mephibosheth retained this sense of grace, this sense that he was an object of mercy throughout; the slander of his servant does not move him.<a name=136:7></a> The chapter outlines what he became, and the Spirit of God seems to enlarge on it.<a name=136:8></a> "Mephibosheth", David says, "shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons"; "one" of them, there are others, he is to be amongst them.<a name=136:9></a> There is nothing perfunctory about it.<a name=136:10></a> David does not seem to have any difficulty or any compunction about placing him there as one of the king's sons.<a name=136:11></a> Now Mephibosheth has a son, for there is to be a continuance of this, and, without enlarging unduly on this, there is a suggestion of productiveness on the part of the subjects of grace.<a name=136:12></a> It is a poor thing if one passes off without there being some evidence of having passed on some influence of grace here, whether in one's own family or among the saints, but I am speaking of it particularly in a spiritual sense.<a name=136:13></a> How can anyone be easy in his mind if he is passing from the scene without leaving something in the way of sons to remind people of his influence in the testimony?<a name=136:14></a>

		Mephibosheth never gave way; we are told he "neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace".<a name=138:5></a> He is maintaining his ground.<a name=138:6></a> He is not putting on religious clothes in sympathy with Absalom, he is no part of the secret service which David left; he is not mentioned in connection with it but he is publicly on David's side at the very height of Absalom's reign.<a name=138:7></a> The supreme test is coming, but he is establishing himself; he is loyal to Christ and will put on no dress, nothing at all to indicate his loyalty to Absalom: as we read here, he "neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes".<a name=138:8></a> I suppose all this was his very salvation; it would bring reproach.<a name=138:9></a> We are afraid of reproach even in our dress.<a name=138:10></a> How often do we dress to gain the respect of the worldly, to be conformed to this world, especially in feminine dress and ways!<a name=138:11></a> "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:2">Romans  12:2</a>.<a name=138:12></a> Of course Mephibosheth never acted like this in David's house, or at David's table; he is simply refusing to be conformed to Absalom's world, and his very non-conformity to it would serve to become his salvation from it.<a name=138:13></a> The more we are not conformed to this world the more we are saved from it.<a name=138:14></a> Young men are enjoined, "Love not the world" -- especially when they get married and buy their houses and their cars.<a name=138:15></a> Non-conformity to the world is our salvation in very large measure.<a name=138:16></a> We do not fit, we are objectionable to the world, and our very objectionableness is our salvation very often.<a name=138:17></a> So Mephibosheth in all those weeks or months of David's absence neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes.<a name=138:18></a> You

		But now the supreme test is coming, I want you to notice verse 25 before going on.<a name=139:6></a> The New Translation says, "as soon as Jerusalem came to meet the king".<a name=139:7></a> Jerusalem here is a great spiritual thought that the overcomer in Philadelphia understands.<a name=139:8></a> I believe that Mephibosheth is an overcomer, and we all want to be overcomers.<a name=139:9></a> The overcomer in Philadelphia is promised much; he is to go no more out, but he is to have a new name, "The name of the city of my God", the Lord Jesus says, "the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God".<a name=139:10></a> Jerusalem is stamped on him -- think of all it means!<a name=139:11></a> -- hardly a subject in Scripture more interesting than Jerusalem from its inception till the finish, the eternal thought; and it is stamped on the overcomer of our day, this very day.<a name=139:12></a> When Jerusalem came to meet the king, a remarkable expression, is Mephibosheth not to be there?<a name=139:13></a> Certainly he is to be there; he is the leading thought, the outstanding thought, in the city.<a name=139:14></a> I should like to have seen him coming down to meet the king; it is not simply the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but Jerusalem; the great king, in principle, is coming to his capital.<a name=139:15></a> Why not come to meet him?<a name=139:16></a> Mephibosheth is there.<a name=139:17></a> He is already fortified; were he not fortified he would be overcome, for the king cannot be said to be a type of Christ here.<a name=139:18></a> He is here a type of a wrongly influenced believer, and the more spiritual I am, the more damage I shall do if I am wrongly influenced.<a name=139:19></a> Mephibosheth had to face this.<a name=139:20></a> The king says to him, "Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?<a name=139:21></a>" -- a very fair question, you might say.<a name=139:22></a> David is already influenced, as the sequel shows; he is not ready to accept his word.<a name=139:23></a>

		Mephibosheth was spiritually the greatest man in Jerusalem, and yet I may be influenced against him; hence the need, as the Lord says in the great assembly gospel, of every word being established in the mouth of two or three witnesses.<a name=140:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First of all, he tells the truth about his servant, "He said, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said, I will saddle me the ass, and ride thereon, and go with the king; for thy servant is lame".<a name=140:2></a> Will any of Ziba's sons or servants help us to go to the king in the crucial time?<a name=140:3></a> No, they will never direct us heavenward; they will teach us religion, of course, but to direct the soul heavenward is another matter.<a name=140:4></a> Ziba is not doing it now, he is not aiding Mephibosheth; he was enjoined to serve him, but he is not doing it now, he is thinking of himself.<a name=140:5></a> The apostle says, "Ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake".<a name=140:6></a> What about Ziba?<a name=140:7></a> It is for his own sake; we have to watch that.<a name=140:8></a> He may serve the saints, or pretend to, but he is serving himself, and we have to watch that influence, watch anyone who does not direct us to Christ.<a name=140:9></a> He is thinking of himself.<a name=140:10></a> Paul says, "We do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:5">2 Corinthians  4:5</a>.<a name=140:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mephibosheth is maintaining grace, and one of the greatest things at the moment is to maintain in our souls the sense of grace, that we will not succumb to opposition, to unfair treatment, for the world is full of it.<a name=140:12></a> He says to the king "Do therefore what is good in thy sight.<a name=140:13></a> For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; and thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at thine own table.<a name=140:14></a> What further right therefore have I?<a name=140:15></a> and for what should I cry any more to the king?<a name=140:16></a>".<a name=140:17></a> He is a subject of mercy now, as he was before, and let us hope to be that, dear brethren, until the end, to exhibit this wonderful feature of the dispensation to the very end.<a name=140:18></a>

		The Lord Jesus says, I am still sitting on My Father's throne.<a name=141:1></a> It is grace; even in speaking to Laodicea, He is on His Father's throne administering the grace of the Father's heart, for the title "the Father" means that; it is a title that denotes grace, and the Lord is exhibiting that to the very last moment of the dispensation.<a name=141:2></a> I want to be in that, too; it is a great opportunity for us, dear brethren, to finish up in this way.<a name=141:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Mephibosheth goes on to say, "All my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; and thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at thine own table.<a name=141:4></a> What further right therefore have I?<a name=141:5></a> and for what should I cry any more to the king?<a name=141:6></a>".<a name=141:7></a> His integrity is complete; he is standing by the mercy and grace in which he was taken up, he is standing by it firmly, even in the presence of unfair treatment.<a name=141:8></a> He goes on, and the king is not moved apparently; he says, "Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?<a name=141:9></a> I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land".<a name=141:10></a> The keenest thrust!<a name=141:11></a> you might say.<a name=141:12></a> He had just been laying before the king the facts of the case, and now it is.<a name=141:13></a> Yourself and Ziba; he is put on the same level in the king's mind as Ziba as to the inheritance.<a name=141:14></a> But he says, That is not in my mind.<a name=141:15></a> He is triumphant.<a name=141:16></a> The Spirit of God tells us, it seems to me in triumphant language, "Mephibosheth said to the king, Let him even take all, since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house".<a name=141:17></a> He is a victorious believer, acting without resentment; overcoming slander, maintaining a right spirit, and asserting in the plainest language that Christ and Christ only is his object.<a name=141:18></a> He is a lover of Christ's appearing.<a name=141:19></a> As the apostle says, a crown of righteousness belongs to all those who love His appearing.<a name=141:20></a> So there is every incentive, not only for the future but in the present, to maintain the spirit of grace constantly.<a name=141:21></a>

		Well now, I shall come back to this text again for other reasons, but I go on to John to show that, whilst Luke would bring in the receptiveness of heaven, heaven's value of this glorious Person who belonged to it, John would show that He had been here amongst His own in the world.<a name=209:9></a> He says, "The world was made by him".<a name=209:10></a> John is very condensed in his opening verses (1 - 13), which are a sort of preface to his whole book.<a name=209:11></a> He combines the actual creative thought, the world in its physical form, with the moral side.<a name=209:12></a> He says, "He was in the world, and the world was made by him".<a name=209:13></a> It was not made in the moral sense but it was in its physical character.<a name=209:14></a> "And the world knew him not" -- that is the moral side.<a name=209:15></a> "He came unto his own, and his own received him not"; "his own" might be rendered, 'that which was his own', that is, it is the neuter, involving something that was His special possession, properly His.<a name=209:16></a> All right thought and feeling would recognise this, a strong expression of ownership, "And his own received him not".<a name=209:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will come back to this negative side in a moment, but I want just to dwell on the great fact of the

		matter, namely those who did receive Him.<a name=210:1></a> I will come back to the detail later, but I want to stress for the moment, dear brethren, the result of receiving Christ.<a name=210:2></a> How God watched the course of things; and He watches the course of every one of us.<a name=210:3></a> He watched the course of things in relation to Christ.<a name=210:4></a> All those thoughts that John compresses so wonderfully were in the divine mind in that wonderful course of Christ's pathway, and God would say, 'There are those who are receiving My beloved Son', <i>receiving</i> Him, not simply believing, that is mentioned too, but they are receiving Him.<a name=210:5></a> It was a matter of history, history in heaven as on earth.<a name=210:6></a> He came forth in that way, not only that they might believe for the forgiveness of sins and the like, eternal life as John presents it, but that they might <i>receive</i> this glorious Person.<a name=210:7></a> This has a present bearing, dear brethren, which I hope to come to, but I am speaking of the general position, what it was to heaven, what that history was as one after another received Him.<a name=210:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am stressing this because we have to distinguish between receiving and simply believing or being among the number known as believers, even in the fellowship, for we may be in the fellowship and be short of this properly.<a name=210:9></a> Our treatment of the brethren, our reception of the brethren, is an index as to where we are in regard of Christ, as sure as anything can be.<a name=210:10></a> He is the test of our standing and our state.<a name=210:11></a> As He draws near to us our state is exposed, whether it be directly by the Spirit, or even in His own presence here, or whether it be in the saints.<a name=210:12></a> The presence of Christ in the saints is a test to us, how we regard them, how we think of them and speak of them and treat them generally, particularly how we receive them, or whether we receive them and for what reason we receive them.<a name=210:13></a> All this is a test.<a name=210:14></a> There is no one here that is not tested, whether we are conscious of it or not.<a name=210:15></a> Very often we are not conscious of

		conditions in ourselves but others are quite cognisant of them, and it is as we observe the course of people day by day and week by week that we come to a conclusion, and I have no hesitation in saying that we should have a judgment about each other.<a name=211:1></a> It is a safe way.<a name=211:2></a> It is definitely required that we should have a judgment about one another, not a hostile judgment, not critical, but a sober estimate according to God of what is there in each person, especially what is of the work of God.<a name=211:3></a> The epistles abound with evidence of this; the apostles had a judgment about the brethren.<a name=211:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I have this verse in John particularly in view in what I have to say, "As many as received him .<a name=211:5></a>.<a name=211:6></a>.<a name=211:7></a>".<a name=211:8></a> It is not a question of collective reception although there is that.<a name=211:9></a> What times they had in the forty days of the Lord's sojourn here from the day of His resurrection to the day of His ascension!<a name=211:10></a> They were unique days.<a name=211:11></a> We have others mentioned, such as Moses' forty days on the mount with Jehovah, and Elijah's experience, and other experiences, but never such a period of forty days as those with Christ risen.<a name=211:12></a> The brethren were all ready.<a name=211:13></a> Paul omits the perturbation that Luke records because he is not speaking of assembly privilege in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, he is speaking from another point of view, namely, that Christ was indeed risen, a fact that we do well to take into our souls and keep there freshly.<a name=211:14></a> They were saying it at the beginning, "The Lord is risen indeed".<a name=211:15></a> What I am stressing now is that we might keep the thing there freshly, that He is indeed risen.<a name=211:16></a> Not that He has risen, that is not what they are saying, but that the Lord is risen; it is a present, continuous fact to be maintained freshly in our souls, and that is why the apostle brings in the appearance to Cephas and then to the twelve, and to five hundred brethren at once, to James, and to all the apostles, and then to Paul himself.<a name=211:17></a> Paul's experience, of course, must be outside

		the period of the forty days, but there it is.<a name=212:1></a> The main thought is what came into those forty days; it is not simply the doctrine of the resurrection -- that, of course, is important -- but the fact that the person is raised.<a name=212:2></a> "Now is Christ risen from the dead", says the apostle.<a name=212:3></a> "The Lord is risen indeed".<a name=212:4></a> It is a present fact, and what a fact it is.<a name=212:5></a> From the power standpoint it is the foundation of everything, for divine power wrought then and it is towards us, dear brethren.<a name=212:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I am speaking now of what ought to affect our hearts, that the Lord is risen and <i>indeed</i> He is risen.<a name=212:7></a> So that the saints were kept alive as to it, and they were ready for Him in time to come amongst them.<a name=212:8></a> We are told in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>that He presented Himself alive.<a name=212:9></a> That is a beautiful thought.<a name=212:10></a> Think of the Lord designing a certain aspect of Himself to appear before them.<a name=212:11></a> We know He appeared in other forms to others, He can do that.<a name=212:12></a> The book of Revelation shows how He can change His form, and it is a solemn act, because instead of dove's eyes, His eyes are a flame of fire.<a name=212:13></a> He could make all those changes, but Luke says He presented Himself living: "To whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered".<a name=212:14></a> All that is touching.<a name=212:15></a> John says the disciples were glad when they saw Him.<a name=212:16></a> I mention all this as to the forty days to show how the idea of receptiveness was there, the thought of it, the fact of it.<a name=212:17></a> The Lord was delightful; as He came in they were glad and He was glad, too, that they were glad, that they seized the position.<a name=212:18></a> That is John's point of view, they grasped the greatness of it and were glad.<a name=212:19></a> They were not perturbed in John's record.<a name=212:20></a> And He says, "Peace be unto you" twice.<a name=212:21></a> I believe that the Lord means that as joy; joy comes into our hearts; it is to be consolidated, we ought not to let it go, but consolidate it, hold it there, and Paul would say, "Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice", "Rejoice

		evermore".<a name=213:1></a> So that the state of receptivity of Christ was there in fulness and that is what I am aiming at now.<a name=213:2></a> They had received Him, so that one can understand with what pungency of spiritual power John would speak of this, for he was there when the Lord came in after He arose, so he says, "As many as received him .<a name=213:3></a>.<a name=213:4></a>.<a name=213:5></a>".<a name=213:6></a> How he would say, I belong to those.<a name=213:7></a> Let each of our hearts say it in honesty, that I belong to those who receive Christ, not only believe on Him or believe Him even, but receive Him.<a name=213:8></a> Then we have added by John, "To them gave he the right to be" (that is, take the place of) "children of God", not 'sons', the word is 'children'; it is a dignified word for children, that is, that we really belong to the family, are born into it, the youngest, as it were, having the same status as the eldest; there is no difference in that sense, "To those that believe on his name".<a name=213:9></a> That is not to be left out, because as John is writing this, Christ has gone to heaven and His name is here.<a name=213:10></a> That is the test at the present time, the name.<a name=213:11></a> But then the birth -- "Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God".<a name=213:12></a> What a distinction: no angel can take up this right.<a name=213:13></a> It is a question of the right; it is not here that the thing is conferred, dear brethren, that is from God's side; what is in mind here is active interest in the divine calling, in what is in the mind of God for us.<a name=213:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So John would have us always living; it is one of his main points that I live; life is active in us, so that he says it is your right, your title, to take that place.<a name=213:15></a> Why did He do it?<a name=213:16></a> -- because we received Him.<a name=213:17></a> One can understand this thought as it came in to the early christians, as the Spirit of God gave it power, for that is the principle, not only that light comes into my soul but that the Spirit of God enlarges it.<a name=213:18></a> That principle is seen really in Ezekiel's river.<a name=213:19></a> It is a very small thing at the first, it is not even called a

		river but just water, or waters in the plural, issuing from the house from under the threshold, from the right side of the house on the south side of the altar, and then a good time elapses so to say, and Ezekiel is taken round by the north gate to the outer gate, by the way that looked eastward, and he sees it again and it is larger.<a name=214:1></a> That is the principle, that is the power of expansion.<a name=214:2></a> A new thought is definitely placed in our hearts; let us let these thoughts expand, dear brethren.<a name=214:3></a> The Holy Spirit in us is, so to say, compressed.<a name=214:4></a> And that is really the secret of so much that causes sorrow; one has observed it in persons who have not the Spirit, or at least do not know the power of the Spirit.<a name=214:5></a> Let the thing expand itself.<a name=214:6></a> Paul uses that very word.<a name=214:7></a> Let your hearts expand themselves; be ye also enlarged.<a name=214:8></a> The more scope, the greater is the thought that comes into the soul; it comes in as light, too; then the Holy Spirit takes it on, faith operating and scope given to it, and it expands and expands.<a name=214:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is with the thought of the reception of Christ.<a name=214:10></a> Think of that word, the reception of Christ, that it could be applied in regard of my soul!<a name=214:11></a> How would heaven receive Him?<a name=214:12></a> Well, I want to be like that, receive Him in glory.<a name=214:13></a> Do not be ashamed.<a name=214:14></a> How can I receive Him in glory in my heart if I am ashamed of Him, ashamed to speak of Him to my companions in the works or elsewhere?<a name=214:15></a> Receive Him in glory, He is worthy of it.<a name=214:16></a> Heaven regards Him so, and so does everyone who loves Him.<a name=214:17></a> The assembly becomes expanded as Christ comes in spiritually, not actually.<a name=214:18></a> The appearings that Paul records are corporeal appearings, but I am speaking now of what is spiritual.<a name=214:19></a> It is just as real, and every time it is recognised there is expansion.<a name=214:20></a> Let our hearts expand themselves.<a name=214:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as I was saying, the divine thought of reception came in as light.<a name=214:22></a> How it would affect such as John and the others, and how the Holy Spirit has come in

	<div class="paragraph">
		from Christ in heaven, taking it up and causing it to expand.<a name=215:1></a> That is really the antidote to spiritual smallness and stuntedness; there is a great deal of that.<a name=215:2></a> Let us make full allowance, dear brethren, for a divine thought; it comes in as light and faith, but the Spirit expands it.<a name=215:3></a> There is no limit to that in a way, I mean what the thing is in itself, for Ezekiel says it was a river he could not pass over, but he does not stop there; he says it cannot be passed over.<a name=215:4></a> It is his judgment in the matter and we want to have a judgment of things; we are dealing with infinite things, let us never assume to compass them, let us give place to the Spirit and we shall be filled with all the fulness of God, but never to compass it.<a name=215:5></a> We are still creatures, but we are happy as we are subject and allow the Spirit to expand and expand the divine thoughts in us.<a name=215:6></a> We are not like the old bottles, no matter how great the expansion of thought is, the new bottle does not burst.<a name=215:7></a> The more you think over anything that has come into your soul, the more you meditate upon it, the more it expands.<a name=215:8></a> "He that has wrought us for this very thing is God", so that we are great enough for any thought which God gives us and for the Spirit to expand in us.<a name=215:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that was the state of things, the state for the reception of Christ marked the saints at the beginning and commensurate with that was this great matter that they had the right or title to take the place of children of God, and then the Spirit gave them to know and realise that they were not born of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<a name=215:10></a> That is the main thought that I had in mind, that we might get it into our souls and understand our status now, as John gives it again, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God".<a name=215:11></a>

		Now another thing comes out in Martha.<a name=216:22></a> She did receive Him and she received Him into her house.<a name=216:23></a> Well, I may do that; Simon the Pharisee also received Him into his house, but it was not because he loved Him, it was because He was in his mind somewhat of a distinguished Person, and he thought he could not go very far wrong in inviting a man so distinguished into his house.<a name=216:24></a> The Lord submitted to it,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the sequel shows that Martha was different.<a name=217:6></a> It is John that gives us the sequel of Martha, not Luke.<a name=217:7></a> She would be a poor sister in our minds had not John come to her rescue.<a name=217:8></a> He takes up every bit of the work of God, wherever it is and in whomsoever it is, and makes the most of it.<a name=217:9></a> The Spirit expands the work of God in our souls, but love also expands the work of God as we speak of it publicly.<a name=217:10></a> Paul's affections for the Corinthians were expanded and they were publicly made known, "Known and read of all men", and I think that is more like John's gospel, where we have the real Martha.<a name=217:11></a> The abstract Martha is developed into a concrete sister, serving in love, she is in her place, though it is much as it is with many of us.<a name=217:12></a> At first she received the Lord into her house, but she made it very uncomfortable for Him in the house.<a name=217:13></a> That is a poor thing, it is indeed.<a name=217:14></a> Well, the Lord accepted the invitation and the reception, and the glory came out.<a name=217:15></a> John gives you the glorious side.<a name=217:16></a> Bethany is a glory scene in Luke too, but John gives the full thought of God as to the work of Christ in that town.<a name=217:17></a> It is a love matter.<a name=217:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I am speaking now, dear brethren, of the matter of receiving, not Christ personally, but those who are like Him.<a name=217:19></a> That is the point, for in our passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>He sets a little child by Him, as much as to say, He is before your eyes objectively.<a name=217:20></a> It is not what you see every day, but it is what is

		alongside of Him, and what he is in keeping with Him.<a name=218:1></a> That is the idea.<a name=218:2></a> Now He says, "Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me".<a name=218:3></a> So that this enters into the reception of those who serve the saints; are they not worthy?<a name=218:4></a> The Lord has set them alongside of Himself.<a name=218:5></a> He says, 'Look at Me and look at him'.<a name=218:6></a> He said to Simon about the woman, 'Look at this woman.<a name=218:7></a> I am looking at her; she has qualities that are of Me'.<a name=218:8></a> It is a love matter, and of course love must enter into all divine service, however small or great.<a name=218:9></a> I wish there were more of it.<a name=218:10></a> So that is the test, it is a question of how you receive the person with whom the Lord identifies Himself.<a name=218:11></a> What you do to him you do to Christ; it is a question, as I was saying, of a state of receptivity of Christ, that is the test, not simply that a man has gift; of course that has to be respected, that is of Christ, too, and has its own place, but with this little child it is not a question of gift but of quality, likeness to Christ, and as I receive that little child I receive Christ.<a name=218:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other side is what I want to finish with.<a name=218:13></a> It is a terrible suggestion of the Lord's in the verse in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>; He says, "I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not".<a name=218:14></a> He is not saying, I have come here in the works of power or in likeness to God, representative of God, but "I am come in my Father's name" -- it is a question of the Father -- "and ye receive me not".<a name=218:15></a> All that I have been saying now enters into this verse, because we are on the very eve of the coming of the person to whom the Lord alludes, the antichrist.<a name=218:16></a> It is most solemn.<a name=218:17></a> These things are no longer prophetic thoughts that may be taken up in a sort of academic way; they are at our very doors; they exist in principle.<a name=218:18></a> Antichrist does not exist; I mean there is no suggestion of that in what the Lord says and what I have

		J.T.<a name=221:11></a> It is what is much needed, for we are so affected by judaism in our relations with one another and even in assembly procedure, that we need to be divested of it in becoming spiritual and discerning; for we are in difficult times and times of limitation.<a name=221:12></a> Much is put on externally that is wanting in spiritual depth, power and discernment.<a name=221:13></a> We need, therefore, to have discernment; for it is said here, "The spiritual discerns all things".<a name=221:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=222:2></a> Quite so; and we learn by contrast very largely.<a name=222:3></a> One has thought of the Lord's remark concerning Abraham, "This did not Abraham", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:40">John  8:40</a>.<a name=222:4></a> You may find it difficult to find a scripture to apply to any particular thing, conduct or ways current, but it helps to examine spiritual men, whether these things marked them; so the negative helps there: "This did not Abraham".<a name=222:5></a> Being the father of all believers, he is a model in that negative way, and so the 'not' here, and also in Colossians, "Have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth" (chapter 3: 2).<a name=222:6></a> That negative thought runs through this epistle; the apostle had to confine himself to certain initial or elementary features of the truth, whereas he had that which was more spiritual and was ready to bring it out when opportunity offered.<a name=222:7></a> He was compelled to be hindered in speaking to them, presenting the negative side, confining himself to certain fundamental truths; but he says, "We speak wisdom among the perfect".<a name=222:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.S.<a name=222:9></a>H.<a name=222:10></a> Perfect in the sense of being those who have arrived at giving the Spirit His place and having Christ before them?<a name=222:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=222:12></a> Yes.<a name=222:13></a> Spiritually their senses are exercised.<a name=222:14></a> The five natural senses are suggestive of spiritual completeness; the sense of perfection spiritually is that you are not wanting in the use of any of your senses, you have the use of them all.<a name=222:15></a> Natural features often dull the exercise of our spiritual sensibilities.<a name=222:16></a> So "the perfect" would mean, I think, that a brother can be trusted in his exercise, having all his senses and not dominated by natural feelings; you can trust him with the greatest things.<a name=222:17></a> One great need in assembly service, order and care, is trustworthiness, that the Lord can entrust us with things.<a name=222:18></a> You would

		F.I.<a name=223:2></a> You have in mind that spiritual discernment is necessary to us in the two important features of reception in relation to young persons or fresh persons and recovery in regard to those who fail?<a name=223:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=223:4></a> Well, that is an important side of our subject -- the discernment of things and persons.<a name=223:5></a> The word 'things' is used, but then the spiritual man is said to be beyond the discernment of anyone; he is linked on with what is eternal, "the depths of God".<a name=223:6></a> Well, you cannot fathom those depths, and yet you can see generally he is an honest person, a reliable person, but he is beyond the range of almost anyone, even Satan, which is an immense advantage.<a name=223:7></a> No one discerns him, but he discerns all things and is able to name what he sees.<a name=223:8></a> The first principle is, I suppose, seen in Adam naming the animals, discerning the qualities; so a spiritual man is able to discern what comes up by examination; he is not in haste, he is careful in his examination, but he finally reaches a definite judgment about a thing and he stands on that.<a name=223:9></a> He is a most useful man, not marked by vacillation.<a name=223:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.I.<a name=223:11></a> In connection with the naming of the animals, "God .<a name=223:12></a>.<a name=223:13></a>.<a name=223:14></a> brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:19">Genesis  2:19</a>); so God is taking account of every spiritual movement.<a name=223:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=226:5></a>H.<a name=226:6></a> Will you say a word in regard to this matter of experience?<a name=226:7></a> I was thinking of what it says of Paul, in calling over the elders of Ephesus, and later saying to them, "Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers, to shepherd the assembly of God", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>.<a name=226:8></a> Would it be right to link up this thought of experience you are mentioning with the thought of elders in a practical way amongst us?<a name=226:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=226:10></a> Yes, indeed; that is one leading thought in it.<a name=226:11></a> So with Paul and Barnabas it is said, "Having chosen them elders in each assembly" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:23">Acts  14:23</a>); they themselves chose them; not as in Jerusalem in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6">Acts  6</a>, where the deacons were to be chosen from among themselves "full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom".<a name=226:12></a> Paul and Barnabas did not leave it in that way, they chose them elders in every assembly, meaning that they would discern what the men were; for in that very chapter Paul saw that the man who was lame, "who had never walked", "had faith to be healed", showing the power the apostles had to discern what was there.<a name=226:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in selecting elders, they would exercise that power as to the men they would select; they would discern that they were suitable.<a name=226:14></a> They would discover these elders by their ability to discern, as shown in Paul in that chapter.<a name=226:15></a> Then in chapter 20, which is further on in the history of the testimony, the Holy Spirit had set them as overseers.<a name=226:16></a> The inference there is that the Holy Spirit has perfect first-hand knowledge of everybody; it is what is in the man that has to be discerned.<a name=226:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=227:4></a> That is the same idea; where you get the Holy Spirit acting in that way, that is the point, not that He does not act in everything, but God comes down to our way of thinking.<a name=227:5></a> He knows us perfectly: "He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:27">Romans  8:27</a>.<a name=227:6></a> So where the Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", that implies, amongst other things, that the Spirit knows that the facts show that we are trustworthy men; but there was more than that needed for missionary service amongst the heathen.<a name=227:7></a> How few missionaries today think of it!<a name=227:8></a> The Holy Spirit alone knew what was needed.<a name=227:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=264:1></a> What is in mind to be considered is sonship from the gospel of John.<a name=264:2></a> The passage in Isaiah is intended to bear on the last two scriptures read in John's gospel, to bring out the bearing of the children which God gave to Christ.<a name=264:3></a> The first scripture is intended to bring before us plainly the subject of the children of God; that relationship characterises John's gospel rather than that of sons; the word is 'children', not 'sons'.<a name=264:4></a> It refers to all christians, not in relation to our growth, for which another word is used, but as those belonging to the family of God, born of God.<a name=264:5></a> It belongs to the prefatory part of the gospel, showing the end reached through the incarnation, that those who received Christ were entitled to take this place.<a name=264:6></a> It might be enquired why sonship is not in mind, in view of chapter 20 where we are said to be brethren of Christ and that His Father is our Father and His God our God.<a name=264:7></a> That passage certainly involves sons, not children, for Christ is not said to be a child in the sense in which we are said to be children in this passage.<a name=264:8></a> Sonship is by adoption in our case, in His by birth; whereas we are children by birth.<a name=264:9></a> So that the answer as to the use of the word 'children' here, a dignified word, is that, in the main, the gospel has our present position here, as representative of God, in mind, in view doubtless of the apostasy; at the beginning of christianity, apostasy among the Jews, and now, at the end, apostasy among nominal christians.<a name=264:10></a> So that it finds out those who are real.<a name=264:11></a> Profession in itself is of no value; there must be the evidence of life, but life in the sense of being born of God, belonging to the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=265:6></a> Well, the idea of the reception of Christ is condensed in John; we need to go to Luke for the enlargement of it; it is said in Luke that the time of His receiving up had come.<a name=265:7></a> God indicating in the record that, whatever men were thinking of Him, there was a warm reception awaiting Him in heaven: He was received up in glory, we are told.<a name=265:8></a> Luke also affords examples of the reception of Christ with very little warmth attached to them.<a name=265:9></a> John would indicate here that the reception of Christ by those who believed was genuine, accompanied by the work of God, by the divine birth, in the saints who were born, as it is said, "not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God".<a name=265:10></a> As coming to His own, to what was His own, namely Israel, it would appear that their inability to receive Him must have occasioned grief to the Lord, and corresponding pleasure in those who did receive Him.<a name=265:11></a> It would mean, as was remarked, the genuine reception of Christ.<a name=265:12></a> There were different presentations of Him as they came to Him and received Him, but it was genuine, as in the incidents we have recorded in the gospel of persons who received Him.<a name=265:13></a>

		F.S.<a name=266:3></a>M.<a name=266:4></a> What would the difference be between the thought of receiving Him and believing on His name?<a name=266:5></a> Both appear to be our side, whereas God's side is "born of God".<a name=266:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=266:7></a> "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name".<a name=266:8></a> I would say that believing on His name would be the recognition of what came out in Him by way of testimony.<a name=266:9></a> The signs, of course, called attention to Him; we are told in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>that "many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought.<a name=266:10></a> But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man".<a name=266:11></a> I suppose that would mean that there were those then, as in our day, who received Him in a merely mental way because of certain signs, but they were not genuine, they could not be said to be born of God.<a name=266:12></a> There are many who believe today through the testimony of christianity generally in this same way, but they are not trustworthy; so that believing on His name here would be accompanied by genuineness, as it is said, "Who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God".<a name=266:13></a> That is how I would take that; perhaps you have more to say about it.<a name=266:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=267:11></a> That is the thought, and earlier in the gospel of Luke (chapter 9) the Lord sent messengers before His face to prepare His way and they came to a village of the Samaritans, and they did not receive Him because His face was as though He would go to Jerusalem.<a name=267:12></a> That is another important feature in Luke, that the direction of the Lord's face at that time implied His death; and, whether the Samaritans had that in mind or not, the fact is there, they did not receive Him because His face was towards Jerusalem.<a name=267:13></a> And I think that is pretty much how matters stand today; it is a question of whether our faces are towards Jerusalem.<a name=267:14></a> If we follow in the Lord's steps in that sense, we shall not be received either.<a name=267:15></a> We are to go all the way, for that is the idea; the Lord was going all the way involved in His mission.<a name=267:16></a> If we go all the way we shall not be received.<a name=267:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=269:12></a> Well, that refers to what we are saying as to those who receive Him.<a name=269:13></a> I think the reception of His testimony, that is, Christ's testimony, would be that He was representative of God, and setting that to his seal would mean a man is thoroughly committed to the matter.<a name=269:14></a> He sets it to his seal -- he will not put his hand to anything else -- that God is true.<a name=269:15></a> It would imply what we are saying that he is one of the children of God, but he is an outstanding person; he has received His testimony, and that implies God is true, for Christ represents God in His testimony.<a name=269:16></a> God's giving the Spirit without measure would allude to Christ, to how Christ received the Spirit, but it also alludes to how the Spirit has come into christianity.<a name=269:17></a> At Pentecost He came in fully and wholly, no individual believer could receive Him in that fulness; it is a question, I apprehend, of how He is here in the assembly.<a name=269:18></a> So the verse contemplates christianity in the fullest sense, a man having set to his seal the testimony that God is true.<a name=269:19></a> I think it brings out

		Joseph fulfils his charge.<a name=327:9></a> Matthew makes much more of Joseph than of Mary; Luke more of Mary, but the gospel of Matthew is the assembly gospel, and contains great general principles of government, and the principle is the father and mother, but in the case of Jesus it is the little Child before the mother.<a name=327:10></a> Matthew develops the idea of children, and shows that they become the means of perfecting praise, which is a remarkable word from the lips of Jesus Himself, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established praise", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8:2">Psalm  8:2</a>.<a name=327:11></a> Perfected it.<a name=327:12></a> We hardly get that until we come to the New Testament, but it is presented by David, the sweet psalmist of Israel, but the perfecting of praise is to be in the mouths of babes and sucklings.<a name=327:13></a> So the mouths should be cared for and the filth of the street should not be allowed to pass in and out of them, and in

		I desire to speak about divine authority and how it is accepted and submitted to so that God will be with us.<a name=340:1></a> It appears in Matthew particularly, as I hope to show from the verses in the last chapter.<a name=340:2></a> It appears throughout all the gospels, even in John, who quotes the Lord as saying, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, <i>he</i> it is that loves me".<a name=340:3></a> No one loves Christ save as he observes His commandments.<a name=340:4></a> The profession is of little value save as it is accompanied by the observance of the Lord's commandments.<a name=340:5></a> The observance of His commandments throughout is made the test of spirituality and gift, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment".<a name=340:6></a> That is 1 Corinthians, so that the question of love to Christ is tested by obedience, and obedience is of prime importance, especially as the great apostle speaks in his epistle about the curse falling on those who do not love our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=340:7></a>

		Matthew brings in the idea of authority peculiarly, for it is the royal gospel, in which Christ is seen as the great King, and Jerusalem as the city of the great King.<a name=340:8></a> It is the gospel in which we are told that He went up into a mountain and His disciples came to Him.<a name=340:9></a> It is not said that He invited them, but that they came, implying that it was a sacrifice to them to reach Him, for going up a mountain involves sacrifice, and is testing to our strength of heart.<a name=340:10></a> He sat down and opened His mouth and taught them, and we read that "he taught them as having authority, and not as their scribes", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#7:29">Matthew  7:29</a>.<a name=340:11></a>

		Paul speaks of the obedience of faith, which is essential to the assembly.<a name=341:3></a> The lordship of Christ is presented in Matthew in order to promote obedience, indeed to enforce obedience, so that in the last chapter we have an angel who speaks with authority, "Behold, I have told you", conveying that God was there.<a name=341:4></a> It is an angel of the Lord, not just an angel, but one who can speak with authority, as appears in the end of verse 7: "Behold, I have told you".<a name=341:5></a> Any word that comes to our souls with this authority is intended to affect us.<a name=341:6></a> God has the means of impressing us with His authority, so we read of this angel, in verse 3: "And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow".<a name=341:7></a> This is to impress us with the authority and the means of enforcing it.<a name=341:8></a> It continues, "And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men".<a name=341:9></a> Such was the divine power there.<a name=341:10></a> This is no trivial matter, no passing event merely to be spoken of, but it is to affect men.<a name=341:11></a> He says to the women, "Fear not <i>ye</i>, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one", indicating that they were not ashamed of His reproach; they are accepting His crucifixion and the One crucified.<a name=341:12></a> This is very touching and is to reassure the hearts of these women that the look like lightning did not refer to them.<a name=341:13></a> Under that look was the knowledge of what they were seeking.<a name=341:14></a> The angel knew, and it really is divine knowledge.<a name=341:15></a> The Lord would impress everyone here that He knows.<a name=341:16></a> One of the most comforting words in Revelation is from the Lord's lips, "I know", alluding especially to what was creditable to the saints.<a name=341:17></a> If there be that which is discreditable, He knows that too, and will not fail to

		We have often noted that Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God talked with him: "A pillar of stone, and poured on it a drink-offering, and poured oil on it".<a name=350:10></a> Instead of the altar earlier, with no drink-offering, here a drink-offering is poured on it for God's satisfaction.<a name=350:11></a> In the earlier incident Jacob was thinking of his own things, and what God would do for him for his own satisfaction, but now he is thinking of God's satisfaction, and that speaks of the position of the assembly, for God would have us reach the point where we are sensible that God is pleased with us.<a name=350:12></a> Jacob anoints the pillar with oil.<a name=350:13></a> Properly speaking, only that with which God is pleased can be anointed, as we see in perfection in Jesus.<a name=350:14></a> The Spirit came upon Him and God said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight".<a name=350:15></a> So that what is pleasing to God is anointed, and what is anointed is to be used in the dignity of service; therefore Jacob called the name of the place where He talked with him Bethel.<a name=350:16></a> He renames it, and it is now more the house of God to him than ever before.<a name=350:17></a> How many have such an experience?<a name=350:18></a> It is a second

		J.T.<a name=394:1></a> In order to see the bearing of this chapter and those following, we should note that chapters 11 and 12 bring priesthood and kingship into evidence, persons coming before us who were, in the main, suitable for the work of God, for God generally uses persons suitable for the work He appoints them.<a name=394:2></a> Whereas here you have persons who are said to do evil in the sight of Jehovah, and yet God uses them, so that He raised up a saviour for Israel (see verse 5) and the saving was through Joash and Jeroboam the son of Joash (chapter 14: 23 - 27).<a name=394:3></a> It is said that Joash did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and yet we are told that three times did he beat the king of Syria, and recovered the cities of Israel, and it was indicated to him how he was to do it.<a name=394:4></a> In regard to Jeroboam, his son, we are told that he warred and recovered for Israel that which had belonged to Judah in Damascus and in Hamath (chapter 14: 28).<a name=394:5></a> So that we see that, while on the one hand, God carried on His work through capable persons in keeping with that work, yet, on the other hand, He uses persons not characteristically marked by suitability, the question here being sympathy with His people as in verses 4 and 23 of chapter 13, and verses 26 and 27 of chapter 14.<a name=394:6></a> So He acts sovereignly.<a name=394:7></a>

		These verses will suffice to show how the thought of the assembly develops.<a name=422:1></a> The Lord had spoken of the assembly after Peter's confession of Him, saying, "On this rock I will build my assembly", and the thought is then announced that it should be invulnerable against the gates of hell.<a name=422:2></a> Having that in view, as well as other scriptures, I thought it would be helpful to consider as to whether we understand what it is to assemble.<a name=422:3></a> In moving about, one discerns that saints have more the thought of a congregation in their minds than of an assembly.<a name=422:4></a> The idea of a clergyman having sprung up in the history of the church outwardly, the thought of a congregation has almost universally taken the place of the thought of the assembly, and many who are breaking bread have scarcely any different thought from that.<a name=422:5></a> The idea of a congregation is a number of people together without any special responsibility, the responsibility being vested in one or two.<a name=422:6></a> The principle of a clergyman fosters this, and depends upon it, whereas the thought of an assembly is that each one has a share in things; it is mutual.<a name=422:7></a> We come together, sharing mutually what obligations or what privileges there may be.<a name=422:8></a> The Lord's thought was that people should be found in local companies taking up assembly character, so that each one should be there intelligently and with a sense of responsibility as having the mutual state of things at heart.<a name=422:9></a> Thus they deliberate, because "the gates of hell" supposes a counsel of evil against the thought of God.<a name=422:10></a>

		advantage against us.<a name=423:1></a> The conditions indicated at Corinth exposed the saints to Satan having an advantage over them, and the apostle says, "We are not ignorant of his thoughts".<a name=423:2></a> Now, if the saints are in a position to know the very thoughts of Satan, you may be sure that he can get no advantage.<a name=423:3></a> If a general has the means of discovering not only the counsels, but also the very thoughts of his antagonist, what can the enemy do?<a name=423:4></a> Hence the king of Syria was discomfited, because the king of Israel knew his thoughts; Elisha the prophet could tell him the words which the king of Syria spoke in his bed-chamber.<a name=423:5></a> I think it is important to take up the thought of the assembly in that way, because we are the assembly militant.<a name=423:6></a> Of course there is the side of privilege, but the position today is the saints are the assembly militant, and there are the means by which we can tell the very counsel and thoughts of the enemy, "He that is spiritual discerneth all things .<a name=423:7></a>.<a name=423:8></a>.<a name=423:9></a> We have the mind of Christ", that is, the thinking faculty.<a name=423:10></a> I do not think the apostle meant to convey that every Christian could say that, but the spiritual discerns all things; he knows Satan's thoughts, as well as the thoughts of men.<a name=423:11></a> What can the enemy do with such a company who take counsel together?<a name=423:12></a> The advantage of an assembly is that we can take counsel together.<a name=423:13></a> The Lord said, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", meaning that <i>we</i> should take up the matters connected with His name.<a name=423:14></a> He leaves <i>us</i> to do it, only He supports us in the doing of it; so that the meetings in which brethren confer and take counsel together are of great importance.<a name=423:15></a> It supposes ability to look around and see that in which the enemy might attack.<a name=423:16></a> At Corinth, the man had judged himself, but they were not restoring him quickly enough.<a name=423:17></a>

		We are together now on the line that comes in in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:11">Acts  20:11</a>.<a name=425:6></a> In the beginning it was an unbroken discourse of Paul, but after they had broken bread they <i>conversed</i>; as if the apostle would carry on the mind of God, but others spoke.<a name=425:7></a> Coming together "in assembly" is for the breaking of bread, but in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>you have, "If the whole assembly come together into one place"; there it is for ministry.<a name=425:8></a> It is not 'all of you assembled', but the whole assembly coming together into one place, for the exercise of gift or ministry, and the gift of prophecy being in exercise would bring to light what was there.<a name=425:9></a> If one came in who was unconverted, the secrets of his heart would be made manifest, and he would report that God is in you of a truth.<a name=425:10></a> The apostle does not say, If ye be come together in assembly; it is a continuation of chapter 11 in a way, but it has not the same official character.<a name=425:11></a> As convened now we are not together in assembly; it is more in the nature of a conversation, or ministry.<a name=425:12></a> Then it goes on: "When ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine .<a name=425:13></a>.<a name=425:14></a>.<a name=425:15></a>"; each of you has something; that would be an open meeting, but what we are at today is not that; it is more like the conversing.<a name=425:16></a>
