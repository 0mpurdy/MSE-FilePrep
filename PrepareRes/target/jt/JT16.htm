		Chapter 5 contemplates figuratively that the believer is raised up by the word of Christ into the sphere of eternal life; in chapter 6, we have the food that sustains him in that sphere.<a name=1:6></a> The gift of the Holy Spirit underlies all this.<a name=1:7></a> He creates desire in the believer for food.<a name=1:8></a> But there must be the laying aside of all malice, guile, hypocrisies, etc.<a name=1:9></a>, and then, "as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation", (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:1">1 Peter  2:1</a>,2).<a name=1:10></a>

		<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:37">Genesis  41:37</a> - 49
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:1></a> The book of Genesis affords much instruction as to food.<a name=3:2></a> All creatures have to be sustained by the Creator, and so in chapter 1 we are told that God, having created man, cattle, fowl, etc.<a name=3:3></a>, provided food for them.<a name=3:4></a> To man He gave "every herb producing seed that is on the whole earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree producing seed" (verse 29); and to the cattle, fowl and creeping things He gave "every green herb for food" (verse 30).<a name=3:5></a> The entire provision was vegetable; the carnivora were not recognised, being notably a development after sin entered into the world.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After the fall we get the death of animals, implied in the skins by which God clothed Adam and Eve, and seen definitely in Abel's offering to God; but only after the deluge is flesh allowed as food for men.<a name=3:7></a> This would enhance man's dominance in the creation, and strengthen him in the heavier responsibilities now placed upon him; not only over the lower creatures, but also in regard to his own race, this domination was to be maintained.<a name=3:8></a> The section of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41">Genesis  41</a>- 47 now before us presents the subject of food in the most general bearing.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=3:10></a>H.<a name=3:11></a> And it would indicate that the present period is the greatest day of food, corresponding with the "seven years of great plenty", (chapter 41:29).<a name=3:12></a> There has never been such bounty in the history of God's dealings with the world, and I suppose there never will be again.<a name=3:13></a> The Spirit's day would exceed all in this respect.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> Food puts great moral power into the hands of him who controls it.<a name=3:16></a> The present time is, therefore, one of the exercise of moral power in Christ.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=4:1></a> How do you apply "the seven years of famine" today; and in what sense do we go to Joseph for food?<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=4:3></a>H.<a name=4:4></a> They go along with the years of plenty which result from the Lord being exalted and the Spirit being sent down from heaven.<a name=4:5></a> At Pentecost three thousand souls were brought to the Lord.<a name=4:6></a> What an abundant pouring out of supply from heaven there was on that day!<a name=4:7></a> It was adequate to satisfy every living thing.<a name=4:8></a> Parallel with that there was the fact that man, in himself, is without supply, and that will work out in its full character when the Spirit is withdrawn.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=4:10></a> Would the moral power of which you spoke be seen in Paul?<a name=4:11></a> Would the ministry of the assembly be in line with the richness and abundance administered in the day of the Spirit?<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> It would, I am sure.<a name=4:14></a> It is Christ exalted among the Gentiles, as typified in Joseph.<a name=4:15></a> It is through Paul's ministry that He is known thus, and in this position the food supply is in His hand, and it is administered to Israel and to all.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.G.<a name=4:17></a>T.<a name=4:18></a> There was plenty in Egypt, but God brought it under control.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:20></a> There is no control of the food in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>and 9.<a name=4:21></a> It is a question of what there was.<a name=4:22></a> There was, no doubt, plenty of it growing up out of the earth.<a name=4:23></a> Then in chapter 9:3 it is said, "Every moving thing that liveth shall be good for you".<a name=4:24></a> But in the chapters before us all is in control.<a name=4:25></a> This involves power wielded by Joseph through which his brethren are brought to light and set up in relation to himself and to each other.<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B-w.<a name=4:27></a> Is it the dispensing of food under control?<a name=4:28></a> Is it dispensational in that sense?<a name=4:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:30></a> Yes, it is the day of the Spirit.<a name=4:31></a> There was a wonderful supply at Pentecost, but then what we have here typifies all that being under the control of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ not only in heaven, but among the Gentiles.<a name=5:1></a> At Pentecost the supply was at Jerusalem, but what is before us contemplates Israel having to go down to Egypt to get the food from Joseph.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=5:3></a> Do you connect the idea of control in chapter 3 with the tree of life?<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:5></a> The tree of life was prohibited there.<a name=5:6></a> The idea of the control of food is that it is there to be administered according to wisdom.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=5:8></a>H.<a name=5:9></a> It has to come through certain channels to which God would call attention.<a name=5:10></a> It is delightful to think of the Lord as the One to whom all attention is drawn through the very want in the world.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:12></a> One great thought stressed in this typical instruction is that universal attention is called to Christ.<a name=5:13></a> He is rejected by the Jews, but they and all are compelled to go to Him for the means of sustenance.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.G.<a name=5:15></a>T.<a name=5:16></a> So that the control of food enhances His position.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:18></a> It affords Him great moral power.<a name=5:19></a> Chapter 47 shows the result of this; not only is need met, but the Egyptians and their land were bought for Pharaoh.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=5:21></a> Would the idea of control be that it is made available and put into the right channels?<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:23></a> That is the thought, and the first salient result is to bring the brethren of Joseph to light, to put them together and show their relation to him.<a name=5:24></a> Then all the Egyptians are brought directly under Pharaoh through it.<a name=5:25></a> The instruction in all this, as applied at the present time and in the future, is very evident.<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=5:27></a>W.<a name=5:28></a> The food is under control during the seven years of plenty as well as during the seven years of famine.<a name=5:29></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:1></a> You mean that it has been gathered up and cared for; though it came up in handfuls, it was not wasted.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=6:3></a> It was stored "in the cities".<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:5></a> The cities are suggestive of safe-keeping and of the means of administration locally.<a name=6:6></a> But, generally, the food was administered according to the wisdom of Joseph, for his position was based on the fact of his great wisdom, as able to reveal the secret of Pharaoh's dreams.<a name=6:7></a> The instruction brings out what Christ is, typically; because the advent of Joseph in Genesis is spiritual.<a name=6:8></a> As soon as Joseph was born, Jacob proposed to leave Padan-Aram.<a name=6:9></a> That is the idea.<a name=6:10></a> Joseph causes movement out of the world; and in the presence of Esau he has precedence over his mother (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#33:7">Genesis  33:7</a>); then he is specially loved by his father.<a name=6:11></a> So that his is a history which in its very inception is spiritual, and causes movement out of the world; accordingly he acquired immense moral power in his father's house, and in the prison; and now, as in the house of Pharaoh, he has it universally.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=6:13></a>H.<a name=6:14></a> These are the lines upon which he is advanced: "Shall we find one as this, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?<a name=6:15></a>" There has to be care to apprehend what the Lord is giving and to gather it up; and then the administration of it has to be governed by wisdom from Himself.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:17></a> It says, "In the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls.<a name=6:18></a> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years that was in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities; the food of the fields of the city, which were round about it, he laid up in it.<a name=6:19></a> And Joseph laid up corn as sand of the sea exceeding much, until they left off numbering, for it was without number".<a name=6:20></a> There was volume, but great care is shown in gathering it up and placing it in the cities.<a name=6:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=7:7></a> "He laid up in it".<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=7:9></a> So that in the seven years of plenty we have great spiritual movement, but it takes seven years of famine to bring about appreciation of it on our side.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=7:11></a>H.<a name=7:12></a> You have the giving from heaven, which is so wonderfully abundant; and on the other hand, there has to be the process of appropriation with each one of us.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:14></a> We should notice the care shown here; although there was such abundance, nothing was to be lost.<a name=7:15></a> All was garnered.<a name=7:16></a> If the Lord is pleased to give volume, it ought not to be treated lightly; it ought to be garnered.<a name=7:17></a> If it is not needed now, it will be later on.<a name=7:18></a> You get times of plenty and times of famine.<a name=7:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=7:20></a> What would be the idea of garnering now?<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:22></a> I was thinking of Samuel.<a name=7:23></a> "Jehovah .<a name=7:24></a>.<a name=7:25></a>.<a name=7:26></a> let none of his words fall to the ground" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#3:19">1 Samuel  3:19</a>) Scripture says.<a name=7:27></a> I think there is a principle there.<a name=7:28></a> His words must have been of value; and if they did not fall to the ground, they must have fallen into some hearts.<a name=7:29></a> It is a question of whether we retain in our hearts the things ministered, or let them go.<a name=7:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=7:31></a>M.<a name=7:32></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>they gathered up the fragments and filled twelve baskets.<a name=7:33></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:6></a> Yes.<a name=8:7></a> The idea of "the faith" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:5">Acts  16:5</a>) is that the hearts of the saints are receptacles for what God affords.<a name=8:8></a> "The faith" is that which is treasured and held in our souls by faith.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=8:10></a> Would you say that the seven plenteous years were the result of the exaltation of Joseph?<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:12></a> They were determined.<a name=8:13></a> Everything that has come out in Christ was determined, including His death.<a name=8:14></a> All is a question of divine determination; here the matter was revealed to Pharaoh.<a name=8:15></a> Joseph came into general evidence by the wisdom that God gave him to reveal the secret.<a name=8:16></a> The whole mind of God began to take form as Christ became man.<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=8:18></a>H.<a name=8:19></a> There is not merely the fact of His exaltation, but the path of moral worth whereby He reached it.<a name=8:20></a> What comes down is really what has been displayed in the Lord from the manger to the cross and to the glory.<a name=8:21></a> He is the fruitful field whence all comes.<a name=8:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=162:1></a> We have already considered the famines in the times of Abraham and Isaac, and the famine which was universal, with which Joseph had to do in Egypt.<a name=162:2></a> I think the Lord helped us to see that the effect of the famine in Egypt was to bring the brethren to light; and, as applying it to the present time, to bring into evidence the Lord's people in their relation to Him.<a name=162:3></a> The present pressure is to bring to light those related to Christ as Joseph's brethren were related to him, so that they might be marked off from this world.<a name=162:4></a> We also noted that Jacob, in sending his sons to Egypt for food the second time, said, "Buy us a <i>little</i> food" (<a href="../bible/Genesis..htm#43:2">Genesis.  43:2</a>), as though he accepted the reduction which the famine involved.<a name=162:5></a> This has a special significance now, for in the stress of the moment the Lord would have His people accept reduction, which means inward expansion.<a name=162:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#6">Judges  6</a>there is a famine, or rather a scarcity of food mentioned, but that was rather in the character of an oppression; whereas this book of Ruth begins with a famine and the effect of it on a certain family.<a name=162:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=198:1></a> The New Testament alludes to this section of scripture more than once, and throws light on it, especially the reference to it in <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:17">James  5:17</a>: "Elias was a man of like passions to us, and he prayed with prayer that it should not rain; and it did not rain upon the earth three years and six months; and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to spring forth".<a name=198:2></a> James brings it into our own times, and shows how famine or similar circumstances may arise and come about in the world in answer to prayer; that is, the Lord's people may take account of things from God's point of view and pray.<a name=198:3></a> The answer may be in the form of certain governmental conditions arising and affecting the saints who go through those circumstances as Elijah did according to our chapter.<a name=198:4></a> Then further, prayer by Elijah brings about rain, and so the cessation of the famine or pressure.<a name=198:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=198:10></a> I think there is.<a name=198:11></a> In that section of Revelation an angel appears at the golden altar, with "a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he might give efficacy to the prayers of all saints" (chapter 8:3), and special judgments follow; it may be that the fearful condition that now exists has arisen through the exercises of the saints; but then we have to go through the circumstances ourselves, as Elijah did.<a name=198:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=233:1></a> The subject before us is introduced in chapter 6: "And it came to pass after this that Ben-hadad, king of Syria, gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria.<a name=233:2></a> And there was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was worth eighty silver pieces, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung five silver pieces" (verse 24).<a name=233:3></a> The situation was so dreadful that two women bargained to eat their offspring; one of them addressed the king of Israel and said, "This woman said to me, Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son to-morrow.<a name=233:4></a> And we boiled my son, and ate him; and I said to her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she had hidden her son" (verses 28,29).<a name=233:5></a> The Spirit calls our attention to the repulsive food that was available, and to its great cost.<a name=233:6></a> The occasion of this famine was not providential, as an act of God directly, but was caused by the Syrian army.<a name=233:7></a> It especially exposes the king of Israel, who, while he pretended to feel things, having put on sackcloth, was a murderer; then his captain was an unbeliever in the direct testimony of God.<a name=233:8></a> So that the situation was one of evil against evil; but with all that, the prophet Elisha was seated in his house, and the elders sat with him.<a name=233:9></a> That was another position in Samaria to be taken into account.<a name=233:10></a> Then, as completing the picture, we have these four leprous men outside of the gate.<a name=233:11></a> It is for us to compare this state of things with what is current today, and to see that whilst God is over all that is transpiring, the famine condition has arisen not by His withholding food, for there

		A.F.<a name=234:2></a>M.<a name=234:3></a> You were saying this afternoon that the key to the relieving of this awful position was with individuals who did something; and you referred to the exercises of these four leprous men.<a name=234:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=234:5></a> That is what I think we may see.<a name=234:6></a> The general features of the famine are seen in chapter 6.<a name=234:7></a> God is shut out as far as those in authority are concerned.<a name=234:8></a> The king of Israel was a murderer ready to take off Elisha's head; and another king, Ben-hadad, is outside with all his army.<a name=234:9></a> We have thus a set of circumstances brought about by human wickedness.<a name=234:10></a> But in the midst of this is Elisha representing the mind of God; then there are four lepers outside the gate who, in the midst of all these things have no status at all, and we have to understand whom they represent, which is seen largely in what they do.<a name=234:11></a> They become capable of announcing glad tidings, as we shall see; they are marked off as persons who reason out things -- putting two and two together, as we say, and rightly concluding, as children of wisdom, what is the best course -- indeed, the only course -- to take.<a name=234:12></a> There is this and that way to go, but death would be the certain result of taking either.<a name=234:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=251:1></a> Those who have looked into the subject of famines will know that the prophets refer very extensively to it, but none of them gives a more concrete example of famine than Joel.<a name=251:2></a> We have famine conditions presented here, in remarkable severity, without the actual use of the word 'famine'; the instrumentality, too, is fourfold, namely, the palmer-worm, locust, canker-worm, and caterpillar; one after the other, all were employed in order to make the thing complete.<a name=251:3></a>

		What is particularly important in chapter 30 is that Jacob proposed to leave Padan-Aram when Joseph was born; that is to say, that there was one child in the family who suggested Christ.<a name=315:8></a> Joseph, in a sense, is the spiritual link between God and the family, so that there was spiritual movement as soon as Joseph was born.<a name=315:9></a> If we keep this in mind I think we shall get help all through this subject; it is Christ coming in in the type, and later actually.<a name=315:10></a> In Joseph there is movement and ultimate recovery to a spiritual standard.<a name=315:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=380:6></a> Moses did that, Jehovah having generally directed it.<a name=380:7></a> It is a distribution of wisdom; in the curtains Gershon had a lighter burden to carry; these were not so heavy to carry as the boards, pillars, etc.<a name=380:8></a> Merari had the heaviest burden; there is consideration in wisdom and in love to provide more for a servant according to his work.<a name=380:9></a> If a man has to take a long journey to reach the field of his labours, you would give him more money than to one going a shorter distance; that is the way this type works out.<a name=380:10></a> The saints ought to think of these things as interested in the work of God.<a name=380:11></a> Thus although the first part of the offerings here are not on the level of those for the dedication of the altar, still they are of great importance because you cannot expect burdens to be carried unless you help the carriers.<a name=380:12></a> In other words, if we wish the work of God to prosper we must provide these material things for the workers.<a name=380:13></a>
