	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> The subject proposed is, I may say, cumulative, and it is essential to the completion of certain lines of truth that have been before the Lord's people for some years; doctrines and principles all bearing on the service of God.<a name=1:4></a> <i>It is thought that spirituality, as the Lord may help us to consider it, will be seen as essential to the application of what has been before us</i> .<a name=1:5></a> We are told that which is first is natural, afterwards that which is spiritual.<a name=1:6></a> So that the spiritual is the final thought, that is, it enters into the final thought of God, our eternal portion, and we ourselves will be marked by spirituality; as raised, our bodies will be spiritual, or if quickened, as alive and remaining when the Lord comes, they will be spiritual.<a name=1:7></a> So that in view of our final portion -- our being with the Lord -- it seems that this subject should be formally looked into.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as regards the present time, in the epistles to the Corinthians, which are corrective and instructive as to the service of God, the subject of spirituality is stressed.<a name=1:9></a> The apostle says to the Corinthians, for instance, that he could not speak to them as unto spiritual, a very humbling thought; he had to speak to them as unto babes in Christ: that is, they had the full Christian status, but were wanting in spirituality and hence were depriving themselves of the best and most blessed thoughts of God.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One need not say that this latter thought is solemn, because unless spirituality be developed, however much we may take things in mentally, we are not really profiting by them, and perhaps we may be better off without them; but, as having them, it is obvious that we

	<div class="paragraph">
		should have before us this matter of spirituality.<a name=2:1></a> Then as to administrative service -- of which there is much need in our care meetings, and assembly meetings for discipline -- spirituality is a leading necessary feature; it shuts out personal feelings in these matters.<a name=2:2></a> Paul's word to the Corinthians is that "the spiritual discerns all things, and <i>he</i> is discerned of no one", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:15">1 Corinthians  2:15</a>.<a name=2:3></a> That is, in the administration of divine things the principle of the mystery is always present, everything is not compassed, especially as to those under discipline, they are unable to discern.<a name=2:4></a> The spiritual man retains inscrutability in measure; he is discerned of no one, so that the dignity of Christianity is maintained in these administrative matters by spirituality.<a name=2:5></a> In Galatians the restoration of erring ones depends on spirituality; "ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:1">Galatians  6:1</a>.<a name=2:6></a> With all this in view it seems to me it would be wise for us to look at the subject from the foundation in the types, and I believe that is properly in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>, spirituality stands related to the Spirit of God in a personal way.<a name=2:8></a> It is a subject brought in as developed out of faith and the Spirit of God.<a name=2:9></a> In John's gospel we have the foundation of it bearing particularly on our own times, that is new birth.<a name=2:10></a> "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a>).<a name=2:11></a> That is what I understand to be the fundamental thought in us; it is constitutional, not exactly what we have received through our minds, but what God effects sovereignly as fundamental in our constitutions.<a name=2:12></a> Those who grow up ostensibly in the truth, without bearing in mind this fundamental thought, are usually defective, so that the chapter read, I believe, deals with the matter first as rooted in the sufferings of Christ, which were essential in order that we may have the Spirit; the Spirit being viewed here as received through the sufferings of Christ.<a name=2:13></a>

		The chapter begins with an allusion to the commandment of Jehovah as governing the teaching in it, and proceeds to tell us of the people contending with Moses because there was no water.<a name=3:1></a> The battle of Rephidim, which follows, has in mind the state in us seen in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, which requires elucidation if this matter of spirituality is to be reached intelligently.<a name=3:2></a> The matter of God's sovereign act as fundamental to our chapter contemplates the elucidation of conditions <i>within</i> us; the law being the instrument, divinely provided, to lead us to this analysis, without the understanding of which none of us shall ever reach Christianity in a spiritual sense.<a name=3:3></a> In general that is what one had in mind.<a name=3:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:13></a> Yes, the "word of the truth".<a name=3:14></a> That is where the difficulty lies in many.<a name=3:15></a> Very few believers, brought up under defective teaching, have the Spirit operating in them, as far as I have observed.<a name=3:16></a> This is because they do not get the "word of the truth" which is an adjusting thought as to our souls.<a name=3:17></a> That is always necessary in view of the reception of the Spirit.<a name=3:18></a> The apostle alludes there to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>, in which we are told that there were twelve men at Ephesus who had had imperfect instruction -- what related to the baptism of John; they were persons, such as are very prevalent today, brought up under defective teaching; truth to a point, but not

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> That helps, because it is a question of the commandment of the Lord.<a name=4:9></a> This position is reached by the commandment of the Lord; meaning that it is imperative that we should come to this point in our souls.<a name=4:10></a> We read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:4">1 Corinthians  10:4</a> that they had all eaten the same spiritual food and drunk the same spiritual drink; they drank of "a spiritual rock which followed them".<a name=4:11></a> This is what is alluded to in the spiritual drink; the rock comes into view here; but the position is marked by divine commandment.<a name=4:12></a> The gift of the Holy Spirit is from God's side.<a name=4:13></a> It is essential to Christianity; to our being in it rightly.<a name=4:14></a> Verse 1 says, "at the command of Jehovah .<a name=4:15></a>.<a name=4:16></a>.<a name=4:17></a> they encamped in Rephidim".<a name=4:18></a> I believe this is to be noted specially, because there is with many the feeling that divine things are optional; this is especially so in young people; whereas it is a divine commandment that we should reach this point.<a name=4:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:12></a> Quite so.<a name=5:13></a> He is not given now directly from heaven as He was given at Pentecost.<a name=5:14></a> He was "sent from heaven", we are told, (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:12">1 Peter  1:12</a>), and <i>is here</i> so that the believer comes into what is already here, and he is set in the body by the reception of the Spirit, but still every believer has a transaction with God, and God with him, as the Spirit is received.<a name=5:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:25></a> Exactly.<a name=5:26></a> The apostle is dealing with the profession of Christianity in which many would not have the Spirit, which is so today; hence the importance of obedience.<a name=5:27></a> This is an imperative matter, so that in order that we should have the Spirit, Christ had to suffer; He had to be smitten.<a name=5:28></a> God does not express resentment at the people's murmurings.<a name=5:29></a> He deals with Christ in regard of it all, for He would intimate to young believers that Christ would undergo sufferings, so that they should have the Spirit.<a name=5:30></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:5></a> That is where the conflict begins.<a name=6:6></a> The conflict is from verse 9; Moses says, "go out, fight".<a name=6:7></a> The battle must result in victory for Amalek unless we recognise the Spirit; hence the early part of the chapter is basic from the divine side.<a name=6:8></a> What appears from verse 9 to the end is what transpires in our souls; so that victory is reached in an experimentally spiritual way.<a name=6:9></a> The law comes into this, although it is seen more fully in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, but the writer of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:14">Romans  7:14</a> says, "the law is spiritual: but <i>I</i> am fleshly", There is a battle inwardly between what is spiritual, and what is carnal.<a name=6:10></a> What is spiritual prevails; the victory therefore is spiritual.<a name=6:11></a> It implies the introduction of a spiritual element into one's being, an operative spiritual element and, as augmented by other elements seen here, it prevails.<a name=6:12></a> The law is spiritual.<a name=6:13></a> Why should there be a law?<a name=6:14></a> It came in, in order to work out the great thought of sin, "that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful" -- <i>exceeding</i> sinful, (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:13">Romans  7:13</a>).<a name=6:15></a> It has been worked out in the history of humanity.<a name=6:16></a> The book of Revelation shows how it will appear later on, and God is patiently waiting until it is fully developed before He strikes.<a name=6:17></a> It is the history of humanity without God, but it becomes <i>exceeding</i> sinful in the believer.<a name=6:18></a> The thing is worked out in the believer on the same principle.<a name=6:19></a> That is the thing to get at in our souls -- the judgment of sin, not only sin normally, but the <i>exceeding sinfulness</i> of it.<a name=6:20></a> The operation of the law, being spiritual from this point of view, develops this.<a name=6:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:5></a> The context shows that the death of Christ is meant in this type.<a name=7:6></a> Smiting is applied to Christ several times, involving His death, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:31">Matthew  26:31</a>.<a name=7:7></a> We could not have the Spirit except Christ had died.<a name=7:8></a> The Lord said on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=7:9></a>"(<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:46">Matthew  27:46</a>) But sufferings alone would not suffice; there must be the termination judicially in death of the man that sinned, and the more I discern the exceeding sinfulness of sin in that man -- that is, in myself - the more ready I am to abandon him, and to see the necessity of his being brought to a termination.<a name=7:10></a> The first cry on the cross, I believe, is that the wrath of God was felt in the Lord's heart, and He says, "why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=7:11></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:46">Matthew  27:46</a>) The second cry is the termination of the man, for, having uttered it, the Lord actually died.<a name=7:12></a> There were two cries.<a name=7:13></a>

		My theme tonight is gathering and attraction, Christ being the Gatherer and also the Object who draws men and women to Himself by attraction.<a name=102:1></a> Attraction comes first in order historically, for it is found in the physical creation; gathering or shepherding is later, it awaited the creation of man.<a name=102:2></a> Abel represents the thought of gathering or shepherding, for he was a keeper of sheep, a man whose interests were in what was <i>living</i>.<a name=102:3></a> He is the prototype of all shepherds, and the occupation took definite and permanent form in the family of faith; the family of Abraham.<a name=102:4></a> It was abhorrent to the Egyptians; in the spiritual sense it belongs to those who have faith and love, the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.<a name=102:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind to speak of it as John presents it.<a name=102:6></a> He records this remarkable prophecy of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.<a name=102:7></a> Such a prophetic word from such a man is of peculiar<i>interest</i>, and suggests the importance of the prophetic word.<a name=102:8></a> God used the high priest of Israel at that time, not that there were not persons more suitable, but He would have testimony rendered to Christ by an exalted official among the Jews at that time.<a name=102:9></a> That God should use him reminds us of His sovereign ways, and also of the great value that attaches to the prophetic word and the consequent importance of being available for such a service.<a name=102:10></a> If we desire gifts, which we should, it is particularly that we should prophesy.<a name=102:11></a> God used Caiaphas, He used Balaam; showing how resourceful He is, that He uses whom He will according to His purpose.<a name=102:12></a>

		John, in keeping with his general line, introduces the thought of the children of God, but he regards them here (or the Spirit of God through him does so), as "scattered abroad".<a name=103:10></a> That thought would have touched, and was heavy upon, the heart of Christ, for He died that He should gather together into one the children of God that were scattered abroad.<a name=103:11></a> Doubtless we are all children of God, one would assume that we are, but some of us may be among the scattered ones.<a name=103:12></a> There are many in that sad case.<a name=103:13></a> It is sorrowful that any of the family of God should be scattered abroad.<a name=103:14></a> The Lord

		It is the gathering time now.<a name=105:7></a> I shall speak in a moment about attraction, but I want to stress now that it is the gathering time, and also that there are not wanting those who are shepherds.<a name=105:8></a> As I have been saying, the shepherds belong to the family of faith.<a name=105:9></a> You will recall how Joseph tutored his brethren as to what they should say to Pharaoh.<a name=105:10></a> Pharaoh says to them, "What is your occupation?<a name=105:11></a>(<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#47:3">Genesis  47:3</a>)" but Joseph anticipated this inquiry of the monarch.<a name=105:12></a> It was an occupation in reproach in Egypt.<a name=105:13></a> It could not be much in reproach in the mind of Pharaoh, for he himself had cattle and needed shepherds to look after them, so that in this respect he was not characteristically an Egyptian.<a name=105:14></a> We may look for such in our exercises as under reproach; where we least expect it we may find what corresponds to us as of God.<a name=105:15></a> So Joseph had carefully primed his brethren to say to Pharaoh, "Thy servants are men that have been occupied with cattle from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#46:34">Genesis  46:34</a>.<a name=105:16></a> Let us not be

		ashamed of that occupation, for it is an honourable one.<a name=106:1></a> It is really persons occupied with live stock, typically <i>living people;</i> and so Abel stands over against Cain.<a name=106:2></a> Cain was occupied with purely material things -- machinery and the like, building cities, which would lead to honouring the god of forces, <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#11:38">Daniel  11:38</a>.<a name=106:3></a> Faith is engaged with living persons.<a name=106:4></a> Our eternal occupation will be with persons, not with machinery and the like.<a name=106:5></a> So that as Pharaoh inquired of the five that Joseph selected to take to him, they said, "Thy servants are shepherds (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#47:3">Genesis  47:3</a>)".<a name=106:6></a> One of the gifts of Christ was "shepherds and teachers", in one person -- a most valuable brother!<a name=106:7></a> Teaching may give one more prominence, it is seen on the platform, and requires more grace to keep small.<a name=106:8></a> The shepherd services are often unseen by others, requiring self-abnegation, and toil, as with the Lord Himself <i>going into the mountains</i> for the lost sheep.<a name=106:9></a> Hence the importance of the ability of a shepherd.<a name=106:10></a> It is a question of life from John's point of view.<a name=106:11></a> "Children of God" is a generative thought, and there are many of our brethren having a link with God in that sense, and yet having no family circle.<a name=106:12></a> Dear brethren, let us take that word into our hearts, <i>a family circle where affection is</i>.<a name=106:13></a> God has provided it at the present time.<a name=106:14></a> It is a question first of our relation with Him through His generative power.<a name=106:15></a> He has brought it about Himself, "the children of God".<a name=106:16></a>

		What I have been saying is all abstract as regards the sheep; you <i>begin</i> with that.<a name=109:2></a> The time was when you did know something of Christ.<a name=109:3></a> He took note of that.<a name=109:4></a> It is included in what is said here, "I .<a name=109:5></a>.<a name=109:6></a>.<a name=109:7></a> am known of those that are mine", but He is dealing with the full thought in an abstract sense, saying, that His sheep know Him as the Father knows Him and He knows the Father.<a name=109:8></a> Think of the circle open to us, dear brethren, in the sense of knowledge, <i>the kind of knowledge</i>.<a name=109:9></a> There is the kind of <i>love</i> that the Father has for the Son, but there is the kind of <i>knowledge</i> that exists between the Father and the Son, and the sheep are admitted into that.<a name=109:10></a> Is it not attractive?<a name=109:11></a> But I am not at this moment speaking of attraction, but rather of what the Shepherd does.<a name=109:12></a> He goes on to say.<a name=109:13></a> He "brings" the sheep, not attracts them exactly, but He brings them.<a name=109:14></a> That is to say, the Shepherd goes to where you are and brings you.<a name=109:15></a> And He says there are "other sheep".<a name=109:16></a> He had been speaking of the Jewish sheep; He had gone into the fold and put them forth, so that they followed.<a name=109:17></a> That was His service to them, added to the great fact that He laid down His life for them.<a name=109:18></a> He opened up the way for them to come out of the Jewish fold, and then He brings the other sheep that He had, and constitutes them all one flock.<a name=109:19></a> Not one flock by themselves, but both classes forming one flock and having one Shepherd.<a name=109:20></a>

		I purpose to speak about the Scriptures first.<a name=114:2></a> They are peculiarly the object of the enemy's attack at the present time; for many years past, indeed, they have been the subject of attack continuously; for, although a certain body of professing Christians of great antiquity and renown, assumes to recognise them <i>in toto</i>, yet they are largely nullified by its interpretations - as effective a way as there is of rendering them ineffective as read by men.<a name=114:3></a>

		In the period of the Reformation, as many of us will know, the authority of scripture was asserted.<a name=114:4></a> This was met by the body, to which I allude, some years later, by spurious additions to the Scriptures, beclouding them and dragging them down, to say the least, to the level of mere human productions; the Apocrypha was added to the canon of scripture.<a name=114:5></a> Then again in regard to the temple of God, God graciously, in later years, revived the thought of it.<a name=114:6></a> The truth recovered included what Paul conveyed in his question to the Corinthians, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=114:7></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>.<a name=114:8></a> Light from the temple was thrown on the holy page of scripture and the true canon of scripture was discerned and preserved, and has been maintained to the present moment, and will be, by the help of God, to the end: the Spirit being here.<a name=114:9></a> This great revival of the truth, so far-reaching, so illuminating, so practical, entering into the various meetings of the saints for the study of scripture and for ministry, is discounted by the same religious body in what it calls <i>The Bull of Infallibility</i>, in which a mere man, under certain conditions, is regarded as competent to speak with divine authority.<a name=114:10></a> Antichrist, we are told in the Scriptures, "sits down in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God", <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:4">2 Thessalonians  2:4</a>.<a name=114:11></a>

		I want first to speak of the Scriptures before continuing about the temple.<a name=116:5></a> You will see how the two thoughts as to the temple are linked in my first passage -- <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>; first, the temple in the general sense, out of which the oxen, etc.<a name=116:6></a>, were cast; and then the Lord speaks of the temple of His body; and, as to the latter, John says, that after He rose from among the dead.<a name=116:7></a> His disciples "believed the scripture".<a name=116:8></a> We have a suggestion here of the importance of the light of resurrection in relation to scripture.<a name=116:9></a> They believed the scripture.<a name=116:10></a> Many of us here, it may be, believe because we have been born into Christian households.<a name=116:11></a> We have regarded the Scriptures according to their face value, theoretically perhaps, scarcely reading them much.<a name=116:12></a> Presently some school teacher tells you that the book of Genesis is doubtful, and the book of Jonah a fanciful story, and you partly believe it.<a name=116:13></a> In thousands of cases this has happened.<a name=116:14></a> Hence the importance of looking into the great matter of the resurrection.<a name=116:15></a> John says, on more than one occasion, this included, that the truth of the resurrection and glory of Christ bears on the authority of scripture.<a name=116:16></a> In truth it is as apprehending by the Spirit, Christ risen and indeed glorified, that we get the full bearing of scripture.<a name=116:17></a> The Bible becomes a new book to us.<a name=116:18></a> It is lighted up with the glory of Christ.<a name=116:19></a> Hence here the disciples after Christ arose "believed the scripture" -- it is put first, and after that "the word which Jesus had said".<a name=116:20></a> The word which Jesus had said, as I hope to show presently, implies the temple.<a name=116:21></a>

		The body of Christ was the temple.<a name=117:1></a> It was the temple while He was alive, and here in the flesh, but now His word is believed.<a name=117:2></a> He raised Himself, and the light of His resurrection enabled the disciples to believe what Jesus said as well as the Scriptures.<a name=117:3></a> Hence, as believing the Scriptures, on this principle, they become peculiarly interesting.<a name=117:4></a> A living thought enters your soul, the resurrection of Christ is a wonderful fact in the soul.<a name=117:5></a> One of the most remarkable things is that after He arose He expounded to two wandering saints in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself -- Himself in that condition.<a name=117:6></a> Of course they refer to Him in flesh and blood, but now He is in a new condition, and so the effect of resurrection in the soul enables one to read the Scriptures in a new way.<a name=117:7></a> They are <i>Appointed to be read in churches</i> -- thank God!<a name=117:8></a> especially in England; but how read?<a name=117:9></a> The Lord says to one, "how readest thou?<a name=117:10></a>" And again an honest man, the Ethiopian eunuch, in answer to Philip's question, "Understandest thou what thou readest?<a name=117:11></a>" says, "How can I, except some man should guide me?<a name=117:12></a>(<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:30">Acts  8:30</a>,31)" That is the attitude of soul to take, and hence I lay stress on the word read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>, "they believed the scripture".<a name=117:13></a>

		What is in mind at this time is to speak about identification in God's world.<a name=124:1></a> These scriptures furnish a basis, a three-fold testimony to the point in mind.<a name=124:2></a> The book is indeed marked by testimony to the certainty that believers in Christ shall be identified in that world.<a name=124:3></a> The Lord Jesus Himself spoke of "that world and the resurrection (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:35">Luke  20:35</a>)".<a name=124:4></a> He said that those who share in it neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:36">Luke  20:36</a>; they are the sons of God, being sons, as He says, of the resurrection.<a name=124:5></a> This instruction in no way precludes the idea of identification of those who belong to Christ in "that world".<a name=124:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I hope to show is that they will be identified by certain moral features that marked them in this world in the days of their responsibility, but taking on a permanent form in a spiritual sense, still carrying the identification of the persons with it.<a name=124:7></a> The Lord says to His disciples, as they gloried in speaking to Him of the power that wrought in them through the ministry, "in this rejoice not, .<a name=124:8></a>.<a name=124:9></a>.<a name=124:10></a> but rejoice that <i>your names are written in the heavens"</i>, (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:20">Luke  10:20</a>).<a name=124:11></a> He mentions only their names.<a name=124:12></a> The epistle to the Hebrews speaks of "the assembly of the firstborn <i>who are registered in heaven"</i>, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:33">Hebrews  12:33</a>.<a name=124:13></a> Again the allusion is to a register of names, as we may say, a <i>Who is who</i> book in heaven.<a name=124:14></a> <i>Each will answer to his name, and have his own distinguishing feature in life, and not only in life, but in family dignity, for each is a firstborn</i>.<a name=124:15></a> This could only be said of the divine family.<a name=124:16></a> In no other family is every member a firstborn.<a name=124:17></a> <i>Hence, dear brethren, our family status above is mutually equal</i>.<a name=124:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So with all this in view I read in 1 Corinthians; not because it is a specially heavenly epistle; it is a wilderness epistle, intended to regulate us as in the wilderness.<a name=222:11></a> It gives us the position of the assembly in the wilderness, and the behaviour proper to it, and how God is to be served in it.<a name=222:12></a> We have commandments; indeed, it would seem as if the whole first epistle is one commandment; headed up under the words "commandment of the Lord".<a name=222:13></a> "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise .<a name=222:14></a>.<a name=222:15></a>.<a name=222:16></a> that it is the Lord's commandment", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>).<a name=222:17></a> The verses I have read are, therefore, included in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		One would love to have heard the apostle sing.<a name=223:4></a> There is not a verse of a hymn sung by the apostles now extant, as far as is known, but heaven used to hear them -- beautiful tones, we may be sure, and beautiful words, too!<a name=223:5></a> So that Paul said, "I will sing with the Spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:15">1 Corinthians  14:15</a>)".<a name=223:6></a> You may be sure he could sing, as well as David and Moses.<a name=223:7></a> The Spirit of adoption in us, the Holy Spirit viewed in that way, indites the true songs; songs of Zion; songs of the assembly.<a name=223:8></a> We read of a song in heaven; it is said to be a "new" one, in wonderful tones, "as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder", (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14:12">Revelation  14:12</a>); and yet it was the voice of harpers harping with their harps.<a name=223:9></a> Those who formed the assembly are being trained now to have part in that wonderful service above in immense volume, and yet in distinct symphony, and with the highest kind of musical instruments, namely, harps; symbolically, the most refined notes issue from them.<a name=223:10></a> Prophetic ministry bears on all this, as our chapter shows.<a name=223:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So these verses deal with prophecy.<a name=223:12></a> They enjoin meetings for prophecy, not in an arbitrary way, but the epistle shows how important they are, and how superior to other meetings.<a name=223:13></a> They are superior, at least in this sense that they bring about education in a person who is ignorant, or an unbeliever, even, and that education leads to self-judgment, and it involves that all present judge.<a name=223:14></a> We are not to be afraid of the saints' judgment.<a name=223:15></a> We cannot trust our own.<a name=223:16></a> Not that one may not judge oneself thoroughly, but we have to be on the watch, for our hearts are so deceptive.<a name=223:17></a> It is wholesome,

	<div class="paragraph">
		The word <i>judgment</i> is a key-word of this epistle, both as to ourselves and as to others, <i>for we are not only to prepare for the singing in heaven</i> , but also be in the light of the judgment-seat of Christ.<a name=224:3></a> How great are our prospects!<a name=224:4></a> "Do ye not know that we shall judge angels?<a name=224:5></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:3">1 Corinthians  6:3</a>), and the world, too; but how shall we ever attain to that, <i>save as we learn to judge ourselves in the very roots of our being</i> , and to ask others, too, as to what they think?<a name=224:6></a> For normally our brethren are in accord with what scripture teaches and are worthy of our confidence.<a name=224:7></a> So we are to confess our faults one to another and pray for one another, and, of course, to confess our faults to God.<a name=224:8></a> It is a great advantage to confess our faults to the Lord's people.<a name=224:9></a> And, of course -- according to their character, as scripture indicates -- <i>certain sins should be confessed to the assembly, its judgment of them being necessary</i> .<a name=224:10></a>

		Now having said all that, I want to go to the Old Testament to show how this matter of prophecy is integrally linked up with the service of God.<a name=225:6></a> You will observe that the great leaders of song in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#25">1 Chronicles  25</a>are said to be prophesying as well as singing, prophesying on harps Three of them, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, were really prophets.<a name=225:7></a> Two of them are called the king's seers, and that leads me to speak about Nathan and Gad.<a name=225:8></a> These two prophets are presented in scripture as serving David, and Solomon his son.<a name=225:9></a> Not that one would undertake to say that they did not serve others, but why is it that David should have two prophets?<a name=225:10></a> In fact, as far as I can see, there are four prophets of his, Nathan and Gad, Jeduthun and Heman.<a name=225:11></a> The last two are called his seers.<a name=225:12></a> Nathan is called a prophet.<a name=225:13></a> Heman and Jeduthun are called the king's seers, and the facts as to Nathan show that he served David exclusively; the Spirit of God is stressing the importance of prophecy in relation to the service of God, and David represents this <i>par excellence</i>, in the Old Testament.<a name=225:14></a> Indeed he is, we may say, the inaugurator of it "the sweet psalmist of Israel (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:1">2 Samuel  23:1</a>)".<a name=225:15></a> He inaugurates the service and maintains it.<a name=225:16></a> How valuable then is the service of these prophets!<a name=225:17></a> What would have happened to David without them?<a name=225:18></a> Nathan's service is especially to be noted; and as David needed such ministry, so do we all.<a name=225:19></a> The most spiritual of us is capable of sin.<a name=225:20></a> David, one of the most exalted men indeed, one of the most spiritual men in the Old

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, what I have said indicates the need of prophetic ministry in the service of song, and the question should arise with each of us as to whether he is contributing anything among the saints in this sense.<a name=226:4></a> I believe that enters into the verses I read.<a name=226:5></a> David had seers, and hence the question rightly arises as to any gathering.<a name=226:6></a> Are there any seers there?<a name=226:7></a> Have the saints any seers, those who prophesy on harps, prophesy, as it were, as they sing?<a name=226:8></a>

		That is in a general way what is in mind, and I now wish to speak a little more about Nathan.<a name=226:9></a> He is the one specially in view -- a remarkable man.<a name=226:10></a> He represents all the prophets in a sense, for his name signifies <i>gift</i> , a suitable name for such a man.<a name=226:11></a> His first appearance is in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>, and the result there is to bring to light the sonship of Christ typically.<a name=226:12></a> One of the greatest results in ministry is to make clear the sonship of Christ.<a name=226:13></a> God has greatly helped the brethren on that point, and Satan has sought to rob us and is still seeking to rob us of the gain of the inquiry and the exercises; but it belongs to Nathan in the historical books to bring this truth into evidence.<a name=226:14></a> That is why I read in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12">2 Samuel  12</a>, because he is employed there to name Solomon.<a name=226:15></a> Solomon has two names there, but one of them is given by Nathan; not of himself; he is sent to give this name to Solomon -- Jedidiah -- it is an addition to the name David.<a name=226:16></a> David is the <i>beloved</i> , Jedidiah is the <i>beloved of Jehovah</i>, and Nathan is used of God to give that name to Solomon -- to him who typifies Christ as Son.<a name=226:17></a> Let us allow the name to come into our souls --

		As regards Nathan's service to David, recorded in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>, we can hardly say it was perfect.<a name=227:6></a> David said, "I dwell in the house of cedars, and the ark of God dwells under curtains <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:2">2 Samuel  7:2</a>".<a name=227:7></a> Nathan immediately says, "Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:3">2 Samuel  7:3</a>.<a name=227:8></a> How often we, in our little bit of ministry, speak to please someone present!<a name=227:9></a> That is a great danger, if some particular person or persons are present you would like something to please them.<a name=227:10></a> No prophet will do it, if he is in the spirit of prophecy.<a name=227:11></a> He would rather speak to their consciences than to their natural feelings.<a name=227:12></a> Nathan said to David, "do all that is in thy heart, for Jehovah is with thee (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:3">2 Samuel  7:3</a>)".<a name=227:13></a> That was saying a good deal, committing Jehovah to all that was in David's heart.<a name=227:14></a> God took Nathan in hand that night.<a name=227:15></a> David was <i>not</i> to build a house for Jehovah.<a name=227:16></a> He had it in his heart to build it, and we learn later that it was good that he had it in his heart, but it was not God's mind that he should build it, and David had to accept that.<a name=227:17></a> We do well in our ministry not to flatter anyone.<a name=227:18></a> Elihu says, "For I know not how to flatter; my Maker would soon take me away", (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#32:22">Job  32:22</a>).<a name=227:19></a> Nathan effectively delivers his message to David after God spoke to him and he tells him he is not to build the house.<a name=227:20></a> Let David's feelings be what they may, the word from Jehovah is that he is not to build His house.<a name=227:21></a> To be limited in that way causes humiliation.<a name=227:22></a> It ought to: I have gone beyond the mind of God, in what is in my heart.<a name=227:23></a> Well, if I have gone beyond the mind of God in

		J.T.<a name=235:1></a> The verses in Genesis have been suggested because they indicate that God provides beforehand for what is to follow: what may arise in His service amongst His people, and this includes a wife, constitutionally needed; so in view of the need in Abraham's family, that is, in Isaac, the Spirit of God mentions these facts about Nahor's family, in which we have Rebecca introduced.<a name=235:2></a> Wives are constantly needed and sought after, which is according to God.<a name=235:3></a> Marriages have a great place with Him, a great place in the testimony, that there should be <i>wholly a right</i> seed, <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:21">Jeremiah  2:21</a>.<a name=235:4></a> Hence would-be husbands should approach God as to this, as a matter that concerns Him, and therefore entering into His forethought and consequent provision for such need known to Him beforehand.<a name=235:5></a> If this were accepted by brothers and sisters alike, it would preclude mixed marriages, diverse yokes in this sense.<a name=235:6></a> It is said, "Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing", (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#18:22">Proverbs  18:22</a>).<a name=235:7></a> But then God has forethought as to it, and would thus provide so that the right person <i>may</i> be found.<a name=235:8></a> And then parents, as in the following chapters in Genesis, ought to be concerned as to wives for their sons, and husbands for their daughters; the testimony should rule in such exercises and not merely seeking after financial or social advantages.<a name=235:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=253:4></a> What is in mind is to look at Matthew from the standpoint of the divine confidence placed in the saints under given conditions.<a name=253:5></a> It seems to appear in this gospel peculiarly because of the administrative truth that enters into it; confidence is seen, I think, throughout.<a name=253:6></a> The Lord says at the end, without stating any condition, that He would be with them always, and Joseph, in chapter 2, seems to represent what can be confided in divinely: he qualifies in his uprightness, he is entrusted with the Son of God as a Babe.<a name=253:7></a> He had not only qualified in a moral way beforehand, but the history shows that he was equal to the trust, taking the Child and His mother into Egypt and coming back and employing vigilance to protect the Child.<a name=253:8></a> I suggested these verses because they bring all that thought into assembly administration; what the Lord says involves reliability in the assembly, and then in the "two of you".<a name=253:9></a> Verse 20 seems to bring in the thought of help in answer to prayer; the Lord being in the midst of the two or three, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=253:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=253:11></a> In regard to a person who would not hearken to the voice of the assembly, the Lord says, "Let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer".<a name=253:12></a> I had looked upon that as involving that, if a person disregards the voice of the assembly, he stands as one unfit for Christian fellowship and not to be walked with, is that so?<a name=253:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=310:13></a> Yes.<a name=310:14></a> The evil teachers were saying that the day of the Lord was present, based, perhaps, on certain features of human sufferings connected with it, ignoring its positive blessings.<a name=310:15></a> Instructed saints would see how fallacious that is.<a name=310:16></a> And then they were undergoing persecution, and no doubt the enemy took occasion to suggest to them that such conditions marked the day of the Lord.<a name=310:17></a> So the first chapter is to show that the persecutions were really normal to Christians, and that it was intended to help them and make them worthy of the kingdom of God; persecution helps us as it is thus accepted.<a name=310:18></a> It is not the day of the Lord, but the day to prepare us for it; and tribulations, and persecutions help us.<a name=310:19></a> That is the point, the apostle makes.<a name=310:20></a> On the other hand the persecutors will be dealt with by the Lord when He comes.<a name=310:21></a> If it were His day.<a name=310:22></a> He would be dealing with these persecutors who afflicted the saints; He would be executing judgment upon them.<a name=310:23></a> The
