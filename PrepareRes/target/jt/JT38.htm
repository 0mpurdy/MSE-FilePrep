		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> I should like to consider the subject of life in the book of Revelation.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order that the subject may be clearly before us, I will remark that the first passage which we have read refers to Christ as the Living One; the second speaks of the tree of life in the paradise of God, and then of the crown of life; and the third refers to the book of life.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of the apostasy contemplated in Revelation, it is important to consider the subject of life.<a name=1:6></a> We shall see in the course of our readings that this subject is found throughout this book.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We begin by considering Christ as the Living One.<a name=1:8></a> If we are in the same position as John we shall be within the Lord's reach.<a name=1:9></a> He says: "When I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; <i>I</i> am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades".<a name=1:10></a> John says: "He laid his right hand upon me".<a name=1:11></a> It is according as the Lord lays His hand upon us, that we shall understand and profit in relation to this vast subject of life.<a name=1:12></a> John's ministry must have taken its character very much from the fact that the Lord had laid His hand upon him.<a name=1:13></a> And as feeling that blessed hand, he was able to speak of the Lord as being "the first and the last, and the living one".<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Who is the Lord</i>?<a name=1:15></a> That is a question that ought to be before each one of us.<a name=1:16></a> The antichrist is about to come, and the saints should be instructed as regards who Christ is Himself.<a name=1:17></a> In this book of Revelation, we have names, appellations which denote very clearly the deity of the Lord Jesus.<a name=1:18></a>

		We have first of all, in the first chapter, an expression of praise: "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages.<a name=2:1></a> Amen" (verses 5 and 6).<a name=2:2></a> Then we read in verse 8: "I am the Alpha, and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty".<a name=2:3></a> He is there, without contradiction, "the Lord God".<a name=2:4></a> Then, at the end of this first chapter, He is "the first and the last, and the living one": He who "became dead" and who is "living to the ages of ages".<a name=2:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:17></a> It is the Lord Jesus as God.<a name=2:18></a> In the last chapter He says: "I am the Alpha and the Omega" (verse 13), It is emphatic: "<i>I</i> am".<a name=2:19></a> And there, as in this verse 8 of the first chapter, it relates to the same Person.<a name=2:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:23></a> Many of Job's observations were confused, but others were very brilliant: "I know that my Redeemer liveth".<a name=2:24></a> He desired a mediator (chapters 9: 33 and 16: 21).<a name=2:25></a> He said first: "There is not an umpire between us, who should lay his hand upon us both", and later: "Oh that there were arbitration for a man with God".<a name=2:26></a> This thought is developed in the book of Revelation where Christ is presented on the side of God first, as being Himself God, and then on the side of man.<a name=2:27></a> He can

		The deity of the Lord must be viewed in its absolute character, as before and outside of creation.<a name=11:4></a> Then we must consider His Person relatively to the creation; and from that point of view we have different names.<a name=11:5></a> All the names that we have of the Persons of the Godhead in the Scriptures, are relative to the creation; we cannot regard them as applying before creation, for then they would have no force as connected only with the Persons of the Godhead.<a name=11:6></a> For example, the name of God, which appears from the first verse of the Bible, is a relative name.<a name=11:7></a> The Hebrew word is Elohim, which means the Supreme Being, the One who is to be worshipped.<a name=11:8></a> None of the Persons of the Godhead appears to be supreme with regard to another; none could be worshipped by another.<a name=11:9></a> A careful consideration of all these names confirms this fact.<a name=11:10></a> The name of God to which we are baptised is that of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>.<a name=11:11></a> But this order could not be applied in absolute deity.<a name=11:12></a> It indicates simply that two of the Persons have taken a relatively inferior position in view of revelation.<a name=11:13></a>

		In chapter 8, the apostle speaks of "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus", not the spirit of life at Rome; the idea is that the life is in a Person, "in Christ Jesus".<a name=52:7></a> "The Spirit of life" is something inward, something which one enjoys; it is only intelligible to those who have it, but it has a powerful effect: "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death".<a name=52:8></a> It is "the Spirit of life"; but in verse 10 it says "the Spirit life".<a name=52:9></a> It is necessary to distinguish between these two thoughts.<a name=52:10></a> "The Spirit life on account of righteousness" is a power in the soul to practise righteousness; so that a christian does not practise righteousness in a legal way, but in a spiritual way.<a name=52:11></a> There is with the believer something that corresponds to God, in the practice of righteousness: "If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:29">1 John  2:29</a>.<a name=52:12></a> The Spirit being life is a constant power to make us

		The epistle to the Corinthians is the counterpart of the epistle to the Romans.<a name=53:9></a> The epistle to the Romans places believers in justification of life: the boards of the tabernacle are set up on the bases of silver; the teaching of the epistle to the Romans constitutes believers as these boards, so that they are viewed as standing together erect in the testimony.<a name=53:10></a> The epistle to the Romans does not unfold, in a general way, the truth of the assembly; it is true that chapter 12 alludes to the body, but the whole truth of the assembly is not developed there, while the epistle to the Corinthians views the same persons as placed in the assembly; that is the collective side: the boards are in place and the tabernacle is set up.<a name=53:11></a> The saints at Corinth are called "the assembly of God which is in Corinth" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>; <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#2:1">2 Corinthians  2:1</a>.<a name=53:12></a> And the principles of which we have spoken are put into practice by the saints collectively, by the assembly of God at Corinth.<a name=53:13></a> The epistle to the Romans develops a living state of things among the saints, even as regards sacrifice, of which the thought is presented in chapter 12 -- a living sacrifice.<a name=53:14></a> The Lord had said: "He that follows me .<a name=53:15></a>.<a name=53:16></a>.<a name=53:17></a> shall have the light of life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a>.<a name=53:18></a> He who follows Jesus reaches the sphere of life; he has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Along with the subject of life and righteousness, the epistle to the Romans teaches us priesthood, not as it is understood in religious circles, for all believers are priests.<a name=54:9></a> The apostle Peter speaks of "a holy priesthood" and of "a kingly priesthood" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a>,9 that does not belong only to a certain category of christians, but to all, so that there is a living state of things: we serve "in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:6">Romans  7:6</a>), and at the end of this same chapter the thought of the law is again presented: "<i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law" (verse 25).<a name=54:10></a> Every brother or sister assumes that responsibility.<a name=54:11></a> You see how the idea of priesthood is found again in these passages, priesthood being carried out in the service of God in a living and spiritual way.<a name=54:12></a> So we are not bound by customs; it is evident that there must be order, and the apostle insists, in the epistle to the Corinthians, on suitable order in the assembly, which is of great importance, since the assembly is the expression of divine order, for God is a God of order; but we must be marked by life, each one acting in a living way and with intelligence: "<i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law".<a name=54:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says in Matthew that "some doubted", and although their number was incomplete (eleven instead of twelve), the Lord did not stop to adjust that defect, but continued, saying: "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth".<a name=56:6></a> In these last days the Lord would teach us that we must go forward in all circumstances; if some are missing, we must pursue and go on, for the Lord is going on, whatever happens.<a name=56:7></a> That is what has characterised God from the beginning.<a name=56:8></a> The failure of Adam and Eve only served to bring out new features.<a name=56:9></a> God has gone on.<a name=56:10></a>

		defection was with the principal servants.<a name=57:1></a> Simon Peter and Thomas are seen together.<a name=57:2></a> Those who fail have the tendency to be together until they are restored.<a name=57:3></a> We often see persons who have turned aside get together when there is an attack to be made on the testimony.<a name=57:4></a> Another very sad feature comes to light: that is that the chief in service becomes the leader in error.<a name=57:5></a> Peter leads the disciples into a false path.<a name=57:6></a> He says: "I go to fish".<a name=57:7></a> And the others answer: "We also come with thee".<a name=57:8></a> It is quite true that we ought to follow our leaders, to obey them, to be subject to them, and considering the issue of their conversation, to imitate their faith.<a name=57:9></a> But in the passage which says that, it is also added: "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:8">Hebrews  13:8</a>.<a name=57:10></a> It is He alone whom we can follow with absolute confidence.<a name=57:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What comes to light here is that the Lord did not allow them to have success in their failure.<a name=57:12></a> It is a great mercy, if we fail, that we are not allowed to achieve our end, and that we are ready to receive correction.<a name=57:13></a> Judas was able to succeed in his path of departure, and alas!<a name=57:14></a> many others since then.<a name=57:15></a> In our days there are many who have turned aside in their own path, and they have not been recovered.<a name=57:16></a> It is very solemn when God allows us to attain our end in following a path of error.<a name=57:17></a> How striking it is that David was allowed to number Israel!<a name=57:18></a> But the avenues to the conscience are near to those who are to be restored: David had a prophet, Gad.<a name=57:19></a> It was a mercy from God who, by means of Gad, reached David's conscience.<a name=57:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So here, the Lord quickly found a way of reaching the conscience and heart of His disciples.<a name=57:21></a> It says, "And early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore"; but it adds that "the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus".<a name=57:22></a> The circumstances bring out how easily one disciple may displace another in leadership.<a name=57:23></a> Generally the apostle John occupies the second place with relation to Peter; but here John reaches the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord said to them: "Children, have ye anything to eat?<a name=58:3></a>" That word 'children' shows that the Lord was not regarding them as erring disciples.<a name=58:4></a> He said: "Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find".<a name=58:5></a> Then they cast it.<a name=58:6></a> The Lord addresses us as 'children', not as erring disciples, which establishes confidence and renews the link of affection.<a name=58:7></a> Many of our brethren are easier to recover through the affections than the conscience; the conscience must be reached before final adjustment, but the affections are more ready to receive appeals.<a name=58:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord".<a name=58:9></a> John has the first place and Peter is content to take the second.<a name=58:10></a> John says: "It is the Lord".<a name=58:11></a> The one who has discernment enough to see that it was the Lord is the one who has the first place.<a name=58:12></a> The position of a servant is never final; one such who leads well today might not do so tomorrow.<a name=58:13></a> John said: "It is the Lord".<a name=58:14></a> That was precisely the light that was wanting at that moment.<a name=58:15></a> If we can discern the Lord, the whole scene will be immediately clarified for us.<a name=58:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Simon Peter, having heard that it was the Lord, does not take the place of obedience to a leader, but occupies afresh the first place.<a name=58:17></a> It says: "Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it was the Lord, girded his overcoat on him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea".<a name=58:18></a> He did not wait for the boat.<a name=58:19></a> John himself got into the boat.<a name=58:20></a> It says in verse 8, that "the other disciples came in the small boat"; it was an auxiliary boat, no doubt.<a name=58:21></a> Peter did not wait for the boat, and he became leader once more.<a name=58:22></a> Leadership among us is the result of moral qualities, not of what is official.<a name=58:23></a>

		I desire now to draw your attention to the position of the Lord in these circumstances.<a name=59:12></a> "Early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore".<a name=59:13></a> He is on well-known ground.<a name=59:14></a> When one is on the water, one does not always know what is the depth of the lake or sea, the bottom, it may be, being at various depths, while the shore is characteristically a known ground, a solid place.<a name=59:15></a> In spite of our failures, the Lord is going to treat us with dignity.<a name=59:16></a> That is another feature of recovery, a feature that the Lord gives us to understand.<a name=59:17></a> We may, for the moment, become the servants of sin; but we do not cease to be sons.<a name=59:18></a> "When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread".<a name=59:19></a> The hand of One who was thinking of them had been active.<a name=59:20></a> Who thought of us?<a name=59:21></a> We were busy fishing all night, without taking anything; but Someone has been occupied about us.<a name=59:22></a> They saw that, it says, but only when they went out on the land.<a name=59:23></a> In order to see, we must take up a certain position.<a name=59:24></a>

		Then the Lord says to them: "Come and dine".<a name=60:3></a> He would not merely give them something to eat.<a name=60:4></a> It is true that they were erring disciples; but they were also dignified persons.<a name=60:5></a> The reception that was going to be given them was according to their dignity; although they had gone astray, they were going to be placed in all the dignity of the counsels of God.<a name=60:6></a> And, as if to set them at ease, the Lord says to them: "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken" -- fresh fish, not of that which they might have had from their previous efforts, but of that which they had just taken.<a name=60:7></a> It is as if the Lord would say to them: 'Since I began to recover you, you have had results, and I can change all those results into a feast for you'.<a name=60:8></a> Simon Peter becomes the leader again in verse 11, and it says that he "drew the net to the land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three".<a name=60:9></a> The results are not negligible; they are very great.<a name=60:10></a> The Lord assures our hearts that, in spite of the defection which has taken place, we are with Him on a dignified ground.<a name=60:11></a>

		After Paul had laboured there for eighteen months, an assembly was formed, and Paul "took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila"; and then it says that "he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there".<a name=67:12></a> It is very remarkable to see that these two were the beginning of the assembly at Ephesus, occupying the ground for the Lord; and shortly after, Apollos arrived at Ephesus.<a name=67:13></a> They heard him speak.<a name=67:14></a> We can understand that one likes to hear a visiting brother who desires to speak.<a name=67:15></a> Now Apollos was "an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures".<a name=67:16></a> But an important element was there in the assembly -- a man and a woman having discernment as to what is of God and serving in ministry.<a name=67:17></a> "And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly".<a name=67:18></a>

		The passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16">Romans  16</a>shows us the place these two occupied in Paul's affections -- blessed reflex of the place they had in the thoughts of Christ.<a name=68:8></a> We have often noticed the wonderful knowledge Paul had of the persons in the assembly at Rome before he went there.<a name=68:9></a> He sends some twenty-seven salutations to the assembly at Rome.<a name=68:10></a> After mentioning "Phoebe, our sister, who is minister of the assembly", his first salutation is to Prisca and Aquila: "Salute Prisca and Aquila, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus, (who for my life staked their own neck .<a name=68:11></a>.<a name=68:12></a>.<a name=68:13></a> )".<a name=68:14></a> We see that these two, in fulfilling their function in the assembly, acquired a very great place in the thoughts of Paul, and not only of Paul, but of the Lord Himself.<a name=68:15></a> Then the apostle adds: "and the assembly at their house".<a name=68:16></a> Twice it says of them that the assembly met in their house, first at Rome, then at Ephesus; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:19">1 Corinthians  16:19</a>.<a name=68:17></a>

		I wish to speak of the boards of the tabernacle.<a name=70:1></a> I suppose we all understand that the various parts of the tabernacle represent typically what the New Testament presents to us.<a name=70:2></a> We shall see, with the Lord's help, that the epistle to the Romans develops the thought of the boards of the tabernacle.<a name=70:3></a>

		In order to answer to the type, every believer must come to himself: it says of the prodigal son that he came to himself; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:17">Luke  15:17</a>.<a name=70:4></a> So, in chapter 7 of Romans we read: "O wretched man that I am!<a name=70:5></a> who shall deliver me out of this body of death?<a name=70:6></a> I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=70:7></a> So then <i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law".<a name=70:8></a> As being delivered, he can say "<i>myself</i>", so that the believer has arrived at his own individuality, as a delivered man; and having arrived at his own individuality, he serves, with the mind, God's law.<a name=70:9></a> He becomes available to the will of God; God takes possession of him and can use him in relation with other believers.<a name=70:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be noticed that, in the passage we read in Exodus, the boards were to be placed upright, that is to say that the persons whom they typify stand upon their own feet.<a name=70:11></a> The believer can stand upright, spiritually, by himself.<a name=70:12></a> In christianity there is no need for human support.<a name=70:13></a> The christian stands upright.<a name=70:14></a>

		Let us also remark that the wood used for the boards was shittim wood, that is, acacia.<a name=70:15></a> It is a wood of extraordinary strength, as if to convey to us that God uses christians to carry burdens.<a name=70:16></a> And it is proved that the boards of the tabernacle came from a tree of considerable height.<a name=70:17></a> "Ten cubits the length of the board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of one board".<a name=70:18></a> The believer understands that that applies to him.<a name=70:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not wish to enlarge on the number of the boards; there were twenty on the south side and twenty on the north side, and on the west six boards, then "two boards .<a name=71:3></a>.<a name=71:4></a>.<a name=71:5></a> for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear".<a name=71:6></a> Now the two tenons of each board were to be in the bases of silver; that is to say, that we stand upright in this world on the ground of redemption.<a name=71:7></a> There is no other ground on which we can be for God in this world, than the ground of the death of our Lord Jesus.<a name=71:8></a> There were also bars for the boards of the tabernacle.<a name=71:9></a> The believer is to understand that, as enjoying redemption, he is linked with all believers; he is not to be independent.<a name=71:10></a> He is linked with all other believers in relation to the testimony of God in this world.<a name=71:11></a> Another thing that is to be noticed is, that the precious things with which the believer is to be occupied were already there, before the boards were made and set up: that is the ark which the cherubim shadowed, the table, the candlestick, the curtains; all these existed before the boards of the tabernacle.<a name=71:12></a> That means that the believer, as represented by a board of the tabernacle, is not to understand that he is the primary thought of God.<a name=71:13></a> The great primary thought of God is Christ as Man, and every believer is to recognise that he is the servant of Christ in the christian system.<a name=71:14></a> So when the great servant John the baptist was speaking of himself, he said that Jesus took place before him, for He was before him.<a name=71:15></a> It is necessary for each believer to recognise that he comes after Jesus, and after many others.<a name=71:16></a> Thus he could take his place in the service, submitting his will to the will of God.<a name=71:17></a> That service is not grievous; it is a joyful service.<a name=71:18></a>

		Now I wish to present to you three persons for whom light shone out of darkness.<a name=89:5></a> How sad, in the history of this world, was the moment when the Lord Jesus, who had walked and shone down here, stood before Pilate to be judged and crucified!<a name=89:6></a> And darker than any other was the hour of the cross.<a name=89:7></a> The world then did its best to extinguish the greatest possible light that has ever shone; it could not succeed.<a name=89:8></a> Jesus was put to death; but He was raised, to shine more wonderfully than ever.<a name=89:9></a> The fact of trying to extinguish the light by putting Jesus to death was as absurd an act as if men agreed together to try and suppress the sun.<a name=89:10></a> The Lord was brought before Pilate and condemned to death.<a name=89:11></a> Indeed a very dark moment, but one in which the light shone.<a name=89:12></a> The heart of man was in profound darkness: "This is your hour and the power of darkness" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:53">Luke  22:53</a>; but Jesus shone before Pilate.<a name=89:13></a> At such a moment God spoke, and the first person to attract our attention is Pilate's wife (now Pilate had authority to put our Lord to death).<a name=89:14></a> She had a dream, and God spoke to her soul while she slept.<a name=89:15></a> He had already done that previously.<a name=89:16></a> God sometimes uses dreams to speak to men and women.<a name=89:17></a> "In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men", then He speaks to them.<a name=89:18></a> "For God speaketh once, and twice -- and man perceiveth it not", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33:14">Job  33:14</a>, 15.<a name=89:19></a> But there are cases where He gets a response.<a name=89:20></a> He had one that night from Pilate's wife, and in the dream she suffered much.<a name=89:21></a> It is important to notice that she suffered: "I have suffered today many things in a dream because of him".<a name=89:22></a> Among those who obtain light from God and are counted as christians, there is a great number who are very superficial, because

		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23">Luke  23</a>, another light shone, and only a few hours after the events of which we have spoken.<a name=91:10></a> The two malefactors were hanging on the cross on either side of Jesus.<a name=91:11></a> What a dark picture outwardly!<a name=91:12></a> Three men, nailed on the cross, were enduring the most atrocious sufferings; and One of them was "just".<a name=91:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=94:1></a> The New Testament scripture that directly connects with our subject -- that of royalty as set out in David -- is in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>"If we suffer, we shall also reign with him" (verse 12), reminding us that suffering now qualifies us for reigning, and moreover builds up a royal character in the people of God.<a name=94:2></a> In order that the subject may be clear, it may be remarked that in looking at David we must bear in mind that he is not always a type of Christ, even as marked by what is spiritual; he is sometimes a type of the saints as partaking of what is spiritual.<a name=94:3></a> This applies in measure to all the types.<a name=94:4></a> Sometimes David rises to a full type of Christ personally; but he is perhaps as often a type of the saints as the subjects of the work of God, and this includes the character of royalty; for royalty is attached to the saints.<a name=94:5></a> It is, of course, seen in Christ supremely, but it is also seen in His people; as it is said, "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:6">Revelation  1:6</a>), and a "royal priesthood", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:9">1 Peter  2:9</a>.<a name=94:6></a> It is from this latter point of view that I have thought of this subject; that we might partake of royalty in character, as partaking of suffering, with a view to functioning by and by in rule.<a name=94:7></a> Another thing to be observed in relation to this subject is that in the early section we have Jehovah as supreme in view, and the ark, and then David himself.<a name=94:8></a> Later we shall see that sonship comes into view, but we have to bear all these features in mind to understand the place royalty has in this section, as seen in David.<a name=94:9></a>

		a royal priesthood, and also in the Revelation that we are made kings and priests.<a name=95:1></a> But we have to understand what that means; and it will be seen as we proceed in David's history, that the first book of Samuel presents him not as reigning, but in the character of a <i>sufferer</i>.<a name=95:2></a> I suggested reading <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#22:51">2 Samuel  22:51</a> because it speaks of David as God's king.<a name=95:3></a> That is characteristic; God's king must bear the royal feature, not only officially but personally.<a name=95:4></a> That is also seen in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:6">Psalm  2:6</a>: "Yet have I set <i>my</i> king upon my holy hill of Zion".<a name=95:5></a> Before he is installed, he is king in <i>character</i>, he is royal.<a name=95:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=95:9></a> Yes.<a name=95:10></a> The early chapters of 1 Corinthians help as to this subject.<a name=95:11></a> Paul shows that his outward circumstances were most despicable in man's eye, but still they were truly royal; whereas the Corinthian leaders were reigning as kings.<a name=95:12></a> They were respectable; they were honoured; they were great in this world; whereas Paul was as the filth and offscouring of the world, as he says, until the day on which he wrote, chapter 4: 13.<a name=95:13></a> But he was showing true royalty, for it is in suffering it is seen now.<a name=95:14></a>

		HEADSHIP SEEN IN DAVID

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=111:1></a> It may be remarked that we considered royalty in David yesterday, so that it seems as if <i>headship</i> in David would be a fitting subject to follow.<a name=111:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In considering the subject of royalty we proceeded as far as David dancing before the ark as it approached mount Zion.<a name=111:3></a> Whilst David rises at times to a type of Christ personally, he also represents the <i>royal</i> feature in the saints, for it is only in the saints we should look for dancing before the ark, which is a type of Christ personally, as the power of God and the glory of God.<a name=111:4></a> That is, in occupation administratively with the things of God, we are to serve royally, but we come to recognise that the excellency of the power is of God and not of us.<a name=111:5></a> Then it was pointed out that there is an additional feature immediately, namely, sonship as seen in the passage in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>.<a name=111:6></a> Sonship is introduced without Solomon being named, although he is alluded to as the seed of David.<a name=111:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject of sonship stands allied with what is before us today, for it is a son who is head.<a name=111:8></a> If we are to reach headship, we have to follow this line; that is, we come to sonship, and then we enter on an experience of displacement; Solomon the son is in mind as displacing David, but the displacement really implies merging, as this psalm shows.<a name=111:9></a> It shows that David was regarded as a son, for it is said in verse 26: "<i>He</i> shall call unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation", and then Jehovah says, "And as to me, I will make him firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth".<a name=111:10></a> So that we have to bear in mind that David is the great governing idea -- David viewed as a type of Christ -- and as we progress to sonship we must not lose sight of him; David tells us himself in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#28">1 Chronicles  28</a>, that he was made "king over Israel <i>for ever</i>", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#28:4">1 Chronicles  28:4</a>.<a name=111:11></a>

		So that it is David's throne, but whilst it is the throne of David on which Solomon sits, it is also the throne of Jehovah -- which is to be noted in the last chapter: "And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father".<a name=112:1></a> We are now definitely in the presence of sonship installed on the throne of Jehovah, and it is in this connection that the thought of headship appears formally; David refers to Jehovah as "Head above all".<a name=112:2></a> So that, bearing these things in mind, by the Lord's help, we may consider David as accepting the substitution of the son for himself in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#17">1 Chronicles  17</a>.<a name=112:3></a> Solomon is spoken of before he was born, in chapter 17 and in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7">2 Samuel  7</a>, but as he is born our attention is called to him: David calls him Solomon, and then he is prophetically called Jedidiah; that is, he is <i>peace</i> to David, but he is <i>beloved</i> of Jehovah.<a name=112:4></a> He is prophetically indicated as one whom Jehovah loves.<a name=112:5></a> The prophetic word is what brings the thing home to us in its initial stage; that is, Nathan announces him as Jedidiah, and so we are to understand that the one who sat on the throne of Jehovah, is loved of Jehovah.<a name=112:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=112:9></a> Headship is in wisdom, in allocating responsibility to all the saints and in the ordering of their service: disclosing the wisdom of God.<a name=112:10></a> Christ is said to be "made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>.<a name=112:11></a> He is made that on God's part, and in due course He comes to be apprehended as allocating responsibility, and then as ordering the various services of the kingdom and the house.<a name=112:12></a> So David in chapter 23 installs Solomon his son on the throne with himself.<a name=112:13></a> The features represented respectively in David and Solomon run on together; and then you have immediately the number of the Levites, thirty-eight thousand, and their responsibility; twenty-four thousand of them to preside over the work

		of the house, six thousand for officers and judges, four thousand for doorkeepers, and four thousand singers.<a name=113:1></a> That is, the son is on the throne -- David yet on it, too -- and you have the great general thought of the distribution of responsibility to the Levites; so that headship in Christ becomes apprehended in this way.<a name=113:2></a> Romans, for instance, brings Him in as Lord, that is, He is in the place of authority, and then He begins to be personally great to us; "much more" is repeatedly said of Him, so that He becomes increasingly great to us morally.<a name=113:3></a> In Corinthians, He is "made to us wisdom" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>, and in that epistle it is said that His head is God: "the Christ's head God", chapter 11: 3.<a name=113:4></a> But then in Colossians He is Head to us on personal grounds; He is formally called the Son of the Father's love, into whose kingdom we are introduced, and He is said to be "head of the body, the assembly", chapter 1: 18 that is the full statement; so that the believer learns to look to Him for guidance; we hold the Head.<a name=113:5></a> That is to say, we have to do with matters that have never been considered before; well, He comes in in that way, and it is not a question of what is commanded, but of what you will get from Christ at the particular time.<a name=113:6></a> As we acquire knowledge of Him as Head, we are never baffled, we get wisdom from Him.<a name=113:7></a> Then in Ephesians, He is said to be "head over all things to the assembly" (chapter 1: 22); that is, you see the full bearing of His headship.<a name=113:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=114:4></a> That is a good illustration of what we are saying.<a name=114:5></a> In 1 Chronicles sonship is passive, as you might say; it is Solomon coming into view and being recognised.<a name=114:6></a> But in 1 Kings it is active; the case of the mothers of the children coming in after David died, is a test case.<a name=114:7></a> It is a question of bringing out headship, the wisdom we can rely on in Christ.<a name=114:8></a> Such cases come up constantly.<a name=114:9></a> There are commandments, that is, great general principles and precedents, but then, there are difficulties not hitherto encountered, and these require fresh light from the Lord.<a name=114:10></a>

		I read the passage so as to link it on with <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#24">Numbers  24</a>, as calculated to amplify what we find in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8">Mark  8</a>.<a name=129:7></a> The subject is of the deepest importance; for we have to do today with peculiarly darkening influences, such as perhaps have not existed before; and hence the greater need for eyesight, a clear vision.<a name=129:8></a> If the visibility is bad, there is all the more need for power of vision; and the horizon today is terribly darkened, the darkness being intensified, so that it may be felt, and is felt, by those who are with God.<a name=129:9></a> Throughout Scripture you find allusions to the danger of poor sight.<a name=129:10></a> Peter speaks of some with whom certain features are not found, and says, "he that lacketh these things is blind" <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:9">2 Peter  1:9</a>.<a name=129:11></a> They are nominal christians, perhaps real christians, but they are "blind, and cannot see afar off", and have forgotten that they are purged from their former sins, a most distressing state for any nominal christian to be in.<a name=129:12></a> Peter shows that it is because of their not having certain features in their faith, such as virtue, knowledge, and

		In our meetings for prayer, for instance, do we include the whole field?<a name=130:3></a> It is said that the Lord bought the field, because of what was in it, and He is operating in it and looks for co-operation from us, and in no way can we co-operate more effectually than in prayer, and for this we must learn to include the whole field to enlarge our perspective.<a name=130:4></a> Then, another thing which is suggested in not seeing afar off, is the want of occupation anticipatively with the future.<a name=130:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember the distinction made in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#9:9">1 Samuel  9:9</a> between a "seer" and a "prophet".<a name=130:6></a> Those who at that time were called prophets, were in earlier days called seers, that is, persons who saw.<a name=130:7></a> Not persons who went about the world to see the scenery; the Spirit of God attaches no importance to that whatever.<a name=130:8></a> The men of faith were not occupied with such things; they looked at spiritual things.<a name=130:9></a> We are told that they saw the promises afar off and embraced them (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:13">Hebrews  11:13</a>); they looked for a city too, we are told, and the Lord Jesus said of one of them that he "rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a>); he saw it afar off.<a name=130:10></a> So that the idea of <i>seeing</i> laid hold of men, and men who saw things were subsequently called prophets.<a name=130:11></a>

		These remarks will lead you to see what is in my mind, and also, I hope, will lead to an enquiry as to our practical eyesight; how we look at things, and even if our horizon be limited, whether we see the limited sphere clearly; even if it be a local matter to be settled or adjusted.<a name=130:12></a> That we may see and feel the difficulty is one thing, but to see <i>all</i> the circumstances attaching to it is another matter.<a name=130:13></a> The Lord would have us to see "all things clearly".<a name=130:14></a>

		Well, I want to show you how Balaam's history illustrates all this.<a name=134:3></a> This is the third blessing or prophecy of Balaam; there are four of them.<a name=134:4></a> Some of you perhaps may not know his history, but it is well known to most of us, and I only wish to touch on what bears out what I have been saying.<a name=134:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#23">Numbers  23</a>you have his two first pronouncements, and you will discern that in making them he was governed by double motives.<a name=134:6></a> He was there for the "reward of unrighteousness", <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#2:15">2 Peter  2:15</a>.<a name=134:7></a> He was hired by Balak to curse Israel, and the reward of unrighteousness was in his mind, and what he would like to do was to curse Israel.<a name=134:8></a> As is often the case in matters that we have to deal with, we pre-judge them and we would like that judgment to go through.<a name=134:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am only speaking of Balaam as an illustration.<a name=134:10></a> He was a wicked man; but for the moment, he is under God's hand in a remarkable way.<a name=134:11></a> He left his place in Syria as a hireling, pretending that he would not say anything that God did not wish him to say.<a name=134:12></a> How often it is so with us!<a name=134:13></a> We say that we would not think or say a word that God does not wish us to say, and yet we pre-judge a matter, and we wish the thing to go according to our pre-judgment.<a name=134:14></a> But God is standing in the way, and He will not let it go that way.<a name=134:15></a> So what you find with Balaam is that God met him.<a name=134:16></a> You cannot overcome God.<a name=134:17></a> As you pre-judge a matter, He is standing athwart your judgment, and hence it cannot prevail.<a name=134:18></a> And Balaam's did not.<a name=134:19></a> Instead of cursing he is obliged to bless Israel.<a name=134:20></a>

		Well, all this is the result, as I said, of the renouncement of pre-judgments, and seeing that God's judgment must go through.<a name=139:6></a> That is what Balaam arrived at, and hence these wonderful statements.<a name=139:7></a> So he goes on to say, "He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted".<a name=139:8></a> There is now what Israel does, what the saints may do as things are adjusted according to God.<a name=139:9></a> As they are seen, and as they move, and are set together according to God, they have buckets of their own, and they can supply water to others; they have drawn from the rivers and now they have water for others.<a name=139:10></a> And "his seed shall be in many waters", meaning a great enlargement or spreading out of this wonderful seed, for in truth it is to fill the earth.<a name=139:11></a> What is of God is to fill the world; all else has to go.<a name=139:12></a> So he goes on to say, "his kingdom shall be exalted.<a name=139:13></a> God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.<a name=139:14></a> He couched, he lay down as a lion, .<a name=139:15></a>.<a name=139:16></a>.<a name=139:17></a> : who shall stir him up?<a name=139:18></a> Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee".<a name=139:19></a>

		It may be remarked that one great idea in the thought of covenant in the scripture is confirmation of faith.<a name=141:9></a> We have in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8">Genesis  8</a>the statement by Jehovah to Noah, that on the ground of sacrifice, "While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>.<a name=141:10></a> The covenant here is obviously based on sacrifice, and the sign is not only for us but for God; He would assure our hearts that He will not forget; not that He ever does forget, in that sense, but it is <i>to assure us</i> that He will not forget.<a name=141:11></a> "I will look upon it", He says in verse 16.<a name=141:12></a> It has a wide bearing.<a name=141:13></a> In the Psalms the earth is used symbolically of that which is immovable, which is founded for ever, and the bearing of the covenant here would be to establish faith by the continuance of conditions that are favourable.<a name=141:14></a> Conditions were favourable -- "seedtime and harvest, and cold and

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=142:5></a> Yes, blessing is evidently based on that.<a name=142:6></a> Following on the altar and the offerings upon it in chapter 8: 20, it says, "And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour.<a name=142:7></a> And Jehovah said in his heart, I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man, for the thought of Man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will no more smite every living thing, as I have done.<a name=142:8></a> Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.<a name=142:9></a> And God blessed Noah and his sons".<a name=142:10></a> That is an order of things that is very favourable, and I think, in chapter 9, the covenant is to confirm faith as to it.<a name=142:11></a> In the New Testament, it is taken up in regard of the throne that stood in the heaven, and Him that sat upon it.<a name=142:12></a> The rainbow in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>is specially mentioned, and what it was like -- "A rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald", pointing doubtless to the colour, the freshness of it, that it has lost nothing of its freshness; there is no change with God, the covenant stands as much today as when it was made.<a name=142:13></a>

		THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANTS (4)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#31:12">Exodus  31:12</a> - 17; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:23">1 Corinthians  11:23</a> - 26
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=193:1></a> Our subject is signs of covenants spoken of in Scripture.<a name=193:2></a> We began with the rainbow, then circumcision as the sign of the covenant made with Abraham, and the seven ewe-lambs given to Abimelech by Abraham witnessing to the fact that he had dug the well.<a name=193:3></a> Circumcision is the putting off of "the body of the flesh", but the well is the bringing in of the positive thing, the spirit of Christ, the heavenly Man.<a name=193:4></a> Then we considered Isaac and the digging of the well by Abraham.<a name=193:5></a> Isaac's servants said, "We have found water", and Isaac calls the well Shebah, connecting it with what Abraham said as to the well of the oath; the well of the oath would imply the means of maintaining the covenant in a heavenly way, it is in the power of the Spirit.<a name=193:6></a> We have the word "city" added in Isaac's case, in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#26">Genesis  26</a>, the city was called Beer-sheba unto this day.<a name=193:7></a> That is not only the negative thought of "the putting off of the body of the flesh", but the putting on -- the well so prominently mentioned implying the Spirit; and the city, according to Ephesians, implying a sphere where the Spirit is free to develop heavenly thoughts.<a name=193:8></a> One of the greatest thoughts of the assembly is that it is heavenly, although here, such a vessel is available to God to develop His thoughts, especially of government and light and order.<a name=193:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we had the sign of the covenant between Laban and Jacob, which, as pointed out, was a very humiliating thing; a heap of stones, intended to be a witness between brethren who are separated.<a name=193:10></a> Instead of denoting the presence of active love, it denoted the negation of it in brethren being mutually agreed to be absent one from the other, and to be contented in the absence.<a name=193:11></a> A humbling side of the truth, but one to be observed, because it is so marked in the history of the assembly, alas,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		certainly it marks its public history, and, as was remarked today, we have not far to go in seeing it, in brethren together, although perhaps on right ground, yet out of keeping with it in their spirits.<a name=194:1></a> The mutual recriminations marking Jacob and Laban often mark local meetings, and therefore, it is a sign to be avoided; anything that reminds us of our true state is not to be ignored, but it is most humbling to have such a witness.<a name=194:2></a> It was pointed out that there is correspondence with what arose at Corinth after the apostle's departure; brethren divided up into coteries, possibly implying social distinctions, yet carrying on the symbol of the Lord's supper without the love, carrying it on in a partisan way; not yet divided up into separate rooms, but in the same hall apparently, yet divided up into coteries, so the word "Galeed" might be written up over the whole scene, and the apostle says, "this is not to eat the Lord's supper".<a name=194:3></a> Although negative, it is important to have this to express the truth, something to warn us that we should keep away from the state it describes.<a name=194:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Genesis the work of God is allowed to show and prove itself, without formal authority or requirements from God; and alas, the works of the flesh too, show themselves; for there was little to restrain Jacob and Laban in what they were doing, Jacob in amassing wealth and making Laban wealthy too -- it was just a commercial matter.<a name=194:5></a> Laban's sons were talking about the glory that Jacob had acquired, their idea of glory was just sheep and oxen and lands -- material things; but what we may reach is the kind of glory that accrues from the covenant of God.<a name=194:6></a> The sign of the covenant, of the new covenant, as we have it before us now, is said to be the ministry of the Spirit which "subsists in glory"; and "the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory", and again, "that which abides subsists in glory", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:11">2 Corinthians  3:11</a>.<a name=194:7></a> It is glory of an excessive kind; not glory in the wealth or status or education of this world, but what

	<div class="paragraph">
		accrues from the covenant of God, the new covenant.<a name=195:1></a> What may be also remarked, is, that we are now on ministerial ground for the moment -- that is Exodus and Corinthians -- going on to heaven.<a name=195:2></a> It is no longer left to us as to what we will do, but everything is carefully prescribed for, a most needful provision.<a name=195:3></a> Ministerial ground is the ground of Moses and Aaron, the one maintaining the authority of God here, and the other maintaining the worship and service of God inside -- the minister of the sanctuary.<a name=195:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=195:5></a>G.<a name=195:6></a> The scripture read in Exodus is after the directions as to the house of God had been given.<a name=195:7></a> Would the connection with what we have had before lie in the fact that Jacob reached Bethel, which is the house of God?<a name=195:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=195:9></a> Yes, he was going on to it.<a name=195:10></a> I believe the setting up of the pillar, as was pointed out this morning, was a lead given which God respected and made way for, for he moved on, and finally by the grace of God came to Bethel.<a name=195:11></a> Bethel in Genesis is just an abstract thought.<a name=195:12></a> It is connected with Jacob very noticeably, but it is an abstract thought; still, the ideas attaching to the house are very clearly set out there.<a name=195:13></a> When we come to Exodus, it is not an abstract thought, we have material, and the building; we do not get that in Genesis.<a name=195:14></a> It is not now a heap of stones, but material of the very finest quality; everything that is divinely required is supplied and constructed, not as a heap, but according to divine specification.<a name=195:15></a> There was not to be one iota of divergence from those specifications, and not only from the specifications, but the pattern <i>shown</i>, shown to one man only; so that we are dependent wholly on one man as to this, but that man is a minister, "faithful in all God's house".<a name=195:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=196:1></a> Yes, that comes in under Moses as having its own significance; but there is to be no divergence as to the quality of the material, it is to be excellent; so that Exodus is the supply secured through redemption.<a name=196:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=196:3></a> How would this sign of the sabbath be seen today?<a name=196:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=196:5></a> Well, it is noticeable that the term is found first in Exodus; the thing is in Genesis, but the term is found first in Exodus.<a name=196:6></a> You may have the things, as in the Old Testament, but unnamed.<a name=196:7></a> In the New Testament we have names, accurate names.<a name=196:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.G.<a name=196:9></a> Was the sabbath ever kept until the days of Moses when the instruction was given?<a name=196:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=196:11></a> There is no evidence that it was.<a name=196:12></a> In Exodus we are on ministerial ground, where there is the sense of obligation to have things right, and that, as having things right, nothing of importance is omitted, things are gathered up and named.<a name=196:13></a> Figuratively, it is the coming in of Christ to take up everything; He linked things on with the beginning, He linked certain things on with their primary setting, so that we might know what they meant.<a name=196:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=196:15></a> Would you connect the pattern with the commandment?<a name=196:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=196:17></a> The pattern is more than the commandment; the pattern is the mind of God presented concretely; nobody saw it but Moses, as far as the Scripture shows; he was a man to whom things could be shown.<a name=196:18></a> "The form of Jehovah", for instance, "doth he behold", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:8">Numbers  12:8</a>.<a name=196:19></a> That was said of no one else.<a name=196:20></a> There is an allusion there to the great Mediator, the One who alone could see these things.<a name=196:21></a> It proved the pattern was Christ.<a name=196:22></a> Moses saw Him in such a sense, but not like Abraham -- Abraham rejoiced to see His day, the Lord said, "he saw it, and was glad" <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a>; he saw it in Isaac, I suppose, when Isaac was born and weaned -- but Moses saw the pattern, as the one who was obligated in regard of it, like an architect.<a name=196:23></a> To go back to Proverbs,

		wisdom was God's architect, so to say.<a name=197:1></a> We must now be prepared for great accuracy, and no deviation, no such word as 'non-essentials' can be allowed, everything is essential, nothing must be left out that is divinely required.<a name=197:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.G.<a name=197:3></a> Do you suggest it is secured through redemption?<a name=197:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=197:5></a> Yes, God would not bring in a ministerial system without redemption, without the liberty wherewith Christ sets us free; it is a system of liberty founded on redemption.<a name=197:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=197:7></a> Why does the sabbath first come in Exodus in relation to the manna?<a name=197:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=197:9></a> Well, that is a point to be noticed.<a name=197:10></a> God says, "Tomorrow" -- it is near by, when you have the manna, the sabbath is near by -- that is the general principle.<a name=197:11></a> The principle of restriction is introduced; you are not to gather it on the sabbath, but you can gather twice as much the day before; so that there is the suggestion of increased capacity, capability of enlargement and the power to keep things until the time arrives.<a name=197:12></a> Like Mary, she acquired the habit, or power, of keeping things -- "against the day of my burying hath she kept this", the Lord says; <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:7">John  12:7</a>.<a name=197:13></a> Only a day to keep the manna, but still it was that principle, to gather twice as much, and keep what was needed for the sabbath with liberty to store it, which is only found in that connection.<a name=197:14></a> That is, there is the principle of liberty attaching to the Person of Christ here.<a name=197:15></a> When the Lord went through the corn fields, for instance, the disciples went further than He did -- they plucked the corn and rubbed it in their hands, and the Lord defends that; that is, He was inaugurating a system of liberty, He was the Leader in that, the presence of the manna brought about a state of liberty and with all that, the power to keep things.<a name=197:16></a> Keeping things under divine principle is right; but keeping back a thing that you should give out at the reading meeting, thinking you

	<div class="paragraph">
		will get a better opportunity later on, God does not approve of that.<a name=198:1></a> If you have a thing to give out, give it out.<a name=198:2></a> Then there are things that have to be kept back; you may have to keep things back for the good of the saints -- Paul did that; not because he wanted some fine thought for some special occasion -- that is not the idea at all.<a name=198:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.M.<a name=198:4></a> You mention the reading meeting, would you apply the same thing to the morning meeting; we may keep back something on the Lord's day morning in priestly service thinking to give it on another occasion.<a name=198:5></a> Would that be an occasion for the manna to breed worms?<a name=198:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=198:7></a> Quite so.<a name=198:8></a> Give it out, if the Lord lays it on your heart.<a name=198:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=198:10></a>S.<a name=198:11></a> Is the sign to preserve us during the absence of Christ?<a name=198:12></a> I was thinking of the following chapter (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32">Exodus  32</a>); the people failed during the absence of Moses.<a name=198:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=198:14></a> Quite so.<a name=198:15></a> They did not know where he was "as for this Moses .<a name=198:16></a>.<a name=198:17></a>.<a name=198:18></a> we wot not what is become of him!<a name=198:19></a>" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:1">Exodus  32:1</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=198:20></a>S.<a name=198:21></a> I thought if they had been in the restfulness which this sign would bring about they would have been preserved.<a name=198:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=198:23></a> Yes, they certainly would not have made the calf.<a name=198:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.G.<a name=198:25></a> What have you in mind as answering to this sign today?<a name=198:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=198:27></a> Well, we propose in this reading, to confine ourselves to the two thoughts, that is, the first covenant, and the second -- to keep the idea of the sign before us.<a name=198:28></a> The sign of the first covenant was the sabbath; the second, according to the way the Lord presents it in the gospels, and the apostle in the Corinthians, is the sign of the Lord's supper; that is the cup -- He says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:25">1 Corinthians  11:25</a>): that is, the literal cup that He took into His

		<a name=199>[Page 199]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hand.<a name=199:1></a> So that our concern is to arrive at an understanding of the cup as a sign of the new covenant; not ignoring the sabbath, because it also has its force today.<a name=199:2></a> It is to arrive at a state of spiritual restfulness in the presence of Christ, and that is, I think, where <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16">Exodus  16</a>is so instructive, showing that the sabbath was there -- "Tomorrow is the .<a name=199:3></a>.<a name=199:4></a>.<a name=199:5></a> sabbath" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16:23">Exodus  16:23</a>.<a name=199:6></a> The sabbath of rest is in the Person of Christ, even as the manna gave rest; where He is, there it is.<a name=199:7></a> Why not avail yourself of it?<a name=199:8></a> -- this restfulness.<a name=199:9></a> If anyone were to look into the Scriptures and compute the actual time required to be spent by Israel in keeping Sabbath, they would find that it covered more than one-fourth of their time.<a name=199:10></a> It is a very important matter; it shows what the sabbath is in the mind of God; it is to accustom us to eternity beforehand.<a name=199:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.I.<a name=199:12></a> Does the entering into the truth of these two signs, the sabbath and the covenant, make us available in the service of the Lord, because in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#56">Isaiah  56</a>it speaks of laying hold of the sabbath and the covenant, so that the people might become available in a priestly way for the service of Jehovah?<a name=199:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=199:14></a> That is how it stands, I think.<a name=199:15></a> We have to learn to keep our sabbaths, to lie fallow, and to learn to be inactive in a spiritual way; to do no servile work.<a name=199:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=199:17></a> Would the spirit of the covenant bring in liberty and glory in view of the Supper?<a name=199:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=199:19></a> Well, it does.<a name=199:20></a> I think it is significant that the principle of keeping comes in in connection with <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16">Exodus  16</a>-- they could keep things, and then that the sabbath is so near -- "Tomorrow is the .<a name=199:21></a>.<a name=199:22></a>.<a name=199:23></a> sabbath".<a name=199:24></a> It is so near as the manna is seen and utilised.<a name=199:25></a> I think it is to call attention to what Christ was as here, in lowly circumstances.<a name=199:26></a> The manna was a small round thing lying on the face of the ground, a nameless thing -- "What is it?<a name=199:27></a>" -- you might ask it always of yourself.<a name=199:28></a> As understood, there is a sense of rest in it.<a name=199:29></a> The Lord had to say, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are

		THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANTS (5)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=211:1></a> It will be well to bear in mind what has been remarked, that the ministerial features under which the covenant appears in Exodus, suggest authority and accuracy, important items in relation to the truth.<a name=211:2></a> This chapter stresses the thought, the apostle speaking of competency in himself and others as ministers of the new covenant.<a name=211:3></a> The position in Exodus is marked by this feature, the Spirit of God introducing Moses almost immediately; first as a babe, then as a full-grown man, then in the school of God for forty years, then as seeing a manifestation of God.<a name=211:4></a> Then we have the genealogy coming down from Levi, Aaron being of the same family, and then we have "this is that Moses and Aaron" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6:27">Exodus  6:27</a>), so that we are assured as to the ministers -- who they are.<a name=211:5></a> Much place is given to Moses, and Jehovah said to him, "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron .<a name=211:6></a>.<a name=211:7></a>.<a name=211:8></a> shall be thy prophet" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#7:1">Exodus  7:1</a>), thus the authority is greatly stressed; and throughout his history the Spirit brings forward qualities with regard to himself, such as, that there was no one like him in meekness; <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:3">Numbers  12:3</a>.<a name=211:9></a> Then in Deuteronomy he is seen as suffering God's anger on account of the people.<a name=211:10></a> In Numbers God is displeased with him on his own account, yet in Deuteronomy it is on account of Israel, so that he rises to the type of the Mediator, even in regard of atonement; he felt the anger of God, he turned it away from Israel: all that is typical of what has come out in Christ, and what is peculiarly seen in Paul's service.<a name=211:11></a> So that the ministry comes through such an one as Paul, made of God a competent minister of the new covenant.<a name=211:12></a> Things, therefore, have come to us unmarred, they have come to us as from God, through him.<a name=211:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=212:3></a> Well, that is the kind of authority that enters into the effectuation of the covenant; it is not a harsh authority, it is tempered, there is nothing about it to prejudice us, so that what is meant should come to us in its full preciousness; and the thought widens out to all who are in the position of ministers of God, so that the truth is thus exemplified in the one in whom it is presented; it thus gives us impressions, not only by what is said, but by the persons who say it.<a name=212:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=212:8></a> I think the covenant is already made; it is not like the ten words, it is more the covenant in the spirit of it.<a name=212:9></a> In the second giving of the law in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:27">Exodus  34:27</a>, Jehovah says, "after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel".<a name=212:10></a> There is not so much said there, as at the first giving, but we have the word "tenor" which we do not have in the first.<a name=212:11></a> The point of the new covenant is that it is <i>in spirit</i> not in letter -- the letter kills.<a name=212:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=212:17></a> Yes, it is really being effectuated now in a greater and fuller way because of what the assembly is to divine Persons.<a name=212:18></a> It is not <i>made</i> with the assembly, but it is applied to the members of the assembly, and in a fuller and greater way than it will be applied to Israel.<a name=212:19></a> The law is written in their hearts and in their minds; instead of that we have the blessed Holy Spirit Himself in us -- "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit", as it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>.<a name=212:20></a> That is Romans, that is part of the gospel; it is not called the covenant in Romans, but the thing is there; but the Corinthian epistles stress the ministerial side

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=215:10></a> That is right; it involves the whole chapter, you might say.<a name=215:11></a> We should go back to the first epistle to see how this ministerial subject is developed; and to see how at the present time the truth comes to the saints in the appointed way, through ministry.<a name=215:12></a> These saints were called of God, but that includes what comes through ministry and this comes through competent ministers.<a name=215:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=215:16></a> No, they were partisans; you cannot get competency in a minister who is on partisan or clerical lines.<a name=215:17></a> The subject is most important in both epistles, and links on with Exodus; there you get the kind of persons -- "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=215:18></a> I know that he can speak well.<a name=215:19></a> And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:14">Exodus  4:14</a>.<a name=215:20></a> That is the kind of thing that underlies competency, God having taken a man in hand.<a name=215:21></a> What can be greater in the mind of God in regard of ministry, than competency; that ministry should reach the saints unimpaired.<a name=215:22></a> You get the general thought in Exodus, then you see how it works out, and the pains God took with Moses; Aaron, too, was under God's eye; he was eighty-three years of age when God spoke about him.<a name=215:23></a> He had been in the school of God -- who says, "I know that he can speak well.<a name=215:24></a> And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and when

		J.T.<a name=236:1></a> We get the thought of the water of purification in this gospel.<a name=236:2></a> The subject is somewhat extensive so that we shall need to touch each scripture lightly.<a name=236:3></a> <i>The first</i>, gives the idea of a vessel (or vessels), empty, but intended to contain the water of purification: <i>the second</i>, is the application of the thought on the principle of birth so as to enter the kingdom, and that there should be spiritual movement: <i>the third</i>, is the principle applied to us in relation to the position of Christ here in humanity, so that faith has its eyes open to look upon Him in another connection and another world, the clay alluding to the incarnation, to the Lord as He was then; faith should be directed to Him as He is now, in another world as the Son of God: <i>the fourth</i>, is entrance into the privilege of having part with Christ, He having come from God, and going to God.<a name=236:4></a> The link is very plain, I think, and the subject is progressive.<a name=236:5></a> The first calls attention to what is current amongst us and around us; there are many vessels empty that should be useful as containing vessels -- not yet of living water, but of the water of purification.<a name=236:6></a> John presents that thought of containing vessels, the water of purification being turned into the wine of joy under the direction of Christ, and the drawing-out process.<a name=236:7></a> The application of this passage in chapter 2 is generally to young people; you are perhaps standing, but you are of no practical value, and yet not to be despised because you are there.<a name=236:8></a> "There were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews", <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:6">John  2:6</a>.<a name=236:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=249:1></a> It is proposed to consider Jacob as representing a father, and Joseph, a son, and Ephraim and Manasseh the saints as secured by Christ as among the gentiles.<a name=249:2></a> Stress is laid by Jacob on their having been born in Egypt, before he came there; and Joseph, in keeping with that, says that God had given them to him, as he says, "They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place"; that is, in Egypt.<a name=249:3></a> Applying <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#48">Genesis  48</a>to the present time, it contemplates the <i>outward</i> weakness that marks our position, as indeed marked the position of the assembly from the outset, but particularly in the last days.<a name=249:4></a> Yet, in this weakness, we have the clearest setting out of the divine mind.<a name=249:5></a> Jacob speaks in the most definite way as to what was in his mind, and he would not be turned aside from it, although it cut across the human mind.<a name=249:6></a> In this attitude Jacob stresses his thought to take on these two sons of Joseph, and give them a status on the very highest plane; he says, "Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon".<a name=249:7></a> Then, as Joseph brings them to Jacob, who enquires as to them, Joseph says, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here", but Jacob regards them as his, and blesses them accordingly.<a name=249:8></a>

		These scriptures are all peculiar to John, and, like others in his gospel, they bear on the last days of our dispensation.<a name=265:1></a> His writings indicate, with other prophecies of the New Testament, that there was to be a revival and it has come to pass; it is no longer a matter of prophecy but of fact, of history, past and current; a revival, not only of light and knowledge, but of affections, of the living features of christianity.<a name=265:2></a> While John in his gospel thus provides for the last days, he does not deal solely in last day events, but links on these events of the last days with the very first events.<a name=265:3></a> No one indeed goes back further than John, no one could; he opens with an allusion to the beginning of the divine operations, telling us that, in that beginning, the Word <i>was</i>, Jesus was; so that it is very comprehensive.<a name=265:4></a> In going so far back, he presents to us our Saviour in the Deity, personally existent there, but also operative there, whatever was made, was made by Him; and I need not say that John takes us on to the future as far as anyone else does.<a name=265:5></a> So that, whilst he bears, as I said, on our times, there is an immensity behind and before, and an immensity present.<a name=265:6></a> However he views Christ, whether in his gospel or in the Apocalypse, we are impressed with this One "who is, and who was, and who is to come".<a name=265:7></a>

		Having these thoughts in one's mind, great as they are, and as feeling them to be great in some little way, I call attention first of all to John the Baptist's testimony of Jesus in these early verses: he uses the word "Behold!<a name=265:8></a>" Pilate uses it also, and presents Christ, saying, "Behold the man!<a name=265:9></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#19:5">John  19:5</a>" You can understand, dear brethren, how different would be the voice, how wanting in spiritual

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having arrived thus at the position the Spirit of God intends to convey to us by the baptist's testimony, I would dwell, for a moment, on the perfection presented.<a name=269:5></a> God begins with perfection; there is no idea of development in Jesus as presented here, there is no such thought in the testimony presented, it is all perfect there.<a name=269:6></a> Who could undertake to add to this scene?<a name=269:7></a> -- to that glorious Person who is there, with the Holy Spirit upon Him for ministry.<a name=269:8></a> The testimony is that this is "he .<a name=269:9></a>.<a name=269:10></a>.<a name=269:11></a> who baptises with the Holy Spirit" -- that is to say, He takes away the sin, the cause of the trouble, He is the taker-away of it, and He is the Introducer of the means of joy for God and man.<a name=269:12></a> The scene is perfect!<a name=269:13></a> There is no evolutionary thought here at all; that is banished for ever from the mind of the believer as applying to what God presents in christianity; it is a perfect state of things set up by God, one divine Person coming into a place of subservience to the divine will, but retaining His equality in the deity.<a name=269:14></a> That is the position.<a name=269:15></a> It is therefore, as I said, the mature side of things that the Holy Spirit would imbue our souls with at the outset.<a name=269:16></a> As it was in Genesis, so it is in John's gospel; there is a remarkable link between Genesis and John's gospel.<a name=269:17></a> In Genesis everything is done in the six days, and all is "very good" -- God's own pronouncement.<a name=269:18></a> Adam was not a development from babyhood to manhood, he was made a man -- so too Eve was made a woman.<a name=269:19></a> Everything from the hand of the Creator is as it should be, not as it would eventually be, but as it should be; it was there in perfection.<a name=269:20></a> It must be so from the hand of God.<a name=269:21></a> That answers to what you get here; and the Spirit would fill our souls with the glorious perfection of the position in the Persons presented.<a name=269:22></a>

		Well now, in chapter 3 the Spirit would tell us that this Person is not only admirable to John, but "The Father loveth the Son", verse 35.<a name=270:1></a> He is admirable to the minister, that is what is in mind in John the Baptist's testimony.<a name=270:2></a> It is not a question of christian state so much as the ministry, to find the minister that is pleasing to God as knowing how to speak of Jesus as seeing Him -- that He is "the Son of God"; one who knows how to speak of the Spirit as seeing Him, and who readily retires, saying, "He must increase, but I must decrease".<a name=270:3></a> So that the Spirit of God goes on from John's remarks in chapter 1 till he is brought in again in chapter 3, and he says there just what he said in chapter 1, he had not changed his mind about Christ one iota.<a name=270:4></a> It is a great matter to maintain or rather to increase in our apprehension of Christ.<a name=270:5></a> John introduces a beautiful background for this statement of the Spirit, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand".<a name=270:6></a> I apprehend in this, that the administration is in the hand of One who is loved, the Son is loved.<a name=270:7></a> As in the case of David, the Holy Spirit came upon him as one who was loved.<a name=270:8></a> ("David" means "beloved".<a name=270:9></a>) The first mention of David is as the Holy Spirit came upon him, the one who is loved; he is the one who is to do things, he does all the will of God.<a name=270:10></a>

		Then finally, in chapter 20, we have the continuation of this in the sense of confidence -- "The Father loves the Son" -- He has the utmost confidence in Him.<a name=275:4></a> There is no reserve in the Father's giving to the Son, it is "all things" without reserve.<a name=275:5></a> There is to be correspondence in the ministers with this; that is, there is to be confidence, there is to be that which the Lord can trust, dear brethren; the more there is of it, the more we shall have, for it is "to every one that has shall be given" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19:26">Luke  19:26</a>.<a name=275:6></a> So that the point in chapter 20 is to bring about correspondence with Christ in the sense of trustworthiness, so that things can be given over without any restraint.<a name=275:7></a> I do not know of anything more assuring for servants, than that the Lord hands things over without any restraint, He leaves it with you.<a name=275:8></a> How blessed to have the sense of this.<a name=275:9></a> 'What you do', He says, 'I will support'.<a name=275:10></a> Whoever's sins you remit, I will do it too -- "they are remitted to them", verse 23.<a name=275:11></a> I may go about visiting the brethren clumsily, but I have in mind that <i>sins should be remitted</i>; the Lord has intimated that what I do, <i>He</i> will do.<a name=275:12></a> I want to think of how He did that, how He remitted sins.<a name=275:13></a> What a great position to be in, to exercise administratively the grace of heaven in regard to one who has sinned; so that we know from the Lord that, if we do it, He will do it.<a name=275:14></a> Who can tell what He will do in the meantime, so that there may be the carrying out of His promise -- who can tell what He will do with that sinner in the interval so that he may indeed be worthy of forgiveness?<a name=275:15></a> But forgiveness is put first here, in keeping with the great position, for surely remission is the great thought!<a name=275:16></a> The end of the dispensation is not to be any less than the beginning of it, and, while Luke says much about forgiveness, he does not

		So in regard to this great subject of the city of God, it comes in after man has built his city or cities.<a name=277:3></a> The city that Cain built, was called after the name of his son (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:17">Genesis  4:17</a>), that is the first city mentioned, and the second is built by Nimrod.<a name=277:4></a> These afford us the features of the cities of this world.<a name=277:5></a> They are all in view in the Apocalypse, where we have mention of "the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11:8">Revelation  11:8</a>.<a name=277:6></a> The cities of the world all bear in that direction.<a name=277:7></a> They are to be apprehended <i>spiritually</i> in their fulness in the future as seen in the world's city, which is <i>spiritually</i> Sodom and Egypt.<a name=277:8></a> It is well for young people to bear that in mind, so that they may not be deceived by what the world's city affords.<a name=277:9></a> The Lord's supper, which is intended to appeal to our hearts, is in the midst of that city as it were.<a name=277:10></a> It was first instituted by the Lord in the city of Jerusalem.<a name=277:11></a> From the Lord's own remarks we learn that Jerusalem embodied all the features of wickedness at that time.<a name=277:12></a> He was about to be crucified in it, the culmination of all wickedness was the crucifixion of the Lord of glory; and the Lord instituted His supper there, that is, it was at the wickedest time, and <i>where</i> the murderous spirit was.<a name=277:13></a> This is not to be

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now that city begins with Cain and comes down through Nineveh which Nimrod built, and it is worked out today as it has never been worked out before.<a name=278:4></a> It is a city period in the history of men, and God by His Spirit is bring an anti-type before us.<a name=278:5></a> There has been a great revival in interest in regard to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, we have come to that.<a name=278:6></a> It is in the distance literally, but we have come to it in a spiritual sense, "the <i>heavenly</i> Jerusalem" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:22">Hebrews  12:22</a> it is called, as over against "the great city" of which I spoke.<a name=278:7></a> And that is the burden of what I have in mind, that we should understand that we are inhabitants of it, that we live in it.<a name=278:8></a> The book of Nehemiah shows that it was not much in favour even among returning Israel, the obligations of it were somewhat irksome to many of them; and so it is today.<a name=278:9></a>

		Now Genesis, whilst affording light to us by example as to the world's city, also introduces the city of God which He had prepared for His people, not that He had promised it, but He prepared it for them -- that is the comment of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>.<a name=278:10></a> "And if they had called to mind that from whence they went out, they had had opportunity to have returned; but now they seek a better, that is, a heavenly".<a name=278:11></a> That is the comment by the Spirit of God on the faith of that period.<a name=278:12></a> We may well emulate this, dear brethren, "now they seek a better [country], that is, a heavenly", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:16">Hebrews  11:16</a>.<a name=278:13></a>

		The words "better" and "heavenly" are leading words in Hebrews, they are significant indeed, for a better country is a heavenly country.<a name=279:1></a> All the better things, are heavenly things.<a name=279:2></a> And so God was not ashamed to be called their God, having prepared for them a city.<a name=279:3></a> Genesis brings before us the heavenly side, and then we have examples which we have already noticed in Beer-sheba, the city of "the well of the oath", suggesting that we come to the city where all these great thoughts of God are confirmed to us and realised by us.<a name=279:4></a> We do not attach ourselves to any nation on earth.<a name=279:5></a> We are all very prone to be national, but it is a deadening thing spiritually.<a name=279:6></a> We have to watch it.<a name=279:7></a> In some countries it is stronger than in others, but it is innate in all of us.<a name=279:8></a> Regard for 'my own native land' is a strong sentiment, but it is leaven.<a name=279:9></a> If you apply it to the earthly nation, the land they sought is a heavenly; the Scriptures are full of it, a land which the eye of God is upon from the beginning of the year to the end of it, a land of waterbrooks, hills and valleys, and vineyards and olive yards, "whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass" <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:9">Deuteronomy  8:9</a>.<a name=279:10></a> The wealth of the land is continually in the mind of the Spirit in Scripture, so as to allure us away from our earthly moorings, that we should be like Abraham, and get out from our country and kindred and father's house, that we may learn to cut the links of nature, and whilst recognising all that is to be recognised according to God, we may live in the heavenly.<a name=279:11></a> After all, the links of nature are easily snapped and at best our years are few here.<a name=279:12></a> And so Beer-sheba, the well of the oath, is suggestive of the city of God, where things are confirmed to us livingly, in which we are assured of the promises of God and the purposes of God, where Jacob offered up sacrifices.<a name=279:13></a> He was leaving the land, under the government of God, the God of his father Isaac, that is Christ risen from the dead, but he went down to Egypt in that light, and that is our position, Christ risen and glorified, "in him

		We reached yesterday afternoon, in chapter 4, the subject of formation, which, as was remarked, is perhaps the crux of the subject, for without it there can be no building up or elevation; and formation -- Christ being formed in us -- belongs to the phase of the truth that deliverance requires.<a name=367:6></a> There can be no stability or maturity, and hence no real foundation for building or entrance into heavenly or exalted thoughts, aside from Christ being formed in us.<a name=367:7></a> And what may be further remarked as to this great subject, is that it arises from the apostle's own service to the Galatians, and their relation to him as children.<a name=367:8></a> He addresses them thus in verse 19 of chapter 4: "my children".<a name=367:9></a> He purposes to speak from a maternal point of view; and the figure would carry with it the desire of a mother that the features of the father should be seen in the children.<a name=367:10></a> That is what the apostle aimed at.<a name=367:11></a> He had brought forward the paternal side of the truth in his announcing the glad tidings to them, and he had travailed, as he says, in birth, because he had to do it again now; hence, he had already travailed for them, as ministering among

		Now, I want to work out as fully as the time allows, from these women, an amplification of what I have said.<a name=448:4></a> Luke furnishes us with these five women, and they stand in his narrative in relation to one another, not promiscuously, but constructively.<a name=448:5></a> The thought of construction is an important idea to get into our minds.<a name=448:6></a> That is to say, the woman in chapter 4, prepares for the woman in chapter 7, and so on.<a name=448:7></a> The first great thought is simple, as indeed I hope you will see; it is subjection.<a name=448:8></a> It is said in the epistle to the Ephesians that "the assembly is subjected to the Christ", chapter 5:24.<a name=448:9></a> It is the divine mind that is thus conveyed to us, for that is to be her place and attitude; "subjected to the Christ", The relief that comes to this woman in chapter 4 makes way for this; the relief, as it were, synchronises in the result that the Lord intended, and I doubt whether anyone really profits by the gospel as the Lord intends, save that the result He has in mind synchronises with the relief, God must come into the mind as relief is enjoyed, if things are normal.<a name=448:10></a> This is an important matter, and applies to young believers, or to those who may be old in years, but have never yet come to it -- the Lord has need of them, for He has relieved them for a purpose.<a name=448:11></a> So the first thing, as I said, is subjection.<a name=448:12></a> The Lord, as you will observe here, stood <i>over</i> this woman.<a name=448:13></a> Think of <i>who</i> it was that stood over her.<a name=448:14></a> Picture the scene: a feverish person -- Peter's wife's mother, as in his house was in circumstances tending to irritability; but, however provocative a set of circumstances may be, there is no excuse for irritability.<a name=448:15></a> The work of God cannot go on in our souls in a feverish condition.<a name=448:16></a> The Lord is teaching us to be restful, to learn to lie fallow, to be in His hand, as clay in the hand of the potter.<a name=448:17></a> The Lord stood over her.<a name=448:18></a> What an impression it must have conveyed to her soul!<a name=448:19></a> Such
