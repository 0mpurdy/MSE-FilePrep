	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> This chapter has been before some of us lately, and with profit, but largely to develop out of it the import of the Lord's supper.<a name=1:3></a> This is in mind too now, only what is prominent at the moment is the idea of headship.<a name=1:4></a> The apostle brings himself forward and we cannot ignore the fact that he has been taken up by the Lord to develop this thought of the assembly.<a name=1:5></a> He did not fail to do so, for he is the one to do it, according to his word in the epistle to the Ephesians, "I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly".<a name=1:6></a> What is in mind now is to bring out the thought of headship in Christ and how it should develop in the working out of the Lord's supper.<a name=1:7></a> It would seem as if the Lord's supper is the initial idea in the service of God, and it may be remarked that the first day of the week has become increasingly valuable in connection with the Lord's supper and the service of God.<a name=1:8></a> All that follows in every week generally contributes to the service of God so that the brethren have come to regard it in this way.<a name=1:9></a> We have the service of God in the morning, and the scriptures read in the afternoon with a view to developing the truth and then the gospel preached in the evening.<a name=1:10></a> The first day of the week thus has a peculiar place as we all know in regard to the whole system of service.<a name=1:11></a> We commence with the Lord's supper and the service of God follows, so that the Father is approached and worshipped.<a name=1:12></a> The worship of God has thus acquired its proper place, and also what belongs to it, such as hymns, have acquired

	<div class="paragraph">
		their own place.<a name=2:1></a> Then too one believes that more and more there is real concern, at the present time, as to the Spirit and the place He should have.<a name=2:2></a> So that the service of the Spirit is not at all relegated in the service of God; it has its own place so that we have such thoughts as "Abba, Father", which would be by the Spirit and that belongs properly to the worship of the Father.<a name=2:3></a> I thought it well to lay out a little what is in mind both for this meeting and for the evening meeting.<a name=2:4></a> It may be remarked too that the types, as we properly call them, have acquired a great place, and such a place as they have not had earlier, so far as I can discern, and one believes the brethren would do well to use them, because they are intended to be used.<a name=2:5></a> Chapter 10 of this epistle refers to them.<a name=2:6></a> In fact in chapter 10 the cup is placed before the bread, but the order is the bread and the cup.<a name=2:7></a> There are not two suppers or really two parts of it, the idea is one Supper, it is the Lord's supper.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:9></a> There are believers in wrong associations who claim to partake of the Lord's supper.<a name=2:10></a> Would you say whether they can truly do that in wrong associations?<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:12></a> I am sure they cannot.<a name=2:13></a> The Scriptures are so full of instruction and, in that light, what you refer to cannot be accepted.<a name=2:14></a> There must be right principles and right doctrine underlying the service of God and the Lord's supper leading in it.<a name=2:15></a> There are probably a hundred so-called religious christian systems; but there can be only one according to God, and that is based on the Lord's supper.<a name=2:16></a> Then the service of God follows on that, the brethren all being brought into it under the leadership of Christ as the "minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man".<a name=2:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=3:1></a>E.<a name=3:2></a> Is that why you have been so concerned recently to emphasise the assembly amongst us, rather than permitting the thought of a remnant?<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Quite so.<a name=3:5></a> I think the word 'remnant' is properly connected with Israel, whereas, in dealing with the service of God in relation to christianity, the word 'remnant' is not suitable.<a name=3:6></a> The Scriptures would require that the whole idea of the assembly should be kept before us; it is one idea.<a name=3:7></a> The assembly is the greatest family in the whole universe, and it is the family God has selected to set out His system of worship.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=3:9></a>R.<a name=3:10></a> Is that confirmed in our chapter by the words "When ye come together in assembly"?<a name=3:11></a> Is it still possible to come together in assembly in spite of the broken state of things?<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:13></a> I think so, I think that what I was saying is of prime importance.<a name=3:14></a> It is not simply as a remnant that we come together, but the whole idea is to be there, and the Spirit of God will be here.<a name=3:15></a> The blessed Spirit remains not in part, but as a whole.<a name=3:16></a> He supports and maintains the service of God -- including the gospel, of course.<a name=3:17></a> The gospel is to promote material for the assembly; for the assembly is the prime thought in the divine mind at all times.<a name=3:18></a> But then there is the remnant of Israel and presently there will be the apostasy.<a name=3:19></a> God is holding His hand against what is current, but there will be an apostasy.<a name=3:20></a> That is one of the most solemn things, and although the apostasy is in principle current, it has not set in formally yet, because the Spirit of God is here and He holds His hand against the evil of an apostasy.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:22></a> When the Lord Jesus addresses Himself to Sardis, after the complete failure in Thyatira, He speaks of Himself as having "the seven Spirits of God".<a name=3:23></a> Is that what you have in mind in the Spirit being here in fulness still?<a name=3:24></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:1></a> Very good, "The seven Spirits" is the whole idea -- the whole idea of the Spirit.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:3></a> So that alongside of that, there is to be maintained the whole idea of the assembly?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:5></a> Quite so.<a name=4:6></a> God is behind all that; He has been calling attention to His service, and has brought forward ministry for the last hundred and twenty years that is suitable to lead to and support the idea of the service of God.<a name=4:7></a> The service of God is the great thought.<a name=4:8></a> The word 'service <i>of God</i>' -- that is the term or formula that we ought to keep before us all the time, because it is the leading thought at the present time.<a name=4:9></a> The assembly is the first thought in the mind of God at the present time, and it will continue so.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:11></a> Is this recognition of headship intended to set us free in regard of speaking to God and speaking to men?<a name=4:12></a> I was thinking of the way headship is introduced by praying and prophesying.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> That shows that the chapter we have just read has the service of God in mind.<a name=4:15></a> The idea is to correct everything that was wrong and to maintain things according to order, for God is said to be the God of order, and the God of order enters into this matter of headship.<a name=4:16></a> Headship is the prime thought as conveying the intelligence that belongs to the assembly, especially in view of the Lord Jesus Christ being the Head of it; He is the Head of the assembly.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:18></a> Will you please distinguish between the thought of Head of the assembly and Head of every man, as it is in chapter 11.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:20></a> I think Christ being the Head of every man would bring out the divine thought as to man.<a name=4:21></a> God is dealing with humanity and, of course, the fact that the Son has become Man is to give the full
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thought of it, and to show how important it is in the divine mind.<a name=5:1></a> The Son has become Man, and before entering on His full service He is seen as "about thirty years old".<a name=5:2></a> So it is full manhood in the gospel of Luke.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:4></a> And the highest thought of manhood would be to be occupied in the service of God?<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> That is what I think.<a name=5:7></a> There are things added, such as meetings of this kind, and the Lord's day afternoon reading to which the brethren usually rally, and which, I think, ought to be fully supported and promoted generally, especially among young people, who should not allow themselves to be diverted by ordinary affairs on the first day of the week.<a name=5:8></a> Then again another matter of importance is that God has graciously, or mercifully, granted us these weekends free to have meetings of this kind, and they are very prevalent.<a name=5:9></a> Generally, as far as I know, they are very prevalent throughout the christian world.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:11></a> Would you say that the idea of the man and woman in their place in the divine economy in the first part of the chapter is in view of that thought being filled out fully in Christ and the assembly?<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:13></a> That is just what I thought.<a name=5:14></a> One has often thought of the man and the woman being brought in in this peculiar way.<a name=5:15></a> No other part of Scripture has such a place in Paul's writings, in this sense, and it is because the Lord took him up at the time his service was needed.<a name=5:16></a> The Lord took him up, and in due time gave him a leading place, which he retained until the end.<a name=5:17></a> Whenever it was that he was martyred, he had that place, and he had a great deal of time, too, in imprisonment, which probably was in the Lord's mind to give him opportunity to develop the truth, even in writing, so that we have it now in our hands.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:1></a> Would you say a little more about the thought of divine order in all these things?<a name=6:2></a> Would that assure divine presence?<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:4></a> See how this chapter opens.<a name=6:5></a> The apostle says "Be my imitators, even as <i>I</i> also am of Christ".<a name=6:6></a> That is to say, the apostle followed the Lord Jesus in the service of God, and the idea of imitation is carried through, and all flowing out from Christ as the Head.<a name=6:7></a> "Be my imitators", he says, "even as <i>I</i>" -- emphatic -- "also am of Christ".<a name=6:8></a> So that the idea of imitation is stressed here, showing that the thing is to go through.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=6:10></a>S.<a name=6:11></a> Would you mind saying another word on Him being the Head of every <i>man</i>, in contrast to woman?<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:13></a> Well, let us read the passage.<a name=6:14></a> "I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me; and that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions", showing that Paul is again stressing himself.<a name=6:15></a> Notice these words -- "ye keep the directions".<a name=6:16></a> It is the idea of order, and then he goes on, "But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man".<a name=6:17></a> Well now, I believe that what has been said already is true, that God is going on with humanity.<a name=6:18></a> He is not simply going on with judaism; He is going on with man -- humanity; and the service of God requires that headship should be stressed for this.<a name=6:19></a> It is a question of man, and that Christ is the Head of every man -- not only in the aggregate, nor of every assembly, but of every man; it is the idea of men.<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:21></a>G.<a name=6:22></a> Does that mean that the intention is that every man should learn from Christ, and then that the woman should learn from the man?<a name=6:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:24></a> That is just what I think is the truth here.<a name=6:25></a> Again I would say that God is showing that the idea of humanity has the first place with Him in regard of creation.<a name=6:26></a> Man is the leader of creation,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and hence the word was "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness".<a name=7:1></a> And then it says "let them have dominion" that word is a plural word, and requires a woman.<a name=7:2></a> She is to be with the man, and the man is not to be without her.<a name=7:3></a> But the woman is not the first; man is the first and the woman was created for man, not man created for the woman.<a name=7:4></a> I believe all that is worked out in this chapter, the service of God being in mind.<a name=7:5></a> Man is in God's mind, and He is never going to give it up.<a name=7:6></a> He will cleanse the world in the course of time in the sense of judgment, but He will retain man.<a name=7:7></a> He will retain man because Christ has become Man and He is not going to give up His manhood; He is to continue in it.<a name=7:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.C.<a name=7:9></a>C.<a name=7:10></a> Does the principle of subjection work out in these relations in view of the Supper?<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:12></a> I think that is the truth.<a name=7:13></a> What I quoted from <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>is also the truth, and it ought to be noted.<a name=7:14></a> "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion" that is the man and woman; they are to be coupled together in dominion.<a name=7:15></a> It is the divine way, and God is holding to it and will hold to it.<a name=7:16></a> I suppose Israel will have its place in the millennium, and although Israel will have its place, man will be finally the great thought.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=7:18></a> And that much greater than angels.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:20></a> Surely, because angels are said to minister, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation".<a name=7:21></a> That is to say the angels are our ministers, although they are great servants too.<a name=7:22></a> Sometimes you can see that God has put them forward, but He has created them, for the very purpose of service, not to have an assembly of angels -- things are not put that way; it is a question of manhood, including womanhood.<a name=7:23></a>

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:1></a>S.<a name=8:2></a> "The tabernacle of God is with men".<a name=8:3></a> Would you say that the headship of Christ continues into the eternal day?<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:5></a> That is the way, I think, that the chapter should be read in Revelation.<a name=8:6></a> It says, "The tabernacle of God is with men", and "the tabernacle of God" will be the assembly.<a name=8:7></a> I think the book of Revelation is God asserting His rights to this, that, and the other thing, and among these rights is that man must have the first place.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=8:9></a>S.<a name=8:10></a> I was thinking in connection with what you have been saying, would it not bring out the importance of the man on the one hand and the woman on the other hand, each knowing their place in relation to the assembly in order that the service might be carried on rightly?<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:12></a> Quite so.<a name=8:13></a> Woman, in this epistle, is put under restriction as to speaking in the assembly, but she is nevertheless part of those who serve, she is part of the assembly, and her existence really will call attention to the fact that the assembly is a feminine thought.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=8:15></a>S.<a name=8:16></a> In the world, woman is seeking a great place and denying the principle that is laid down here.<a name=8:17></a> I was thinking of the necessity of accepting this principle if the sisters are to have the great place which belongs to them in assembly exercises and testimony.<a name=8:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:19></a> Quite so.<a name=8:20></a> The place that women have, of course, has greatly caused degeneration, because she assumes to have the same place as man in regard of rule.<a name=8:21></a> Even in regard of voting, in certain countries those who hold the vote include women and they put certain men into power.<a name=8:22></a> So that all that is in mind, and yet God says that "He has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed".<a name=8:23></a> So that man is kept there and the assurance comes

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		from God as to Christ's place.<a name=9:1></a> The word 'judge' there would be judgment in the sense of humanity being judged, and the government of God is in the hands of a Man.<a name=9:2></a> He will judge the habitable earth, in righteousness; the expression "habitable earth" is just a general thought of humanity.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=9:4></a> In verse 3, it goes back to God, "Christ's head God".<a name=9:5></a> So that there is no confusion, but order.<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:7></a> That is true.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=9:9></a>E.<a name=9:10></a> Is there something peculiarly attractive in this allusion to the angels in verse 10 in relation to the woman?<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:12></a> It would show the place that angels have, although, as I said, they are given to be servants to those who are heirs of salvation.<a name=9:13></a> We cannot say how old the idea of angels is, but we do know how old man is, and God has kept back the idea of manhood to the final thought.<a name=9:14></a> It is in order clearly that His beloved Son should become a Man and He is now Man, and is the Head of every man.<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=9:16></a>G.<a name=9:17></a> Does this reference to angels involve that angels take account of the maintenance of divine order in the assembly in contrast to the confusion in the world?<a name=9:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:19></a> Just so, and, of course, we know angels have fallen, too; some of them have lost their first estate and the judgment of God overtakes them.<a name=9:20></a> At the same time, God has not given up His primary thought in man.<a name=9:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:25></a> Quite so.<a name=9:26></a> Every sister should take account of this.<a name=9:27></a> It will not, in any way, decrease her place

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=26:7></a> Well, it seems to be the greatness of the assembly and how it is linked up with Christ as His body, but we should not overlook that God is in the whole matter.<a name=26:8></a> We ought to remember that the Lord Himself sent letters to the assemblies, and so His idea is to bring out what the assembly is to Him.<a name=26:9></a> That is really what it is, and now we should follow the thing up; so that we have what the <i>Spirit</i> says in addition to what the Lord says.<a name=26:10></a> "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=26:11></a> That is, there is the double thought in it, what the Lord says by Himself, and then what the Spirit says, and the word is added to that, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says".<a name=26:12></a> It is as if there is the idea that the Spirit's speaking is in a certain sense more important for us to follow up than even what Christ says.<a name=26:13></a> The importance of the Spirit at the present time cannot be over-stated because it is a question of the ending of the dispensation, and the Spirit coming into what belongs to Him, as a divine Person.<a name=26:14></a> He has always shown Himself so lowly in everything that the Lord's word in Revelation is "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says".<a name=26:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=58:1></a> It is remarkable that the early verses of chapter 10 give a clear indication of the character of the man -- the centurion -- Cornelius.<a name=58:2></a> It says: "Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic, pious, and fearing God with all his house" -- notice that -- "with all his house".<a name=58:3></a> So that we have to consider in the light of this as to conditions in our houses, old and young in the houses: "With all his house, both giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually".<a name=58:4></a> So that the idea of piety certainly is one of the first thoughts in connection with christianity.<a name=58:5></a> And, of course, the household includes everybody, in fact we might say servants, but especially children and young people; the household includes all.<a name=58:6></a> So it says further as to Cornelius that an angel appeared to him, and that is another thing to notice.<a name=58:7></a> It says: he "saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day".<a name=58:8></a> Notice the accuracy with which things are stated, "About the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.<a name=58:9></a> But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of fear, said, What is it, Lord?<a name=58:10></a> And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God".<a name=58:11></a> That is, Cornelius has established a memorial in heaven, before he is brought into christianity, which is a very remarkable thing.<a name=58:12></a> So that evidently the thought of alms, or giving, is one of the leading things too, as to christian practice; as to christian customs and walk.<a name=58:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=58:17></a> Quite so, it has been in one's mind, that there is considerable prayer, thank God, and answers to prayer too, but perhaps not much fasting.<a name=58:18></a> There is perhaps very little fasting, and it is something for us to look into as it is now brought before us.<a name=58:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=59:3></a> The Lord Himself says.<a name=59:4></a> "This kind" -- in the casting out of the demon, in fact it was a lunatic -- "does not go out but by prayer and fasting", showing that lunacy or mental conditions are the most difficult in relation to illness.<a name=59:5></a> We should therefore have recourse to fasting if there are such conditions in our houses.<a name=59:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=59:10></a> Surely, I certainly do.<a name=59:11></a> It is not what may be practised at the time of Lent by certain religious people, but literal fasting in the sense of denying oneself of what one is entitled to, or of what one has a right to.<a name=59:12></a> It is for the sake of the truth and for the sake of power that comes in through fasting, for there is power attached to it.<a name=59:13></a> "This kind", the Lord says; it is a question of the kind of the disease, and the kind of power that is needed to cast out the demon.<a name=59:14></a> Whatever it may be that besets us, in the sense of sin or other things, the power of fasting is in mind.<a name=59:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=60:17></a> And another word as to that is "the Lord is near".<a name=60:18></a> So we are encouraged to count on Him being near, and to draw near corresponding to that.<a name=60:19></a> If God is drawing near to us, let us be sure to draw near to Him and not to show any sign of diversion in ourselves from what is good.<a name=60:20></a> I would say to anyone that feels overcome by any particular tendency to sin, that it is a wise thing to have recourse to fasting if he wants to overcome.<a name=60:21></a> It is assumed that normal christians, certainly if they are real christians, ought to have the desire to overcome evil, and then to encourage purity in themselves and in their houses too, of course.<a name=60:22></a> This thought of fasting is of prime importance, because God helps us through it.<a name=60:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=61:8></a> So that prayer and fasting are, you might say, taken together, the great remedy.<a name=61:9></a> The great remedy for overcoming sin, and, of course, we need to overcome sin, because it will not go of itself.<a name=61:10></a> We have to be energetic in dealing with anything that we know to be sinful, or tending to sinfulness.<a name=61:11></a> To have recourse at once to the remedy, and that remedy is prayer and fasting.<a name=61:12></a> I remember that came up in Australia and I was very struck with the thought.<a name=61:13></a> They had large prayer meetings at that time in Australia, and the thing came to me very forcefully as to fasting.<a name=61:14></a> We had large prayer meetings and good attendance but what was the amount of fasting?<a name=61:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=61:19></a> What specially comes in now in the present phase of our exercise, is denying oneself of things that are legitimate.<a name=61:20></a> Many go in for what is legitimate and, in itself, perhaps is not evil, but we go in for the habit too much; we take shelter in the fact that in itself it is not evil, but at the same time the tendency would be sinful unless we judged ourselves: That is to say that the word 'judgment' would be <i>intelligent</i> understanding of what is in mind, because Scripture gives us intelligence.<a name=61:21></a> Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do <i>ye</i> judge what I say".<a name=61:22></a> That is the remedy I would say, to apply to all this that is coming under our notice.<a name=61:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=77:8></a> Quite so.<a name=77:9></a> There are certain things that are omitted in some of the gospels; for instance, Matthew does not record the ascension, so that we have to watch that and see what is recorded and what is not recorded.<a name=77:10></a> What is recorded three times is certainly to be noted specially.<a name=77:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=80:5></a> Quite so.<a name=80:6></a> Now I think we should go on to the main subject from the chapter where we began to read.<a name=80:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=80:8></a> In verse 35 of chapter 10 is Peter looking out for any feature of the work of God, wherever it appeared?<a name=80:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=80:10></a> I am sure he is.<a name=80:11></a> At the same time the Spirit of God knows; He is God, and He knows what is to happen, as well as what has happened.<a name=80:12></a> We can thus count on Him and be guided by what He says or does not say, and then if we need to compare and get help from the comparison, we might well look into each detail of the matter, and make a comparison.<a name=80:13></a> So that we have in this verse, "But in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him", showing that the fear of God and the working of righteousness is to be observed, and then again: "The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ (<i>he</i> is Lord of all things, ) <i>ye</i> know".<a name=80:14></a> Notice the word 'word' there.<a name=80:15></a> Sometimes you may have 'words', which would mean detail of language, but sometimes you have 'word', which is a general idea, as we say 'preach the word' -- the word is one whole idea.<a name=80:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=80:17></a> You drew attention this afternoon to the word 'witnesses' in verses 39 and 41.<a name=80:18></a> Had you something further to say as to that?<a name=80:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=81:8></a> I would think that is what Peter means, although the apostle Paul was already selected, you know.<a name=81:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=81:10></a> Is it to be noted that those who accompanied Peter were designated the faithful of the circumcision?<a name=81:11></a> Do we see by that that they were morally fitted to accompany him on this great mission?<a name=81:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=81:13></a> Just so; there were six mentioned afterwards.<a name=81:14></a> I would think what you say is right.<a name=81:15></a> So that the Spirit of God is careful to give credit where credit is due, and to bring to light the persons in whom God is working.<a name=81:16></a> When we say God -- you might say it is God in the full sense.<a name=81:17></a> In chapter 8 of 1 Corinthians it is said "to us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things .<a name=81:18></a>.<a name=81:19></a>.<a name=81:20></a> and one Lord, Jesus Christ".<a name=81:21></a> The Holy Spirit is not mentioned in that category.<a name=81:22></a> We can add that very evidently, but we need not because the Spirit of God does not add it Himself.<a name=81:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=82:12></a> Quite so.<a name=82:13></a> If we give thanks for our food at the table we do not lengthen our prayers, but we would not deny anything; there are occasions for shortening prayers and for lengthening them.<a name=82:14></a> We could easily pick out from Scripture lengthened prayers or lengthened terms of reverence and thanksgiving to God.<a name=82:15></a> We could easily select many passages from the Psalms and the Old Testament generally as well as in the New.<a name=82:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=83:9></a> You would make a point of intimacy; is that what you mean?<a name=83:10></a> that Peter had intimacy with the Lord?<a name=83:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=83:12></a> Yes, eating and drinking with Him after He rose from the dead suggests the intimacy of communion with the Lord Jesus in that condition, and I was thinking how it would in that sense reflect on our intimacy with the Holy Spirit now, so as to rise above what is legal.<a name=83:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=83:14></a> Quite so, I think what you say is perfectly right.<a name=83:15></a> The question of intimacy with the Holy Spirit is a matter to be understood and to be practised too, because the Lord Himself has helped us as to that truth.<a name=83:16></a>

		Ques.<a name=83:17></a> Does the thought of the Holy Spirit falling upon those that were hearing the word bring in the affections of the Spirit, and how attractive those that were hearing the word would be to Him?<a name=83:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=83:19></a> Quite so.<a name=83:20></a> We have the expression "the love of the Spirit" in Romans, so that the idea of the affections of the Spirit is quite in order.<a name=83:21></a>

		A.J.<a name=84:11></a>G.<a name=84:12></a> I was only thinking that Peter would be sympathetic with those who had difficulties because he had had difficulties himself, and God had graciously removed them by the vision and the voice from heaven, and so on.<a name=84:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=84:14></a> It is a very good sign if a brother who has had difficulties and who has been saying things that are not right, would say so and confess he has been wrong.<a name=84:15></a> He would be helped.<a name=84:16></a> It often happens, however, that people ignore the errors they have been making.<a name=84:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=84:21></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=84:22></a> So that the matter was settled, that is what I would say.<a name=84:23></a> It is a great thing to settle a matter, and not to spread it out too much.<a name=84:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=159:1></a> I have the word 'elevation' in mind, considering the first chapter of Ephesians this morning, because of the spiritual elevation that is found there, and then this afternoon the part of Corinthians which treats of the service of God too, but what relates to what is physical in the sense of elevation, because there is physical elevation too, which we hope will come about presently.<a name=159:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It need not be remarked that it is not intended to pursue this chapter in Ephesians in detail.<a name=159:3></a> It is one of the fullest and most blessed chapters in the Bible; the thought is just to touch on it from the standpoint of spiritual elevation.<a name=159:4></a> Later we hope to look at Corinthians in which the apostle speaks of being caught up to the third heaven, which would be physical elevation.<a name=159:5></a> Now it is a question of what is moral and spiritual, so that we might be lifted out of the mere naturalness of the scene around us into what is of God, and spiritual, in the sense of elevation.<a name=159:6></a> We all know how the heavens are in mind, and so it says here: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies".<a name=159:7></a> It is a word peculiar, I believe, to Ephesians -- "heavenlies" -- and it refers to heavenly-mindedness and heavenliness in the sense of spiritual elevation.<a name=159:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=183:1></a> Someone here was asking a question as we left off this morning.<a name=183:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.A.<a name=183:3></a>W.<a name=183:4></a> We were speaking of the high level of things this morning, and also the place that the Spirit has in relation to the service of God.<a name=183:5></a> I wondered if you could help us as to the Spirit leading us on into these great high levels.<a name=183:6></a> We have in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:18">Ephesians  2:18</a> "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".<a name=183:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=183:8></a> It is clear enough that the access is through the exercise of the Spirit's power.<a name=183:9></a> "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".<a name=183:10></a> That is through Christ, so that it is a question of mediatorial service, which is a very important matter, and involves that One of the divine Persons takes a lower place to be mediator -- to mediate a position or a circumstance.<a name=183:11></a> There are clearly religious systems around us that have certain principles to go by that are simply human -- at least in a great measure, but those who are walking in the truth recognise that the means of worship is by the Spirit -- through the mediatorial service of Christ.<a name=183:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.A.<a name=183:13></a>W.<a name=183:14></a> I think some of us would like help on the position the Spirit has as Mediator.<a name=183:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=183:16></a> There are two ideas.<a name=183:17></a> First it is "through him" -- that is Christ; He is the main thought in the mediatorship, but then the Spirit also is a Mediator.<a name=183:18></a> Of course it is a question of the power of the Spirit, but the Lord Jesus is the actual Mediator in everything.<a name=183:19></a> The main idea of mediatorship in divine things is in Christ Himself but then the Spirit has a part in the mediatorship also.<a name=183:20></a> There are three Persons in the Deity, and of course the Three act in whatever it may be and the Spirit in this case acts in our souls.<a name=183:21></a> It is not external; it is in our souls.<a name=183:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=184:4></a> Just so.<a name=184:5></a> Now if you take the Church of England, of course, they have got methods or ways that are merely human, and so have the Presbyterians, and so also all of them, whereas those who are walking in the truth recognise the Spirit, and they recognise that Christ is the main thought of Mediator of everything, and that the Spirit also has a mediatorial service, but that is inside of us.<a name=184:6></a>

		Now what is before us is <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>where we get, "Well, it is not of profit to me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.<a name=184:7></a> I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows; ) such a one caught up to the third heaven.<a name=184:8></a> And I know such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows)"; it is remarkable this repetition in the parenthesis, and then he says: "that he was caught up into paradise".<a name=184:9></a> "He was caught up into paradise".<a name=184:10></a> That is the idea that is before us, for it is a question of elevation, and what this may mean in Paul's case.<a name=184:11></a> It is really physical catching up.<a name=184:12></a> He did not know whether he was in the body or out of the body, which is a remarkable thing.<a name=184:13></a> Apparently he was -- like Peter -- in a state of ecstasy, and therefore it is a question of our being able to discern what is meant in this elevation; how it happened to him.<a name=184:14></a> He intimates that it is extraordinary because apparently it only happened to him once, and that was fourteen years before, which is a very remarkable thing.<a name=184:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=185:6></a> Yes, but then the question is, how could he say that he knew about it.<a name=185:7></a> "I know", he says, "a man".<a name=185:8></a> It is a sort of abstract statement, and then he repeats it in verse 3: "And I know such a man, (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows; ) that he was caught up into paradise".<a name=185:9></a> He changes the word from "third heaven" to "paradise", so that I confess that I myself feel that I do not know just what to say about it, because it is extraordinary.<a name=185:10></a> It is an extraordinary circumstance, and yet it is clear that it is an opportunity for the brethren -- a good many of us here now -- just to enquire what it means, and whether there is any such experience in the service of God that we know of.<a name=185:11></a> I confess I do not know of it, nor do I think that Paul knew it fully; he says, "I know not, God knows", and we can take refuge in that -- that God knows everything.<a name=185:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=186:13></a> It does, that is what he is speaking about.<a name=186:14></a> We might as well just look at the wording.<a name=186:15></a> He says: "Well, it is not of profit to me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord".<a name=186:16></a> That is to say it was the Lord's doing -- the Lord was revealing Himself in certain connections and circumstances, and then he says, "I know a man" -- meaning that he had extraordinary relations with God and with the Lord, and with the Spirit.<a name=186:17></a> Perhaps, as suggested, there was no man in the whole realm of creation like Paul -- so much distinctiveness -- he was honoured so much in the truth.<a name=186:18></a> So that it is just as well to think that there was such a man, but at the same time there is something for us to see, in the sense of spirituality, that we have not reached, and the question is whether we can reach it, because it is a time of learning, and if God is graciously giving us opportunity to learn we must take advantage of it, and seek that we can learn, because the Spirit of God is within us.<a name=186:19></a> He is actually here as sent from heaven; that has been repeated over and over again, and I do not know of anything more important in the matter that we are dealing

		J.T.<a name=193:11></a> I speak of the Lord's day morning meeting because it is alluded to in the first epistle, chapter 11.<a name=193:12></a> He says in verse 17, "In prescribing to you on this which I now enter on, I do not praise, namely, that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse.<a name=193:13></a> For first, when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you".<a name=193:14></a> That is to say, he deals there with the idea of the divine service, and that the Lord's supper is the beginning of it; but we are now dealing with the second epistle, and it is a question whether we know anything of what we are speaking of.<a name=193:15></a> "I know a man in Christ", he says, "fourteen years ago, (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows; ) such a one caught up to the third heaven".<a name=193:16></a> That is a remarkable thing, and then he goes on to say, "And I know such a man, (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows; ) that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter".<a name=193:17></a> Well, now we are dealing with what is unspeakable, but at the same time there is something that we can come into; it is surely written for that purpose.<a name=193:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=221:1></a> It may be wise that we should be reminded of the character of the epistle to Hebrews.<a name=221:2></a> It is an epistle, as the title indicates, addressed to Jewish believers at the beginning of our dispensation.<a name=221:3></a> Those believers, however, were declining and weakening in the faith, and sin is treated very seriously -- more seriously than in any of the other epistles, so that in Hebrews it really is not to be forgiven.<a name=221:4></a> It is thought that in view of all this the epistle should be considered, and we should have two readings today, one reading tomorrow and two readings on Monday, God willing.<a name=221:5></a> There is thus fairly good scope to consider the epistle, and it may be remarked that the quotations from the Old Testament (and there are relatively many) are largely from the book of Psalms.<a name=221:6></a> They are almost entirely so, either directly or indirectly, and this would remind us too of the need of experience.<a name=221:7></a> The book of Psalms may be taken to be that -- experience with God, and we would, no doubt, all admit that we need that very much to cope with such a world as is about us.<a name=221:8></a> Another thing, of course, that enters into the Psalms is that it contains five books, and they are written in the main or collected by David, and he himself is said to be "the sweet psalmist of Israel".<a name=221:9></a> So that, in view of these facts, we have now a most precious opportunity to consider what is available to us, not as Hebrews or as unregenerate people but as believers.<a name=221:10></a> The word 'faith' is greatly enlarged in the epistle to the Hebrews, and it is said there that "without faith it is impossible to please him".<a name=221:11></a> And another thing that comes into Hebrews is the thought of salvation, so that it says, "<i>We</i> are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving the soul".<a name=221:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=222:6></a> I think there was the need of the Hebrew christians, and there is the need now of so-called professing christians, to understand fully and maintain in the soul, and in the assembly too, the deity of Christ.<a name=222:7></a> The Person of Christ is the main thought, because there is so much to the contrary, worldliness having deadened the feelings and affections of most of the so-called brethren abroad; so-called christians, because the word 'christian' is not applicable except in professing saints.<a name=222:8></a> No doubt in most of the denominations, including the Church of England, there are many christians, many whom we regard as christians, and rightly so, but there are many too who are not christians.<a name=222:9></a> There are those in the Church of England and other churches, so-called, such as Unitarians or Christian Scientists that are not christians.<a name=222:10></a> These terrible things are current, and hence there is the need of considering such a book as the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=222:11></a> So the book opens -- "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son".<a name=222:12></a> Now the word 'end' there, as you will see in the notes at the bottom of the page, refers to the days when the Messiah was to be introduced.<a name=222:13></a> The end is to lead up to the thought of the Messiah, that is to say, Christ, and that helps us as to the dispensation in which we are, that we are in the dispensation of faith, not that of the law.<a name=222:14></a> The Lord Jesus was born under the law, and He witnessed to the truth in it -- as under it, but at the same time knowing that the

		J.T.<a name=226:7></a> Yes, but I think 'inscrutable' is a better word than 'infinite'.<a name=226:8></a> It is inscrutable, that is to say, we are left to realise that we are outside the range of all these great things, and yet in a <i>certain</i> sense we are dependent on them and have part in them.<a name=226:9></a> In that certain sense, things should come before us so as to be intelligible to us, because it is a question of spiritual discernment as to these matters.<a name=226:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=226:14></a> Quite a good bearing.<a name=226:15></a> It is based on these facts that are before us now: Chapter 11 is towards the end of the book, but we are at the first chapter now, so that we have to get understanding about the facts of the first chapter in order to come to the eleventh chapter.<a name=226:16></a> Chapter 11 is to give an account of faith and to show how faith worked out in the Old Testament times and how it works out now.<a name=226:17></a> So that it says, at the end of the chapter, "They should not be made perfect without us".<a name=226:18></a> That is to say, the Old Testament saints were not perfect, for redemption had not been accomplished.<a name=226:19></a> Redemption is required for perfection, in the sense in which the word is used.<a name=226:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=239:1></a> It will be noticed that this epistle, beginning with the first chapter, is continuous almost entirely throughout, so that this second chapter begins, "For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things we have heard, lest in any way we should slip away".<a name=239:2></a> That is, the instruction is sequential, and what is stressed now is the danger of the word being neglected.<a name=239:3></a> So it says, "For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution, how shall we escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken of by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard; God bearing, besides, witness with them to it, both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will?<a name=239:4></a>" This paragraph deals with the beginning of christianity, clearly, and how certain were turning aside.<a name=239:5></a> That is what is in mind almost entirely throughout the epistle, and hence the stress laid upon the things that have been heard.<a name=239:6></a> They were first spoken by the Lord and confirmed to the saints by those who heard Him.<a name=239:7></a> So the idea of hearing is stressed in view of the danger of giving up what we have heard, so that in the letters in Revelation we have stressed seven times by the Lord Himself, "He that has an ear, let him hear".<a name=239:8></a> But we must not attach over-importance merely to what we hear, even although we may attend meetings like this, because it is not what we hear but what we appropriate and assimilate, and thus make good in our souls.<a name=239:9></a> What is to be observed, too, is that the types of Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus call attention to certain food that was

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=240:12></a> The first chapter is in mind, and the second is just sequential to what is taught in the first.<a name=240:13></a> That is to say, the deity or Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ, and all that enters into that are in mind.<a name=240:14></a> Certain things were stressed in the first chapter, and now the thought is to proceed in enforcing them in a practical sense, and I think we shall see as we proceed in chapter 2 that it affords much material, so to speak, for the service of God, because it abounds with references to the service of God.<a name=240:15></a> We have Christ Himself singing to the Father; praising the Father in the midst of the assembly, and that is where we are to carry on the service, and to praise God and to worship God.<a name=240:16></a> We have to remember that the assembly is the sphere of it, and it is therefore a question of purity, as already remarked.<a name=240:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=240:21></a> I was thinking of the assembly as a sphere of salvation.<a name=240:22></a> It has often been stressed, and even in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>the thought is indicated typically that the assembly is a sphere of salvation, "By faith, Noah .<a name=240:23></a>.<a name=240:24></a>.<a name=240:25></a> prepared an ark for the saving of his house".<a name=240:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=241:6></a> These are elements that accompanied the testimony of those who had heard the Lord.<a name=241:7></a> What was indicated in chapter 1 gives force to what follows, "For this reason we should give heed more abundantly", it says, "more abundantly".<a name=241:8></a> It is not just to give heed, simply, but "more abundantly to the things which we have heard".<a name=241:9></a> That is to say to the gospel that is preached, for Paul himself speaks of his gospel.<a name=241:10></a> The gospel that is preached is therefore allied to it, as it says, "For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution, how shall <i>we</i> escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation" -- notice the superlative feature of the words, "Which, having had its commencement in being spoken of by the Lord", that is, the Lord Jesus -- "has been confirmed to us by those who have heard".<a name=241:11></a> That is to say such as Peter and the eleven, because Paul was evidently the author of the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=241:12></a> So that Peter and the eleven would be the ones that confirmed what the Lord had taught.<a name=241:13></a> Then it goes on: "For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come"; that is to say now we have the idea of the world to come brought in in connection with all this.<a name=241:14></a> It refers to the dispensation that is after this dispensation; this is the present dispensation, but the world to come refers to the coming dispensation.<a name=241:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=264:1></a> There are two main thoughts in these chapters.<a name=264:2></a> The first is the word of God, and the second the priesthood of Christ.<a name=264:3></a> Our remarks therefore should be centred on these points as of immense importance; that is to say, the word of God, by which we are guided and instructed, and the priesthood of Christ by which we are supported.<a name=264:4></a> The address at the beginning is encouraging; it says, "Wherefore, holy brethren".<a name=264:5></a> Again, we have the word 'wherefore', showing that it is sequential as connecting with what has preceded it, the heavenly calling, as in contrast to what will mark the millennium.<a name=264:6></a> Although the millennium will link up with heaven, yet in principle it is the earthly position.<a name=264:7></a> So it says here, "partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus, who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house".<a name=264:8></a> The house undoubtedly refers to the assembly, as it says later in the chapter, "whose house are <i>we</i>"; that would be the assembly, and Christ is over it.<a name=264:9></a> The thought here again is clearly as in chapter 1, to bring out the deity of Christ, the personal greatness of Christ, and the bearing of it as in the word of God which is for our instruction, and then the priesthood of Christ which is for our support.<a name=264:10></a> The object indeed is, as we have already remarked, the service of God, and that we should be instructed as to that.<a name=264:11></a> The high priesthood of Christ is in view of that, so that we might be equal to the service of God.<a name=264:12></a> The first day of the week, of course, enters into it because it involves the Lord's supper, which is the beginning of the service of God.<a name=264:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=268:5></a> I do not think the Lord intended to have used the idea of a remnant, as conveying the thought of the assembly, because the presence of the Holy Spirit involves the idea of the body and that is a whole thought.<a name=268:6></a> It is not a partial thought; it is a whole thought.<a name=268:7></a> There is no such thought as the body really in the Old Testament.<a name=268:8></a> Actually the word 'remnant' applies there, but now the presence of the Spirit of God here implies the whole thought.<a name=268:9></a> This gives great encouragement in our ministry, and it is to keep in our minds that there is a whole thought behind it, and the whole thought is Christ Himself in His body.<a name=268:10></a> And so the importance of holding the truth of the body is referred to in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=268:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=281:1></a> Yesterday we touched on two important points in chapter 4, namely, the word of God and the priesthood of Christ, and it is well to be recalled to them.<a name=281:2></a> The priesthood of Christ is continued in the succeeding chapters, especially under the heading of Melchisedec, which the Lord will undoubtedly help us to speak on intelligently.<a name=281:3></a> The word of God is peculiarly presented according to what is said in verses 11 - 13 of chapter 4, "Let us therefore" it says, "use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word.<a name=281:4></a> For the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=281:5></a> And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do".<a name=281:6></a> That is to say, the word here runs into the idea of God Himself; it is no less than God Himself -- "his eyes, with whom we have to do".<a name=281:7></a> We do well, therefore, to think of it in this way and to lay ourselves out for the searching character of the word of God, for it is no less than God Himself with whom we have to do.<a name=281:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=281:11></a> It is undoubtedly.<a name=281:12></a> It has to do with the Holy Spirit, because it is the searching character of it here, near us, as it were -- beside us.<a name=281:13></a> It is the Spirit sent down from heaven really, but it is God Himself as viewed here: "all things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do".<a name=281:14></a> It is the nearness of a divine Person that is implied, and the searching character of the word too.<a name=281:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=282:14></a> It seems so, but, of course, we must not ignore too much the idea of God as God.<a name=282:15></a> Whether we are speaking of the Holy Spirit or speaking of God as such is a question to be determined, "To us there is one God, the Father"; that is generally the idea of God, when there is no specific word stated as to the Person who is speaking.<a name=282:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=282:20></a> That is right; it is a question of discernment as to each instance in which the thought of God is introduced or spoken of.<a name=282:21></a> So that where it is God without any qualification, the context, I think, would indicate whether it is to be regarded just as God -- God as such.<a name=282:22></a> The passage I have just cited is in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8">1 Corinthians  8</a>"to us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him".<a name=282:23></a> Of course, that is clear -- the Father is mentioned -- "and one Lord, Jesus Christ" but there is nothing said of the Spirit.<a name=282:24></a> The Spirit is not mentioned in that particular passage.<a name=282:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=283:13></a> Of course, it is just God, simply, and that we are not going to escape His discerning eye.<a name=283:14></a> The word is: "and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow", there we have come to figures -- they are spiritual thoughts -- "and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart".<a name=283:15></a> It is the power of God; we must not forget that God is God, and that is the great general thought when the word is used.<a name=283:16></a> There is always something to indicate it if the Spirit of God is in mind.<a name=283:17></a> I would think what we have here in this remarkable passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>is generally the idea of God Himself.<a name=283:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=283:22></a> Just so.<a name=283:23></a> It is an inward thought; it is not an external thought.<a name=283:24></a> God sometimes deals with external thoughts -- even our bodies, but here it is an inward idea.<a name=283:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:1></a> Just so.<a name=284:2></a> The word 'hearkening' is stressed greatly in chapters 3 and 4.<a name=284:3></a> The great thing among the early Jews that we are dealing with in this chapter of the Hebrews is that there was a great danger of them falling away or turning away from the truth.<a name=284:4></a> You can see it in chapter 6, in the most striking way, how terrible the thing was, and there is really no forgiveness.<a name=284:5></a> Sin in Hebrews is generally unforgivable, <i>generally</i> unforgivable.<a name=284:6></a> It is apostasy, the Jew turning away from christianity to the old system.<a name=284:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.J.<a name=284:8></a>T.<a name=284:9></a> The Lord Jesus, in the first temptation, said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word .<a name=284:10></a>.<a name=284:11></a>.<a name=284:12></a> of God", as though the <i>living</i> is the point there.<a name=284:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:14></a> Just so.<a name=284:15></a> It is as if the word of God is food for the soul -- "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth".<a name=284:16></a> It is a most particularised thing -- what comes from the mouth of God -- pointing to the human body as a figure, and God is allowing Himself to be pictured in the thought of the human mouth.<a name=284:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=284:18></a> Do we get an instance of the action of the word of God in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>, where Peter laid bare the inward motives of Ananias and Sapphira?<a name=284:19></a> He says, "Why has Satan filled thy heart .<a name=284:20></a>.<a name=284:21></a>.<a name=284:22></a> ?<a name=284:23></a>", and then, "Why is it that thou hast purposed this thing in thine heart?<a name=284:24></a>" The inward motives were being revealed in the presence of God in the person of Peter.<a name=284:25></a>
	</div>

		J.S.<a name=284:28></a>E.<a name=284:29></a> Would the virgin in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>give us an illustration of this penetration to the division of soul and spirit, when she says: "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour"?<a name=284:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:31></a> Quite so.<a name=284:32></a> It is a sort of prophetic word.<a name=284:33></a> It is really, you might say, a word directly from God.<a name=284:34></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=285:3></a>E.<a name=285:4></a> I was thinking of the way that Gabriel came to her with the word of God -- the full expression of the mind of God as to the incoming of Christ, and it had this feature of penetration with her, so that in her contribution she could speak of her soul as distinct from her spirit, and yet both of them were really feeling the value of the communication.<a name=285:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=285:6></a> So that it was really an oracular speech, you might say.<a name=285:7></a> Although the angel is said to have spoken certain things to her, yet this was a word oracularly rendered by Mary.<a name=285:8></a> There are many such instances of these oracular words in Scripture, especially in the Old Testament, and so the "oracles of God" refer to them.<a name=285:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=285:10></a>E.<a name=285:11></a> I was thinking of its bearing upon us in this way, that our greatest snare all the time is gravitation towards what is material.<a name=285:12></a> But does not the word of God tend to our liberation from that, so that we can go on with what is spiritual and heavenly?<a name=285:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=285:14></a> Just so, and as I was saying, there is that which has the character of an oracular statement or address.<a name=285:15></a> I think Mary's word was just that, and, of course, it is right that we should have it, so that even in ministry we may have such statements by the Spirit Himself operating in the servant's heart.<a name=285:16></a> There may be such things as that, because we have come back to the truth of the Holy Spirit.<a name=285:17></a> He is really amongst us, and the ministry ought to take the character that the mind of God is conveyed in it.<a name=285:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=285:19></a>P.<a name=285:20></a> Would the penetrating character of the word of God lead to that self-knowledge and self-searching which would render us fit for our part in the divine system?<a name=285:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=286:15></a> We do; we should see that now as we come on to chapter 5, where the thing is enlarged on.<a name=286:16></a> It says, "every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity".<a name=286:17></a> That is an ordinary priest, not Christ, but it is leading up to Christ.<a name=286:18></a> So it goes on (verse 3), "and, on account of this infirmity, he ought", -- the ordinary priest -- "even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.<a name=286:19></a> And no one takes the honour to himself but as called by God, even as Aaron also.<a name=286:20></a> Thus the Christ also has not glorified

		J.T.<a name=329:1></a> This epistle has been before some of us considerably during recent weeks, and it is thought that we might finish it at this time, especially as there is a certain conclusion reached in the truth.<a name=329:2></a> Severe judgment, too, is announced, or threatened -- severer perhaps than we might have expected or anticipated, but it seems as if God evidently intended to be severe in what He says in this epistle about what was happening, especially as to the Jewish element in christianity turning aside.<a name=329:3></a> We have the idea of the severity of God in the epistle to the Romans, and this particularly applies to the epistle to the Hebrews, because the Hebrew christians were turning aside, as we have said.<a name=329:4></a> It corresponds with what is so prevalent now in nominal christianity, the turning aside and giving up of the truth on every hand.<a name=329:5></a> At the same time, there is great encouragement to those who are seeking to walk in it.<a name=329:6></a> It is therefore thought that we might be encouraged to look into the remaining part of the book and to think on what is evidently open to us.<a name=329:7></a> There are certain things we shall see in the later chapters, but at this time it is in mind to think about entering into the holiest, which is the greatest privilege open to us.<a name=329:8></a> It is not intended to enlarge on the judgment, but to see just what is said in this chapter in the sense of entering the holiest.<a name=329:9></a> That is a Jewish phrase, we may say, because the allusion is to what happened in the Old Testament times when the priest entered.<a name=329:10></a> But what happened then, as seen here, was just a shadow of good things to come, and we are in the midst of the good things.<a name=329:11></a> The Lord is encouraging us too, I believe, as many of us here would testify, in going in for the truth as to the service of God.<a name=329:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=351:9></a> Just so, I suppose surrounding us would be the idea that you can take account of them, and speak of them.<a name=351:10></a> Instead of speaking of certain men in the world, distinguished by the world's history, we take pleasure in men that are distinguished in heaven -- known in heaven, and we shall see them there too.<a name=351:11></a> We shall see Enoch and all the others.<a name=351:12></a> It is a glorious thought to have in our hearts -- what we are coming into in the sense of sight-seeing -- persons who are now to be imitated.<a name=351:13></a> So that it says in the chapter that has just been referred to, "Let <i>us</i> also therefore, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, laying aside every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us" -- that is especially intended for the young -- "run with endurance the race that lies before us, looking stedfastly on Jesus" -- again we have it, as we have had it already -- "on Jesus the leader and completer of faith".<a name=351:14></a> Sometimes it has been suggested that the Lord did not have faith, but this is a clear statement that He had, and that He exercised faith.<a name=351:15></a>

		Well now, we go on to Elisha.<a name=397:19></a> He represents grace.<a name=397:20></a> It is the great grace side in the New Testament and opens up the dispensation of grace by this passage amplifying it.<a name=397:21></a> He is a man of God.<a name=397:22></a> The title is applied to him more than to any other in all Scripture.<a name=397:23></a> It is as if God would say, I want to attach My name to the great grace system.<a name=397:24></a> And so Elisha is met by a woman in debt.<a name=397:25></a> The creditor was at the door.<a name=397:26></a> And Elisha helps her.<a name=397:27></a> He solves her difficulties.<a name=397:28></a> It is a matter of grace.<a name=397:29></a> She is not only to pay her debts; she is to live on the rest.<a name=397:30></a> And he is owned as a man of God.<a name=397:31></a> And then we have the woman of Shunem who says, "This is a holy man of God".<a name=397:32></a> She is a greater woman than the woman of Zarephath.<a name=397:33></a> She says, "This is a holy man of God", even though he has done nothing for her as yet.<a name=397:34></a> But he was passing by her door.<a name=397:35></a> She had an eye for what

		I feel encouraged, beloved brethren, having a sense that it is my privilege and distinction to read and speak from the Scriptures at this time, beginning with the book of Genesis and connecting it with the book of Revelation.<a name=400:1></a> I should just like to link up these scriptures as dealing with the whole time-scene, we might say.<a name=400:2></a> They link up the whole Bible; and what a privilege it is to have the Bible!<a name=400:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Genesis begins the Scriptures and brings in man, which is a great matter.<a name=400:4></a> Indeed, it is one of the most immense matters that could be mentioned, because God and man are brought together.<a name=400:5></a> We have come to a time when men are very active, and in which they are ready to say great things, and to advance great things, and to do great things.<a name=400:6></a> But <i>we</i> are here tonight to do something; and I am thankful to have the opportunity of saying something in regard to the Scriptures.<a name=400:7></a> The word that I seek to speak is about the very beginning.<a name=400:8></a> We are told, in John's gospel: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=400:9></a> But in Genesis it says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=400:10></a> I am thinking about God.<a name=400:11></a> What a marvellous thing that we have to do with God!<a name=400:12></a> We have expressed in creation the majesty of God, the greatness of God, the glory of God and the patience of God.<a name=400:13></a> All this enters into the beginning of the book of Genesis.<a name=400:14></a> And I might say that it carries right through to the end of the book of Revelation.<a name=400:15></a>

		And so the word is: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=400:16></a> I am encouraged to begin with the beginning and to say that it is God with whom we have to do, and that it is <i>such</i> a God.<a name=400:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the passage goes on to say, "And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters".<a name=401:3></a> Notice that the blessed Spirit of God is here.<a name=401:4></a> The Spirit <i>is</i> God, and He was hovering.<a name=401:5></a> And then, "God said, Let there be light.<a name=401:6></a> And there was light".<a name=401:7></a> God has His way; whatever men may say or do or think.<a name=401:8></a> God has His way!<a name=401:9></a> His way is good; His way is right, "The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:7">Psalm  19:7</a>.<a name=401:10></a> And so I would seek, in humility of mind, to consider the great facts of what God did in the beginning and what He will do in the end.<a name=401:11></a> We are at the end of things in this dispensation.<a name=401:12></a> If we do not know it we should know it, and our children should be taught so that they may know what God is doing for men.<a name=401:13></a> He began with creation.<a name=401:14></a> He began with this great matter and He will finish with it in the sense that His glory will be displayed in relation to it.<a name=401:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we are told that "the earth was waste and empty".<a name=401:16></a> Things had happened that were very objectionable and at this point there was no encouragement at all; all was waste and emptiness.<a name=401:17></a> But the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters, and God said, "Let there be light.<a name=401:18></a> And there was light".<a name=401:19></a> The goodness of God comes in immediately.<a name=401:20></a> His goodness, His majesty and His power are in mind.<a name=401:21></a> And the Spirit of God is seen as free.<a name=401:22></a> No one can hinder God, "Thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine".<a name=401:23></a> <a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:2">Job  42:2</a>.<a name=401:24></a> And so God said, Let there be light.<a name=401:25></a> And there <i>was</i> light.<a name=401:26></a> And God saw that it was good.<a name=401:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then the next thing is that God divided between the light and the darkness.<a name=401:28></a> God is doing things to better them for man.<a name=401:29></a> And He called the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters".<a name=402:5></a> God is doing things His own way, and they are His own things, and He is calling them by the names <i>He</i> uses.<a name=402:6></a> And so He made the expanse.<a name=402:7></a> And He called the expanse Heavens.<a name=402:8></a> God was doing the speaking, and it must be done.<a name=402:9></a> And so we have the glorious creation of old.<a name=402:10></a> And, of course, man was created.<a name=402:11></a> We here this afternoon are part of the creation and God is blessing us; I am sure it is so, "And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear.<a name=402:12></a> And it was so".<a name=402:13></a> Notice that when God spoke, it says, "It was so".<a name=402:14></a> There is no use contending with God, for He is going to have His way!<a name=402:15></a> And we thank Him for it!<a name=402:16></a> God has rights in what He is doing and all that He is doing is good.<a name=402:17></a> And then we have the grass and the herbs and the trees yielding fruit.<a name=402:18></a> And God saw that it was good, "And there was evening, and there was morning -- a third day".<a name=402:19></a> Now we have come on to the idea of the power of resurrection in the third day.<a name=402:20></a> That is a great matter to reach -- resurrection!<a name=402:21></a>

		Now I will just touch on the passage in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>.<a name=402:22></a> Verse 14 says, "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city".<a name=402:23></a> Now God has a <i>right</i> to do that.<a name=402:24></a> He is giving men life!<a name=402:25></a> And it is that <i>they</i> may have right to the
