		Ques.<a name=2:3></a> Would the manifestation between the two expositions in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>have any bearing?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:5></a> Yes, a very great bearing.<a name=2:6></a> It does not appear that the first exposition the Lord gave altered the course of the two.<a name=2:7></a> There are those who enjoy expositions of Scripture and their course is not altered, nor their associations changed, but the manifestation of the Lord in Emmaus in the breaking of bread led to a movement toward the assembly.<a name=2:8></a> The Scriptures cannot be understood save by those in the light of the assembly.<a name=2:9></a> The manifestation had the effect of their returning to Jerusalem and there they find the eleven and those with them.<a name=2:10></a> Then they relate what had taken place, and the Lord comes in and says, "It is I myself", and it is in the light of His appearing that we have the Scriptures divided so that they become intelligible to us: "that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me".<a name=2:11></a> The law of Moses represents the authority of God, His rights.<a name=2:12></a> One has to begin there, no one can arrive at an understanding of what is becoming in the assembly, save as he sees how the rights of God are fully maintained and expressed in Christ.<a name=2:13></a> "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day".<a name=2:14></a> So the law of Moses read in the light of Christ risen represents the authority of God in our souls.<a name=2:15></a> Then the prophets impress us with the patience of God.<a name=2:16></a> One needs to know the patience of God if one is to reach the Psalms, because, if we seek to answer to the rights of God, we soon discover that we have to draw on His patience.<a name=2:17></a> One of the most interesting

		things found in Scripture is the patience of God.<a name=3:1></a> The Psalms themselves testify to this feature, and as I said, if we do not know patience we shall not reach the Psalms.<a name=3:2></a> So that is how the Scriptures are to be read if we are to be spiritually intelligent; they are to be read in the light of Christ risen.<a name=3:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:7></a> Well, they are included in "all the scriptures", but their omission is a mark of spiritual exactitude.<a name=3:8></a> People who have their backs to Jerusalem have no psalms that God can take account of.<a name=3:9></a> They were going through an experience of dejection, and their faces were away from Jerusalem where divine interest was centred.<a name=3:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> The Psalms are a wonderful storehouse.<a name=3:16></a> God greatly honours saints in that He draws from that storehouse to build up the testimony to the greatness of Christ.<a name=3:17></a>

		as the latter and former rain unto the earth".<a name=4:1></a> That is what comes within the range of one who is truly desirous of knowing.<a name=4:2></a> As light comes into the soul, you see what God has effected on the third day; you move on.<a name=4:3></a> You are not stationary, you follow on to know, and that brings out the movements of Christ.<a name=4:4></a> How many apprehend them?<a name=4:5></a> "His going forth", Hosea says.<a name=4:6></a> He is moving in relation to all the thoughts of God; every thought of God is to be fully expressed in the <i>day</i>, so His going forth is as the morning dawn.<a name=4:7></a> Spiritually you see every divine thought becoming verified in Christ, and the heart is full of hope as the fulfilment of all these thoughts is the end to which we are going.<a name=4:8></a> Colossians and Ephesians take account of Christ in that way in relation to the thoughts of God, to the mystery.<a name=4:9></a> This principle of following on to know is important.<a name=4:10></a> As knowing and made to live before the face of God there is power for movement, and you come to see that His going forth is as the morning dawn.<a name=4:11></a> Wonderful things come into view, filling your heart with hope.<a name=4:12></a> "He shall come unto us as the rain": His coming unto us shows what an interest He has in us.<a name=4:13></a>

		I wanted to bring out from these scriptures something as to life, according to the manner in which it is developed in our dispensation.<a name=12:1></a> Life necessarily enters into all dispensations.<a name=12:2></a> When the Lord said, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:10">John  10:10</a>).<a name=12:3></a> He had reference to ourselves; we have everything in abundance and especially life.<a name=12:4></a> John, having this great subject in view in his gospel, introduces the subject of life immediately, and he does so, not in a theoretical way, but in a concrete way; that is, as it had taken form in a Man -- in One, indeed, of whom he had already said that He was in the beginning with God and that He was God, and that without Him not one thing received being which had received being.<a name=12:5></a> So that His Person is carefully guarded and asserted, before John introduces this great subject as having its beginning in Christ: "In him was life, and the life was the light of men".<a name=12:6></a>

		It is well, dear brethren, to be reminded in approaching such a great subject, which has its beginning in Christ, that we should be on our guard in regard of the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, for on every hand He is attacked.<a name=12:7></a> Even those who profess to love Him and regard Him in esteem, are letting down the bars and admitting the agents of the enemy, of whom the apostle says, "his ministers .<a name=12:8></a>.<a name=12:9></a>.<a name=12:10></a> transform themselves as ministers of righteousness", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:15">2 Corinthians  11:15</a>.<a name=12:11></a> One is reminded of Joab, David's captain, a sagacious man, one who would stand up for, as we say, the fundamentals, but who, being selfish, and ambitious, and perceiving that David's heart longed for Absalom,

		I just close with a word about 'man'.<a name=50:1></a> Immediately after the matter of the temple and believing in Jesus and in the Scriptures, you have brought to your attention that Jesus did not trust man, even though they believed.<a name=50:2></a> You cannot trust man simply because they assent or profess to believe on Jesus.<a name=50:3></a> And so it says, "But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man".<a name=50:4></a> There is a remarkable scripture in Ecclesiastes.<a name=50:5></a> It says, "What man is, is known", <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#6:10">Ecclesiastes  6:10</a>.<a name=50:6></a> This sheds light on conditions at the present time, because there is so much inquiry into the origin of man.<a name=50:7></a> Solomon said, "What man is, is known".<a name=50:8></a> Modern scientific men say, 'No, we are investigating'.<a name=50:9></a> And that means that they do not know.<a name=50:10></a> They do not know, and they are only throwing up clouds of dust.<a name=50:11></a> How can they know?<a name=50:12></a> They shall never know!<a name=50:13></a> John would manifest what is known.<a name=50:14></a> "We speak that which we know"; that is what you want, what is known.<a name=50:15></a> The Lord knew what was in man.<a name=50:16></a> He amplifies what Solomon says, "What man is, is known".<a name=50:17></a> John says, as it were, 'Jesus is the One who knows, and He did not trust man'.<a name=50:18></a> They are not to be trusted, not even my own heart, naturally.<a name=50:19></a> "What man is, is known".<a name=50:20></a> But then it immediately goes on to say here, "But there was a man".<a name=50:21></a> He is a remarkable type of man.<a name=50:22></a> "He came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God".<a name=50:23></a> That is the thing.<a name=50:24></a> These notorieties talk about man's development, but they do not profess to come from God.<a name=50:25></a> "Thou art come a teacher from God"; this was said by a man on the way to the temple.<a name=50:26></a> I mention this so that you may understand that the temple is now composed of men who recognise that Jesus is come from God, a teacher.<a name=50:27></a> The Lord says, "It is needful that <i>ye</i> should be born anew".<a name=50:28></a> There was to

		J.T.<a name=52:1></a> It is evident in the Canticles that the apple tree alludes to the Lord, and that the feminine speaker had been awakened, or raised up, under Him; and I thought that that idea would have a connection with the epistles to the Corinthians in that the aim of the apostle in writing to them was to awaken them under the authority and influence of Christ, so that they should be formed, as it were, and brought forth.<a name=52:2></a> There is much that answers to the idea of mother in the religious organisations around, but wherever the assembly is recognised, wherever believers walk in the light of it, the aim should be that those coming in should be nurtured under the authority and influence of Christ.<a name=52:3></a> It is only thus that there can be right formation, that there can be children according to God.<a name=52:4></a> The bride earlier had said when she found the Lord, having sought Him that she brought Him to her mother's house; that is, as finding the Lord she would connect Him with the assembly, so to speak.<a name=52:5></a>

		And so I read the verse in Revelation.<a name=69:3></a> The Lord laid His right hand upon John.<a name=69:4></a> Isolated as he was, he was to bear witness to the power of the life that was in Christ.<a name=69:5></a> In the gospel he does not attach his name at all, it is "the disciple whom Jesus loved", but it is "I, John", in the Revelation so that we have no doubt as to who is speaking.<a name=69:6></a> It was one upon whom the right hand of power was laid.<a name=69:7></a> One knows but little of the Lord's touch, but one can understand that the touch of the right hand of the One who is life would convey an impression which would enter into John's testimony in this wonderful book of Revelation.<a name=69:8></a> Energy marks it.<a name=69:9></a> It announces the break-up of man's world.<a name=69:10></a> It is impregnated with the energy of life.<a name=69:11></a> "Behold, the lion .<a name=69:12></a>.<a name=69:13></a>.<a name=69:14></a> of the tribe of Juda .<a name=69:15></a>.<a name=69:16></a>.<a name=69:17></a> has overcome".<a name=69:18></a> So that there is energy in the testimony; this has a voice for us, for we should be as those who believe what we say and as those who are affected by what we say.<a name=69:19></a> So the Lord lays His right hand upon John and says, "I am he that liveth and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death".<a name=69:20></a> That, you see, breathes energy, victory; Christ has the keys of hades and of death.<a name=69:21></a> He has supreme control over those elements which Satan once held.<a name=69:22></a> One dwells on this because it is teaching intended to qualify a witness.<a name=69:23></a> This book of Revelation is one of the most powerful witnesses there is and the vessel had to be prepared for it.<a name=69:24></a> What preparation there is in the appearance of the Lord to him!<a name=69:25></a> and then in His personal touch, symbol of His power, "Fear not; I am the first and the last".<a name=69:26></a>

		I need not remark that I take a most blessed subject, believing that the Lord and the sympathy of the brethren will help, so that He should become known to us in His eternal relations; for I hope to show that in the scriptures read we have persons attracted to Him, and that the attraction had an inward and upward bearing.<a name=72:6></a>

		You all remember how that David on taking Zion built round the citadel inwardly.<a name=72:7></a> David is a type of Christ in the sense in which I hope to present Him at the present time.<a name=72:8></a> He is a type of Christ as personally attractive, and so he has gained an entrance into hearts; that is really what the taking of Zion in one sense means, the hearts of God's people taken up in relation to His eternal purpose.<a name=72:9></a> A wonderful conception.<a name=72:10></a> God takes our hearts up in relation to His eternal thoughts, and in order that He should have these hearts He comes out in the Son, who is, as seen in that relation, unofficially but personally attractive; so that David as he appears first in Samuel is said to have been ruddy, meaning that he was full of life.<a name=72:11></a> Then he is said to have been beautiful-eyed and

	<div class="paragraph">
		You see thus what Jehovah had in this remarkable type of Christ, and so in the epistle to the Hebrews, the first chapter of which is full of the Person of Christ, after the Holy Spirit in a few brief sentences shows that the Son had come in, and that it was the Son, and that this One was the effulgence of the divine glory, the expression of His substance, and that He upheld all things by the word of His power, and that after He made purification of sins He sat down at the right hand of the Greatness on high -- after these things are said, conveying in majestic language the Person, the Speaker, the Spirit of God, brings forward the estimation of the saints, what they had to say about Him; and so the citations which follow in quick order in that chapter are from the Psalms, as if God were to honour His people by allowing them to convey in their appreciation of Christ the greatness of His Person.<a name=73:8></a>

		The so-called synoptic gospels present Christ not as in His eternal setting: they present Him as come in to effect a certain thought of God in regard of what existed on earth before.<a name=74:12></a> In other words, to speak in a general way, these three synoptic gospels present Him officially.<a name=74:13></a> In Matthew He comes into prominence as the Son of David and the Son of Abraham.<a name=74:14></a> That is not an eternal setting.<a name=74:15></a> In Mark, while it is true that He is the Son of God, as expressed at the beginning of the gospel, "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God", it is Christ in relation to what existed before, namely the service of God.<a name=74:16></a> In Luke we have Him in relation to man who had been on earth for thousands of years, so that Luke connects Him with what existed before here upon earth: He is the Son of man; that is not an eternal setting.<a name=74:17></a> True enough, the Son of man is in heaven, and the Son of man ascends up where He was before.<a name=74:18></a>

		relationship.<a name=75:1></a> How one approaches it with diffidence!<a name=75:2></a> The sense one has of the need of the support of the Spirit to deal with it is difficult to express.<a name=75:3></a> And yet, beloved, that relationship is there, and it is of all moment that the saints should understand it.<a name=75:4></a> Things are written in regard of Him that man would not have written.<a name=75:5></a> Only the Holy Spirit could write them, and so we do well indeed to approach the subject humbly and yet confidently, for it is for us.<a name=75:6></a> As I said, beloved, it is the Son, and what I wish to dwell upon is what the saints in this gospel see, those saints who are singled out as having come into personal contact with Him, as having been personally attracted, so that it may not seem beyond any of us.<a name=75:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First we have John the baptist.<a name=75:8></a> True indeed that the writer of the gospel refers to himself and others in saying, "We have contemplated his glory", but John the baptist is the first person presented who was personally affected by, and personally attracted to, Christ.<a name=75:9></a> He it is indeed who is the first to declare in this gospel that "this is the Son of God".<a name=75:10></a> I say these things so that you may see that they are not beyond us, and so the baptist says "I knew him not".<a name=75:11></a> As John the baptist did not know Him by natural means, no man or woman on earth can know Him by natural means.<a name=75:12></a> He was related to Him, he was contemporary with Him in childhood, and yet he says "I knew him not".<a name=75:13></a> Of course he knew Him as his relative, the child of Mary and Joseph, but he knew <i>Him</i> not, nor do any of us know Him on natural lines.<a name=75:14></a>

		John says, "I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, <i>he</i> said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=76:1></a> And what does John say?<a name=76:2></a> What designation does he give Him?<a name=76:3></a> Does he refer to 'the Baptiser with the Holy Spirit'?<a name=76:4></a> No.<a name=76:5></a> He says, "I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God".<a name=76:6></a> He had knowledge of Him by spiritual means.<a name=76:7></a> What we find is that John designates Him as the Son of God.<a name=76:8></a> He had in him spiritual ability to name what he saw, and that is what is so essential -- to be able to give a right name to what we see spiritually.<a name=76:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it is that John the baptist introduces to us the Son of God from his own personal appreciation of Him.<a name=76:10></a> "I saw", he says, "and bare record that this is the Son of God".<a name=76:11></a> And so the knowledge of Him as such is within our range.<a name=76:12></a> I do not say that there was the inward effect or the upward effect, for John belonged officially to a past dispensation.<a name=76:13></a> "A little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:11">Matthew  11:11</a>), according to Christ's own words, for the reason among other things that such has access within and above.<a name=76:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The two disciples who heard John say "Behold the Lamb of God" followed Him.<a name=76:15></a> We now arrive at the first movement after Christ according to this gospel.<a name=76:16></a> It is a movement which began with the words of one who had given Christ the title of the Son of God.<a name=76:17></a> Were they likely to stop short?<a name=76:18></a> No, beloved, and so the Lord says to them as He saw them following, "What seek ye?<a name=76:19></a>" He would bring out what they had in their souls, and so He will ever.<a name=76:20></a> All divine questions put to us thus are to bring out what may be of God in us, however little.<a name=76:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=196:3></a> It would appear from the first chapter of Ezra that he presents the divine intervention, God acting of Himself to bring about His thoughts; He acts outside of His people in Cyrus, whereas here you will observe that it is from the point of view of the exercise of one of the people.<a name=196:4></a> These two things run together in God's ways -- God's sovereign action to bring about His thoughts, using whom He will, and then the exercise in His people who are found in relationship with Him, and who feel the conditions existent which are the outcome of their own guilt, their own conduct.<a name=196:5></a> So that what we have in <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#1">Nehemiah  1</a>is what this brother or person has to say.<a name=196:6></a> It is a very interesting side of the thing -- what he has to say as having gone through all that is recorded in chapter 1.<a name=196:7></a> They are the words of Nehemiah, a man who has had to do with God about things, who has humbled himself and has helped the people of God in very remarkable ways; so we do well to listen to what he has to say.<a name=196:8></a> He can say much that will be a guide to us in similar circumstances.<a name=196:9></a> The book of Ezra is an account of what God did; it is more historical: it begins, "In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia", and goes on to tell us what God did.<a name=196:10></a> The writer's name is not mentioned; it is just to tell us what God did.<a name=196:11></a> It says, "That the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia".<a name=196:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we shall see in the scriptures we have read that there is divine regulation, a subject that the evangelist Luke expresses having in view the order that is becoming to the people of God.<a name=212:1></a> For divine order cannot be seen in us save as we are subject to divine regulation; nothing is more foreign to God than independency, that is, in man.<a name=212:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in the physical systems around us how everything is regulated by law, and therefore you have order and benefit to man.<a name=212:3></a> Apart from the recognition of order or divine regulation, there must be catastrophe, of which we have indeed evidences from time to time in physical things, but, alas, much more in moral things, for it is the moral things that man has to handle.<a name=212:4></a> He could do little or nothing to interfere with the great bodies which God has created for his benefit, even as to the earth itself upon which he is, his power of interference is small, but in the moral things that God has introduced here, man has had a great deal to say, and catastrophe after catastrophe have ensued.<a name=212:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Lord came into this world as the poor wise man in Ecclesiastes, in order to deliver the little city, for the things that God had introduced for the regulation of man in the way of systems had become reduced and were apparently at the mercy of the enemy, for it says that a great king came against the little city and built bulwarks against it, but there was in that city a poor wise man who, by his wisdom, delivered the city.<a name=212:6></a> It is in the gospel of Luke that we get the poor wise man particularly, although he is that throughout the New Testament; in this gospel we have Christ come in lowliness and obscurity, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		presently the action of wisdom became evident, and consequently the sure deliverance of the city from the attack.<a name=213:1></a> So I feel encouraged, beloved brethren, to call attention to Luke from the standpoint of divine guidance and direction and regulation, for obviously the principles which God introduced are for man; they are to be wrought out by man.<a name=213:2></a> For as by man came lawlessness, so by man came resurrection of the dead and righteousness, and the setting out of divine regulation, and all that came in in Christ, who was subject to God in every detail, growing up before Him as a tender plant, increasing, as we are told, in favour with God and man, so that when He reached the age of thirty the voice out of heaven says, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:22">Luke  3:22</a>.<a name=213:3></a> He answered to God and the Holy Spirit came upon Him in a bodily form as a dove -- <i>a bodily form</i>.<a name=213:4></a> It abode upon Him so that now He was here in a public way for ministry; to effect, so to say, the deliverance of the little city.<a name=213:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This must be worked out in man, and so you find in Luke that great stress is laid upon faith.<a name=213:6></a> Zacharias was in every way blameless, he and his wife Elizabeth, and trustworthy as to their walk; he, too, conformed to the outward regulation of the priesthood, serving in his order, yet he was unbelieving.<a name=213:7></a> So that we may be outwardly regulated apparently, and yet inwardly unbelieving.<a name=213:8></a> As Gabriel therefore comes to him and announces to him that he is to have a son according to his prayer and supplications, he cannot believe the glad message.<a name=213:9></a> He was unbelieving, and so was rendered dumb for a season until the answer should come to his prayer.<a name=213:10></a> We are thus reminded in the beginning of Luke that for the working out of divine principles in us there must be faith.<a name=213:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The regulation is of a moral kind, and comes as a result of the subjection of the heart in faith, so Paul

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord, I believe, begins this service of divine regulation in Peter, and so He enters into his house, as in chapter 4, but as far as the record goes Peter got no help from the visit, although the gain came to his wife's mother, a great advantage to him doubtless, making things easier for him in his house, and God may make things easier for you, yet it may not touch you yourself.<a name=214:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was a very striking sign, the restoration of Peter's wife's mother, but there is nothing said about the effect of it on Peter, and yet there cannot be a doubt that the Lord had Peter especially in His mind in going into his house.<a name=214:9></a> We are not told that He was invited in; it would appear to be an act of the Lord, for He knew what a great servant Peter was to be, but there is nothing said as to the effect of it in Simon, and so the next movement of the Lord is in relation to Peter's business.<a name=214:10></a> It may be that he was more interested in his business affairs than he was in his house.<a name=214:11></a> It is often the case with us, and we may well be reminded of the danger of excessive attention to business and neglect of our houses.<a name=214:12></a> What you look for in a christian is balance.<a name=214:13></a> The Lord had not yet approached Peter in his business relations.<a name=214:14></a> He now entered into Peter's boat, we are told.<a name=214:15></a> It was not accidental; it was not, the only boat there, but it was the one the Lord selected.<a name=214:16></a> He had Peter in

		His mind; much was to be worked out in this man; the Lord knew what He was doing and so He asked Peter to move the boat out into the water.<a name=215:1></a> It was not a command; it was not an order; it was a request.<a name=215:2></a> The Lord is extremely tender with us in all His dealings; He would avoid wounding unless a wound is necessary, and so He <i>asks</i> Peter that he would draw out into the water, and then He speaks from that boat.<a name=215:3></a> This was an immense advantage for Peter, and yet it does not appear that he was in any way affected.<a name=215:4></a> He had failed to be affected both in his house and in his boat, but when the Lord finishes, He addresses Peter.<a name=215:5></a> He does not ask him now; He directs him to launch out, as you will observe.<a name=215:6></a> He says, "Draw out into the deep water, and let down your nets for a haul".<a name=215:7></a> He is coming near now to Peter's soul, and in the perfection of His service to every one of us He knows just when to do the thing that is necessary.<a name=215:8></a> There is never a bow shot at a venture with the Lord; the aim is always taken, and the object reached; so that He directs at the right moment.<a name=215:9></a> Instead of asking, it is now a question of testing.<a name=215:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter says to Him, "having laboured through the whole night we have taken nothing", that is, he was doubtful.<a name=215:11></a> The Lord had said, "Draw out into the deep water, and let down your nets for a haul".<a name=215:12></a> There is no hesitancy in these words; they are most direct words, and this is divine direction, but Peter is doubtful.<a name=215:13></a> But in his doubtfulness he is submissive.<a name=215:14></a> He says, "but at thy word I will let down the net".<a name=215:15></a> Thank God, Peter is saved!<a name=215:16></a> Not actually saved yet but potentially saved.<a name=215:17></a> He is obedient, "at thy word I will let down the net".<a name=215:18></a> That was all the Lord asked him to do; He did not appeal to him for confidence; He only directed him to do that one thing, and he did it.<a name=215:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter was in the Lord's eye, as you are and as I am, and we are told that he fell down at Jesus' knees; now that is the result of submitting to divine regulation.<a name=216:11></a> The Lord did not tell him to do that.<a name=216:12></a> You see the effect of light in the soul so that you move in the light that comes into it, but there is no light in your soul until you learn to obey.<a name=216:13></a> The light in the soul becomes operative.<a name=216:14></a> "But at thy word I will let down the net" is submission to what is precursory to the light coming into the soul, and in that light Peter moved.<a name=216:15></a> He fell down at Jesus' knees; at His knees!<a name=216:16></a> That was a matter of instinct; it was perhaps the first definite spiritual movement in Peter.<a name=216:17></a> It is not a question now of intelligence, but of instinct, for instinct led him to fall down at His knees.<a name=216:18></a> His spiritual history is beginning, the history that stands out in Scripture by itself, and now comes the adjustment.<a name=216:19></a>

		Well now I wish to carry this thought on to Zacchaeus, for it is in him you see the regulation of the Lord as entering into his house.<a name=217:8></a> It does not appear, as I said, that Peter was affected when the Lord entered his house, but when Jesus entered into the house of Zacchaeus (and we need our houses regulated, for if we are to be in the assembly right our houses must be right) he was affected.<a name=217:9></a>

		I have been thinking of light, dear brethren, in view of this meeting, particularly of the 'true light' which is said to lighten every man, showing that however much is said of light in the Scriptures, and however important it is as viewed by itself, yet in the divine mind men were in view in it.<a name=223:1></a> God, I need not say, always worked in the light in whatever He did, so that it is said in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, before He began, "God said, Let there be light.<a name=223:2></a> And there was light".<a name=223:3></a> The operations that followed were in it, and as they proceeded, they were seen in relation to one another.<a name=223:4></a> As day after day developed, the divine thoughts became clearer, and were obviously coordinated, always in the light.<a name=223:5></a> But when we come to John's gospel, we have the divine mind as to light, that it had man in view, man as such; "every man", not simply man as a race but every member of it.<a name=223:6></a> Whatever his nationality or antecedent, every man was in the divine mind in regard of the light.<a name=223:7></a> So that everything from the very outset was done in the light.<a name=223:8></a> God never operated in the dark.<a name=223:9></a> Hence we find that in the laying of the foundations of the earth, those present knew what was being done.<a name=223:10></a> Although God does not always give an account of His matters, yet in the laying of the foundations intelligent beings knew what was being done.<a name=223:11></a> He has not been pleased to give an account of many of the things that are visible to us, physical phenomena.<a name=223:12></a> That is within His prerogative; He is not obliged to give an account of these things, but at the same time all has been done in the light, and those present are cognisant and interested, so that we are told, "the morning stars sang together", <a href="../bible/@Job.htm#38:7">@Job  38:7</a>.<a name=223:13></a> They sang

		<i>together</i>, a beautiful tribute to unity even then.<a name=224:1></a> We may be assured that whatever is alluded to, they were engaged with the same thing; they sang together.<a name=224:2></a> They sang with the spirit, as I may say, and they sang with the understanding.<a name=224:3></a> They knew something of what God was doing, and then it adds, "all the sons of God".<a name=224:4></a> These allude surely to mature beings, persons of intelligence.<a name=224:5></a> They were all interested, and so interested that they "shouted for joy".<a name=224:6></a> They saw what God was about.<a name=224:7></a> The book of Proverbs opens up to us further that wisdom was there.<a name=224:8></a> The morning stars and the sons of God say nothing about men.<a name=224:9></a> Wisdom does.<a name=224:10></a> Wisdom carries the thought forward and speaks anticipatively, anticipating the actual realisation of the divine thought in that He says, "my delights were with the sons of men", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:31">Proverbs  8:31</a>.<a name=224:11></a> You see, beloved brethren, what a note of intelligent jubilance runs through.<a name=224:12></a> In wisdom you have Christ personified; He was not simply occupied with the general scheme of God, infinite as it was, but particularly with the <i>habitable</i> parts of God's earth.<a name=224:13></a> He speaks anticipatively, seeing what was in the divine mind and knowing it, knowing more than the morning stars and the sons of God.<a name=224:14></a> He spoke of the habitable parts of God's earth; His delights were with the sons of men.<a name=224:15></a>

		Now, therefore, you can see, dear brethren, how John's gospel fits in with all that.<a name=224:16></a> Although as stated here, "All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:3">John  1:3</a>.<a name=224:17></a> What is in view immediately is men, and hence the statement, "In him was life; and the life was the light of men".<a name=224:18></a> In the expression 'true light', it is not meant that the light previously referred to was not true light.<a name=224:19></a> Physical light, of course, is true to a point, the sun and whatever other light there may be in the physical system, but God had reserved the thought of the true light for men.<a name=224:20></a> It was something

	<div class="paragraph">
		that should become a substantive, not merely an abstract, thought.<a name=225:1></a> It was to be something here within men's range, something that men could touch.<a name=225:2></a> And so it says, "In him was life; and the life was the light of men".<a name=225:3></a> But so as to prepare our minds for the thought, we have to dismiss all earlier conceptions of light for the moment, for hitherto light dispelled darkness, so that darkness was driven by it into its own area, and a name given to it.<a name=225:4></a> The light was called Day.<a name=225:5></a> It ruled and dominated.<a name=225:6></a> They had not existed together.<a name=225:7></a> Here, however, we are prepared for the new thought in that we are told that the light, the true light, "appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not", and that, moreover, witness has been borne to it.<a name=225:8></a> No one needs to call attention to the sun as it shines in the heavens.<a name=225:9></a> It is there; nothing is hid from its heat.<a name=225:10></a> Its light comes to all the earth, and as it rises, the darkness is driven out of the way.<a name=225:11></a> In fact it negatives the darkness, so that in its presence darkness ceases.<a name=225:12></a> The new thing has to be apprehended, and therefore we are told that the light shines in darkness and the darkness apprehended it not, and that attention has to be called to it.<a name=225:13></a> So that we are told immediately, "There was a man sent from God".<a name=225:14></a> That is not merely historical; it is moral.<a name=225:15></a> It is a man that was with God, and was sent as being 'with Him'.<a name=225:16></a> He came, we are told, for a witness of the light.<a name=225:17></a> He was not it, the Spirit tells us, although the Lord later pays a beautiful tribute to John.<a name=225:18></a> He says, "He was a burning and a shining light", <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:35">John  5:35</a>.<a name=225:19></a> It was more local; he burned and he shone.<a name=225:20></a> You can see as those Pharisees came to him to be baptised, how he burned; as he called them a generation of vipers he would wither them up.<a name=225:21></a> But the light was there: he was a burning and a shining light and they rejoiced for a season in it.<a name=225:22></a> But it was local and national.<a name=225:23></a> The Holy Spirit here says, "<i>He</i> was not the light".<a name=225:24></a> That is to say, he

	<div class="paragraph">
		was national and partial, designed of God to be so, for it was a question of saving Israel, and that all should believe on Christ.<a name=226:1></a> But he was not the true light, and then the Holy Spirit tells us what that was.<a name=226:2></a> "The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man"; that is Christ.<a name=226:3></a> He is indiscriminate; He is impartial; He shines on <i>all</i>.<a name=226:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Holy Spirit goes on to tell us how the witness was borne.<a name=226:5></a> John says, "He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he <i>was</i> before me".<a name=226:6></a> Again he says, "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know .<a name=226:7></a>.<a name=226:8></a>.<a name=226:9></a> the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose".<a name=226:10></a> You see the beautiful witness, the kind of witness to this Light.<a name=226:11></a> He was in their midst.<a name=226:12></a> May it not be, beloved, that there is that of God in our midst standing whom we know not?<a name=226:13></a> We are always tested.<a name=226:14></a> It is a constant test among the people of God -- that which is of God in our midst.<a name=226:15></a> Here He is not acting.<a name=226:16></a> He is not preaching.<a name=226:17></a> He is not working.<a name=226:18></a> He is <i>standing</i>, and yet He is the great Creator of the universe, "whom ye do not know".<a name=226:19></a> You see what is of God amongst us, possibly inactive because of ourselves, becomes a test.<a name=226:20></a> John says, 'I did not know Him, but I was on the look-out for Him'.<a name=226:21></a> You see the thing is to be on the look-out for what is of God, for God is never inactive, as the Lord says later, "My Father worketh hitherto", <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:17">John  5:17</a>.<a name=226:22></a> Then John goes on, "he who sent me to baptise with water, <i>he</i> said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=226:23></a> That is what God said to him.<a name=226:24></a> You say, No wonder John knew.<a name=226:25></a> But that is not all that is said about John.<a name=226:26></a> It is said that John saw Him coming <i>to him</i>.<a name=226:27></a> It was when John saw the Lord moving, not standing, that he discerned Him.<a name=226:28></a> It was not the Lord's preaching, it was not the Lord's miracles, it was His moving.<a name=226:29></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=236:1></a> I have been thinking of fruit-bearing as a result of the sowing; as it is said here, "The seed is the word of God".<a name=236:2></a> In Luke, before we have the parable introduced, certain persons are seen with the Lord -- the twelve, whose moral beginnings are represented in Peter's conversion, and then certain women who had been held by wicked spirits and infirmities, of whom Mary Magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out, was the representative; that is, there are those who are with the Lord who present the work of God in its moral setting.<a name=236:3></a> The moral effect of the work of God in John alludes more to what is inward or for eternity, so the disciples are seen inside at the end of that gospel.<a name=236:4></a> These all followed the Lord at the outset, and are seen to appear with Him.<a name=236:5></a> So John is the inward side; we go in in virtue of it to have a part in the Father's house.<a name=236:6></a> The work of God in Luke is more outward in its bearing, and fits us to have a part before the day is over in this world; morally speaking, it is that with which God can identify Himself, so that we are known in our localities as those who were once serving sin and Satan, but are now with God and going on with Him; and so Mary Magdalene is representative of what we were under the power of Satan, but now she is with the Lord and in company with the others.<a name=236:7></a> They have substance, and they minister to the Lord of it.<a name=236:8></a> The Lord is not ashamed to have such as these in spite of their public reputation.<a name=236:9></a> He accepts them and respects their substance, but it is His.<a name=236:10></a> The work of God takes effect upon them and the moral features of the assembly are seen in them, according to Luke, so that in chapter 24, as they are gathered together,

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=280:4></a> I was thinking of the way it is presented in the Scriptures.<a name=280:5></a> In the Old Testament, the synoptic gospels and Paul's epistles, it is generally presented as a future blessing, as answering to the mind of God for the future; being definite blessing which He commands; whereas John brings it in as a present thing, so that one has it on the principle of faith, agreeing with the well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=280:6></a> I thought that is perhaps what we need -- to see the thing in its present availability, so that whilst the thought of life is varied as applying to vegetables, cattle, fishes, birds and man, we have it in its wide range in the material creation.<a name=280:7></a> John brings it within the compass of intelligent affection where it can be apprehended by those who love the Lord.<a name=280:8></a> "In him was life" is the statement here.<a name=280:9></a> In his epistle, John dwells on the family idea, that is those who loved the Lord and were near Him and had to do with Him; they saw Him with their eyes and handled Him with their hands, showing that He was available to them.<a name=280:10></a> It was not something at a distance or that which required investigation by scientific knowledge, but it was in a living Person, seen, heard and handled.<a name=280:11></a> That makes it very tangible, too, for us who love the Lord.<a name=280:12></a> It is not something theoretical but practical and substantial.<a name=280:13></a> That is what John would emphasise, hence he introduces the subject of life early in his gospel.<a name=280:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=281:2></a> I suppose the breathing in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>suggests that God would be on intimate terms with man, breathing into his nostrils the breath of life.<a name=281:3></a> There was no such intimate transaction in the other features of creation, although life was there: the earth was caused to bring forth grass, herbs and fruit-trees, that was at the command of God.<a name=281:4></a> The Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:50">John  12:50</a> in regard to eternal life, that it is the Father's commandment.<a name=281:5></a> Again it says, "Let the waters swarm".<a name=281:6></a> It was all God's fiat.<a name=281:7></a> So that life in its variety of forms comes into evidence by His word.<a name=281:8></a> It was all a result of the word or commandment.<a name=281:9></a> On the third day it is vegetable life.<a name=281:10></a> On the fifth day you have two species of creatures, the one inhabiting the waters, the other the air, they are marked by the principle of development outside of themselves.<a name=281:11></a> Then the remainder on the sixth day, the beast of the earth after their kind, cattle and creeping things.<a name=281:12></a> That is another kind of life, all at the command of God's word.<a name=281:13></a> It was what was in His mind to create.<a name=281:14></a> He might have made one kind only, but He made many kinds.<a name=281:15></a> Then we have man, and the counsel being taken in respect of him, and God's intimate relations with him, so that whilst he is a living soul in common with others, he is made a living soul by the divine breath.<a name=281:16></a> Jehovah Elohim breathed into his nostrils the breath of life -- a most intimate transaction, which indicates what He had in mind, that man was to participate, so to speak, in His own life.<a name=281:17></a> That is how the thing stands in Genesis in relation to the creation, and undoubtedly implies that God would have variety of life.<a name=281:18></a>

		THE ASSEMBLY IN LOCALITIES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:1">John  12:1</a> - 3; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:6">Matthew  26:6</a> - 13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking, dear brethren, of the idea of locality.<a name=320:1></a> The divine way in the economy of the assembly is to develop it in localities.<a name=320:2></a> Bethany represents the idea, I believe, expressly, both in John and in Matthew, and indeed elsewhere, but particularly in these two evangelists; John occupies us with Bethany throughout chapter 11 and into chapter 12.<a name=320:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject begins with Bethany, saying that Lazarus was of it and that it was the village of Mary and her sister Martha.<a name=320:4></a> It thus stands out in the chapter as the village of certain ones thus named and loved of Christ.<a name=320:5></a> Nothing can be more interesting than the subject of the love of Christ, especially as it is connected with persons whose names are given and whose locality is given.<a name=320:6></a> So that John the evangelist enlarges on these three in connection with the place.<a name=320:7></a> He also refers to another, a nameless one whom Jesus loved, not in relation to his town.<a name=320:8></a> Others are connected with their towns, such as Nathanael and Philip and Andrew in this gospel.<a name=320:9></a> But John, the nameless loved one (we say it is John, but Scripture does not; it is an inference) is of great interest.<a name=320:10></a> But the fact that his name is not given is that we should not be occupied with him but with the thing, that is to say that there was such a person as that, such a person that was loved of Christ, that He could actually love a person individually.<a name=320:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is how John alludes to himself; and he stands over against one who professed to be a lover of Christ, namely, Peter.<a name=320:12></a> As if John were to put two pictures in front of you and ask you which you preferred.<a name=320:13></a> He would say, 'Here is a man who says he loves Christ, and there is one whom Christ loves'.<a name=320:14></a> These two are

		interesting pictures.<a name=321:1></a> I need not ask you which you prefer, or which is the more attractive.<a name=321:2></a> The more attractive of those two pictures is the one which presents the man whom Jesus loved.<a name=321:3></a> I say, 'I would like to see that man; I would like to look at that man'.<a name=321:4></a> You say, 'Why?<a name=321:5></a>' Because he must have been a very lovable man.<a name=321:6></a> Not that the Lord Jesus does not love unlovable persons in the abstract, and works with us until He makes us lovely.<a name=321:7></a> If He loved Mary, He loved Martha.<a name=321:8></a> But Martha was not nearly so lovable or lovely.<a name=321:9></a> In the abstract she was the same as Mary.<a name=321:10></a> The Lord knew what He could make out of her.<a name=321:11></a> He would work until He made her lovable.<a name=321:12></a> That presents the disciple whom Jesus loved as a most attractive picture.<a name=321:13></a> I should like to meet him.<a name=321:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You would see something about him that distinguished him from all the others, for we must never forget that while the Lord can love in the abstract, He can love in the concrete.<a name=321:15></a> He has a perfect idea of what is lovable; what is lovable in His mind is perfectly so.<a name=321:16></a> We must accredit the Lord with that keenness of appreciation of the perfect, of the lovable.<a name=321:17></a> So that John must have been a remarkable type of disciple.<a name=321:18></a> I see Peter.<a name=321:19></a> Well, he has been saying that he loves the Lord and the Lord challenges him as to this, as you will remember, saying, "lovest thou me more than these?<a name=321:20></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:15">John  21:15</a>.<a name=321:21></a> Not, 'lovest thou Me?<a name=321:22></a>' but, "lovest thou me more than these?<a name=321:23></a>" There cannot be a doubt, beloved friends, in regard to the lovable one that there was as much love at least in him for Christ as there was in Peter.<a name=321:24></a> He is not saying it.<a name=321:25></a> But the Lord knew.<a name=321:26></a> He did not challenge John about his love.<a name=321:27></a> In fact when Peter says, "Lord, and what of this man?<a name=321:28></a>" the Lord says, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=321:29></a>" As much as to say, 'You have no need of anxiety about him; if I love him, you need

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those are the two pictures hung up in John's gospel, the one who professes love and the one loved.<a name=322:12></a> I need not suggest which you would prefer to be.<a name=322:13></a> I wish to be among those that are loved, the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=322:14></a> No name is given, no township is given, simply that there was such a person as that and that he had certain privileges.<a name=322:15></a> He was in Jesus' bosom (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:23">John  13:23</a>).<a name=322:16></a> The bosom is not to be leaned on.<a name=322:17></a> It is a soft, restful place, an inlet.<a name=322:18></a> It is not support; John was in Jesus' bosom while at table.<a name=322:19></a> Then he leaned on His breast.<a name=322:20></a> That is what the loved one did.<a name=322:21></a> There was reciprocation of affection.<a name=322:22></a> He was free, he could take the advantage that He gave, the bosom and the breast.<a name=322:23></a> They are different words.<a name=322:24></a> The one is an inlet, the other strength, the frame-work of the breast.<a name=322:25></a> But the loved one understood both, he was in the one and leaned on the other.<a name=322:26></a>

		When we come to this section, it is persons in the town.<a name=322:27></a> That is to say, in Michigan City, that is the town, the town of Lazarus, Lazarus of the town, and the town of Martha and Mary; the town of special interest to Christ, not only the persons, but the town because of the persons.<a name=322:28></a> That underlies the assembly in the place.<a name=322:29></a> That is what is in view in the chapter.<a name=322:30></a> And so in order to make room for the beginning of chapter 12 it is said that the Lord went down to a city called Ephraim, near the desert, not Bethany.<a name=322:31></a> Bethany was not in the wilderness.<a name=322:32></a> But He was rejected.<a name=322:33></a> The leaders of the Jews were taking counsel

	<div class="paragraph">
		The beginning of chapter 12 is in order to bring out what Bethany was in His mind, what was in Bethany for His eye, for Him.<a name=323:5></a> I hope to show from Matthew what there was there in a public way.<a name=323:6></a> The two things run together, what we are under the Lord's eye and for the Lord's heart and what we are under man's eye.<a name=323:7></a> And so here you will observe the Lord six days before the passover came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus.<a name=323:8></a> That is to say, the Lord thought of one in that town who had no part in it politically, socially or even commercially.<a name=323:9></a> He was not a leader in it.<a name=323:10></a> Whether he worked with his hands is another matter, whether he provided for his sisters is another matter, but he was not alive and not a part of the place publicly, he was "the dead man Lazarus".<a name=323:11></a> 'Lazarus, do you not vote?<a name=323:12></a>' 'No, I do not vote'.<a name=323:13></a> 'Why not?<a name=323:14></a>' 'Well', he says, 'I belong to that world and the resurrection'.<a name=323:15></a> That world.<a name=323:16></a> Could anybody deny it?<a name=323:17></a> When the Sadducees came to the Lord and questioned Him as to the resurrection.<a name=323:18></a> He says, ".<a name=323:19></a>.<a name=323:20></a>.<a name=323:21></a> they who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:35">Luke  20:35</a>.<a name=323:22></a> That world.<a name=323:23></a> What world did He speak of?<a name=323:24></a> Not this; that world, and the resurrection.<a name=323:25></a> Lazarus was one of those.<a name=323:26></a> Nobody could deny it in the place.<a name=323:27></a>

		So the Lord came to the man that belonged to that world, and was counted worthy of that world and the resurrection, the dead Lazarus.<a name=324:9></a> He had raised him, too.<a name=324:10></a> That is another thing, ".<a name=324:11></a>.<a name=324:12></a>.<a name=324:13></a> whom Jesus raised from among the dead".<a name=324:14></a> He came Himself, as if He would say, 'I respect this place because of this man.<a name=324:15></a> He gives character to it in My mind'.<a name=324:16></a> It was "where was the dead man Lazarus".<a name=324:17></a> And the Lord is fully justified in His choice because there they made Him a supper.<a name=324:18></a> They were of that world.<a name=324:19></a> This world does not make Him a supper, they counsel to kill Him.<a name=324:20></a> But those of that world and the resurrection entertained Him at supper.<a name=324:21></a> And Lazarus was one of those.<a name=324:22></a> It was not the Lord and Lazarus only, but those.<a name=324:23></a> That world is a very large conception and they made Him a supper.<a name=324:24></a> Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with Him.<a name=324:25></a> So there is a company in a town dead outwardly, but inwardly risen with Christ by faith, as it says, "ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=324:26></a> We are to live in our souls in relation to Christ.<a name=324:27></a> The town of Michigan City knows nothing about that, but the Lord knows about that.<a name=324:28></a> He thinks of you in that light and comes in that connection and is not disappointed.<a name=324:29></a>

		Well, now I want to show you that whilst they moved in the right direction generally, that is to say to the capital of the Jews' realm, they were deflected, which is very common when divine guidance is afforded.<a name=332:10></a> So that they reached Jerusalem and make their inquiry, "Where is the King of the Jews that has been born?<a name=332:11></a>" They have no question about that, that He is born; it is a question of locating Him.<a name=332:12></a> You see what we want, beloved friends, is certainty in what we are doing, and God ever furnishes us with the means of certainty.<a name=332:13></a> So that they are not in the least doubt as to the birth of Jesus.<a name=332:14></a> The Holy Spirit tells us in the previous chapter in the verse preceding the one I read, that He was born.<a name=332:15></a> They had not a doubt about it.<a name=332:16></a> Where is He?<a name=332:17></a> they do not say, 'Is He born?<a name=332:18></a>' but, 'Where is He that is born?<a name=332:19></a>' You see they were certain of that.<a name=332:20></a> It is a great thing to begin our spiritual life with certainty.<a name=332:21></a> If we begin in an uncertain way, we are likely to continue thus, like a reed shaken by the wind.<a name=332:22></a> Theophilus was written to by Luke with the express intent that he might be certain of the things that are "fully believed among us".<a name=332:23></a> And so God afforded these men certainty.<a name=332:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reading these scriptures I am thinking about guidance; they furnish instruction under this head, instruction that is needed particularly as the darkness thickens.<a name=357:1></a> Apart from the guidance indicated in these passages and others like them, we would miss our way and the favour of the present provision that God has made for His people, if not His purpose.<a name=357:2></a> We have to distinguish between the purpose of God "the eternal purpose", as it is said -- and His present provision, but for both we need guidance.<a name=357:3></a> I selected Matthew first because he introduces the subject in connection with what we may call the learned class, those occupying a more elevated position in human society, for God is no respecter of persons and He has the same light for all.<a name=357:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the guidance is from heaven; it is not the outcome of human culture or learning or study, it is furnished from heaven, for however much men may discover and read in the heavens, they have not put anything there.<a name=357:5></a> What is there is placed there of God, and so we find that there was a star called "his star".<a name=357:6></a> A light had been furnished according to the circumstances of those who were to be enlightened.<a name=357:7></a> God deigns to take account of our circumstances, and to meet us as we are, and to furnish light through that which we most readily understand.<a name=357:8></a> These wise men, as they are called, were accustomed to reading the heavens in their profession, and the shepherds were accustomed to the sheep and the countryside in their daily calling, and God gave each light according to their circumstances.<a name=357:9></a> We may be sure that if light be needed, the guidance is there, and it is there within our range; it is placed within our range

		according to our intelligence and understanding so as to leave us without excuse; so the star appeared to these wise men.<a name=358:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whether others saw it I know not.<a name=358:2></a> There is no evidence that it was specially for a few; it "was appearing" and God furnished it, so much so that it was known by these men as the star of the King; it was "his star".<a name=358:3></a> There was no question in their minds, and so assured were they that it was "his star" that they came in the direction it indicated to see Him.<a name=358:4></a> It was no mere curiosity; they came to worship Him, and they came devoid of all national feeling or prejudice.<a name=358:5></a> What tends to darken many is local or district feeling.<a name=358:6></a> But a star has nothing to do with those matters.<a name=358:7></a> A star is heavenly and its bearing is general, and so, those who followed the light it furnished recognised the "King of the Jews"; they said nothing about the Son of man but spoke of Him "that is born King of the Jews".<a name=358:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I just mention these things in a practical way, but I wish to show you how we may be diverted even though we may start out aright under heavenly guidance, for Christ must be ever the object of heaven's indications.<a name=358:9></a> As we see here, heaven was occupied with Him and all the light furnished from heaven had Him as its object.<a name=358:10></a> A sign had been brought in for men -- for the nation as in Matthew, for men as in Luke, for the family of God as in John.<a name=358:11></a> A sign had been brought in and so the light furnished has that blessed centre in view.<a name=358:12></a> So these men found their way, as being guided by the light, to Jerusalem.<a name=358:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, a remarkable situation existed there, such as christians have to do with in moving with the light.<a name=358:14></a> There is the official class and they have influence.<a name=358:15></a> You will observe the tidings brought by the wise men caused trouble to Herod and that the trouble extended; as we read, "and all Jerusalem with him", showing that when evil is active, although there may be local

	<div class="paragraph">
		feeling and prejudice against the ruling and official class, yet all that is submerged and the ruler's feelings prevail.<a name=359:1></a> It is remarkable at the present time that the official classes are coming specially under influences of opinion and their influence is prevalent.<a name=359:2></a> Why should they be troubled in regard to such a movement, a movement of worshippers -- men affected purely by the light of heaven and governed exclusively by that light.<a name=359:3></a> They had moved in it, and yet it causes trouble to Herod and to all Jerusalem with him.<a name=359:4></a> Then another feature comes out; this official class recognised the Scriptures in a way.<a name=359:5></a> Herod gathers together, as we are told, all the chief priests and the scribes; they are all at his call, and he enquires of them where the Christ should be born.<a name=359:6></a> You see how Scripture may become a blind as used by ungodly persons or those in an official position.<a name=359:7></a> We have to be on our guard, for how deceptive this was!<a name=359:8></a> Herod pretended to be governed by the dictates of Scripture.<a name=359:9></a> "Go", he says, "search out accurately concerning the child, and when ye shall have found him bring me back word, so that <i>I</i> also may come and do him homage".<a name=359:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the wise men moved toward Bethlehem.<a name=359:11></a> Divine light will not lead you in the way of the official class.<a name=359:12></a> There is no evidence that the star had led them to Jerusalem.<a name=359:13></a> We may learn from that how easily we slip off the divine highway, indicated by the heavenly light, by recognising what is historical, the position of Jerusalem.<a name=359:14></a> Heaven furnished the light, not Jerusalem.<a name=359:15></a> Matthew always makes a point of discrediting Jerusalem.<a name=359:16></a> If we are to be rightly in the assembly, we must read Matthew for he delivers us from what is traditional, from what has historical reputation, whether national or otherwise.<a name=359:17></a> He always emphasises heaven as taking precedence of earth and that light comes from heaven.<a name=359:18></a> So that as they moved towards Bethlehem the star went before them, and

		when they saw it they rejoiced with exceeding great joy as it stood over the place where the little Child was.<a name=360:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be there are those here who need such guidance.<a name=360:2></a> You love the Lord and the light of the Lord has come into your heart.<a name=360:3></a> As with the magi, the light may not be great but it involves that He was born, and that He was born King.<a name=360:4></a> So they sought Him, and as the star was over the place where the little Child was, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.<a name=360:5></a> It moves one to dwell on the fact of the work of God, for it was a sovereign act of God that He should intervene in this way, for could He not make a star that should suggest Christ?<a name=360:6></a> Why should He not make a star and cause it to appear so that it should suggest Christ to us?<a name=360:7></a> But it was"his star", and these wise men discerned it; they had no question about it, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.<a name=360:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may thank God we can get clear, even for a moment, of the official religious class.<a name=360:9></a> The wise men are out of the range of that class; they are away from them, and they are occupied with the King of the Jews.<a name=360:10></a> How different from Herod!<a name=360:11></a> The King of the Jews, but He is still a little Child, and they find Him in the house.<a name=360:12></a> It is all on a dignified plane in Matthew; it is not a manger but a house with Mary His mother.<a name=360:13></a> The little Child comes first, the mother comes second, whereas in Luke the shepherds find Joseph and Mary, but the wise men find the little Child and its mother, and having opened their treasures, they present to Him gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.<a name=360:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just dwell on these details, but what I want to come to particularly is this, that they depart to their own country another way.<a name=360:15></a> If you are clear of Herod, do not go back there; whatever you do, whatever way you take, do not go back that way.<a name=360:16></a> Now, that other way is left to you.<a name=360:17></a> It is not that your will is to come in and to choose one of your own, but the

		point is it is "another way".<a name=361:1></a> Many, alas!<a name=361:2></a> having got clear of Herod and Jerusalem, have gone back there.<a name=361:3></a> The other way is the way of faith.<a name=361:4></a> The word is ever, "Woe unto you".<a name=361:5></a> Woe unto you, towards officialism, towards the recognition of the religious order, towards Jerusalem.<a name=361:6></a> We are emphatically warned not to go that way.<a name=361:7></a> May God preserve us, dear brethren, enabling us to take the other way, that is to say, the spiritual way.<a name=361:8></a> The idea of the other way is found throughout Scripture.<a name=361:9></a> I refer particularly to Rahab; she illustrates it strikingly from James' point of view.<a name=361:10></a> She received the messengers, we are told.<a name=361:11></a> We have been noting the idea today of reception, and the reception of the messengers by Rahab is a striking illustration of the principle.<a name=361:12></a> She received the messengers, it is said.<a name=361:13></a> They were not spies in that respect, according to James; they were messengers; they represented Joshua, and Joshua represented God and the mind of God.<a name=361:14></a> There are such today, and we ought not to leave out or ignore the great principles of God, the principle of representation, the principle of a messenger, of one bearing tidings or trusts.<a name=361:15></a> They were like that, they were messengers and Rahab received them and concealed them with the stalks of flax which she had laid out on the roof to dry; that is to say, as over against her previous history, she was beginning to be spiritual.<a name=361:16></a> This flax was not spun or woven, it was in the making, it was spread out to be dried, but it was sufficient to conceal the messengers.<a name=361:17></a> Hiding is a great principle spiritually, but what I refer to is that she sent them forth another way.<a name=361:18></a> The way of God is not the ordinary way, the way of God is another way, not one, however, that leaves room for our wills or independency.<a name=361:19></a> It means it is not the natural human way, it is the way of faith.<a name=361:20></a> And so these wise men escaped the influence of Herod and they departed into their own country another way.<a name=361:21></a>

		I go on now to Luke for another view of this great subject, and what we find there is a different class.<a name=362:1></a> They are shepherds, that is, we have come down to a lower stratum of human society.<a name=362:2></a> It was a remarkable time; the chapter records that our Lord was born in Bethlehem.<a name=362:3></a> The cities were crowded with people but these shepherds were abiding in the field keeping watch over their flocks by night.<a name=362:4></a> They were occupied legitimately; they were occupied unselfishly; they were employed in the care of others, and that at the expense of themselves.<a name=362:5></a> We have been reading today of Jacob who tended cattle, and how that by night the frost consumed him, and the drought, too, by day.<a name=362:6></a> The tending of cattle is onerous service, but these shepherds were occupied unselfishly and at cost to themselves, and it says, "an angel of the Lord was there by them".<a name=362:7></a> It is a different view; it is not a star in the heavens.<a name=362:8></a> It is more honourable, it is a greater privilege to have an angel of the Lord, a living being, by you, than to see the light of a star.<a name=362:9></a> Such is the way of grace in Luke.<a name=362:10></a> "An angel of the Lord was there by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them".<a name=362:11></a> It is grace in a living Person coming to you where you are.<a name=362:12></a> He is there by you.<a name=362:13></a> Whether it be a saint or an angel, the principle is the same, indeed a saint by you is greater than an angel at the present time, for he is one indwelt by the Spirit of God able to convey to you something of Christ.<a name=362:14></a> "The glory of the Lord shone around them".<a name=362:15></a> Great things are portended.<a name=362:16></a> Then there is the word, "Fear not .<a name=362:17></a>.<a name=362:18></a>.<a name=362:19></a> for today a Saviour has been born to you".<a name=362:20></a> There is nothing like that to the wise men of the east; not a word is spoken to them as far as we know.<a name=362:21></a> They had guidance, they were given instruction, but these shepherds had guidance and they had light, the angel of the Lord being there by them.<a name=362:22></a> He came down to where they were, for such is grace; he was "there by them, and the glory of the Lord

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is how Luke presents it.<a name=363:2></a> It is not a question of getting rid of Jerusalem and bringing in the authority of heaven; it is a demonstration of the grace and sympathies of heaven, and that heaven thought of them: "today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord".<a name=363:3></a> Then we read, "suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host"; that is to say, heaven comes down in volume; such is heaven from Luke's point of view.<a name=363:4></a> You are not only to be led, you are to have understanding and feelings as to what heaven is.<a name=363:5></a> The multitude of the heavenly host would bring the very atmosphere of heaven down to these shepherds.<a name=363:6></a> What a scene!<a name=363:7></a> What interest heaven has in every one of us!<a name=363:8></a> It is to impress us that God would have us enlightened and understand what heaven's feelings are in regard of Christ and of ourselves: "to you".<a name=363:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The multitude of the heavenly host here are speaking about God.<a name=363:10></a> If you care to go among the multitude of God's people, that is what you will find.<a name=363:11></a> Normally they are occupied with God.<a name=363:12></a> "Glory to God": and that is one of the best signs you can get as to where Christ is, where He is revered.<a name=363:13></a> A company of God's people together are occupied with God, they are not occupied with the affairs of this world.<a name=363:14></a> There were many things going on.<a name=363:15></a> Caesar had decreed a census should be made.<a name=363:16></a> Matters of great importance were happening in the empire, but the heavenly host spoke about God and of glory to Him in the highest.<a name=363:17></a> Luke lifts us in that way.<a name=363:18></a> "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace".<a name=363:19></a> That would never come from Rome, however many times a census was made; Augustus could never bring in peace.<a name=363:20></a> If kings make a census of the population it is generally to find out the potential military power.<a name=363:21></a> That is not peace.<a name=363:22></a> "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth

		peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=364:1></a> The very atmosphere of heaven is brought down, as I said, and conveyed to these shepherds, and then as the angels were departing to heaven the shepherds moved with haste.<a name=364:2></a> The point is to move with the light.<a name=364:3></a> Great things are ahead of you, great things were ahead of these shepherds, and so they said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem", it was not simply that they said it in their hearts, but one to another.<a name=364:4></a> That is another feature of the people of God -- the mutual side; they speak to one another; that is to say, light having come in, let us move in it, and let us move in it now.<a name=364:5></a> Let us not delay.<a name=364:6></a> Whatever it be that God gives light about, let us move in it now.<a name=364:7></a> "Let us now go", they said one to another, "even unto Bethlehem".<a name=364:8></a> And they went and found exactly what the light indicated.<a name=364:9></a> If there are those here who need light, what I am saying is of the utmost importance.<a name=364:10></a> God graciously gives light, but the point is to move in it and now.<a name=364:11></a> "Let us now go", and they went, and it is said they "found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger".<a name=364:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can see these shepherds going into Bethlehem, not to high places.<a name=364:13></a> The wise men doubtless reached the court, and had an interview with Herod, but these men were not accustomed to kings' palaces and receptions by monarchs.<a name=364:14></a> They were rather accustomed to outhouses, to cattle houses, and that was where the Lord of glory was.<a name=364:15></a> Think of that!<a name=364:16></a> Divine guidance, therefore, does not lead us to the high places of this world, to the embellished buildings of this world.<a name=364:17></a> No, but to the back streets, it may be, and the outhouses.<a name=364:18></a> These shepherds made their way to Bethlehem; they would not go to the hotels or the fine residences, the light did not indicate anything like that, but a Babe in a manger, wrapped in swaddling-clothes.<a name=364:19></a> It was a sign; it is a small thing, a despised position, but divine light indicated

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to finish I go on to John, and as you might expect, guidance now is a question of life.<a name=365:3></a> It is no longer a little child, no longer a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, but it is a living Person here speaking Himself.<a name=365:4></a> We are on more mature ground now.<a name=365:5></a> It is a word for all of us, young and old.<a name=365:6></a> "I am the light of the world; he that follows me .<a name=365:7></a>.<a name=365:8></a>.<a name=365:9></a> shall have the light of life".<a name=365:10></a> He Himself is now the guide.<a name=365:11></a> It is not simply a guide to Him now; He is going somewhere.<a name=365:12></a> In Matthew and Luke He had come in from heaven and heaven was pointing to Him, but now He is going out.<a name=365:13></a> John always has in view that He is going out of this world.<a name=365:14></a> He is going somewhere, but then He is on the way and that way is to be strewn with life, the <i>light of life</i>.<a name=365:15></a>

		If you go as a pioneer to any new country, you must be governed by this principle or you will die.<a name=365:16></a> Pioneers follow the life lines in all new countries; they take the line of the rivers which are the life lines of any country, that is to say, the influence of the rivers produces life.<a name=365:17></a> I am speaking of the thing literally, but many spiritually take the desert where there is no water.<a name=365:18></a> You do not want that; you want the line of life, and the Lord says that if you follow Him that is what you will get.<a name=365:19></a> "He that follows me .<a name=365:20></a>.<a name=365:21></a>.<a name=365:22></a> shall have the light of life".<a name=365:23></a> The life always moves and produces results, and these are to be the guides, so that in John it is a question of discovering where the life is.<a name=365:24></a> A single eye following the Lord Jesus will result in this, that you will have the light of life, you will find those in whom the Spirit of God is working, you will be led there, you will not be led into any sterile plain, into any association in which the Spirit of God is not operating.<a name=365:25></a>

		What makes room from John's point of view for the Spirit of God is the commandments.<a name=366:1></a> The great drift has been away from the commandments of the Lord, and so He says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>.<a name=366:2></a> That is to say, you have a manifestation of Christ through the commandments, then the Holy Spirit will operate in relation to that manifestation and there will be an enlargement of it, a working out of it, so that it gives character to the saints.<a name=366:3></a> That is life.<a name=366:4></a> Hence if you are single-eyed and seek the Lord you will find life, the light of life, you will find those in whom the Spirit of God has room to act.<a name=366:5></a> Where the commandments are not kept the Holy Spirit is shut out; you cannot associate the Spirit of God with a lawless course whether individual or in any collective way.<a name=366:6></a> The commandments must first come before we can have the action of the Spirit, and the action of the Spirit means life, "the Spirit is life", and you have positive evidence of life in following the Lord.<a name=366:7></a> So that, as He says here, "He that follows me .<a name=366:8></a>.<a name=366:9></a>.<a name=366:10></a> shall have the light of life".<a name=366:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=380:1></a> I thought we might be helped in seeing the formation that takes place in the early chapters of Exodus, leading up to the collective features spoken of in chapter 12 where we have the assembly spoken of.<a name=380:2></a> In verse 3 of that chapter it says, "Speak unto all the assembly of Israel", and again in verse 6, "the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel".<a name=380:3></a> Perhaps the Lord may help us to see, in the meetings we may have, that the believer goes out of Egypt, as formed of God in some degree, not only as an individual unit, but as belonging to a corporate whole spoken of in chapter 12 as an assembly.<a name=380:4></a> The two words used in that chapter are very significant.<a name=380:5></a> The word 'assembly' describes the corporate idea -- the sense of responsibility corporately, and the word 'congregation' is inclusive of all the members of it -- all the persons -- <i>each one</i> having a responsibility.<a name=380:6></a> So that we go out in the presence of the power of evil that is already organised.<a name=380:7></a> These early chapters show us what was in the mind of God initially, in Exodus, and how it was portrayed in Moses; the spirit which is suitable to us as going out of the world is portrayed in Moses, in the leader.<a name=380:8></a> The book begins with the names, "These are the names of the sons of Israel who had come into Egypt; with Jacob had they come, each with his household", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#1:1">Exodus  1:1</a>.<a name=380:9></a> God thus indicates at the very outset the dignity of His people as "sons of Israel"; it is a spiritual designation.<a name=380:10></a> Then we see that in coming in, they come in as Jacob came in, that is, under divine direction.<a name=380:11></a> He was the depositary of the promises of God and they came in with him.<a name=380:12></a> They were related to the vessel in whom the light was, and in whom the

		J.T.<a name=425:15></a> Yes.<a name=425:16></a> Now, what may be noted in chapter 12 is the word 'assembly'.<a name=425:17></a> In the New Translation you will see it in verses 3 and 6.<a name=425:18></a> In verse 3 it reads, "Speak unto all the assembly of Israel", and in verse 6, "Ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; and the whole congregation of the <i>assembly</i> of Israel shall kill it".<a name=425:19></a> That is to say, you have two words: the word 'assembly', which is explained in the footnote as a corporate whole in which there is responsibility.<a name=425:20></a> The word 'congregation', which is said to mean that the whole is involved, only in its individual members.<a name=425:21></a> So that what we see here is that God has led His people up to the idea of a corporate whole; the young believer now begins to take his place in relation to the whole as responsible.<a name=425:22></a> There is the responsible whole, and then that I am a unit in it, but with my individual responsibility.<a name=425:23></a> That is what the word 'congregation' implies.<a name=425:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=433:1></a> These divine appearings, given to faith in Genesis and later, are of special importance to us as in the period of faith, the means of these divine manifestations being now in the Spirit.<a name=433:2></a> They are not now angelic as of old; to us they are spiritual, not exactly miraculous, as in these cases, but nevertheless they are real, and are intended to make us spiritual and to impress us with what is divine.<a name=433:3></a> They would make us substantial in our testimony, that is to say, spiritual as to the element of obedience; so that these manifestations, or appearings, or impressions, should be ensured to us.<a name=433:4></a> It says here, that "he left off talking with him; and God went up from Abraham" (verse 22).<a name=433:5></a> Then what follows in the chapter beings out Abraham's implicit obedience in carrying out what was said to him by God, in regard to circumcision, in the very letter of it, not only as to himself, but as to Ishmael and all the men of his house.<a name=433:6></a> Now in that household, typically, the flesh was wholly disallowed, and room was made for the Spirit.<a name=433:7></a> Circumcision is not in the letter now, but in the Spirit.<a name=433:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=434:3></a> Yes, and both levels apply to us.<a name=434:4></a> There is what is here in the way of testimony; divine order is to be seen in a public way; so that we have a great deal in Corinthians in the way of instructions.<a name=434:5></a> Certain provisions were given before the apostle left them; he wrote others, and prayed that they might keep them; then he would give them further directions when he should come back.<a name=434:6></a> There are three revelations spoken of.<a name=434:7></a> That is the prominent feature in Corinth, and therefore all that relates to what God has here before men in a public way; that belongs to the side of things which we were calling 'lower', not in the sense of coming down to man's level, but in contrast to the 'upper' level, which has more to do with the work of God universally.<a name=434:8></a> The lower level is local; it is in localities we look for public order.<a name=434:9></a> In the universal aspect, there is one body, one hope, one calling, and all culminates for God, as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>.<a name=434:10></a> We begin with the local company, but where we end is a question of spiritual power.<a name=434:11></a> Eternity, really, is the objective; the "calling on high of God in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:14">Philippians  3:14</a>.<a name=434:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=435:10></a> I thought so, from the bringing in of circumcision at that point in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17">Genesis  17</a>; so that Abraham might have part with Him.<a name=435:11></a> He recognises God as moving on, and if we are to have part in this, we must disallow the flesh.<a name=435:12></a> Colossians would show that that is a very effective circumcision, "in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ" (chapter 2: 11); Abraham, too, goes in for the thing fully.<a name=435:13></a> God is not going on with the flesh; He has dealt with it fully in the death of Christ.<a name=435:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#19:1">1 Samuel  19:1</a> - 24
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Samuel contemplates the testimony of God as in the vessels taken up for it and in peculiarly close contact with opposition.<a name=485:1></a> It contemplates opposition at a distance, such as artillery warfare, but it also contemplates immediate contact with the enemy; and this latter is the great feature in this book.<a name=485:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book begins with Hannah who was in peculiarly close contact with her adversary.<a name=485:3></a> Peninnah is definitely called her adversary, one with whom she lived every day.<a name=485:4></a> And she made her opposition felt; she had an advantage.<a name=485:5></a> The Lord sometimes allows peculiar advantage to the opposition, to the enemy, so that Peninnah bitterly assailed Hannah -- Hannah being childless, and she the mother of children.<a name=485:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book thus begins, and the principle is carried right through to the last chapter where you see the great enemy, Saul, overthrown.<a name=485:7></a> That is what I have in mind particularly, to connect it with spiritual conditions, to show how opposition is negatived in and by spiritual conditions.<a name=485:8></a> Christianity is intended to set out what is spiritual.<a name=485:9></a> Above all the dispensations of God, this dispensation is intended to portray what is spiritual, and emphasis is therefore laid on spirituality in the New Testament: "the spiritual discerns all things, and <i>he</i> is discerned of no one", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:15">1 Corinthians  2:15</a>.<a name=485:10></a> He has a peculiar advantage: he is in a unique position.<a name=485:11></a> So that the final negation of opposition to truth is seen in the spiritual.<a name=485:12></a> They do not need to resort to violence; the power of spirituality effects the overthrow of opposition without violence.<a name=485:13></a> So that Romans gives this feature: "If

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show from this scripture the kind of instrumentality God employs leading up to spirituality for the defeat of opposition.<a name=486:3></a> The chapter is marked by the most virulent opposition.<a name=486:4></a> Saul, being in supreme control of things, spoke to his son Jonathan, and his servants, that they should kill David.<a name=486:5></a> There was no concealment of his mind.<a name=486:6></a> I want to show how God meets that in certain instrumentalities leading up to spirituality, the final weapon, in His hand, for the nullification of opposition.<a name=486:7></a> There is the idea in Scripture of things being swallowed up, and I hope to show that opposition is entirely overwhelmed by spirituality.<a name=486:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Acts we have the antitype of all this.<a name=486:9></a> In chapter 5, the enemy assailed the position of christianity in Ananias and Sapphira, two covetous persons, two lying persons; that was met effectually.<a name=486:10></a> Then we find the high priests, supported by the infidel Sadducees who do not believe in the resurrection, laying their hands on the apostles and putting them in prison.<a name=486:11></a> The first instrumentality that God uses is angelic.<a name=486:12></a> The angel came and opened the doors of the prison that night, and led them forth saying, "Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:20">Acts  5:20</a>.<a name=486:13></a> Sure enough in the morning they were at their work.<a name=486:14></a> After a night in the prison, possibly without a seat even, they come out and are early in the morning in the temple announcing and teaching all the words of Jesus.<a name=486:15></a> This is discovered by the officers and they send and take them again.<a name=486:16></a> Angelic ministry has done its part, the roar of Satan has been heard -- but presently we are told they did not bring them with violence this time for they feared the people; that

		In the type here, the testimony in the very closest contact with the opposition goes through.<a name=487:19></a> How the very personnel of the opposition, all the organisation of the opposition, becomes the instrumentalities for the protection of the testimony so that it goes right through!<a name=487:20></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=488>[Page 488]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we can rely on.<a name=488:1></a> There are lovers of Christ in the organisations around us.<a name=488:2></a> There are two things that should be noted: that God operates in spite of adverse conditions, and because of favourable or suitable conditions.<a name=488:3></a> He operates in spite of hostility, and also because of favourable conditions.<a name=488:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here He operates in spite of adverse conditions the first, a lover of Christ in adverse conditions.<a name=488:5></a> Again I ask, is there one here like that -- Jonathan was in the house of Saul and he was a lover of David.<a name=488:6></a> He undertakes to speak to Saul about him -- no hardship to speak of one he loved.<a name=488:7></a> If you love Christ, it is no hardship to speak of Him even to an enemy.<a name=488:8></a> Jonathan was a true lover of David; Michal was a selfish lover.<a name=488:9></a> Jonathan loved David for his own sake.<a name=488:10></a> It says, after David had slain Goliath, and after he ceased speaking to Saul, Jonathan loved David as his own soul.<a name=488:11></a> A fine expression!<a name=488:12></a> That love remained all his life.<a name=488:13></a> A true lover of David in every association, and in these associations he is not ashamed to speak well of David.<a name=488:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So he says to David, "My father seeks to kill thee".<a name=488:15></a> One of the most painful things among the brethren is concealment.<a name=488:16></a> Jonathan was open.<a name=488:17></a> A true mark of spiritual formation is that one is open and transparent.<a name=488:18></a> He says to David, "My father seeks to kill thee".<a name=488:19></a> He knew what was in his father's mind.<a name=488:20></a> There is no concealment, young people, of the opposition to Christ in what is around us.<a name=488:21></a> It is blatant.<a name=488:22></a> They deny His divinity.<a name=488:23></a> There is murderous opposition.<a name=488:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Jonathan under God's hand became the means of David's preservation.<a name=488:25></a> He spoke well of David to his father.<a name=488:26></a> Do you ever speak well of Christ in that way to His enemies?<a name=488:27></a> A beautiful speech Jonathan made: he commends him.<a name=488:28></a> God reckons on everything that may be conducive for the testimony to go through.<a name=488:29></a> Whether it be the enmity of Saul or

		Jonathan's love, God uses both that the testimony should go through.<a name=489:1></a> God uses everyday experience.<a name=489:2></a> Can He use it?<a name=489:3></a> If He can, let Him use it.<a name=489:4></a> Jonathan prevails, and Saul says, "He shall not be slain".<a name=489:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next feature is that there was war again.<a name=489:6></a> We need never expect to be free from war, nor be afraid.<a name=489:7></a> Samuel represents the testimony militant.<a name=489:8></a> Abigail speaks of David fighting the battles of the Lord.<a name=489:9></a> We want our names in the book of life.<a name=489:10></a> We want our names also in the book of the wars of the Lord.<a name=489:11></a> David had a very great place in that book.<a name=489:12></a> He fought the battles of the Lord.<a name=489:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So here one of the battles takes place and one can understand how this war would be recorded in the book of the wars of the Lord.<a name=489:14></a> David had a great victory.<a name=489:15></a> He smote the Philistines, and they fled from him.<a name=489:16></a> They mean men of big position here, men of culture, men of standing in a worldly way.<a name=489:17></a> Here was a stripling, but he had overthrown the leader of the Philistines, and now he fought them so that they fled.<a name=489:18></a> This again brings in the wrath of the enemy.<a name=489:19></a> Let us not be oblivious of the opposition to the true testimony of the Lord, to the true vessels that He employs, to His love, to His counsel.<a name=489:20></a> The opposition is unceasing.<a name=489:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now Saul is sitting in his house, and David is playing.<a name=489:22></a> See the proximity of the vessel of the testimony to the arch-enemy of it.<a name=489:23></a> Saul had a javelin in his hand, sitting in his house.<a name=489:24></a> He did not need it there.<a name=489:25></a> There was Christ typically before him.<a name=489:26></a> The evil spirit was operating in his heart.<a name=489:27></a> "And David played with his hand".<a name=489:28></a> Saul had in mind to smite him to the wall.<a name=489:29></a> No doubt he wanted to fasten him with a spear to the wall so that his escape would be impossible.<a name=489:30></a> This is another thing we should take notice of -- the agility of the testimony, of what is of God.<a name=489:31></a> David is nimble, and God uses that agility.<a name=489:32></a> He fled: he got out of the way.<a name=489:33></a> It is a great thing,

		John here, was in a true position for leadership; he "was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus", and he was there as their brother and companion in tribulation, and he became "in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=505:6></a> I believe the "Lord's day" in Revelation, suggests to us what the Lord has done for us in these last days.<a name=505:7></a> He has not publicly intervened in the regulation of the world yet.<a name=505:8></a> His object for the moment is to look after His people, the assembly, and He has intervened in the course of this world to make a way for us.<a name=505:9></a> It is the Lord's day; it refers to the day in which <i>He</i> is dominant.<a name=505:10></a> It may be said that He is not dominant in the world, but He certainly is acting dominantly in christendom, as this book shows, and He has made a way for us.<a name=505:11></a> "I have set before thee an opened door", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a>.<a name=505:12></a> He has done that, and it has caused a mighty movement in christendom covering a long period of time; but He has done it, and John on this day is "in the Spirit", as if he is free to be abstracted.<a name=505:13></a> It is right to be free to be in the Spirit whenever possible.<a name=505:14></a> The realm of the Spirit is wonderful!<a name=505:15></a> It was not simply that he had the Spirit, or that he walked in the Spirit, but he was <i>in the Spirit</i> in the sense of being in the realm of the Spirit, and he was wholly absorbed in that realm on the Lord's day.<a name=505:16></a> The Lord's day and the Spirit go together.<a name=505:17></a> The Lord's day means that the Lord has intervened for us and has made a way

		John was in this state, and he heard a voice behind him like a trumpet.<a name=506:7></a> Why should John be disturbed?<a name=506:8></a> I do not suppose he ever complained about the disturbance: the voice of Jesus could never be a disturbance to be complained about by John.<a name=506:9></a> It may be a disturbance to some of us, who are in worldly associations, but the voice of Jesus, even when like a trumpet, would never be regarded by John as a disturbance.<a name=506:10></a> And there were words in the voice, which was behind: "What thou seest write in a book, and send to the seven assemblies".<a name=506:11></a> And then he turns to see the voice -- a remarkable expression -- and he saw the Lord, not in habiliments that belong properly to heaven or heavenly associations, but in habiliments that refer to a state of things here that needed to be dealt with judicially; it is that to which I would call attention.<a name=506:12></a> If we are to go forward spiritually, it is important not to ignore conditions that exist, for the Lord will call us back if we do.<a name=506:13></a> People who pretend to go forward spiritually, and ignore conditions locally or generally, will soon hear a trumpet voice <i>behind</i>, as if the Lord

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking, dear brethren, of 'energy'.<a name=537:1></a> The fact that these mighty men of David come in at the end of David's reign in this second book of Samuel is to remind us obviously that there was no one throughout that reign whose service was omitted.<a name=537:2></a> The energy that marked David's helpers as seen in these mighty men has all been taken account of in divine record.<a name=537:3></a> For God writes up His people and no one is omitted, so there is every incentive to devotedness from that viewpoint.<a name=537:4></a> God is always particular to assure us that there is no forgetfulness in Him.<a name=537:5></a> Think of that register in heaven where all our names are written!<a name=537:6></a> In Revelation we have no one omitted we read of all who took part in the tribulation, and then all these have part in the first resurrection.<a name=537:7></a> So whilst the list of the 'mightier' in Chronicles is at the beginning of David's reign, the list here is at the end; so that the whole devotedness throughout is taken account of.<a name=537:8></a> We get certain mention of mighties in Philippians who might have not been remembered, but their names are written down.<a name=537:9></a> So again there is no omission with God.<a name=537:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I speak of devotedness I mean that all the resources, whatever we may have, are to be dedicated and made effective by energy.<a name=537:11></a> The resources are devoted to us for use; so these mighties represent strength and the right use of it.<a name=537:12></a> We see that their strength was not misspent, and for that they had to understand what David valued.<a name=537:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For instance, we have in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:44">Matthew  13:44</a>, the idea of the treasure.<a name=538:3></a> It was found in a field and hidden in a field.<a name=538:4></a> We are not told the extent of the treasure -- it may have been gold, but there was one who could value it and so the whole field was bought to secure it.<a name=538:5></a> Then we have the merchant seeking beautiful pearls and then he finds one pearl of great value and sells all that he might purchase it.<a name=538:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the early part of the Acts the numbers converted are given.<a name=538:7></a> It is right to number converts but if we go too far on that line we shall do as David did, but the Lord numbers them.<a name=538:8></a> There is no need to think that in heaven there will not be enough room for everyone -- there will!<a name=538:9></a> There are great numbers in heaven already; we read of great numbers of angels round about the throne.<a name=538:10></a> So that there is no danger of inflation with regard to numbers -- the more the better, but there is great danger in occupation with numbers.<a name=538:11></a> So in the Acts, although there the feature was numbers, there is no evidence of inflation.<a name=538:12></a> I think it was a question of the treasure coming to light.<a name=538:13></a> The Lord was beginning to get the benefit of His treasure.<a name=538:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the apostle Paul there is little enough said about numbers, but Paul was a true evangelist.<a name=538:15></a> His one idea was the 'church'.<a name=538:16></a> This was because he was near enough to Christ to know the value of things -- that is to apprehend the value of the pearl.<a name=538:17></a> The man who understands what is nearest to the heart of Christ is the man with the greatest power.<a name=538:18></a> The man who preaches in order to get converts may get them, but he may leave them without getting them near to Christ.<a name=538:19></a> The espousal must take place.<a name=538:20></a> Paul could say, "I have espoused you to one husband", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:2">2 Corinthians  11:2</a>.<a name=538:21></a> Until the marriage in that sense has taken

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So to return to these three mighties of whom we have read, they have in view this feature which is to run through the dispensation.<a name=539:2></a> According to this passage they came to David at the harvest time.<a name=539:3></a> This is very significant, and the thought is carried on in John's gospel in the fourth chapter when the Samaritan woman has met with the Lord; the Lord says to His disciples, "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest", <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:35">John  4:35</a>.<a name=539:4></a> So it is still harvest time.<a name=539:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we are told that David was in the cave of Adullam.<a name=539:6></a> That is to say the place of rejection, but it was also a stronghold -- that would suggest fellowship.<a name=539:7></a> Then we have the camp of the Philistines who were in possession of the well; then next, the longing of the heart of David.<a name=539:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus all things are plainly set out, the time of year, the position of David, the position of the Philistines and the position of the well.<a name=539:9></a> All this is very important.<a name=539:10></a> Then one thought that the three chiefs were symbolical of something that was intended to run through the dispensation, devotedness and the power to break through.<a name=539:11></a> It is not a question here of being great in exploits and killing Philistines.<a name=539:12></a> The killing is not of the same value as breaking through them and obtaining what is dear to the heart of David; that is for us, what is dear to the heart of Christ!<a name=539:13></a> The point was to reach the thing David's heart longed for and to bring it back.<a name=539:14></a> It is said, "these things did these three mighty men", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:17">2 Samuel  23:17</a>.<a name=539:15></a> The point is, they were such men; it is something positive and so pleasing to their master that he pours it out upon the ground to Jehovah.<a name=539:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think the position is clear (and in any devoted service it is well to understand the position).<a name=539:17></a> Whilst the Lord has the whole field, He knows where
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=540>[Page 540]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the treasure is, or as has been said, where the fish are and where the sheep are.<a name=540:1></a> He knows where the gold is too, and where the excellent things are!<a name=540:2></a> So you find in the beginning of the Bible that a river flowed out of Eden having four heads.<a name=540:3></a> It is a universal thing and the effect of the flowing out of these streams is to search out what is in the land.<a name=540:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whilst the whole field, as I said, is required by the Lord, He knows where the things are that He seeks.<a name=540:5></a> It says of Havilah that "the gold of that land is good", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:12">Genesis  2:12</a>.<a name=540:6></a> Also bdellium and the onyx stone are there!<a name=540:7></a> This is a reference to the field where the gold is, and bdellium is and the onyx stone.<a name=540:8></a> We find in the course of Scripture how these things were used.<a name=540:9></a> For instance, the woods that were used in the temple, the precious stones, and also the gold.<a name=540:10></a> All was overlaid with gold -- this was a question of dignity.<a name=540:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we can see we have the suggestion of the position of things in Genesis.<a name=540:12></a> The Lord knows where the members for His church are.<a name=540:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I am subject to the Lord, I shall serve under His direction and I shall go where <i>He</i> sends me.<a name=540:14></a> Hence with Paul's service.<a name=540:15></a> I was speaking just now of having devotedness and energy.<a name=540:16></a> The next thing is that it should be rightly used as coming under the Lord's direction.<a name=540:17></a> Then we shall find what is dearest to the Lord's heart, and that means breaking through the host.<a name=540:18></a> It is no easy path; it entails rejection and suffering.<a name=540:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In turning to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15">Romans  15</a>we find Paul had never been to Rome but he had it in his mind to go, and meanwhile he wanted them to have a right example.<a name=540:20></a> So he begins to say, as you will observe in verse 15: "But I have written to you the more boldly, brethren, in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace given to me by God, for me to be minister of Christ Jesus".<a name=540:21></a> He was about to speak of himself so that they might see in him the grace that was given to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After he had left Corinth, you will remember the rule of rivals arose, a terrible thing!<a name=541:2></a> So he sent Timotheus to them that they might have in him the positive evidence of his ways as they were of Christ.<a name=541:3></a> So it is in every local meeting, these rivals will have to face this young brother -- Timotheus.<a name=541:4></a> But in the second epistle Paul was able to bring before them real christianity, for they were now able to accept it.<a name=541:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul goes on to say in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15">Romans  15</a>"For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for the obedience of the nations, by word or deed, in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ" (verses 18, 19).<a name=541:6></a> He had fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ!<a name=541:7></a> Now we are in the presence of a real mighty man and it is well that we should look on this picture divinely given here.<a name=541:8></a> It is not a question of what Paul might have been as a natural man.<a name=541:9></a> It was what he had acquired as being near to Christ and as coming under His direction.<a name=541:10></a> But what had it cost him?<a name=541:11></a> He refers to the power that had marked his ministry "in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ".<a name=541:12></a> Now look at that!<a name=541:13></a> Think of the extent of his service!<a name=541:14></a> Think of the number of visitations he would have to have, and the prayers, and sufferings and stripes!<a name=541:15></a> What was all this for?<a name=541:16></a> He was breaking through the host of the Philistines to get the bride of Christ.<a name=541:17></a> The gospel had been served for that, because he had the church in his mind.<a name=541:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=544:10></a> Just so, but the thought is seen in its full bearing and effect as God is with them.<a name=544:11></a> So it especially comes out in Matthew, "Emmanuel, .<a name=544:12></a>.<a name=544:13></a>.<a name=544:14></a> God with us".<a name=544:15></a> God's mind in testimony is effective as He is with us.<a name=544:16></a> In the creation itself, although working on its own impetus as a clock, it is not so kept going and made effective, except as God is in it.<a name=544:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=545:12></a> Yes, and as we apprehend this, we apprehend all His communications.<a name=545:13></a> In His ministry He was not like a recluse or a monk; what we get with Christ is constant movement; He was constantly teaching, and His movements exemplified what He taught.<a name=545:14></a> In that way results are produced according to the pattern presented.<a name=545:15></a> Christianity is intended to be characterised throughout by divine incoming.<a name=545:16></a> Christ is livingly in the testimony.<a name=545:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=546:10></a> An inward journey now; there are two positions in that respect, Matthew and Luke.<a name=546:11></a> In Matthew you take the journey, you agonise before the Lord, and He gives you to understand that if you are to get your message you must get it there.<a name=546:12></a> He says, "There they shall see me".<a name=546:13></a> If you seek to get your service from the Lord you have to see Him.<a name=546:14></a> Well, you go, and you wonder what it is going to be.<a name=546:15></a> You could say many things, give old sermons over again, that is simple; but that is not this.<a name=546:16></a> This is how you have to get it from the Lord.<a name=546:17></a> You may have your own thoughts, but if you see Him He conveys to you that He approves, and as you begin to minister it enlarges, because he is standing in relation to it.<a name=546:18></a>

		In Luke there is no journey; He says, "Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem".<a name=546:19></a> While we tarry we might say to ourselves, 'Why in the city of Jerusalem?<a name=546:20></a>' Because your soul becomes imbued with the sense of the grace of God which would lead you into such a wicked place, before saying anything about the remission of sins.<a name=546:21></a> "Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=546:22></a> They were to tarry there until the Spirit came down; it is not our exercise or activity but we wait on the Spirit.<a name=546:23></a> As regards service, in Luke while you tarry, you would be imbued with a sense of grace, and the Holy Spirit

		Well, now I want to show how Exodus opens up this thought, and it is notable that the princes, typically persons of spiritual wealth and power, furnish the stones, the onyx and other stones, to be set.<a name=557:8></a> Precious stones are of enhanced value as they are set where they can be seen, where they can reflect, indeed, in their own peculiar way, the action of light.<a name=557:9></a> Now I mention the princes because God would urge the thought of our having spiritual means.<a name=557:10></a> The material poverty that is growing out of the present world-wide conditions should work spiritual wealth in the people of God, so that we read that "their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their free-hearted liberality", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:2">2 Corinthians  8:2</a>.<a name=557:11></a> We are apt to rest in our poverty, and speak of it, and act in it; whereas, material poverty or stress is intended to promote spiritual wealth and liberality.<a name=557:12></a> That is what it is for.<a name=557:13></a> So the present widespread pressure in the world will act as discipline from God, which the saints of God -- and only the saints of God -- can understand, and as they understand and accept the discipline, it is sure to work out in spiritual wealth.<a name=557:14></a> Therefore, whatever prognostications may be made as to change in these conditions externally, there can be no doubt, beloved, of a good year ahead of us spiritually.<a name=557:15></a> I have no doubt of that, and that is the whole matter.<a name=557:16></a> Everything portends a good spiritual

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I refer to these princes, and in referring to them in Exodus, I am not overlooking what has often been noted, that Exodus takes into account all the saints in the giving.<a name=558:3></a> Chronicles emphasises the giving of the king but Exodus includes all, so that everyone may contribute to the tabernacle, but yet there is the reference to the princes.<a name=558:4></a> However the saints are viewed as the work of God, there is always the idea of the prince.<a name=558:5></a> A prince is one who has more.<a name=558:6></a> If there is to be envy, let it be a holy envy.<a name=558:7></a> The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians to provoke them to jealousy, and he spoke to the Romans of the same thing, but of a <i>holy</i> jealousy; that is to say, if my brother has spiritual means, why not I?<a name=558:8></a> God would call my attention to him; not that I should seek that he should be diminished in his wealth, but that I should be increased in my wealth.<a name=558:9></a> It is holy envy, if you will allow me to express it.<a name=558:10></a> Why should I not increase my wealth if the means be available?<a name=558:11></a> I am but a sluggard if I do not.<a name=558:12></a> If the Macedonians gave more liberally than the Corinthians, why should it be?<a name=558:13></a> God would stir us up.<a name=558:14></a> I am not speaking of material things, for the moment, beloved, but of spiritual; that there might be princes among us, princely men -- not those who take the position at all, but those who are it -- whose princely holdings prove that they are princes.<a name=558:15></a>

		Now, in speaking of the body, I have especially in mind to speak about the assembly as such.<a name=564:13></a> The body, of course, is the assembly.<a name=564:14></a> It is one phase of it, but when we come down to the last verse read, the word is "assembly", not 'body'.<a name=564:15></a> The word 'assembly' properly means those that are called out -- called-out ones.<a name=564:16></a> Is there anyone here tonight who is professedly a believer in Christ and not called out of the world?<a name=564:17></a> The basis of Corinthians is "called out" persons, persons called "saints", God having called us as He called out of the tabernacle.<a name=564:18></a> He is calling every day, constantly calling every day: "Come out of her, my people".<a name=564:19></a> That is the call, and so in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a>: "Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not what is unclean, and <i>I</i> will receive you".<a name=564:20></a> That is
