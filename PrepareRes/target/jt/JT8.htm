		I thought it might help us to have our attention called to the Spirit's activities in the saints as adjusting our souls, so that we might know relief and satisfaction culminating in eternal life.<a name=1:1></a> That is what comes out in chapter 4.<a name=1:2></a> And then, further, to see how the Spirit acts from the heavenly side in order to bring in the influence of heaven here.<a name=1:3></a> That is chapter 7.<a name=1:4></a> These two sides present the Spirit's work at the present moment.<a name=1:5></a> We have to notice that what we get in chapter 4 is the result of an administration committed to the Son.<a name=1:6></a> "The Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hand".<a name=1:7></a> Then chapter 7 is the result of Christ being glorified.<a name=1:8></a> He goes up to heaven and sends the Spirit here so that there might be the influence of heaven here.<a name=1:9></a> Thus the superiority of the heavenly is seen; it is to influence all.<a name=1:10></a> This is indicated in chapter 3 in the remarks of John the baptist.<a name=1:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 7 brings in the levitical idea as developed in the book of Joshua, whereas chapter 4 is more connected with Numbers.<a name=1:12></a> Joshua gives you the privileged family, the heavenly family in type, and you see them distributed throughout all the tribes of Israel.<a name=1:13></a> They have cities allotted to them in all the tribes; they are distributed throughout the whole inheritance, and in that way a heavenly influence is secured and diffused through all.<a name=1:14></a> I think that is the idea connected with <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>.<a name=1:15></a> What the Lord proposes in chapter 4 meets all our need, and is the result of an administration between divine Persons; the Father commits all things into the hand of the Son, and the Son proposes to give living water to any one who asks of Him, so that he may never thirst for ever.<a name=1:16></a> It is a final solution of the whole question of man's need in mind and affection.<a name=1:17></a> Hence chapter 4 runs pretty

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:22">John  20:22</a>, where we have "Receive the Holy Spirit", it is no question of our need; it is the Spirit of the heavenly Man that is breathed.<a name=2:2></a> It is a most intimate transaction to be breathed into, and conveys quite a different thought to drinking of living water.<a name=2:3></a> His breathing into them in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>was to give them an income equal to their dignity.<a name=2:4></a> Chapter 4 is like <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:22">Romans  6:22</a>; "having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life".<a name=2:5></a> As away from God, one's affections have been scattered hither and thither with a view to corrupt gratification, just as with the poor woman in this chapter, but the Lord proposes to give her living water so that her affections may be gathered up and directed <i>upward</i>.<a name=2:6></a> One must first be satisfied in mind and affection before one can know eternal life.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think one ought to make it clear that eternal life is enjoyed over Jordan, but before one can know eternal life one must be satisfied and at rest in mind and affections.<a name=2:8></a> This woman had been grossly irregular; her affections had gone out with a view to corrupt gratification, but the Lord shows that His proposal of living water would bring in a solution of her case which should be permanent.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we speak of <i>over Jordan</i> we speak of what lies outside human relationships; we are entitled to be there because of the death of Christ.<a name=2:10></a> We are apt to live in nature, but the Lord would lift us outside of nature.<a name=2:11></a> John's way of presenting eternal life is by showing that certain things have to be overcome in the mind and affections, and by that means you are placed over Jordan; you are lifted above natural things and relationships.<a name=2:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		John's presentation of Christ corresponds to the position of the sun set in the physical heavens; it

		is set there to control things, and to regulate things, and to set things in movement.<a name=3:1></a> So Christ is the One who sets things in movement divinely; it is in the way of impulse; He gives impulse.<a name=3:2></a> If Christ moves, others move, but they move under His influence.<a name=3:3></a> You get it set forth in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>; the two disciples are first attracted to Christ, and they follow Him; they are set in movement; and then in their turn they affect others.<a name=3:4></a> Andrew finds his brother Simon, and he follows, and then others, too, are drawn after Christ.<a name=3:5></a> The point was "Come and see".<a name=3:6></a> So here in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, when the woman is set free herself, she is set in movement and attracts others to Christ; "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?<a name=3:7></a>" It is intrinsic to the living water that it gives satisfaction; the mind is satisfied; the affections are satisfied.<a name=3:8></a> It is a great thing to have permanent satisfaction for your affections.<a name=3:9></a> The Lord proposes to give what will bring deliverance from sin and give permanent satisfaction to the affections.<a name=3:10></a> Then another great gain is that one is relieved from the pressure of death.<a name=3:11></a> Before the gain of eternal life can be known we must know what it is not to thirst.<a name=3:12></a> Most of us live in nature; we are ruled by nature and are content with natural relationships; but God brings in a new rule which is outside nature; He brings us under a new control, and that is proposed in the gift of living water; it springs up to eternal life.<a name=3:13></a> Natural relationships are right, but they must be held and regulated by the law of new creation; there is no other law for the Christian.<a name=3:14></a> A man who is over Jordan will be a better husband and father than one who is not, for you fulfil every right relation here, whilst living in your affections outside of them; you are not detained by them, and you are set free from the fear of death as to them.<a name=3:15></a> Whilst there is the fear of death you are not free for new creation.<a name=3:16></a> The great defect with

	<div class="paragraph">
		What the Lord proposes is to give living water which should spring up to eternal life, so that the soul should be brought into the knowledge of the only true God, and of the true Man, a Man here who was entirely for His pleasure; to live in that knowledge is eternal life.<a name=4:2></a> "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>).<a name=4:3></a> Eternal life is consequent on the adjustment of everything on the <i>earthly</i> side; you are set free from the trammels of earth, and you live in the knowledge of the only true God and of a Man who was entirely free from earth.<a name=4:4></a> Think of living in company with such a Man as that!<a name=4:5></a> A Man who was entirely for the pleasure of God.<a name=4:6></a> But along with the knowledge there is subjective energy, and that is by the springing up of the water within.<a name=4:7></a> It "shall become <i>in</i> him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life".<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord shows in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>that He is going to set up the woman with something permanently within her; a source of satisfaction.<a name=4:9></a> A man rules his own family, and maintains every relationship rightly, but he has satisfaction outside of it.<a name=4:10></a> He is not afraid of death though it lies on his family relationships, he is lifted above it.<a name=4:11></a> I think that is a very great testimony; and a man who does not want things here, who is satisfied in mind and affections, is a testimony to God.<a name=4:12></a> Eternal life lifts us outside every natural relationship and outside of earth morally.<a name=4:13></a> The earth is the sphere where the flesh lives, but the Lord proposes to lift a man above it.<a name=4:14></a> He brings in resurrection, and eternal life is enjoyed in resurrection.<a name=4:15></a> Resurrection takes place here, but it lifts us morally outside of earth.<a name=4:16></a> The Lord was not available to us as eternal life till He was raised and glorified.<a name=4:17></a> So, though eternal life is known and enjoyed while we are still down here, it is as we are over Jordan;

		that is the type, and the types refer to Christianity.<a name=5:1></a> You see, God is not developing any order of things in regard to the earth just now; we take up the ground, so to speak, but you cannot define as clearly today as we shall in the millennium just where the earthly line ceases and the heavenly line begins.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we speak of the knowledge of Jesus Christ as sent here, it is the knowledge of <i>that Man</i>, the true Man as we say; we cannot omit what He was down here on earth from what He is up there.<a name=5:3></a> All that He is up there in the glory was seen in Him down here.<a name=5:4></a> How am I to know that blessed Man up there save as studying the gospels which show me what He was down here?<a name=5:5></a> "Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" is the Man who carried out the will of God here, and who was entirely for His pleasure.<a name=5:6></a> He was not a man driven out of Eden, but One living to God and wholly for His delight.<a name=5:7></a> I think we have to see that it is no question of heavenly relationships here; but it is God and man brought together.<a name=5:8></a> The thought of the Father and the Son brings in family relationships, and leads us to heaven, but where it is a question of eternal life it is God and man.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:1">John  17:1</a> speaks of the glory which was His personally from the Father; it is the Father and the Son in connection with what they were doing.<a name=5:10></a> Verse 5 refers to another glory, "the glory which I had with thee before the world was".<a name=5:11></a> He prays to His Father in verse 1, saying, "glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee", and then He says, "as thou hast given him power over all flesh".<a name=5:12></a> What we have to know for eternal life is the Father as "the only true God", it is a question of <i>revelation</i>, not relationship.<a name=5:13></a> For eternal life you must have God and man brought together.<a name=5:14></a> Man had gone away from God and become idolatrous, and man must be recovered to God.<a name=5:15></a> He learns that God is the only true God in contrast to all that is false.<a name=5:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>the point is, that there is no possibility of eternal life being known in the soul except as one is delivered from need and is satisfied in mind and affections; and then what is prominent is that they should know the only true God.<a name=6:1></a> The Lord does not say, that they might know Thee, the Father, but Thee, the only true <i>God</i>.<a name=6:2></a> He is addressing <i>His</i> Father, but it is not the Father in relationship as regards us.<a name=6:3></a> Here it is a question of man knowing the only true God.<a name=6:4></a> Very often people are covetous, that is really idolatry, and they have to be brought out from all that to know the only true God.<a name=6:5></a> While such things are in question it is really too early to bring in the thought of relationships, for they are proper to <i>heaven</i>, but man has to be satisfied <i>here</i> first.<a name=6:6></a> On the one hand there is the entire overthrow of idolatry in the knowledge of the only true God; you are satisfied with God, and then, on the other hand, there is the appreciation of Christ as the Man of God's pleasure, the One who loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.<a name=6:7></a> It is in this way that God and men are brought together in relationships which are perfectly adjusted.<a name=6:8></a> You see it first in regard to God and Christ, but the thing is to be perpetuated in men here.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we may see eternal life coming out in the Lord's pathway here wherever He is in direct relation to the Father, especially in prayer.<a name=6:10></a> He lived on account of the Father.<a name=6:11></a> There was the bringing together of God and man in Christ down here, and now He gives the gift of living water to whosoever will ask for it, so that it may spring up and withdraw a man from every natural influence and from all that is of nature.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		During the forty days in which the Lord remained on earth after His resurrection we see what is entirely spiritual; the apostles saw it; it was that out-of-the-world, heavenly condition and order of things in which eternal life consists.<a name=6:13></a> You have a Man there

	<div class="paragraph">
		who is entirely outside the reach and sphere of nature, One upon whom death had no more dominion.<a name=7:1></a> Even when here, He had His own blessed life with the Father, outside the path of dependence and subjection and responsibility which He had assumed here, so the apostles can speak of "that eternal life which was with the Father"; they had seen it.<a name=7:2></a> In the world to come, man will be under the influence of the Man of God's pleasure: he will be freed from idolatry and lawlessness.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>, I think it suggests the <i>heavenly</i> side of things, and the Spirit coming in from heaven, with the result that there is a heavenly influence down here, rivers of living water.<a name=7:4></a> Chapter 7 supposes an Ephesian saint, for there is excess, a flowing out.<a name=7:5></a> You do not come to the divine thought of giving until you take heavenly ground.<a name=7:6></a> God would follow up His people with a heavenly influence.<a name=7:7></a> That is most beautiful.<a name=7:8></a> Though certain of the tribes of Israel elected to stay on the further side of Jordan, yet God gave certain cities among them to the Levites to dwell in, so that the influence of heaven might be secured to them.<a name=7:9></a> It is interesting that half the tribe of Manasseh broke away from the other half of the tribe, showing that there was special spiritual energy with them.<a name=7:10></a> The daughters of Zelophehad were of Manasseh, and they came to Moses, and demanded an inheritance among their brethren, the sons of their father.<a name=7:11></a> It all shows a spiritual energy that will not stop short of an inheritance in the land.<a name=7:12></a> It shows the energy of faith that breaks loose from nature.<a name=7:13></a>

		HOUSE OF GOD AS PRESENTED IN MARK'S GOSPEL

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I had thought that the early passages in the gospel of Mark would seem to illustrate the truth of the house of God.<a name=8:1></a> There are three houses mentioned here.<a name=8:2></a> The idea of a house includes a system of affection, and this is connected with the testimony.<a name=8:3></a> In this gospel it is the "glad tidings" as preached by Christ, and He is referred to more often as in the house than in other positions, and the thoughts connected with this work out ultimately in the idea of the house of God.<a name=8:4></a> Even if in Christendom the conditions are wanting for the house of God, one's own house can be right, like Joshua's.<a name=8:5></a> He said, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24:15">Joshua  24:15</a>).<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first house mentioned here was Peter's.<a name=8:7></a> His wife's mother was there.<a name=8:8></a> The Lord Jesus entered this house, and the mother-in-law was in a fever, but He touched her, and she arose and ministered unto them.<a name=8:9></a> It is noticeable that on her recovery she was impartial.<a name=8:10></a> She ministered where there was need.<a name=8:11></a> Her case represents a Christian in an awkward position.<a name=8:12></a> Her position was a difficult one for any woman, for she was living in another person's house.<a name=8:13></a> Our position in the world is an awkward one.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Jesus returned to Capernaum it says "he was in the house".<a name=8:15></a> This is the second house mentioned.<a name=8:16></a> It was no small liberty on the part of the four men to intrude through the roof of another person's house, but in this case it is evident there was sympathy on behalf of the person brought in, the palsied man, the four who brought him, and also the owner of the house.<a name=8:17></a> If one is not a preacher one can be in sympathy with the testimony through one's house.<a name=8:18></a> In an ordinary household, the youngest in the house can contribute to the general welfare.<a name=8:19></a>

		In reference to the Lord's ministry, Luke magnifies <i>what</i> was done, but Mark <i>how</i> it was done.<a name=9:1></a> The house is a divine institution.<a name=9:2></a> Adam, Seth and others had their families, but it is formally stated with reference to Noah, that he prepared an ark for the saving of his <i>house</i>.<a name=9:3></a> This is the first mention in Scripture of the house.<a name=9:4></a> Jacob said when he awoke from his dream, "this is none other than the house of God".<a name=9:5></a> That is to say he recognised that God had a sphere which He dominated.<a name=9:6></a> The believer in the Lord Jesus begins his lessons in his own father's house.<a name=9:7></a> God has so ordered it that there is affection there.<a name=9:8></a> We cannot expect to be right in the house of God unless we are right in our own.<a name=9:9></a> In Job's case things were not right when his sons were feasting in their elder brother's house and their father was absent.<a name=9:10></a> The result of this was that the house was smitten at the four corners.<a name=9:11></a> It would appear that the secret of the matter was that Job's wife was not in true sympathy.<a name=9:12></a> It was she who said "Curse God and die" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#2:9">Job  2:9</a>).<a name=9:13></a> The Lord Jesus met the kind of people in Levi's house, when he was called, whom He was glad to see, the publicans and sinners.<a name=9:14></a> The house of God is composed of such who have been reached and set right.<a name=9:15></a> The introduction of the gospel into Europe was through the household.<a name=9:16></a> I refer to Lydia's house and the jailor's house.<a name=9:17></a> This is very encouraging, for we all have our own households.<a name=9:18></a> It is remarkable that after finding communion in Lydia's house, in addressing the jailor Paul says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, <i>and thy house</i>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:31">Acts  16:31</a>).<a name=9:19></a> The apostle later received comfort in the jailor's house for he was washed and fed, and his wounds were cared for there.<a name=9:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In considering this we see how rapidly the Lord extended His territory, and in one way it all depended on the character of Lydia's house.<a name=9:21></a> The state of our households has a great deal to do with the meeting.<a name=9:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to show you from this scripture, as the Lord may help me, how recovery comes about, and how man is recovered for God through the Lord Jesus Christ in a spiritual, not in a natural way.<a name=24:1></a> We all need to be led on to spiritual lines.<a name=24:2></a> This book shows that one may be genuinely converted and have the fear of God before his eyes and yet may be still on natural lines.<a name=24:3></a> The first chapter of Job presents to us Job and his household as set up on natural lines, although he was a godly man himself, one whom God had taken account of among all the race, a perfect man, one who eschewed evil, one whom indeed God calls His servant.<a name=24:4></a> Now before the Spirit of God proceeds to give us this wonderful course of instruction He sets before us the spiritual pattern.<a name=24:5></a> After Job and his family are presented we are told that there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves to God.<a name=24:6></a> Now that is a spiritual pattern.<a name=24:7></a> It does not go beyond the fact that there was a spiritual pattern.<a name=24:8></a> God had sons, and His sons were not lawless; they were not selfish; they thought of Him.<a name=24:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is a spiritual pattern.<a name=24:10></a> On the other hand Job's sons and daughters, although they had a godly father, were not affected by his godliness; they were on natural lines.<a name=24:11></a> They were feasting in their elder brother's house; that is a natural pattern.<a name=24:12></a> That is a pattern of things as they are here in this world, formed under the influence of evil; for, remember, that what is natural now in humanity is under the influence of evil.<a name=24:13></a> So that is what you have in chapter 1 -- a spiritual pattern and a natural pattern.<a name=24:14></a> It is for you to determine for yourself as to whether you are on the line of the spiritual pattern presented; whether it is your habit to come up before

		I want to say a word about education, and I venture to select these scriptures as indicating the course of instruction which is available.<a name=34:1></a> I desire especially to dwell on the last scripture.<a name=34:2></a> Mary indicates by the term she uses in addressing the Lord that she was among those who had taken up the course of instruction and had progressed in it.<a name=34:3></a> She designates the Lord as He had been known to her; she says to Him, "Rabboni"; He was her Teacher, her Master.<a name=34:4></a> Nothing can be more important for us than to come under His instruction.<a name=34:5></a> The sun shines, there is a great deal of light: but there is much need for instruction.<a name=34:6></a> We get such a term as this, "instruction in righteousness" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>).<a name=34:7></a> Timothy was amongst those who had been learners; the apostle says to him, "Abide in those things which thou hast learned .<a name=34:8></a>.<a name=34:9></a>.<a name=34:10></a> knowing of whom thou hast learned them" (chapter 3:14).<a name=34:11></a> In the prophets we have a suggestion that is very solemn.<a name=34:12></a> God's people were "destroyed by lack of knowledge", (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#4:6">Hosea  4:6</a>).<a name=34:13></a> Hosea tells us "we shall know".<a name=34:14></a> Having spoken of the Lord and of returning to Him, the prophet says, "After two days he shall revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight".<a name=34:15></a> He says we shall know God, but there was something more than that: "then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord" (chapter 6:2,3).<a name=34:16></a> The secret of this knowledge is in the <i>following</i>.<a name=34:17></a>

		At the outset of the Scriptures one is greatly struck with the intelligence displayed.<a name=34:18></a> Adam gave proof of very great intelligence; every creature of God is brought to him that he might name them.<a name=34:19></a> We are not told where he acquired his intelligence, or where he was instructed, but every creature of God was brought to him and he pronounced the name of each, and the name which Adam pronounced upon them

		I refer for a moment to Eve; Adam assigns a reason for the name he gives her.<a name=35:6></a> It is a wonderful incident; a most attractive incident, the first marriage ceremony.<a name=35:7></a> Jehovah presents her to Adam, it was a test to the intelligence of the man, but Adam was equal to it; "This time", he says, "it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a Man" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:23">Genesis  2:23</a>).<a name=35:8></a> That is what it is to be intelligent according to God; he can assign a reason for what he says.<a name=35:9></a> Adam was a figure of Him that was to come; he displayed very great intelligence, but he was only a figure of Him that was to come.<a name=35:10></a> Our Lord Jesus Christ gave names, and in the giving of them He displays not only His sovereign right, but His divine intelligence.<a name=35:11></a> He gave names when here, and He never gave them haphazard; there was always a reason.<a name=35:12></a>

		If we speak of the course of instruction, I think it begins with this chapter in Mark.<a name=36:18></a> The word "crowds" is used there, it is not disciples.<a name=36:19></a> Earlier in the chapter His relatives had, in a patronising sort of way, assumed that He was out of His mind.<a name=36:20></a> They were not His enemies, He had enemies, those who said that He cast out demons by Beelzebub, but these were not His enemies, they were His distant relatives evidently.<a name=36:21></a> His mother and His brethren would belong to a nearer circle no doubt, but here they were standing without, and they called to Him to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, His mother and His brethren stood without and desired Him to come to them, but He will never join them on these lines.<a name=37:5></a> He disowns the relationship, and the crowds are respected.<a name=37:6></a> There are those who are around Him inside.<a name=37:7></a> I would call your attention to the word "crowd" in verse 32.<a name=37:8></a> The multitude encircling Him; there is no natural link between Him and them, but He looks round about upon them.<a name=37:9></a> He does not look on those outside.<a name=37:10></a> They desired to see Him on natural grounds, but they stood outside.<a name=37:11></a> Flesh is incapable of divine culture; nature is incapable of divine culture; but if you come inside you will be where you may be divinely instructed.<a name=37:12></a> I want to show you how the education begins.<a name=37:13></a> While you <i>stand</i> you are not a learner; you must <i>sit</i> to be a disciple, a learner.<a name=37:14></a> John the baptist stood: dispensationally he was right in standing, but he did not come into the Christian instruction, inside.<a name=37:15></a> He said, "the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:29">John  3:29</a>); but a disciple sits.<a name=37:16></a>

		Then the Lord says at the end of the chapter, "whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother".<a name=38:3></a> He put the brother first; it is the brother He has in His mind; the Lord was thinking of the brother.<a name=38:4></a> What kind of brethren were they?<a name=38:5></a> The course of instruction begins in sitting around the Lord, and you are recognised as a brother because you are doing the will of God; it is in that way you recognise the brother.<a name=38:6></a> They were using not their hands, that would come later, but they were using their ears, and that is how you do the will of God; it is in listening to Christ.<a name=38:7></a> Your hands will come in later and your feet too, but the will of God begins with sitting around the Lord Jesus.<a name=38:8></a> It is wonderful to arrive at this position, to be sitting around the Lord listening to His word, doing the will of God; of such the Lord will say, "The same is my brother, and my sister, and mother".<a name=38:9></a> Well, that is how Christian education begins; it shows the will of God carried out by the believer.<a name=38:10></a>

		Well, Jacob called it a dreadful place, but one thing he does in keeping with his intelligence is, that, he rises early in the morning, and rears up the stone on which he had slept and pours oil upon it.<a name=57:4></a> In chapter 35 he pours wine on first and then the oil, but here he simply pours oil.<a name=57:5></a> He avowed in that act that at the moment he was not pleasurable to God.<a name=57:6></a> How sad a confession that is, beloved brethren.<a name=57:7></a> To have the Spirit and yet to have to avow that one is not pleasurable to God.<a name=57:8></a> Let us pour the drink offering first; that is for the pleasure of God.<a name=57:9></a> You will remember when David longed for the water of the well of Bethlehem, how the mighty men procured it for him at the cost of their lives, but he would not drink it, he poured it out to God as a drink offering.<a name=57:10></a>

		Now just think for a moment of a young man setting out to get a place for himself in the world; is he considering for God in that?<a name=57:11></a> Is he desiring to be for the pleasure of God?<a name=57:12></a> May be he has the Spirit, and sufficient intelligence to know it, but he is not pleasurable to God in that which he is doing.<a name=57:13></a> Jacob says, There is the pillar, and there is the anointing, and if God will take care of me and prosper me, then this shall be His house, and I will give Him a tenth of all that He gives me.<a name=57:14></a> I do not enlarge upon that.<a name=57:15></a> It is a good thing to make resolutions.<a name=57:16></a> I believe in making resolutions, because if you are conscientious you will be brought back to your resolution; God will bring you back to it.<a name=57:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then a further thought in chapter 35:14 is, that Jacob sets up a pillar in the place where God talked with him; it was the place of divine communications, and there he sets up the pillar; he stands by it there; he will hold the ground there.<a name=60:6></a> The pillar stands upright, and you take your stand by the communications of God to your soul; you support the light of God just there.<a name=60:7></a> I am a great believer in local responsibility, and I would say, If the light of God comes to you in your locality, stand by it; take your stand there; support it.<a name=60:8></a> It was in the place where God talked to him that Jacob set up his pillar.<a name=60:9></a> One has to stand upright and support the light that has come to you, publicly in your life, and words and ways.<a name=60:10></a> The drink offering is the man's appreciation of the communications made to him.<a name=60:11></a> He treasures them in his heart; he values them.<a name=60:12></a> He is like those the Lord spoke of in the gospels who hear the word and do it; there is a testimony to how we value the communications granted to us.<a name=60:13></a> That is the meaning of the drink offering.<a name=60:14></a> The assembly is spoken of as the "pillar and base of the truth"; it is something by which you take your stand.<a name=60:15></a> You stand up in the power of the Spirit where the light of God has come to you, and you seek to support the testimony; and as you do that you have the sense that God can look on you with pleasure; you pour

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, Jacob had come back to the house of God.<a name=61:6></a> He stood up in his place there, and the pleasure of God was in him, and he is anointed; dignity according to God is put upon him for witness.<a name=61:7></a> Now the more Jacob proceeds on his path the more honest he becomes, the more he admits his failures; he does not hide them or deny them.<a name=61:8></a> Though he blessed Pharaoh in all the dignity of his position as heir of God's blessing, yet he confessed that "few and evil have the days of the years of my life been".<a name=61:9></a> "Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage <i>are</i> an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage".<a name=61:10></a> My pilgrimage; how one loves that thought; his life was a pilgrimage; he was passing on to the end of his course.<a name=61:11></a> He had to say that his years "have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my father in the days of their pilgrimage", but for all that those few and evil days had been a pilgrimage.<a name=61:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>we learn that as <i>dying</i> he blessed both the sons of Joseph and worshipped; he did that when he died.<a name=61:13></a> It is not a question of dying with us, beloved brethren, but of living; we worship while we are living.<a name=61:14></a> "The living, the living, he shall praise thee" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:19">Isaiah  38:19</a>).<a name=61:15></a> I need not remind you of that.<a name=61:16></a> The Spirit of life from God has come into our souls.<a name=61:17></a> What for?<a name=61:18></a> That our lips should praise Him; that our

		Although "life" and "eternal life" are used interchangeably, especially by the apostle John, yet in Romans they present different ideas.<a name=66:4></a> Eternal life is an end in view, whereas life in chapter 8 is connected with the Spirit, "the Spirit is life", and so present.<a name=66:5></a> Life in this sense is <i>power</i>, it involves ability to be free from the flesh, so as to fulfil righteousness here.<a name=66:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=108:1></a> Attention was called yesterday to the down line in chapter 2 and how it leads to the reduction of our size, preparing for expansion on the other side.<a name=108:2></a> And although the unleavened bread is not really the subject of the passage, in a way nothing could be more important than that the feast should be kept during the seven days.<a name=108:3></a> That is, that in having to say directly to what pertains to Christ in the heavenlies, there is room for expansion, God looks for expansion, because it is a very large place and requires great largeness of mind and affection; but in regard to things here, and what one is or may be in regard of the world, there is a standing necessity to feed on unleavened bread.<a name=108:4></a> As remarked in prayer, without the reducing process there is no possibility of apprehending the point of view of this chapter, because it is expansion.<a name=108:5></a> And there seems great advantage in that we have given to us in this chapter the exercises of a man like the apostle, not as an apostle, but as a Christian, his inward exercises in regard to Christ and in regard to the calling.<a name=108:6></a> He had other exercises which are also a model for us, such as levitical exercises.<a name=108:7></a> He is compelled in the epistle to the Corinthians to record his levitical exercises because of their envy and folly, though he would have preferred to have left those for the day of Christ to bring to light.<a name=108:8></a> But he is not compelled here, he delights to express his exercises in regard to Christ and the calling.<a name=108:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=125:8></a> So that after the words, "For the rest, brethren", much less follows here than that which follows a similar expression in Philippians.<a name=125:9></a> You have two whole chapters in Philippians which follow this expression; the apostle was led on in a different strain in writing to the Philippians.<a name=125:10></a> The epistle to Ephesus is more formal and official as bringing out the assembly's place in the divine counsels, and the apostle does not let out his feelings.<a name=125:11></a> Having brought that out, the consequences would be that the testimony would be maintained in conflict; so "For the rest, brethren", is preparation for the conflict.<a name=125:12></a>

		REMEMBRACE OF THE LORD JESUS

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in my mind to inquire as to how we regard the Lord Jesus Christ in the way of remembrance, whether our remembrance of Him is an historical one, or whether we hold Him in affectionate remembrance.<a name=141:1></a> I have read the passage from 1 Corinthians because it suggests the latter.<a name=141:2></a> The Lord's supper is to enable us to keep the Lord so before us, that we hold Him in affectionate remembrance.<a name=141:3></a> The designation used by the apostle Paul shows that it was so in his case.<a name=141:4></a> He says, "I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the <i>Lord Jesus</i> the same night in which He was betrayed took bread".<a name=141:5></a> The <i>Lord Jesus</i> is the designation which denotes that Christ was held in affectionate regard and remembrance by Paul.<a name=141:6></a> We all know that in his different epistles he speaks much of Christ.<a name=141:7></a> If he is presenting a certain line of truth he uses the designations which cover that.<a name=141:8></a> If he speaks of the Lord as the One through whom things have been effected for God, he usually refers to Him as the "Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=141:9></a> Indeed it becomes an inquiry to one whether the habitual use of any designation by us does not in some sense indicate our regard for Christ.<a name=141:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I have said, the apostle in setting out some line of truth usually employs a designation which covers that line of truth.<a name=141:11></a> For instance he says, "there be gods many, and lords many"; and there are, dear friends, gods many, and lords many; "but to us there is but one God, the Father".<a name=141:12></a> That is not necessarily <i>our</i> Father, it is <i>the</i> Father; and he goes on to say: "of whom are all things, and we for him".<a name=141:13></a> The Father is the Source of everything.<a name=141:14></a> And then he adds to that "and one Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:5">1 Corinthians  8:5</a>,6),
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=142>[Page 142]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that is to say, "<i>to us</i> there is .<a name=142:1></a>.<a name=142:2></a>.<a name=142:3></a> one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him".<a name=142:4></a> That is, he regards the one Lord as Jesus Christ who has effected things; and oh, beloved friends, what <i>has</i> He effected?<a name=142:5></a> Well, He has brought us in; "and we (he says) by him".<a name=142:6></a> He has brought the saints in; the great result of His work in becoming Man is that He has us all.<a name=142:7></a> I do not know whether you regard yourself in that light, but <i>I</i> do; one regards oneself as by the Lord Jesus, brought in, as it were, as a trophy, "we by him".<a name=142:8></a> But all things are by Him.<a name=142:9></a> Think of the vastness of the scheme, every divine conception brought in by Him; all that order of things of which the tabernacle is a figure, brought in by Him.<a name=142:10></a> But how blessed in the meanwhile that our place is <i>now</i> by Him.<a name=142:11></a> There it is "one Lord Jesus Christ"; and then if the apostle speaks about things that have been effected he refers to them as "in Christ Jesus"; they are in the anointed Man, I do not suppose any one of us would wish them elsewhere.<a name=142:12></a> God has been pleased to commit Himself to Christ; that is the idea of the anointed; God has been pleased to commit Himself to the Lord Jesus, and He has placed everything there; we do not wish them elsewhere.<a name=142:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it is one's own position one is entitled to reckon oneself "dead indeed unto sin".<a name=142:14></a> The Lord resisted unto blood, striving against sin; we are entitled to reckon ourselves dead to it, but more than that we are to reckon ourselves "alive unto God", in whom?<a name=142:15></a> "In Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:11">Romans  6:11</a>).<a name=142:16></a> One is entitled to reckon oneself as in the Man to whom God has committed Himself.<a name=142:17></a> And if God has given to us, in His great act of favour, that which we so often dwell upon, and yet so little understand, eternal life, if it be that, <i>where is it</i>?<a name=142:18></a> Well, beloved friends, according to Paul, it is just there, it is "in Christ Jesus our Lord"; and the more we treasure it the more we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=143>[Page 143]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are satisfied that it is there.<a name=143:1></a> If it be a question of what God is going to introduce for His own satisfaction as Father, He has revealed His Son in the apostle.<a name=143:2></a> He "was pleased" (Paul says) "to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him (the Son) as glad tidings among the nations" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:16">Galatians  1:16</a>).<a name=143:3></a> So that in any line or thought of truth that the apostle has in mind, he uses the designation to cover it, and there are no discrepancies.<a name=143:4></a> But when it comes to what the Lord Jesus Christ was to Paul's own heart he invariably refers to Him as "the Lord Jesus".<a name=143:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would inquire as to how <i>you</i> regard the Lord, and as I said, it just resolves itself into this, whether your remembrance of the Lord is simply historical, or whether it is an affectionate remembrance of Him.<a name=143:6></a> If it be the former I think I can point out to you that somebody else will ultimately take His place in your heart.<a name=143:7></a> In Christendom it is simply an historical remembrance, and never goes beyond that.<a name=143:8></a> What would be the result of what we learn in Christendom?<a name=143:9></a> They only honour the Lord with the lips, but what about the heart?<a name=143:10></a> The word says, "Son, give me thine heart" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#23:26">Proverbs  23:26</a>).<a name=143:11></a> Their hearts are far away, Jehovah had to say.<a name=143:12></a> Well now, it is an historical remembrance of Him that is around us, and that is not the Lord's supper.<a name=143:13></a> If the apostle Paul were called to pronounce upon that which purports to be the Supper, what would he say?<a name=143:14></a> What <i>did</i> he say?<a name=143:15></a> "This is not the Lord's supper", whatever else it might be.<a name=143:16></a> And then he goes on to call attention to the Lord's supper, and says, that he received it of the Lord, and what he received was, "that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread".<a name=143:17></a> The <i>Lord Jesus</i>!<a name=143:18></a> Is that how you refer to Christ in your heart?<a name=143:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=198:4></a> In the beginning of chapter 3 he is "the prisoner of Christ Jesus".<a name=198:5></a> This relates to what is brought out in the long parenthesis in chapter 3; he was a prisoner of the Christ on account of the nations.<a name=198:6></a> The apostle would have laboured amongst the Jews, but the Lord would have him continue the work among the Gentiles, and having alluded to that, he makes the long statement as to the mystery, and his work in administering it.<a name=198:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		His work had been successful amongst the Gentiles; the administration of the mystery, which was given into his hands, would result in glory to God in the assembly unto all generations of the age of ages.<a name=198:8></a> In spite of the fact that he had gone to Jerusalem, nothing had been lost; Christ had retained him among the Gentiles.<a name=198:9></a> He was the prisoner of the Christ Jesus.<a name=198:10></a> He had been retained for the carrying on of the work of God amongst the Gentiles, and the Lord would not allow him to be diverted from that.<a name=198:11></a> Chapter 3 shows that the work of God had gone on, and his prayer, his great exercise, shows how completely he was now under the influence of Christ; he desired that the Christ should have a dwelling place in the hearts of the saints.<a name=198:12></a> Then in chapter 4 he returns to the idea of being a prisoner, only he changes the expression and says, "I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you".<a name=198:13></a> I think the prisoner of the <i>Christ Jesus</i> has reference to the <i>work</i> of God among the nations, whereas the <i>Lord's</i> prisoner suggests the <i>authority</i> of

		J.T.<a name=217:1></a> A word on the "new man" in chapter 4 and being imitators of God in chapter 5 may help.<a name=217:2></a> The second half of chapter 4 evidently refers to our relations with the outer world.<a name=217:3></a> Up to the end of verse 16 the chapter speaks of what we are in relation to each other, but then the apostle says "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye should no longer walk as the rest of the nations walk".<a name=217:4></a> So that it is a question of their outer conduct now, hence the "new man" is introduced.<a name=217:5></a> It may be noted that both in Colossians and in Ephesians we have the new man.<a name=217:6></a> It is not simply, as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>, "newness of life", but a new man, and this new man is a creation.<a name=217:7></a> It is not simply the recovered man here, it is a creation.<a name=217:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=217:15></a> Yes there is, but then what is remarked is that the new man is <i>created</i>, which you do not get in Romans.<a name=217:16></a> In Romans it is that the one who is baptised continues here in <i>newness</i> of life, whereas in Colossians and Ephesians it is a new creation.<a name=217:17></a> What is seen is the new man.<a name=217:18></a> It is not what you were before continued on account of recovery, but a wholly new thing.<a name=217:19></a> I think what distinguishes Colossians and Ephesians in this respect is that there is a new man, and that he is a new creation.<a name=217:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=275:3></a> Well, the saints are all anointed; they have the divine stamp upon them; "he who has anointed us is God".<a name=275:4></a> Hence in a general way, we should have regard to the saints in that light, so that if there be <i>will</i> in any one of them, as is possible, the lesson is here that the superabundance of the spirit of Christ in those that are walking in that spirit brings about repentance in the failing one, if such is possible.<a name=275:5></a> In Saul's case repentance was transitory.<a name=275:6></a> It seems to me that he had been given space to repent and failed to do so in the true sense, as Thyatira in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>.<a name=275:7></a> Thyatira is the fourth assembly addressed and represents that phase of the assembly in responsibility that had the place of the candlestick.<a name=275:8></a> The Lord, before removing the candlestick, gives her space to repent, "and she will not repent" (verse 21).<a name=275:9></a> So with Saul here; he had a great opportunity to recover himself in the presence of the true king.<a name=275:10></a> Instead of David using arbitrary authority in dealing with him when he had him in his power, he acts in grace towards him.<a name=275:11></a> When David had finished speaking, Saul says, "Is this thy voice my son David".<a name=275:12></a> The power in which David spoke touched him, and broke him down for the moment.<a name=275:13></a> He had thus proved the power of David's spirit.<a name=275:14></a> If it were possible for Saul to repent and recover himself in a spiritual way, he would have done so.<a name=275:15></a> Now if this be the case of one amongst us whom the Lord has signally used, the necessity for this spirit in us is all the more evident.<a name=275:16></a>

		HOW DAVID WAS ACTUATED IN REGARD TO CHRIST AS SEEN IN THE ARK
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6:12">2 Samuel  6:12</a> - 23
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:1></a> This book opens with David at Ziklag.<a name=284:2></a> We are told in chapter 1:1 that "David had abode two days in Ziklag".<a name=284:3></a> I refer to that because it indicates a certain progress made.<a name=284:4></a> He had recovered everything at Ziklag, and then remained there two days, which suggests the establishing of the soul in the truth of recovery before moving on.<a name=284:5></a> The two books of Samuel, taken together in that way, help us, as showing how we move on in our souls.<a name=284:6></a> There are stations, so to say, by the wayside, Jerusalem being the final point reached.<a name=284:7></a> There are certain stations by the way in which we consolidate ourselves in the light so far acquired.<a name=284:8></a> You see what I mean; abiding two days in a place is a period in which a thing is tested.<a name=284:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.M.<a name=284:10></a>G.<a name=284:11></a> You test the light received before going on.<a name=284:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:13></a> Yes; if you do not consolidate yourself, to use a military expression, in acquired ground, you are likely to lose it.<a name=284:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.M.<a name=284:15></a>G.<a name=284:16></a> There is the moving on, but you have to make good the ground as you proceed.<a name=284:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.L.<a name=284:18></a> Is there any significance in David waiting two days for guidance from the Lord?<a name=284:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=284:20></a> Well that comes out in chapter 2.<a name=284:21></a> On the third day tidings came to him regarding what took place at Gilboa, tidings of what had befallen Saul and Jonathan, and the fine spirit that David manifests indicates how much he was in accord with Ziklag; because Ziklag is, I think, typically, the epistle to the Romans.<a name=284:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=285:8></a> Yes that is what I thought exactly.<a name=285:9></a> It is a matter that ought to be looked into as to whether we have consolidated the ground acquired in the way of light.<a name=285:10></a> The fact that you have reached a point mentally does not prove that you have got possession of it.<a name=285:11></a> We have to take possession of things.<a name=285:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have David engaged with Saul and Jonathan; his spirit is very noble; he is even speaking of them in poetical language; and these were no vain sentiments, they were real.<a name=285:13></a> They are like what we find in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, showing the spirit of the conqueror overcoming evil with good.<a name=285:14></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us, whatever the elements of opposition, but in chapter 12 you overcome an enemy, but you overcome him in order to recover him.<a name=285:15></a> It is not proving yourself more able in argument, but overcoming evil in him with good.<a name=285:16></a>

		Well, one can understand Peter's service to the saints being accomplished.<a name=323:16></a> He sees the sheep having returned to the Shepherd and then he says, "and to the Bishop of your souls".<a name=323:17></a> The Lord Jesus is the Overseer of every soul on earth; every believer belongs to that diocese.<a name=323:18></a> He is the Bishop of our souls.<a name=323:19></a> How comforting to know that whether you wake or sleep He is overseeing your soul perpetually.<a name=323:20></a> I do not deny that He looks after your body, as the body is His too; but the soul is the great centre of need, and the Lord is Bishop of that.<a name=323:21></a>

		Now, in turning to Ephesians, we find the full gist of Paul's ministry.<a name=324:14></a> One might say much on that: there is, indeed, far more than one could say, and at best one can only touch this wonderful letter addressed to those saints at Ephesus.<a name=324:15></a> You will remember Paul had traversed the upper regions in going to Ephesus; it was an elevated territory morally.<a name=324:16></a> We are not much accustomed to the "hill country".<a name=324:17></a> Ephesians stands in relation to the upper district or region.<a name=324:18></a> We have to accustom ourselves to this elevation.<a name=324:19></a> The low land scarcely requires the same exercise.<a name=324:20></a> The apostle comes to the full result of his ministry in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>.<a name=324:21></a> His thought is to leave the saints, as it were, self-supporting.<a name=324:22></a> I do not wish to use a misleading word, but that is a very good word, as I hope to show you.<a name=324:23></a> John uses it in certain features of his writings.<a name=324:24></a> Indeed, it is a mark of his gospel and epistle that those who come under the influence of Christ, and who benefit by that

		Then we get the gifts enumerated.<a name=327:2></a> Firstly, apostles to enforce His authority; secondly, prophets to bring <i>God</i> in; and then evangelists to bring <i>man</i> in; last of all, pastors and teachers.<a name=327:3></a> In the pastor we touch Peter's line.<a name=327:4></a> Then it goes on "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ".<a name=327:5></a> That is the situation, "till we all come in the unity of the faith" (verses 12,13).<a name=327:6></a> Mark the word "<i>faith</i>"; it is not the unity of the Spirit, as in the earlier part of the chapter, but the unity of the faith; by this means we come unto a perfect man.<a name=327:7></a> That is a collective thought.<a name=327:8></a> "Unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ".<a name=327:9></a> What a marvellous aim!<a name=327:10></a> Well, that is Paul's ministry.<a name=327:11></a>

		Now he says "that we be no more babes"; <i>that</i> is a word for our souls.<a name=327:12></a> The state of babes is a most dangerous one to remain in.<a name=327:13></a> In <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2">1 John  2</a>the saints are classified as fathers, young men and babes; and a good deal more is said to the babes than to the "fathers" or to the "young men".<a name=327:14></a> You will observe also no charge is committed to the babes.<a name=327:15></a> Their great danger was Antichrist.<a name=327:16></a> Not that Antichrist had yet come, though John says he is coming; but he adds, "Even now are there many antichrists".<a name=327:17></a> How are they to be known?<a name=327:18></a> "They went out from us, but they were not of us"; and the babes were in danger from them.<a name=327:19></a> So we are today; we are in danger from the influence of men.<a name=327:20></a> The babes are greatly exposed to the influence of men, those who would be leaders in the world.<a name=327:21></a> Now, the apostle Paul says, Let us be no longer babes; "that ye be no more babes tossed to and fro by every wind of that teaching, which is in the sleight of men in unprincipled cunning with a view to systematised error".<a name=327:22></a> <i>Systematised error</i>; that is Christendom.<a name=327:23></a> Ministry now is very largely taken up with exposure

	<div class="paragraph">
		of evil; it is not happy work, but it is essential.<a name=328:1></a> The apostle saw Christendom as systematised error.<a name=328:2></a> Note, it is <i>systematised</i>.<a name=328:3></a> It may be very plausible, carefully constructed and built up, but it is deceptive, and the babes are caught by it.<a name=328:4></a> Hence the need of ministry.<a name=328:5></a> The object of ministry is to prevent the babe state continuing, and to lead us on to growth, to "perfection", so that we should be "no longer babes".<a name=328:6></a> Let us see to it, for in the babe state we are exposed to "systematised error".<a name=328:7></a> Look at the words, "the sleight of men and cunning craftiness".<a name=328:8></a> How essential to be on our guard in respect of such things!<a name=328:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the apostle goes on to the positive side; "speaking the truth in love".<a name=328:10></a> What a happy employ that is!<a name=328:11></a> "They that feared the Lord spake often one to another"; we are not told what they said, but it was not distasteful to the Lord's ear, you may be sure, for He "hearkened and heard it" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a>).<a name=328:12></a> The Lord has a perfect ear.<a name=328:13></a> Joshua said on the occasion of the golden calf: "There is a noise of war in the camp" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:17">Exodus  32:17</a>).<a name=328:14></a> His ear was deceived.<a name=328:15></a> Moses said: 'No, it is not war'.<a name=328:16></a> Idolatry was at work.<a name=328:17></a> The Lord hearkened, and heard those who spoke together of His things, and what He heard, as I said, was not distasteful to Him.<a name=328:18></a> How searching as to what we talk about when together!<a name=328:19></a> So the apostle says, "Speaking the truth in love", "<i>in love</i>", that is what will be to His glory.<a name=328:20></a> "Speaking in love", not to show how much we know, but speaking the truth for the truth's sake.<a name=328:21></a> If you read John's second and third epistles you see what he says about the truth.<a name=328:22></a> Love of the truth should mark every one of us, and loving it leads us to speak of it; and we do not dissociate it from the brethren.<a name=328:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then further, "that we may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ".<a name=328:24></a> See how the apostle leads us on.<a name=328:25></a> Growth is necessary

		for apprehending headship; growth in Christ, "that we may grow up to him in all things who is the head".<a name=329:1></a> In speaking the truth in love together we acquire divine sensibilities, such sensibilities as discern the movements of the Head.<a name=329:2></a> Then he goes on, "from whom the whole body fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply".<a name=329:3></a> It is from Christ that all the nourishment flows in this connection, but every joint has its own contribution to make to the whole, for the growth is "according to the working in its measure of each one part"; not one excepted.<a name=329:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I repeat, this is Paul's ministry, the great end of it, that the saints should be set together in those holy bonds growing up to Christ as the Head, and getting all the nourishment which comes from Him, working out through all the members, so that there is increase.<a name=329:5></a> Romans does not give increase, but the man there is just recovered, without any children, so to speak, like David at Ziklag; it says he recovered all.<a name=329:6></a> Then he goes to Hebron and gets children, and at Jerusalem he gets more; a further increase.<a name=329:7></a> So Colossians and Ephesians give increase.<a name=329:8></a> The Man from heaven increases through the body, so that there is a presentation of Christ down here.<a name=329:9></a> Thus Paul closes the passage with this "making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love".<a name=329:10></a> It is self-edifying, or building up in love.<a name=329:11></a> The apostle sets the assembly up here as self-supporting, and thus there is increase, and self-building up in love.<a name=329:12></a> Whilst we cannot look for the collective idea now, it is our privilege to have it as light.<a name=329:13></a> We can look on to the "latter glory"; but the New Testament writers insist on what was "from the beginning".<a name=329:14></a> We do not look for development, but for what was from the beginning and for what is coming out in the future.<a name=329:15></a> What was at the beginning is to take Christ's place during His absence and that is the testimony for us right on to the end.<a name=329:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=399:10></a> The book of Exodus shows that which was pleasing to God.<a name=399:11></a> It says they brought their work to Moses in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#39:42">Exodus  39:42</a>,43.<a name=399:12></a> "According to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work, and Moses did look upon all the work and behold they had done it as the Lord had commanded; even so had they done it, and Moses blessed them".<a name=399:13></a> All the parts of the tabernacle are brought as completed, and it is said they were made as the Lord commanded Moses.<a name=399:14></a> They are brought to Moses, as if to be passed upon, and Moses blessed them.<a name=399:15></a> That is, he blessed the people.<a name=399:16></a> In the next chapter they are all put together; then it says in verse 9: "Thou shalt take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof; and it shall be holy.<a name=399:17></a> And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt-offerings, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar; and it shall be an altar most holy.<a name=399:18></a> And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.<a name=399:19></a> And thou shalt bring

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says further, Moses having set up and anointed everything; "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.<a name=400:5></a> And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle".<a name=400:6></a> Now there you have the dwelling presented as wholly pleasing to God.<a name=400:7></a> Moses had anointed every part of it with the holy oil.<a name=400:8></a> The oil did not represent God dwelling.<a name=400:9></a> It rather represented God's approval of the work.<a name=400:10></a> It was anointed, but then the glory entering in is typical of the divine dwelling; that God had come in Himself, so that the whole tabernacle was filled.<a name=400:11></a> There was nothing there undesirable to God; nothing to cause Him displeasure; He is complacent in all.<a name=400:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the book of Leviticus opens with God speaking out of that.<a name=400:13></a> It says, "The Lord called unto Moses and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation".<a name=400:14></a> It is not out of the tabernacle of <i>witness</i>, but out of the tabernacle of the <i>congregation</i>.<a name=400:15></a> That is to say, that in which He is to meet His people.<a name=400:16></a> So that Leviticus stands on that ground, and I think the passage we read in Peter is a direct allusion to Leviticus, only that Peter is insisting that things are to be <i>spiritual</i>, so he says, "yourselves also as

		This book affords us many features of Christ's position in regard to things on this earth.<a name=476:1></a> As most of us here will be aware, chapters 1 to 3 present the Lord as dealing judicially with "the things that are;" that is, the seven churches; in chapter 4 we have presented to us the Lord sitting on the throne in relation to the creation of God; and chapter 5, from which we have read, introduces Him not sitting <i>on</i> the throne, but standing in the midst of it, and symbolised as a "Lamb as it had been slain".<a name=476:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to speak of Christ in this latter connection because it is Christ in relation to <i>suffering saints</i>.<a name=476:3></a> He Himself had suffered, but He was now in the place of authority, in the midst of the throne.<a name=476:4></a> It is not my thought to open up any prophetic line from these chapters, but to bring before you the relation of Christ to His suffering people.<a name=476:5></a> Another thing that I may remark on is the position of the writer of this book, John, who is not here as an apostle, but as a prophet.<a name=476:6></a> In describing his own exercises and position, he calls himself a brother of the saints and their companion in tribulation; thus, one well qualified to speak to them.<a name=476:7></a>

		I come now to this passage in chapter 5 in order to present the true bearing of the passages in chapters 6, 7 and 8.<a name=478:1></a> John weeps, not on account of his tribulations, for they were his glory, but on account of the fact that there was no one in view, so far as he could see, equal to the task of opening the seals, of opening the book of God's thoughts in regard to this earth.<a name=478:2></a> In other words, John was with God; he was thinking for God; and that was his qualification to speak for God.<a name=478:3></a> He was a man who would weep, not on account of his sufferings, nor even the sufferings of the saints, but because there was no one available, as far as he could see, to open the book and to loose its seals.<a name=478:4></a> Such was John, and like John the baptist, too, he was entirely with God in his exercises.<a name=478:5></a>

		Well now, one of the elders reminds him that he need not weep.<a name=478:6></a> Much sorrow amongst the people of God is occasioned through lack of intelligence.<a name=478:7></a> Did we only know more, and the knowledge is available, for the Son of God has come that we might know Him that is true, did we know more, we should suffer less in this respect.<a name=478:8></a> So the prophet is reminded that he need not weep; the elder says, "Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof".<a name=478:9></a> I want to dwell just upon this glorious Person, known here as "The Lion of the tribe of Juda", because it is an immense thing to be maintained in the sense of victory in our souls, whether it be the victory that Christ has achieved in death, or whether it be the victory of the Holy Spirit in the saints.<a name=478:10></a>

		I am only deducing certain principles for present application, which is perfectly right, for every scripture is profitable in this way.<a name=482:1></a> Suffering, as viewed from God's standpoint, brings about purification, cleansing and holiness; indeed, after it is said of the Lord that He sat down at the right hand of God, having gone through the whole path of faith as a Man here, the word is, "ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:5">Hebrews  12:5</a>).<a name=482:2></a> They had forgotten that God disciplines.<a name=482:3></a> Suffering and persecution may be turned to account in the way of discipline by the Father, and under His hand they become the water of purification; so that we become white and pure in our thoughts, aspirations and hopes, and in our associations.<a name=482:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all these things and more besides develop as we accept suffering from the hand of God.<a name=482:5></a> They are, as it were, in His hand; our sufferings are from the Father of spirits and for our purification.<a name=482:6></a> And so to these souls the word is, "that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled".<a name=482:7></a> Other things have to happen yet; it may seem hard, but it is the divine way, and to those who are subject, who have faith, and accept the will of God, it is His perfect way, and in the sense of this one would not have anything altered.<a name=482:8></a> The will of God must be accomplished, so that it was a question for those slain ones of waiting in patience "until their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled".<a name=482:9></a> In other words, a waiting attitude becomes us, in order that every item of the will of God should be accomplished.<a name=482:10></a>

		One is conscious of needs that cannot be understood or expressed, but He reads the groanings of the Spirit in the saints; He knows how to read the motions produced by the Holy Spirit, but that does not mean that all <i>our</i> prayers are accepted; so the Lord Jesus takes them into His hands and presents them to God.<a name=485:6></a> I think this is very encouraging; not that we would encourage imperfect prayers, for our prayers should be the expression of the Spirit's motions in us.<a name=485:7></a> It is said, "If we know that he hear us .<a name=485:8></a>.<a name=485:9></a>.<a name=485:10></a> we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:15">1 John  5:15</a>).<a name=485:11></a> That would be direct prayer, that He hears, unmixed and acceptable; but being what we are, in a mixed condition, it is as well to admit it, that our prayers are very imperfect, and yet we know that what is sincere and according to God goes up to God, they are not lost.<a name=485:12></a> Such is the system of grace with which we are connected; as it is said, "the throne of grace".<a name=485:13></a> God will rightly interpret any right petition, however imperfectly it may have been expressed.<a name=485:14></a>

		There is a great demand for young men; a great demand for them in the world, and a great demand for them in heaven.<a name=487:1></a> Heaven has its own way of expressing itself, and it takes particular care to secure young men.<a name=487:2></a> We see in Saul of Tarsus a representative of this class.<a name=487:3></a> He is first spoken of in Scripture as "a young man", and as such he was employed in opposition to Christ.<a name=487:4></a> He stood as a witness when Stephen, the martyr of Christ, was stoned.<a name=487:5></a> He was not there merely as an ordinary spectator of an execution; he was there as an enemy of Christ, who had a personal interest in what was happening.<a name=487:6></a> He took account of Stephen as a witness of the Lord Jesus, and he would have none of Christ; he would fain blot out every remembrance of Jesus, and so he had a personal interest in what was happening, as the murderers of that witness of Jesus assailed him with stones.<a name=487:7></a> It is not said <i>he</i> cast a stone, but he was there, and those who did cast stones laid their clothes at his feet.<a name=487:8></a> "The witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul".<a name=487:9></a> But there was a demand in heaven for this young man.<a name=487:10></a> Heaven knew about him; the Lord had His eye on him even before this.<a name=487:11></a> He was in the mind of heaven, and heaven has its eye on such an one, and has a great way of attaining its end.<a name=487:12></a> Heaven has wonderful resources.<a name=487:13></a>

		The first activity of heaven that we find in Scripture involved the opening of its windows, to let out some of its reserves in order that the will of God might be carried out.<a name=487:14></a> These contributed enormously to the deluge.<a name=487:15></a> There were other resources besides, for God controls everything; but let no one assume that God

		So, as the clothes were laid down at Saul's feet, heaven had its eye on him, and heaven was determined to overwhelm him, not in wrath, but in <i>grace</i>, for he was not born in a day of wrath, but in a day of grace, in the accepted time, in the day of salvation.<a name=488:9></a> He was born into such a dispensation.<a name=488:10></a> He was living when Jesus was here in the days of His flesh, but we know he lived after the cross, after the ascension, and after Pentecost; so he came into a dispensation marked by the grace and love of God, a dispensation pervaded by the very atmosphere of heaven, for One had been here great enough to give expression to all that is there, and that One was Jesus.<a name=488:11></a> He gave expression to what was in heaven, and that in face of all the opposition Satan could bring to bear against Him; for no one can dwell on Gethsemane and Calvary without being touched with the greatness of that blessed One who could maintain the grace of

		We see in Zechariah how a young man, thus brought to Christ and set up and employed serviceably, is initiated into the purpose of God and what is to take place in the future, for it is a great mistake for any servant to be merely occupied with what he himself is doing, and the results of his service; the Lord would lead him on to the world to come.<a name=494:12></a> The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews alludes to "the world to come, of which we speak" (chapter 2:5).<a name=494:13></a> Christians in those days spoke of it, and young men coming in today will hear of it, "the habitable world which is to come".<a name=494:14></a> Thank God, we do not care much about the habitable earth that now <i>is</i>.<a name=494:15></a> The inhabitants of the earth cause us pain as we see them, the lowest grades of humanity as well as the most exalted, the hyssop as well as the cedar.<a name=494:16></a> The heart recoils from all that goes on, and looks forward to the habitable world which is to come, where men will all be like Jesus.<a name=494:17></a> Wisdom could rejoice in the habitable part of the earth, looking forward to that day, and so does every believer.<a name=494:18></a> Hence the word in Zechariah is, "Run, speak to this young man".<a name=494:19></a> Is he aspiring to a place in <i>this</i> world, <i>this</i> earth, inhabited as it is?<a name=494:20></a> No, he is not thinking of that, he is thinking of something beyond.<a name=494:21></a> "I lifted up mine eyes", it says,

		Well now, my point is for the moment to show you that it depends on love for Christ, and I selected John's gospel because he says more about love than any of the evangelists.<a name=497:8></a> He says more too, perhaps, about hatred than any of them; he is a man of extremes in a sense, and he presents the things that he speaks of in their absoluteness.<a name=497:9></a> In speaking of love in contrast to hatred he intimates clearly that love is according to Christ and that hatred characterises Antichrist.<a name=497:10></a> It seems to me that Judas is the representative of the anti-Christian spirit; whereas, in a modest way, John presents "the disciple whom Jesus loved" as the expression of the spirit of Christianity.<a name=497:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of the character of <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, it is very suited that these two opposites should appear in it.<a name=497:12></a> I am not saying that other New Testament writers do not speak of love; they all do; Paul is very express about it; he says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:22">1 Corinthians  16:22</a>).<a name=497:13></a> Very strong language this!<a name=497:14></a> It is his way, in one sense, of expressing his estimate of Christ; he had wonderful affection for Christ.<a name=497:15></a> He is speaking to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing to the Ephesians he does not suggest there were any amongst them who did not love Christ.<a name=498:6></a> He had a very great experience of the spiritual affections at Ephesus.<a name=498:7></a> You will all remember how, having called the elders, they embraced him; that is very beautiful!<a name=498:8></a> They loved him.<a name=498:9></a> They felt most of all, it says, that they should see his face no more.<a name=498:10></a> It was a scene to touch the heart.<a name=498:11></a> They loved the apostle, and this was really an evidence that they loved Christ.<a name=498:12></a> He does not therefore suggest that there was a non-lover amongst them; he rather emphasises in his epistle that they had faith in Christ Jesus and love, not only for him, but for <i>all</i> the saints.<a name=498:13></a> It is a wonderful thing to love Christ and <i>all</i> the saints.<a name=498:14></a> At the end of his epistle the apostle remarks, "Grace be with all them who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:24">Ephesians  6:24</a>).<a name=498:15></a> He suggests there the possibility of the existence of love for Christ in insincerity.<a name=498:16></a> I am not prepared to define how it works out in the individual, but the apostle suggests it, and I mention it so that we may inquire what is the character of our love.<a name=498:17></a> Is there an element of corruption there?<a name=498:18></a> He pronounced his benediction on those who loved Christ in "incorruption" (N.<a name=498:19></a>T.<a name=498:20></a>).<a name=498:21></a> Remember that word.<a name=498:22></a>

		So the apostle Paul treats of love very extensively; but, as I was remarking, John uses the word more frequently, he weaves it into the whole fabric of his writings, and on the opposite side you have presented the anti-Christian spirit, and Judas is the father of it.<a name=498:23></a> The reason why I say that Judas is the father of the anti-Christian spirit is that he was with Christ,

		Well now, there was "the disciple whom Jesus loved", he was not acting from the back, he was on <i>Jesus' bosom</i>.<a name=500:6></a> He is reposing in confidence, the confidence begotten of known affection; that was John.<a name=500:7></a> He is pleased modestly to regard himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved, and he rewards the Lord, as it were, for the place He gave to him, for he never tires of calling attention to the love of Christ.<a name=500:8></a> In chapter 14:22 Judas says: "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?<a name=500:9></a>" As to this disciple, the apostle carefully says he was not Iscariot.<a name=500:10></a> It was not that Judas, it was another.<a name=500:11></a> Thank God, there was another Judas.<a name=500:12></a> As I was saying, love for Christ is the great antidote to the anti-Christian spirit, hence chapter 14:21,23 enlarges on the great advantage of loving Christ; "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me", and further the Lord says, "If any man love me, he will keep my words".<a name=500:13></a> These are tests, keeping His commandments and His words.<a name=500:14></a> Besides the former, all the wonderful communications of Christ are treasured in the heart of the lover of Christ.<a name=500:15></a>
