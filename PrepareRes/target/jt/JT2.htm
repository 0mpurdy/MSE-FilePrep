		Exodus closes with the tabernacle set up and filled with the glory of Jehovah.<a name=1:4></a> Wonderful scene!<a name=1:5></a> God, as dwelling there, would be approached and worshipped by man.<a name=1:6></a> This is the ground on which the teaching of Leviticus stands.<a name=1:7></a> The priesthood, although recognised as there, is not brought forward at the outset: it is God placing Himself in such a position as to be approached by those who loved Him.<a name=1:8></a> The priesthood had been instituted in connection with the construction of the tabernacle: this is assumed here, for without the priests the various offerings brought by the people could not be presented to Jehovah.<a name=1:9></a> It is God as in His abode ready (every requisite provided) to receive men according to their appreciation of Christ in the various lights in which He is viewed as walking here on earth, and offering Himself in death in devotedness to God.<a name=1:10></a> Later on Aaron and his sons are formally consecrated.<a name=1:11></a>

		The fourfold view of the sacrifice of Christ, seen here in type, as set forth in the offerings, presents it in its completeness <i>as before God;</i> but each phase has to be apprehended in detail by us.<a name=1:12></a> The relative value of any given offering is according to the spiritual stature of the offerer.<a name=1:13></a> For example, a bullock offered as a burnt offering indicates a large appreciation, on

		In the sin offerings the various animals set forth in type the <i>responsibility</i> of those who offered; these were not freewill offerings -- they were specified; but this, of course, assumed ability to comply with the requirement.<a name=2:6></a> When a trespass offering was required, provision was made for extreme poverty.<a name=2:7></a>

		Chapter 16 before us now stands alone.<a name=3:12></a> It is wider in its bearing, perhaps, than any other chapter in the Old Testament, except <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>.<a name=3:13></a> It sets forth typically the ground, the blood being on the mercy seat, upon which God places Himself in relation to the whole universe in grace.<a name=3:14></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>the ark of the covenant refers to Christ <i>personally</i>, He by whom God effects everything; while in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>it is the efficacy of His <i>death</i> that is in view.<a name=3:15></a> It is universal in its bearing.<a name=3:16></a>

		The gospel refers not only to man, but also to the creation.<a name=3:17></a> The Lord commissioned the apostles to "preach the glad tidings to all the creation".<a name=3:18></a> <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:15">Mark  16:15</a>.<a name=3:19></a> Paul said it had been "proclaimed in the whole creation which is under heaven".<a name=3:20></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:23">Colossians  1:23</a>.<a name=3:21></a> In preaching the gospel, Paul presented the mercy seat.<a name=3:22></a> We should learn how to preach from the example set by the apostles; the Lord taught them how to preach.<a name=3:23></a> The more you advance spiritually the more you get into sympathy with God.<a name=3:24></a> His grace goes out to the whole creation.<a name=3:25></a>

		The blood on the mercy seat presents a very different thought to the blood of the paschal lamb on the door of the Israelite in Egypt.<a name=4:10></a> In the latter the individual is sheltered from the universal judgment: the blood marks off the believer in <i>God's</i> eye from the world.<a name=4:11></a> The Red Sea prefigures God's judgment of the world; the world was judged morally in the death of Christ.<a name=4:12></a> Baptism marks the believer off before <i>man's</i> eye as apart from the evil system in which Satan rules and the flesh lives, and in its moral import is the believer's acceptance of God's judgment of the world, and is thus a testimony to the world that it is judged; but this can have moral force only as the believer walks in the Spirit.<a name=4:13></a> The Spirit brings demonstration to the world "of judgment".<a name=4:14></a> What is in view in the early part of Exodus is to deliver man from the influence of Satan, and to put him into relationship with God on the ground of righteousness;

		As to the order of His ways in Exodus, the people were dealt with in pure grace up to chapter 19.<a name=5:2></a> God may intervene for our deliverance apart from any thought of <i>state</i> in us, but He will not own us as in relationship to Him as His people unless we judge the world and separate from it: "Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing: and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".<a name=5:3></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a>.<a name=5:4></a> Whatever God's thoughts were as to Israel, the people were not His congregation properly till they had crossed the sea.<a name=5:5></a> Baptism severs us <i>publicly</i> from the world; we cannot be regarded as in God's congregation until baptised.<a name=5:6></a> Baptism in its moral force is "the washing of regeneration", and it corresponds to the cleansing judgments which will usher in the world to come; the order of things which will be according to God, and with which He will identify Himself.<a name=5:7></a> He will be God of <i>that</i> world.<a name=5:8></a>

		Salvation takes place here on earth: it is in Christ, and has become effective for man through elements which God has introduced down here, and which operate subjectively.<a name=5:9></a> The elements are "the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost" <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:5">Titus  3:5</a>.<a name=5:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2">Titus  2</a>the grace of God has brought salvation to all men, and in chapter 3 we learn how it is effected practically.<a name=5:11></a> "According to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour".<a name=5:12></a> <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:5">Titus  3:5</a>.<a name=5:13></a> The pouring out of the Spirit refers to Pentecost -- "Poured out on <i>us</i>".<a name=5:14></a> It is collective, and it is through Jesus Christ our <i>Saviour</i>.<a name=5:15></a> The same thing will take place, in principle, in the millennium, <a href="../bible/Joel.htm#2:28">Joel  2:28</a>, 29.<a name=5:16></a>

		Reconciliation refers to all things being taken up in Christ as Man on the ground of redemption.<a name=7:5></a> God is complacent in all.<a name=7:6></a> Propitiation is in the death of Christ; it refers to God as offended and dishonoured by man's sin.<a name=7:7></a> But reconciliation has reference to His affections; He had <i>lost</i> man, and now He has recovered him in Christ.<a name=7:8></a> We are before Him in Christ in all His acceptability.<a name=7:9></a> The headship of Christ involves reconciliation.<a name=7:10></a> Headship is asserted by love.<a name=7:11></a> Christ, having died for all, has established an incontestable claim over all.<a name=7:12></a> He is Head by God's appointment, but He is also Head in virtue of what He is in His own Person, and He recovers everything for God <i>subjectively</i> by the mighty influence of His love.<a name=7:13></a> As Head He makes known the love He bears to us, as having died for us, so that we become captured by Him in our affections, and led in triumph by Him to the Father.<a name=7:14></a>

		It is very noticeable that there is no scape <i>bullock</i>.<a name=8:12></a> This gives rise to a very important distinction between the position of Christians now and that of Israel in the future.<a name=8:13></a> <i>They</i> will know forgiveness only when they see Jesus; that is, when He reappears to them.<a name=8:14></a> Their sins have been put away, as our own, in His death, but they will not <i>know</i> this until He returns.<a name=8:15></a> <i>We</i> know forgiveness <i>by the Spirit</i>.<a name=8:16></a> "The Holy Ghost also is a witness to us".<a name=8:17></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:15">Hebrews  10:15</a>.<a name=8:18></a> Indeed, it is not only so, but we, by the Spirit, are enabled to "see Jesus crowned with glory and honour".<a name=8:19></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:9">Hebrews  2:9</a>.<a name=8:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=48:22></a> I think the fact that they shouted for joy when the foundations of the earth were laid, shows that they were in full sympathy with God in what He had before Him; for in laying the foundations of the earth, God had in view the establishment of all that was in His mind.<a name=48:23></a> The earth was to be the theatre of His ways, and His sons were in sympathy with Him in what He was doing, so that now, as our brother says, it is as sons we enter into God's counsels, and they occasion joy to us.<a name=48:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=75:1></a> The chapter is suggested in connection with the second epistle to Timothy, which the brethren had on their minds.<a name=75:2></a> It may seem singular that we should read a chapter that presents to us the formation of the church originally, whilst what is in the mind of the brethren is a day of ruin, and what should govern us in a day of ruin.<a name=75:3></a> But in order to be for God in a day of ruin we have to see the order which marked the church as established at the outset.<a name=75:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=75:8></a> A remark in the last chapter of the Old Testament is, I think, helpful in this connection, as it was uttered in a day of small things.<a name=75:9></a> The people are called upon to remember the law of Moses which was, with the statutes and judgments, commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel I think it is very suggestive that it should be there; such a reminder in the last chapter of the Old Testament.<a name=75:10></a>

		F.L.<a name=75:11></a> Do you not think that that line of things comes out very much in the Old Testament?<a name=75:12></a> I was thinking with regard to the remnant in Ezra, they could not have rebuilt the house if they had not known what Solomon's house was.<a name=75:13></a> They must have had the divine thought of what it was.<a name=75:14></a> And, too, in Nehemiah when they kept the feast of tabernacles there was no such feast since the days of Joshua.<a name=75:15></a> It is rather on the line of what you were indicating.<a name=75:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=76:20></a> I think one great point in connection with the formation of the church was that the saints were to adhere sedulously to the commandments of Christ.<a name=76:21></a> In chapter 1 He commanded them to tarry at Jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high.<a name=76:22></a> That is to say, they were placed under obligations by His commandments.<a name=76:23></a> Following on the stress the Lord laid on His commandments in the gospel of John, I think it is important to note that the church was formed in that connection.<a name=76:24></a> It was really formed by those who knew how to keep Christ's commandments, and undoubtedly that is the thought of God in the church -- the assembly.<a name=76:25></a> It was to be regulated by Christ's commandments.<a name=76:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=76:30></a> I think its suitability is shown in chapter 1.<a name=76:31></a> That is, they abode by His commandments and acting on a specific commandment in relation to the selection of an apostle, they recognised what had already been written.<a name=76:32></a> There is no need for repetition in the things of God.<a name=76:33></a> They recognised what had been

		F.L.<a name=116:1></a> That is very good; the contrast is very suggestive, and what comes out in that circle is the manifest power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=116:2></a> The whole circle is engaged with the counsels of God concerning Jesus; and the identification of the Holy Spirit comes in by shaking the house with power; and then there is the moral conformity that comes out in the concluding verses, and especially as seen in Barnabas, who shows the spirit of a true Levite.<a name=116:3></a> He becomes a son of consolation; he devotes himself and his substance to the saints.<a name=116:4></a> It would all seem to run in a nice order there.<a name=116:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=116:6></a> So the question would be, and it is a searching question, especially for young believers, as to whether that is the kind of company you would cultivate; a company in which the rights of God are maintained and cherished.<a name=116:7></a> God had anointed Christ, and the world was against Christ, and so the issue was really between God and the world; therefore the prayers uttered in the assembly take that into account.<a name=116:8></a> They speak of Herod and Pilate and the people being arrayed against Christ, whereas those in the assembly are wholly in sympathy with God in regard to the place He had given Christ.<a name=116:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=116:13></a> I feel it is very serious as to those to whom God has given light, because if God continues His testimony for some years, we who have it now will be removed and another generation will have to take our place; so it is a very serious question for us as to whether we are going to hand down to them what we have had handed down to us.<a name=116:14></a> We should see to it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I desire is to seek to engage your hearts with Christ as Speaker.<a name=118:1></a> It is evident that God intended to communicate His thoughts by means of speaking, and therefore He took up different vessels from time to time in order to communicate His mind through them.<a name=118:2></a> So you find in the ways of God there were many speakers, as we are told, "God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets".<a name=118:3></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:1">Hebrews  1:1</a>.<a name=118:4></a> What I wish to make clear is, that now all speaking is by the Son.<a name=118:5></a> As we were saying this afternoon, God has recovered man in sonship, and all that He accomplishes now through man is through him as in sonship, so you will find in the New Testament that all that which God undertook to accomplish before is now taken up afresh and accomplished in permanency by the Son.<a name=118:6></a> There were many things that God undertook to do, such as speaking, writing and building; but, because of the character of the instruments used, imperfection marked everything that had been done, So that you find in the New Testament that God undertakes to do all these things now by the Son.<a name=118:7></a> Whether it be speaking or writing or building or ruling, all is by the Son.<a name=118:8></a> And all that the Son does is done in permanency and perfection.<a name=118:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I wish to engage you with the Son as the Speaker.<a name=118:10></a> He is now the One through whom all communications from God to us are made, and hence I brought the passage in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>to your attention.<a name=118:11></a> The Father's voice is heard from the cloud.<a name=118:12></a> The cloud indicates the Father's house, and it comes into view for the specific purpose of calling attention to the Son as a Speaker.<a name=118:13></a> Moses and Elias (great speakers) were there, but they are withdrawn,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish, if I can, to show you that in the Old Testament in the typical part you get foreshadowings of Christ as Speaker; but what I wish especially to show is, that each man of faith in his closing word to men, set forth some feature of the testimony, and that feature of the testimony was the feature for which he in the ways of God stood personally.<a name=119:5></a> Therefore I shall refer to certain men of faith to show you that that which comes out now fully and perfectly in Christ had been set forth in individuals in the Old Testament.<a name=119:6></a> <i>Now</i> all is established permanently in Christ.<a name=119:7></a> When I choose to speak of the closing addresses of these men, I do so because I believe that the last words of any man embody substantially that which he represented in regard to the testimony of God.<a name=119:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I begin with Noah.<a name=119:9></a> In referring to him one must admit that the last words of Noah recorded were uttered long before his death.<a name=119:10></a> Nevertheless, his last speech, according to Scripture, is in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9">Genesis  9</a>, and it indicates what he stood for personally in the development of the testimony.<a name=119:11></a> That is to say, Noah stood for government.<a name=119:12></a> Noah is a type of Christ in other respects, but he is a type of Him in relation to government, and his pronouncement as to his sons conveys to us what he stood for; he stood for <i>government</i>, and his last recorded statement indicates what came to pass in the government of God in connection with his posterity.<a name=119:13></a> I do not dwell upon Noah, only to indicate that as a speaker he foreshadowed Christ.<a name=119:14></a> He had something to say which had reference to Christ.<a name=119:15></a> He blessed Shem and Japheth and he cursed the posterity of Ham.<a name=119:16></a> The speech is brief, but it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I proceed to call attention to Isaac.<a name=120:2></a> One cannot but refer to Isaac with pleasure.<a name=120:3></a> His name signifies laughter.<a name=120:4></a> Isaac stands for Christ as the One in whom the blessing of God became effectuated.<a name=120:5></a> He superseded his father Abraham.<a name=120:6></a> He was conscious that he was qualified to bless.<a name=120:7></a> I take his utterance in the blessing of Jacob; he was, in type, the vessel of the blessing.<a name=120:8></a> This may be taken as his closing word, for it was spoken in view of his death, and it conveys to us that feature of the testimony which he represented personally.<a name=120:9></a> He was conscious of being the vessel of God's blessing, and he passed it on to Jacob.<a name=120:10></a> So that he was a speaker, and his words conveyed what he stood for.<a name=120:11></a> He stood for the <i>blessing of God</i>.<a name=120:12></a> Isaac is Christ, the heavenly man in resurrection.<a name=120:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to Jacob.<a name=120:14></a> Jacob is the Jew: he is typical of Christ in relation to God's earthly people, in all the trials and vicissitudes of their history.<a name=120:15></a> In all their sorrows and their joys Jacob represents them.<a name=120:16></a> When we come to Jacob as a type we descend to the level of God's people here on earth in their responsibility, Christ with them; the Lord took a place in relation to Israel.<a name=120:17></a> He descended to where they were.<a name=120:18></a> "In all their afflictions he was afflicted".<a name=120:19></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#63:9">Isaiah  63:9</a>.<a name=120:20></a> Jacob represents the Israel of <i>responsibility</i>.<a name=120:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when you come to the closing words of Jacob that is exactly what you find.<a name=120:22></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49">Genesis  49</a>we have recorded from his lips an outline of the history of God's people.<a name=120:23></a> He calls his sons together and he says, "Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days".<a name=120:24></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:1">Genesis  49:1</a>.<a name=120:25></a> And he faithfully outlines, in a prophetic way, from beginning to end, the history of the people.<a name=120:26></a> There was much wickedness; that, for instance, of Reuben; and as to Simeon and Levi, instruments of cruelty

		My thought in reading these passages is to seek to call attention to Christ as the One who brings in the rest of God.<a name=252:1></a> It appears to me that the thought of the rest of God should be continually maintained in the affections of the saints, and what encourages me in that thought is that God, in establishing His covenant with Israel, made it a specific provision that there should be the recognition of the sabbath.<a name=252:2></a> He assigned two reasons why the sabbath should be kept: the first in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#31:17">Exodus  31:17</a>, and the second in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#5:15">Deuteronomy  5:15</a>.<a name=252:3></a> In the book of Exodus it is that on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed; whereas in the book of Deuteronomy -- the point of which book is God's love for His people -- you get the sabbath connected with the deliverance of the people out of Egypt.<a name=252:4></a> So that there are two distinct reasons why the saints of God should maintain in their affections the thought of His rest.<a name=252:5></a> The first, as I suggested, is that the earth upon which we live, the heavens over us with all their beneficent influence upon us, were created by God; and, having created all, "he rested, and was refreshed".<a name=252:6></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#31:17">Exodus  31:17</a>.<a name=252:7></a> The second is, that God in His love to us came down in Christ to where we were, as steeped in the depths of iniquity, and in bondage to the god of this world, and effected our deliverance.<a name=252:8></a> So that there is every incentive to the people of God to recognise His sabbath.<a name=252:9></a> Now notice, it is not <i>man's</i> sabbath; although the Lord in the gospels tells us that the sabbath was made for man, in the types the sabbath is God's sabbath.<a name=252:10></a> "My sabbath", He says, and what I think it points to is <i>Christ</i>.<a name=252:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		remember that in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>, where Jehovah institutes His feasts, the sabbath stands at the head of the list, and, as I said, I think it points to Christ.<a name=253:1></a> When Christ was here the Father took occasion to intimate that His soul rested in that Man, and as He appears under the eye of God, His soul is refreshed!<a name=253:2></a> That is a sign to us, and a sign perpetually, that God will rest universally, so that in our souls we cling to the sabbath, to Christ, as the One in whom God rests and is refreshed.<a name=253:3></a> Therefore I think it should be a matter of profound interest to us that God has His rest; so that, although we share in it, the point in the types is that it is <i>God's</i> rest, "my sabbath".<a name=253:4></a> Thus in cherishing Christ in our souls in that light, it is that He is <i>God's</i> rest, and in result both God and His people will rest; indeed, the whole moral system will rest perpetually in Christ.<a name=253:5></a>

		Now I am encouraged to take account of Noah as foreshadowing Christ in this light.<a name=253:6></a> His name signifies (as the margin reads) <i>rest</i> or <i>comfort</i>.<a name=253:7></a> Noah prefigures Christ in other respects, but He prefigures Him as the One who will introduce that in which God will rest.<a name=253:8></a> You will notice what his parents say.<a name=253:9></a> We read, "Lamech .<a name=253:10></a>.<a name=253:11></a>.<a name=253:12></a> called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:29">Genesis  5:29</a>.<a name=253:13></a> Now I desire that each believer should get a glimpse of Christ in this light, for it was what Lamech saw in Noah.<a name=253:14></a> He saw Christ dimly in his son.<a name=253:15></a> I wonder if you see Christ in that light.<a name=253:16></a> In order to have a full and right view of Christ you have to see Him in all the characters which represent Him in the Old Testament.<a name=253:17></a> No one character could fully set forth Christ.<a name=253:18></a> Noah only sets forth one phase of the blessed Person of Christ.<a name=253:19></a> You require to have them all if you wish to have a full understanding of the Lord.<a name=253:20></a>

		In chapter 35 the house is marked by divine communications -- God speaks there.<a name=300:1></a> After long wanderings, Jacob learns something of his own crooked character, and on returning from Padan-aram God meets him, and Jacob has his name changed: he is now Israel, for he has power with God and with man, and has prevailed.<a name=300:2></a> This new name involves the possession of the Spirit, for it is only by the Spirit that such a name can be maintained.<a name=300:3></a> Now Jacob is qualified for the house, but instead of going there, alas, he goes to Shechem.<a name=300:4></a> These chapters are intensely important as indicating the believer's soul-history.<a name=300:5></a> Jacob had a crooked path: he had acquired much substance in the East, and on returning he would make a good show before Esau his brother: "I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight".<a name=300:6></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:5">Genesis  32:5</a>.<a name=300:7></a> But all Jacob's belongings having gone over the brook, he is left alone; God meets him, and Jacob is crippled.<a name=300:8></a> God was thinking of Jacob, not of his flocks.<a name=300:9></a> Jacob is crippled, but he is now a prince; you must be a prince in God's account in order to have a place in His house.<a name=300:10></a> Nature can never qualify us for divine things.<a name=300:11></a> Discipline prepares us for a divinely given name, and by the power of the Spirit that name is practically set forth in us.<a name=300:12></a> Dignity marks the house of God.<a name=300:13></a>

		Instead of going to Bethel after receiving his new name, Jacob, as we have said, went to Shechem, and here he gets into trouble and disgrace.<a name=300:14></a> Now God says to him, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there".<a name=300:15></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35:1">Genesis  35:1</a>.<a name=300:16></a> Jacob responds, and now note: the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about him.<a name=300:17></a> It is remarkable that when a believer turns his face to the house, God is against his enemies.<a name=300:18></a>

		When the divine command is given to go up to Bethel, Jacob commands that the idols be buried; he recognises the holiness of God's house.<a name=301:1></a> At Bethel he rears up an altar to God, and calls it El-beth-el.<a name=301:2></a> He thus recognises, not only that God has a house, but also that God is <i>paramount</i> there, for his altar meant, "God of the house of God".<a name=301:3></a>

		Believers may have the Holy Spirit, and yet not go in for the full enjoyment involved in the house.<a name=301:14></a> Jacob did not go to Bethel at once after receiving the blessing, but, as we have said, went to Shechem, and indeed in Succoth he built <i>himself</i> a house.<a name=301:15></a> Under such conditions the believer may allow much that is of the nature of idolatry, as we see with Jacob here; but coming into the circle of the saints, where God dwells, we are ashamed of these things.<a name=301:16></a> Jacob buried all his idols under the oak at Shechem.<a name=301:17></a>

		My thought is to say a word about light.<a name=309:1></a> Inasmuch as it was the first element which God introduced to bring order out of chaos, its importance is evident; that is, its importance in the moral order of things; for facts and principles that appear in the material creation are illustrative, and indeed typical, of what we find in the order in which God brings to pass a moral system that is for His pleasure.<a name=309:2></a>

		"God said, Let there be light".<a name=309:3></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:3">Genesis  1:3</a>.<a name=309:4></a> It was a command, and what God commands is absolutely necessary.<a name=309:5></a> This is evident here; and it is also evident in the New Testament where this passage is connected with the gospel: "God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>.<a name=309:6></a> God had, in Old Testament times, dwelt in thick darkness, but now has commanded light, and this is the light of His own glory in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=309:7></a> This great light shines now upon the earth.<a name=309:8></a> It takes the form of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=309:9></a> The effect of the light of God is to set things in the moral system in motion; received into the soul of man, it sets him in movement.<a name=309:10></a> God having introduced light in the Person of Christ, for "in him was life, and the life was the light of men", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>; the effect was to set the souls of men in motion.<a name=309:11></a>

		Now the light being introduced, there is development, and this begins with the <i>first day</i>.<a name=309:12></a> Note that, as presented in Scripture, the day begins with the evening; not with the morning, as we regard it ordinarily; "the evening and the morning were the first day".<a name=309:13></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:5">Genesis  1:5</a>.<a name=309:14></a> This corresponds with the experience of the believer; light, coming into his soul, is regarded as <i>good</i>, but it exposes a horrible state there, and hence a period of darkness follows.<a name=309:15></a> It is not a darkness

		Scripture affords illustrations of this, as, for instance, Abraham and Jacob.<a name=310:2></a> God, in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>, gave Abraham much light as to his seed, and immediately he has to go through his evening.<a name=310:3></a> "When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abraham; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:12">Genesis  15:12</a>.<a name=310:4></a> Sunset is the end of the day in the experience of our souls; and the evening introduces a new chapter in our history, and this eventuates in another morning.<a name=310:5></a> For the Christian each morning is found in Christ risen.<a name=310:6></a> This goes on until we reach the seventh day, which has no evening.<a name=310:7></a> The smoking furnace and the burning lamp between the pieces of the sacrifices were the answer to the darkness through which Abraham passed.<a name=310:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now as to Jacob.<a name=310:9></a> After obtaining the blessing from Isaac, he had his night on his way to Padan-aram he tarried in a place and "the sun was set"; but he had his morning in the light of heaven.<a name=310:10></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>.<a name=310:11></a> Thus Jacob counted "one day" in his spiritual history.<a name=310:12></a> Returning from the east, he has another day.<a name=310:13></a> He had the night of wrestling at Penuel, and "the sun rose upon him" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:31">Genesis  32:31</a>.<a name=310:14></a>

		Many other illustrations of this principle might be adduced from the Old Testament.<a name=310:15></a> And in the New Testament Saul of Tarsus is an excellent example.<a name=310:16></a> The principle has, indeed, an unvarying application where God's work is concerned; for God's work has in view the establishment of permanent order and blessing where darkness and disorder had prevailed.<a name=310:17></a> It is clear that if we are to reach the seventh day in the history of our souls, we must traverse the six previous days; and each day begins with the evening.<a name=310:18></a> The evening of each day, which follows upon the

		Having dwelt upon the light, and the divine command that there should be the evening and morning, as forming the first day which followed, I wish now to speak of the light in the heavens, spoken of in verse 8.<a name=311:7></a> You will notice that in verse 4 it is said that God divided the light from the darkness; whereas in verse 18 the lights set in the heavens are said to do this.<a name=311:8></a> What is said of the fourth day has reference to Christ in heaven.<a name=311:9></a> Going out of the world through death, the Lord left it in total darkness; but in resurrection He has inaugurated a new order of things, and the light is in this.<a name=311:10></a> Having gone into heaven, He sent down the Holy Spirit, who formed a sphere in which the light was truly separate from the darkness.<a name=311:11></a> There had been light in connection with Judaism, but the death of Christ put an end to that.<a name=311:12></a> The Lord left that system in dense darkness, but He placed the light elsewhere.<a name=311:13></a>

		In this chapter we have the groundwork of what follows: that is, the death and resurrection of Christ, and His ascension; and, as a consequence of this, His Spirit here on earth.<a name=321:3></a>

		Elijah is, typically, Christ as in the midst of Israel, and his movements from one point to another indicate how fully God took account of the breakdown of the nation as having been set up in responsibility.<a name=321:4></a> Each point visited by Elijah and Elisha spoke of some particular feature of God's testimony as it had been developed in connection with the people, and they had failed in respect of all.<a name=321:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Gilgal there was a testimony to God's power over death -- the twelve stones from the bed of Jordan were placed there; and there the reproach of Egypt was rolled away -- circumcision took place.<a name=321:6></a> Bethel spoke of God's faithfulness, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>; and God's house had been in Israel.<a name=321:7></a> Jericho had been the seat of the enemy's power as possessing the land of Canaan, but God overthrew it.<a name=321:8></a> In the movements of Elijah here God is showing that He remembered the wideness of His love for Israel, and that He had fully judged their utter unfaithfulness in regard to Him.<a name=321:9></a> All this may be seen in the Lord's position as presented in the Gospels.<a name=321:10></a> But He died and rose again, so that where law had failed, grace should triumph.<a name=321:11></a> This latter the following chapters in this book set forth in type.<a name=321:12></a>

		Elisha now undertakes the journey travelled by Elijah, but in the reverse way.<a name=322:20></a> Jordan is thrown back again by the power of the God of Elijah.<a name=322:21></a> The power that wrought in Christ, when God raised Him from the dead, works in us.<a name=322:22></a> Elisha rends his clothes in two pieces -- it was discarding himself for the man he had seen going up.<a name=322:23></a> He takes up the mantle of Elijah.<a name=322:24></a> It was the mantle of Elijah that fell from him.<a name=322:25></a> We have to note this.<a name=322:26></a> It is the character of

		Elisha returns to Jericho, and the ministry of grace begins.<a name=323:5></a> The marks of the curse were there but all is changed by Elisha.<a name=323:6></a> The situation of the city was pleasant, but the water was naught, and the ground was barren.<a name=323:7></a> Elisha asks for a <i>new</i> cruse.<a name=323:8></a> In Christianity, the vessels used are entirely new.<a name=323:9></a> Salt refers to the purifying and preservative character of God's grace as active in the midst of a world where the curse had been.<a name=323:10></a> Healing takes place at the fountain-head.<a name=323:11></a>

		The sons of the prophets were not opposed to the testimony but here they show the unbelieving state of their hearts by suggesting to Elisha that his master may have been somewhere on earth, whereas he had gone up to heaven.<a name=323:12></a> They had been content to remain at Jericho when Elijah and Elisha were crossing the Jordan.<a name=323:13></a> They viewed the wonderful spectacle "afar off".<a name=323:14></a> A corresponding state is often seen among God's people, but it is marked by unbelief as to the fulness and greatness of the truth.<a name=323:15></a> A Man is in heaven as having accomplished redemption.<a name=323:16></a> The Spirit of that heavenly One indwells, and marks others here on earth.<a name=323:17></a> The suggestion of the sons of the prophets would deny the heavenly side of the truth.<a name=323:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=325:4></a> In order that we may see the position of Elisha it may be well perhaps to revert a little to chapter 2 again; I refer to the journey he took from Jordan to Samaria.<a name=325:5></a> It says, "From thence he returned to Samaria" <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2:25">2 Kings  2:25</a>; the chapter presents to us Elisha in Samaria, which, I think, spiritually is the scene of testimony.<a name=325:6></a> I believe that whilst Elisha represents the spirit of Christ active here in grace, we may also see in him that discipline that marked the vessels of the testimony.<a name=325:7></a> He has to traverse the whole journey taken by Elijah and himself, only in the reverse way.<a name=325:8></a> He went from Jericho to Bethel, from Bethel to Mount Carmel and from Mount Carmel to Samaria.<a name=325:9></a> These afford additional instruction as to the vessel, or vessels, in which the testimony of the gospel was rendered historically.<a name=325:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=443:1></a> This chapter presents the final resting-place of the ark.<a name=443:2></a> The staves were drawn out, indicating that it would never need to be carried again.<a name=443:3></a>

		It might be well for us to notice that the temple, and even Solomon himself, and the order of things that obtained under him, were the outcome of David's faith and energy so that 1 Chronicles, it seems to me, covers rather the present period of time.<a name=443:9></a> It is a transitional period.<a name=443:10></a> The ark was taken care of, but not yet in its final resting-place; and there was great activity on the part of David in connection with it and the order of service in the house, which, I think, points to the present time.<a name=443:11></a> The Lord is now arranging all these things, and the time of display is coming when they will be presented in perfection.<a name=443:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=443:16></a> Yes.<a name=443:17></a> You cannot but be struck in reading 1 Chronicles with the excessive energy of David in relation to the house and the order of service in it, and yet the house was not built so that it would seem to me that the present period is <i>morally</i> greater than the millennial state of things, because the millennial state of things is rather the outcome of the wisdom and energy of Christ, which appear now.<a name=443:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=443:19></a> It would appear that the rebellion, the attempted substitution of Adonijah for Solomon, was serious in the eyes of David, because it interfered with the very thing that was being effected for the house.<a name=443:20></a> Everything centred in Solomon.<a name=443:21></a> You do

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is laid upon my heart to say a word in regard to God's will, feeling that it becomes the test to men, and hence to us.<a name=487:1></a> One feels especially encouraged to call attention to it in view of existing conditions, for it is the question really raised at the present moment amongst God's people: that is, Is God's will or man's will to rule?<a name=487:2></a> What is noticeable in the passage I have read is, that all that is contrary to God's will has to be removed; whereas, on the other hand, he who does the will of God abides for ever.<a name=487:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John does not here raise the question as to <i>where</i> he is to abide, but he habitually refers to the sphere created by God for man, and he thinks of it as a sphere of blessing, and a sphere in which God's will is to be paramount.<a name=487:4></a> Evidently, if God creates a sphere, He creates it for His own pleasure, and He intends that it is to be dominated by His will; and all who are not at agreement with His will have to go, for God will not brook any disagreement.<a name=487:5></a> It is well for people to make their minds up as to this.<a name=487:6></a> God will not admit of any divergence from His will.<a name=487:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will find if you trace it in Scripture that this is so, and what specially marked Christ was, that in becoming Man He recognises the principle of absolute submission to God's will.<a name=487:8></a> He came into the sphere designed for man, and that was His first object; He would at all cost recognise God's will.<a name=487:9></a> As we have been seeing already, He found the law, which was the expression of God's will, disregarded; but He says, "Thy law is within my heart".<a name=487:10></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:8">Psalm  40:8</a>.<a name=487:11></a> In a way I know of nothing that brings out the faithfulness of Christ, and what He was as a perfect Man, more than that.<a name=487:12></a> He had in His soul before God the idea of what man's place was, and that is, that man was to be subject to God.<a name=487:13></a>

		<a name=488>[Page 488]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only did He keep the law Himself, but He brings in a generation who keep it also.<a name=488:2></a> I think if there is one thing more than another that brings out who Christ is, it is that He is capable of bringing into God's world a generation of people who love His law.<a name=488:3></a> You remember how that directly He begins to teach His disciples He taught them how to pray, and what He had in view was the production of a race which should be according to Himself, loving the will of God.<a name=488:4></a> He says, "pray ye, Our Father .<a name=488:5></a>.<a name=488:6></a>.<a name=488:7></a> thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:9">Matthew  6:9</a>,10.<a name=488:8></a> The Lord was perfectly cognisant of what existed in heaven.<a name=488:9></a> God's will was not contravened in heaven, but it was on earth, So His thought was to form His disciples in accordance with God's will, and hence their petition was to be, "Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven".<a name=488:10></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:10">Matthew  6:10</a>.<a name=488:11></a> And I think that this desire is what the Spirit of God produces in <i>us</i>.<a name=488:12></a> But I will come to that presently.<a name=488:13></a>

		I was saying that if you search the Scriptures you will find that in every new departure in God's ways there was something that indicated His will, and whatever it may have been, it became the test for the moment.<a name=488:14></a> It takes a very little thing to indicate what God's will may be, and it takes also a very little thing to indicate that it is man's intention to disregard it.<a name=488:15></a> You find this at the very outset.<a name=488:16></a> Eden was designed for man; it was a garden of delights, in every way representing the goodness of God; but there was one element there that was a testimony to God's rights; God planted one tree there, which was a witness to His rights.<a name=488:17></a> He planted another, a witness to His counsels; the tree of life was a witness to His counsels, but He also planted a tree there which was a witness to His rights, the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and what was a

		Now you see that what the apostle John states in the passage I read is fully verified in what took place.<a name=489:8></a> Adam did not "abide for ever".<a name=489:9></a> He was driven out because he did not regard God's will, and so it is, that unless there is recognition of God's will in any given sphere of blessedness (and there is at the present time a sphere of blessedness ordained of God) those who do not recognise His will must go out.<a name=489:10></a> It is not a question of what your brethren may think of you, but of the unalterable principles of God's government.<a name=489:11></a> Adam was driven out because he did not recognise God's will.<a name=489:12></a> And this we find all through the Scriptures.<a name=489:13></a> You will find that in every departure in God's ways, in every new phase of the testimony, there was always some thing that indicated that God's will must prevail.<a name=489:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have been speaking of the law given to Moses, which was in an especial way the testimony on the part of God to His rights.<a name=489:15></a> It was not a negative law like that given to Adam; it contained <i>positive</i> requirements.<a name=489:16></a> It was one of two testimonies.<a name=489:17></a> There were two great witnesses in the Old Testament first, the law, and secondly, the prophets.<a name=489:18></a> I do not know if we have considered them much in that light, but it is clear from the New Testament that these are the two great witnesses to men in the Old Testament.<a name=489:19></a>

		It is remarkable that there were <i>so many</i> prophets.<a name=490:4></a> I have often wondered why there were so many.<a name=490:5></a> You would think Isaiah said so much, and Jeremiah and Ezekiel, that these three would be sufficient, but it is very interesting to see that there are so many, and there were a great many more prophets than those who have written.<a name=490:6></a> There were prophets who spoke, whose words are not recorded.<a name=490:7></a> The prophets have a voice.<a name=490:8></a> I believe the voice of the prophets, in one respect, is the patience of God, God's long-suffering.<a name=490:9></a> It tries a man to get up early.<a name=490:10></a> God states several times, in figure, of course, that He rose up early to send prophets.<a name=490:11></a> It does not say this as to the law, but He rose up early to send prophets; a striking testimony to His patience.<a name=490:12></a> The people departed from Him and from blessing, and hence He recalls them.<a name=490:13></a> He gets up early to send prophets to them to recall them to what was a standing witness to His rights.<a name=490:14></a> The permanent testimony to God's rights in the Old Testament is the law.<a name=490:15></a> We were saying that Israel did not keep it, and hence God made an ark in which to treasure it so that the ark was the depository of His law.<a name=490:16></a> The ark is a most remarkable type of Christ in many ways, but especially in this, that it is the treasury of God's law, that in which God's law was preserved when men could not keep it.<a name=490:17></a>

		But what I want to say, as briefly as I can, is that the Lord Jesus Christ has taken up the testimony, He has taken up the law, He has treasured it in His heart; He came to fulfil it, and that one jot or tittle of it should not fail.<a name=490:18></a> Moreover, what He proposes to do is to bring in a generation of law-abiding people.<a name=490:19></a> We were speaking about the Son

		Now I would say one word in regard to prayer, and that is, that God does not <i>always</i> answer prayer immediately, because He puts your heart to the test as to whether you really value what you ask for.<a name=491:11></a> As an example, Jacob requested from Jehovah in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32">Genesis  32</a>that He would reveal His name to him.<a name=491:12></a> He says "What is thy name?<a name=491:13></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:27">Genesis  32:27</a>.<a name=491:14></a> God had asked Jacob for <i>his</i> name, and he told Him that his name was Jacob.<a name=491:15></a> Jacob in turn asked God for His name and God says, "Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?<a name=491:16></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:29">Genesis  32:29</a>.<a name=491:17></a> It is well for us to have our interest aroused as to something of God that we are not acquainted with, because directly our interest is awakened as to something we do not know, we <i>ask</i>.<a name=491:18></a> God does not answer Jacob's request until <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35">Genesis  35</a>.<a name=491:19></a> He waited until then, and in that chapter God answers him in His own time.<a name=491:20></a>

		We are accustomed to the term "God Almighty", but it was a wonderful thing for Jacob to have a God like that, it means that He <i>is Almighty</i>.<a name=492:10></a> He is able to do everything to accomplish His counsels, and to do everything needed for our good, and He revealed His name to Jacob <i>in His house</i>.<a name=492:11></a> I do not know of a chapter that is, in a way, more helpful to believers than <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35">Genesis  35</a>.<a name=492:12></a> I think it shows how God directs His people into a sphere in which His interests are, and where His will is paramount.<a name=492:13></a> God says to Jacob, "Go up to Bethel", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35:1">Genesis  35:1</a> and directly Jacob crossed its threshold he recognises that God is the God of it; he rears up an altar to God in Bethel and he names it El-bethel.<a name=492:14></a> He is now in God's sphere where God's will is supreme.<a name=492:15></a> God is not the God of Shechem, but He is the God of Bethel.<a name=492:16></a> He rules there.<a name=492:17></a> If you come into the house of God remember that His will is paramount there.<a name=492:18></a> Now Jacob recognises that in his altar, and God answers his question there.<a name=492:19></a> He says, "I am God Almighty", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35:11">Genesis  35:11</a>) and He tells Jacob that he would be multiplied, not after the flesh, indeed, but in the power of resurrection.<a name=492:20></a> He would be multiplied by God Almighty.<a name=492:21></a> The answer to all this will be seen for us in the future on the principle of resurrection.<a name=492:22></a> But I do not dwell on that now, I only referred to it in connection with prayer.<a name=492:23></a>

		The disciples professed not to know how to pray, so they asked the Lord to teach them, and He taught them according to what was in His own heart.<a name=493:1></a> He had before His heart the formation of a generation of people like Himself, a people who would adhere to the will of God.<a name=493:2></a> Such is the generation that Christ left in this world.<a name=493:3></a> He did not find them here.<a name=493:4></a> He found the law disregarded by men; there was nobody treasuring it.<a name=493:5></a> He took it up and placed it in His heart and He left here a generation of people who love God's law, who love the will of God.<a name=493:6></a> They had been taught by Him to pray that God's will should be done on earth as it is in heaven.<a name=493:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=495:2></a> I had in mind to suggest 1 Kings as foreshadowing the greatness and grandeur of the millennial state of things; but I felt that if we were occupied exclusively with that we should miss that which is more immediately connected with ourselves; that is to say, with the saints of the present moment; and therefore I felt it was but right that we should make the connection with the gospel of John.<a name=495:3></a> The way in which the Father's house is spoken of there seems to connect it with the saints viewed in relation to God, either as sons or as children.<a name=495:4></a> The point in John is the family.<a name=495:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#1:5">Deuteronomy  1:5</a> - 8; <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#26:1">Deuteronomy  26:1</a> - 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps one might say that there are few books in the Bible less understood than the book of Deuteronomy; and I think it is because the assembly is not understood; for, I take it, that Deuteronomy contains regulations for the assembly.<a name=509:1></a> You will notice in chapter 1:5, that Moses speaks of a second law.<a name=509:2></a> He had given the first one in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>.<a name=509:3></a> The first law was largely intended to regulate the people in the wilderness.<a name=509:4></a> There were many regulations for the wilderness the force of which, of necessity, ceased after the wilderness journey was over; but what you find in the book of Deuteronomy are instructions for the people, which were to be permanent; laws which applied to them only as in the land.<a name=509:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is to my mind of great importance that that thought should be laid hold of.<a name=509:6></a> You will notice that, after speaking of the law given in the land of Moab, the Spirit proceeds to indicate the character of it; "The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.<a name=509:7></a> Behold I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them", <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#1:6">Deuteronomy  1:6</a> - 8.<a name=509:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God took account of the people in the wilderness; He knew perfectly what the wilderness was.<a name=509:9></a> It was not a land flowing with milk and honey.<a name=509:10></a> The people had been there forty years, and in the kindness of His heart God suggested to them to move on.<a name=509:11></a> He

		<a name=510>[Page 510]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		said, You have been at the mount long enough.<a name=510:1></a> It is true that this had been said at Horeb, but the generation to which the first law was given never answered to it, so here it is set at the beginning of the second law, which is spoken to another generation.<a name=510:2></a> I allude to it just for a moment, for one is forced to the conclusion that the people of God are more content in the wilderness than in the land, and, if not in the wilderness strictly, at any rate, in the plains of Moab.<a name=510:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there was no law for the plains of Moab; the second law, alluded to here, was given there, but it did not apply to the plains of Moab; it applied to the land of Canaan, and it is most touching that God, through Moses, should proceed to suggest to the people that they move on, opening up to them the entire extent of the promised land.<a name=510:4></a> That is what the Spirit of God would seek to do for us.<a name=510:5></a> The resurrection and ascension of Christ secures for man at the present moment what answers spiritually to the entire extent of the land of promise, from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, including the valleys and the hills; Lebanon and the sea-shore; a land flowing with milk and honey; a land watered with the rain from heaven; a land influenced by heaven itself; that land is opened up to the people of God at the present moment, and it is most touching that Jehovah, in opening up His second law, in giving the regulations for the land, should suggest to them to go in.<a name=510:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I would suggest to all here, that, inasmuch as the Lord Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and is ascended as Man, it entitles man to the land of promise.<a name=510:7></a> The time will come when God will discriminate; some of His people will remain upon the earth, while others will inhabit heaven.<a name=510:8></a> But the Lord Jesus Christ has gone into heaven as a risen Man; He has taken up a place as Man beyond

		death, and the place He occupies indicates God's mind for man.<a name=511:1></a> There is nothing limited; the whole land, from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, is opened up to man.<a name=511:2></a> It opens out a wonderful vista.<a name=511:3></a> Moses did not put his feet there, but he <i>saw</i> it.<a name=511:4></a> It is a wonderful thing to get a glimpse of the land of promise.<a name=511:5></a> All these things were spoken in the plains of Moab.<a name=511:6></a> Moses saw the land from Moab, but never put his feet there until he appeared with Christ on the mount of transfiguration.<a name=511:7></a> That was when Moses got into the land of Canaan.<a name=511:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now beloved friends, where are we?<a name=511:9></a> The plains of Moab is a most desirable place for a certain state of soul in Christians.<a name=511:10></a> The Israelite that inhabited the plains of Moab had the Spirit typically, and was an intelligent believer, but he dwelt in the land in which there was no law.<a name=511:11></a> Moab was not strictly the wilderness, and the regulations given in relation to the tabernacle did not extend beyond the brazen serpent; and the second law, given subsequently, refers to Canaan.<a name=511:12></a> You will get no help from God, no specific directions from God, as dwelling in the plains of Moab.<a name=511:13></a> People who dwell there are Christians; they have title to Canaan, but they do not go there, and, inasmuch as they have no regulations from God, they make regulations for themselves, they formulate codes of laws for themselves; these laws are especially fitted for them, but they are not God's laws.<a name=511:14></a> Now God begins His law by directing His people to move into Canaan, and He opens up the entire extent of the land of promise to them.<a name=511:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I was saying that Deuteronomy corresponds with the assembly in a sense.<a name=511:16></a> One could easily show that from different passages.<a name=511:17></a> I refer to one particularly in chapter 15, in which Jehovah enjoins the people, all the males, to appear before Him three times in the year.<a name=511:18></a> Now I take it that when the Spirit of God specifies the males among His people He
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=512>[Page 512]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		alludes to the saints viewed as formed in the intelligence of the Spirit, and hence they represent the whole.<a name=512:1></a> They were to appear three times in the year.<a name=512:2></a> I venture to connect it with the Lord's request in regard to the Lord's supper.<a name=512:3></a> It may be inquired, Why three times?<a name=512:4></a> I believe that three is an adequate testimony, and in the threefold appearance of all the males of Israel in the presence of Jehovah you have an adequate testimony of their affections, affections formed by the Spirit of God, and they are not on the wane.<a name=512:5></a> If they only appeared once or twice one might conclude that their affections were declining; but inasmuch as they were to appear three times in the year it indicates how Jehovah would secure for Himself the affections of His people.<a name=512:6></a> As often as they responded there was a positive testimony to sustained affections.<a name=512:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think that it is in that way the Lord maintains us.<a name=512:8></a> We do not come three times in the year only; we come on the first day of every week in answer to the request of our Lord.<a name=512:9></a> Every Christian who neglects the Supper virtually confesses that he has no affection for Christ.<a name=512:10></a> It is impossible for one who really has affection for Christ, and who rightly understands the Supper, to neglect it.<a name=512:11></a> Therefore the Supper was to be a continual law, so to say.<a name=512:12></a> It was to be permanent during the absence of Christ.<a name=512:13></a> It was to afford an opportunity for the saints to attest their affection for the Lord.<a name=512:14></a> But what I wish specially to call attention to is that in the assembly there is a witness to resurrection.<a name=512:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say, for the moment, that the assembly itself is that, although that is also true, but what I see in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#26">Deuteronomy  26</a>is that, as the Lord's people appear before God they do not appear in their own nakedness; they appear with that in evidence which is an obvious testimony to Christ in resurrection, the basket of firstfruits.<a name=512:16></a> That is what I had specially

	<div class="paragraph">
		before my mind, but I would like to encourage you first of all in regard to the assembly.<a name=513:1></a> As the resurrection of Christ is realised and laid hold of in the soul one is led to the assembly, and once there, you are under the law that is to regulate the assembly.<a name=513:2></a> I would impress you with that, because we are living in a most lawless age; and I would point out again that the law that is to regulate you in your individual conduct is not the law that is to regulate you in the assembly.<a name=513:3></a> There are regulations for the assembly that have no reference to the wilderness; and there are regulations for the wilderness which have no reference to the assembly.<a name=513:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most important, if we are to walk together, and if we are to maintain the order that belongs to God, and to God's house, that we should recognise that there is a code of laws, so to speak, which regulate the assembly.<a name=513:5></a> Those laws are of a unique character; as I have already pointed out, they begin with directing the saints to go in, and that in itself suggests a great deal.<a name=513:6></a> They are of a unique character; in truth, because it is the law of new creation.<a name=513:7></a> Who can tell anything about the law of new creation?<a name=513:8></a> Certainly none but those who are created anew.<a name=513:9></a> The apostle says, "neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but new creation.<a name=513:10></a> And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them, and mercy", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:16">Galatians  6:16</a>.<a name=513:11></a> Is that your rule?<a name=513:12></a> It is a rule that is altogether outside of the ken of man in the flesh.<a name=513:13></a> He may know something of the law given at Sinai, but the law of new creation is outside of him.<a name=513:14></a> The law that rules in God's world is altogether and absolutely outside of the knowledge of man in the flesh for "neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision",
