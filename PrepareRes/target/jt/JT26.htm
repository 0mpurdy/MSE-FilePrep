		R.S.<a name=1:1></a>S.<a name=1:2></a> It has been thought that it would be helpful to consider something in connection with what is due to God.<a name=1:3></a> I am sure that we would all desire to be more characterised by taking account of this.<a name=1:4></a> It is natural, for us to consider things connected with ourselves, and our own blessings, but is it not true that when we begin to consider for God, we make a distinct advance in our souls?<a name=1:5></a> "Thy praise our service is".<a name=1:6></a> When we think of the pleasure of God we naturally turn to a scripture like <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8">Genesis  8</a>, where Noah was coming out of the ark, and God was making a new beguiling altogether, and where Noah offered burnt-offerings of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl.<a name=1:7></a> Of every kind Noah made an offering.<a name=1:8></a> Of the clean there were seven pairs, showing that God had anticipated this event before Noah went into the ark.<a name=1:9></a> "Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens .<a name=1:10></a>.<a name=1:11></a>.<a name=1:12></a> .<a name=1:13></a>.<a name=1:14></a> and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female; of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female".<a name=1:15></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#7:2">Genesis  7:2</a>,3.<a name=1:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=1:17></a> What seems interesting in this connection is the trustworthiness of the man into whose hands things were committed.<a name=1:18></a> In chapter 5 Noah's birth is recorded and special reference is made to his name, and then to the years of his life, so that he had had opportunity to prove what he was in the midst of hitherto unparalleled corruption.<a name=1:19></a> Then in chapter 6, as God's grief in having created man is mentioned, it is said that Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah.<a name=1:20></a> Then, "This is the history of Noah: Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God.<a name=1:21></a> And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth.<a name=1:22></a> And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was full of violence.<a name=1:23></a> ….<a name=1:24></a>.<a name=1:25></a> And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me".<a name=1:26></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:9">Genesis  6:9</a> - 13

		Then we find dates standing in relation to his birth; so the Lord, I suppose, has brought our attention typically to his personal worth in the midst of corruption.<a name=2:1></a> Hence the thoughts of God, and the means of carrying them through the judgment are all entrusted to one man, and the new world is marked off as dating from him.<a name=2:2></a> It says he was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth, and when he went into the ark.<a name=2:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=2:4></a>H.<a name=2:5></a> He is a type of Christ in this regard.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:7></a> I thought so.<a name=2:8></a> The personal character of the man is brought to our attention and the verses read justify that -- how he thought for God at the outset.<a name=2:9></a> Then he was entirely subject, and made no move, although the ark had rested and the earth was dry; until (as we read) God spoke to him and told Him to go out of the ark.<a name=2:10></a> He went out by divine direction.<a name=2:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=2:12></a>B.<a name=2:13></a> It is remarkable there should be a distinction between the clean and the unclean.<a name=2:14></a> How should Noah know the difference?<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:16></a> That puts us all to the test -- how are we to find out the clean and the unclean?<a name=2:17></a> It is assumed that he knew.<a name=2:18></a> His personal character would show that he had the means of discerning.<a name=2:19></a> He evidently had his senses exercised so that he could discern between good and evil.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.Jy.<a name=2:21></a> Is it not assumed that he had the light of Abel and Enoch?<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:23></a> The light is cumulative right through.<a name=2:24></a> He would have the light of Enoch, who walked with God for three hundred years.<a name=2:25></a> In that period there would be some instincts developed to discern between what is clean and what is unclean.<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=2:27></a>S.<a name=2:28></a> That discernment was very important when it became a question of what he offered to God.<a name=2:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:1></a> There must have been some anticipation of the direct instructions in Leviticus, as to what is clean and unclean.<a name=3:2></a>

		E.J.<a name=3:3></a>McB.<a name=3:4></a> Would it not be true in a man's history with God that he would discern the direction in which things went under influence?<a name=3:5></a> Those amenable to good influence would be clean.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:7></a> What seems to be of importance is that Noah had the clean creatures there and knew what to do with them.<a name=3:8></a> They were available to express his appreciation of the God whom he had come, in some measure, to know.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=3:10></a>McB.<a name=3:11></a> Would that be a development of the thought of Abel offering to God?<a name=3:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:13></a> I think so.<a name=3:14></a> "<i>Every</i> clean animal and, of <i>all</i> clean fowl".<a name=3:15></a> There was no selfish reserve; God was before him, and nothing was held back.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=3:17></a>H.<a name=3:18></a> You were speaking of our side and God's side; is our side wholly absent from the burnt-offering?<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=3:20></a>S.<a name=3:21></a> I was rather thinking of our side of things as in connection with our need.<a name=3:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=3:23></a>H.<a name=3:24></a> Otherwise you do get the thought of our acceptance in the burnt-offering from the very outset.<a name=3:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:26></a> The distinction accorded to Noah as the head strikes one, and then the beautiful suggestion of Noah waiting for divine direction before he went out of the ark; then without any direction, building the altar.<a name=3:27></a> It all indicates the place God evidently had with him, and how there was no reservation.<a name=3:28></a> He took of every clean animal and of every clean fowl, and offered up burnt-offerings on the altar.<a name=3:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.W.<a name=3:30></a> Is it not always the case that the teaching of God in our souls coincides with the subsequent instruction of God to us?<a name=3:31></a> That might account for Noah knowing what clean things were.<a name=3:32></a> It was first of all what God had taught him in his soul.<a name=3:33></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=4:4></a>S.<a name=4:5></a> Then there is the wonderful response from God.<a name=4:6></a> He smelled a sweet savour.<a name=4:7></a> It was really Christ.<a name=4:8></a> It goes onto say, "And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake .<a name=4:9></a>.<a name=4:10></a>.<a name=4:11></a> .<a name=4:12></a> while the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease".<a name=4:13></a> Evidently this was the response on God's part; He was so delighted with what was presented to Him that the curse was removed, I think before the flood man had a hard time to make a living, but now that the curse is removed, things are largely changed.<a name=4:14></a> God also changed man's food "Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things".<a name=4:15></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:3">Genesis  9:3</a>.<a name=4:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:17></a> The reference to God's heart is very touching in this section, chapter 6:6.<a name=4:18></a> The very depth of His being was affected by man: "It grieved him in his heart".<a name=4:19></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:6">Genesis  6:6</a>.<a name=4:20></a> And now He says <i>in His heart</i> (chapter 8:21): "I will, no more henceforth curse the ground on account of man".<a name=4:21></a>

		There is a certain relation between the gospel of Luke and the book of Chronicles.<a name=27:1></a> Taken together they trace the testimony from the beginning.<a name=27:2></a> Chronicles begins with Adam and leads us on to David, who restored the priestly service under twenty-four courses.<a name=27:3></a> A man who thus restored the priesthood in that extended way, provides for the service of God, and he is concerned that all that is connected with God should be in accord with Him.<a name=27:4></a> Now Luke takes up these twenty-four courses of priesthood in introducing Zacharias, who belonged to one of these courses, and his wife Elizabeth, who was of the daughters of Aaron; so that we have in the opening of Luke the priestly feature emphasised, and throughout his narrative we find that he keeps in view that there should be that here in this world which would be according to God -- that in which the service of God should be maintained in a priestly way, and that the testimony of God should go forth in suitable dignity.<a name=27:5></a>

		And then we find the same persons, as if to confirm this great point of view in Luke, continually in the temple.<a name=28:4></a> The great High Priest Himself had lifted up His hands and blessed them, and as He blessed them He was parted from them and carried up into heaven.<a name=28:5></a> The kind of service He had rendered on earth as divinely presented by Luke, was such as heaven had pleasure in.<a name=28:6></a> We must never forget in our service that we have to say to heaven in regard to it.<a name=28:7></a> It is true that those who listen are to judge, but we have to say to heaven.<a name=28:8></a> We have to take account that heaven has to be pleased with it.<a name=28:9></a> If it be otherwise, we miss divine approval.<a name=28:10></a> And so Luke presented the personal service of Christ, and after He finishes His service on earth He is carried up.<a name=28:11></a> Heaven is so pleased with Him that He is carried up.<a name=28:12></a> It is not in Luke a question of His dignity as a divine Person, but as a man here in the service of God.<a name=28:13></a> And His service is so delightful, so simple, and heavenly in its character that heaven claims Him, and He was carried up into heaven.<a name=28:14></a> And then the disciples return to Jerusalem, it is said, with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.<a name=28:15></a>

		read from Chronicles to show you the correspondence with Luke in this regard.<a name=29:1></a> In the chapter I have read, David has become the gathering point.<a name=29:2></a> The Holy Spirit in that book, as I have said, begins with Adam, and leads up to David.<a name=29:3></a> In chapter 12 David is the centre of gathering.<a name=29:4></a> Jacob had said in his remarkable blessing of the tribes, that the sceptre should not depart from Judah until Shiloh came, and unto him should be the gathering of the people; that is to say, Christ was to be the centre of gathering.<a name=29:5></a> And as He becomes the centre of gathering, the house is set in order for God.<a name=29:6></a> So that in the next chapter to that which I have read in Chronicles, David consults with every captain and every leader, and appeals to all Israel that they should be assembled together to bring up the ark of God.<a name=29:7></a> If you have got the divine centre, and if you are gathered to that centre, then you will see how consideration that is according to God is obtained for the ark.<a name=29:8></a> David considered for the ark, for he said, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob".<a name=29:9></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:4">Psalm  132:4</a>,5.<a name=29:10></a> Then he says, too, "<i>We heard of it</i> at Ephratah; <i>we found it</i> in the fields of the wood".<a name=29:11></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:6">Psalm  132:6</a>.<a name=29:12></a> Many of us hear of it, but few of us <i>find</i> it.<a name=29:13></a> It is one thing, beloved, to hear a thing, but it is another thing to find the thing; as Philip said, "We have <i>found him</i>".<a name=29:14></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:45">John  1:45</a>.<a name=29:15></a> David heard of the ark and found the ark, and he would find a habitation for it -- no less than that -- a place in which God could rest, one in which there would be no disturbing element.<a name=29:16></a> That is what David had in his heart, so that he was a remarkable type of the Lord Jesus in that respect, who would not give sleep to His eyes or slumber to His eyelids, who could say, too, "the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up".<a name=29:17></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:9">Psalm  69:9</a>.<a name=29:18></a> If the Lord took sleep, it was when need was not present, but when sinners were around Him, He was awake and active; and so David was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Referring again to chapter 12, I shall go back to show you how David the king became the centre of gathering in three distinct connections.<a name=30:6></a> The first was in Ziklag, the second was in the wilderness, and the third was in Hebron.<a name=30:7></a> If we understand what it is to be gathered to the Lord, dear brethren, we have to analyse this twelfth chapter, and see what these different positions signify for us.<a name=30:8></a> A very great weight of responsibility attaches to us -- I mean to the assembly.<a name=30:9></a> As I was saying, in Chronicles the testimony begins with Adam and comes on to David.<a name=30:10></a> David had a true estimate of responsibility attaching to him, and so in regard to the building of the temple, he passes on the sense he had of the responsibility devolving upon him.<a name=30:11></a> If you read the closing chapters, you will see how perfect he was in the sense of responsibility.<a name=30:12></a> No one is of worth or moral value in the house of God save he who has the sense of responsibility.<a name=30:13></a> In the fourteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians -- a part of Scripture bearing directly on ourselves -- the apostle says, "The things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord".<a name=30:14></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>.<a name=30:15></a>

		David cherished the principle of gathering, and he passed on to Solomon the whole burden of responsibility in regard to the testimony.<a name=30:16></a> There is the principle of passing on responsibility; and it has now come to us.<a name=30:17></a> Now, let no one shirk that.<a name=30:18></a> It is in seeing and accepting responsibility as to the testimony,

		<a name=31>[Page 31]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that you come into divine power.<a name=31:1></a> Divine power is available to support those in this responsibility, "upon whom the ends of the ages have come", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:11">1 Corinthians  10:11</a>.<a name=31:2></a> There may be someone here who has never faced responsibility.<a name=31:3></a> There is the responsibility of the sinner, as having to say to God about his sins, but redemption has been accomplished, and so, beloved, the Lord Jesus has taken up that responsibility and settled it for eternity for those who believe.<a name=31:4></a> Jerusalem had its opportunity in the Lord coming to it, but it refused it, and so it has come in for the awful responsibility of all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from Abel to Christ; and so that city is suffering today -- wrath having come upon them -- the Jew -- to the uttermost.<a name=31:5></a> The assembly began in Jerusalem free from all this, for God had dealt with the sin of its members.<a name=31:6></a> The members of the assembly were set up free from all such responsibility; but then the responsibility of the testimony has come to us: all that God has set out from Abel onward has come on us, and it has to be preserved by us until the Lord comes and takes it up again Himself.<a name=31:7></a> At the present time, the obligation of it rests with us.<a name=31:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to refer again to chapter 12 David is bound up with the three positions indicated there.<a name=31:9></a> The first is in Ziklag.<a name=31:10></a> Certain ones came to him there, that is to say, certain of us come to Christ, so to speak, at Ziklag.<a name=31:11></a> Thus we have come into the light of Romans.<a name=31:12></a> Ziklag signifies that everything that was lost is recovered.<a name=31:13></a> We all know how the Amalekite invaded the land and took everything that was in the city.<a name=31:14></a> It was a disaster -- nothing less.<a name=31:15></a> David wept until he had no more power to weep, but then he encouraged himself in the Lord his God, and in that encouragement and in that strength he recovered all.<a name=31:16></a> Now that is written in view of the Lord.<a name=31:17></a> The Lord Jesus coming into this world felt the state of things.<a name=31:18></a> He could not but have felt, as no one else could, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=32>[Page 32]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		awful disaster that has come to the race.<a name=32:1></a> All was ruin -- all was seemingly irretrievably lost.<a name=32:2></a> I have no doubt that the weeping of David is a type of the Lord's own feeling even unto death -- "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death".<a name=32:3></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:38">Matthew  26:38</a>.<a name=32:4></a> He felt as no one could the awfulness of what had come in, for He knew the divine thoughts for man, but He recovered all.<a name=32:5></a> It is a great thing for you young people as gathered, as come into fellowship, to get that light into your souls.<a name=32:6></a> If the enemy seems to be triumphing, this light will stand by you, and the Lord Himself will stand by you; He will always do it, as we trust in Him.<a name=32:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, the next point of gathering is in the stronghold in the wilderness.<a name=32:8></a> That is another feature, and a very comforting one.<a name=32:9></a> In coming into fellowship you are being made conscious of hostile power.<a name=32:10></a> You are sure to be attacked.<a name=32:11></a> The enemy will never let you alone.<a name=32:12></a> He never does, and hence the need of the stronghold in the day of trouble, and that stronghold is where the Lord is, in the fellowship of the people of God, and it is the sphere of protection.<a name=32:13></a> I want you to note that the more you proceed on this line, the more encouraged you are, and the more recompensed you are.<a name=32:14></a> You find in the assembly that everything is recovered, nothing is lost, and then you find too in it a place of security.<a name=32:15></a> There are walls, and so it is a stronghold in the wilderness.<a name=32:16></a> But then you have to accept the wilderness.<a name=32:17></a> Ziklag is not exactly the wilderness; it represents, as I said, the recovery of everything for God, and for us, in Christ.<a name=32:18></a> But the wilderness is what the world has become to us.<a name=32:19></a> There is opposition in the wilderness, and we have to accept that, and in the accepting of it, we come to Christ for protection, so there is this sphere of protection-the stronghold in the wilderness.<a name=32:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we read is that all these men who had gathered to David come with a perfect heart -- perfect in unison to make David king.<a name=33:14></a> David's men are not thinking of themselves, they are thinking of David, and what you find is that there is abundance; as it says in the passage, "And there they were with David .<a name=33:15></a>.<a name=33:16></a>.<a name=33:17></a> .<a name=33:18></a>.<a name=33:19></a> eating and drinking".<a name=33:20></a> You see in it the thought of the assembly as gathered in one place -- come together for mutual contribution, and edification, and even an unbeliever is not excluded.<a name=33:21></a> We read as to those who came to Hebron, that "their brethren had prepared for them", and they were there eating and drinking for three days.<a name=33:22></a>

		Now I want you just to note all that, as I wish to connect it with <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=34:1></a> We have already noted that in the gathering in Chronicles, there is mutual contribution -- the place of gathering is the place of plenty, and being the place of plenty, it is the place of joy.<a name=34:2></a> There was great joy in Israel, and that is what we want in our meetings.<a name=34:3></a> Now in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>I want to show you how all this fits in and is worked out from the two principles of mutual confidence and sovereignty; because these are the principles that meet, in the place of gathering.<a name=34:4></a> Sovereignty in Chronicles is seen in David and in Judah.<a name=34:5></a> "For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came, the chief ruler", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#5:2">1 Chronicles  5:2</a>.<a name=34:6></a> It was a question of sovereignty, but then there was mutual confidence, and I want, by the Lord's help, to just say a word in a practical way on these two features.<a name=34:7></a> If we are to have spiritual plenty and joy, we must combine these things.<a name=34:8></a> Now in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>you have the two things brought in -- the honeycomb, and broiled fish.<a name=34:9></a> The former I take to be a suggestion of mutual contribution.<a name=34:10></a> Those who understand anything about bees, know that the feature that marks them is mutual contribution.<a name=34:11></a> On the other hand, there is the fish, and fish I take to represent sovereignty -- sovereign resources.<a name=34:12></a> I understand the waters of the ocean, covering as they do about two-thirds of the earth's surface, represent divine resources.<a name=34:13></a> Only God knows what they contain.<a name=34:14></a> Man may know what is on the surface of the earth.<a name=34:15></a> A census of people can be made, but no one can make a census of fish.<a name=34:16></a> I believe that in Scripture they represent divine resources.<a name=34:17></a> Now it is in the combination of these two things that I believe we shall get spiritual plenty in variety, and as a result spiritual joy.<a name=34:18></a> It is a poor thing if our meetings are not marked by these things -- spiritual abundance in variety and spiritual joy.<a name=34:19></a> Now I think that these two things are brought out in the first

		It is on my mind to address you this evening in regard of the sanctified company.<a name=39:1></a> God had before Him from the time that sin entered into the world to take out of the world in sanctification a company for Himself, and what comes to light is that this is worked out on the principle of exercise, Enoch being the first to speak of it.<a name=39:2></a> "Behold the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads to execute judgment against all".<a name=39:3></a> Jude refers to Enoch in this connection; he refers to him as "the seventh from Adam", the Holy Spirit by the expression 'seventh' evidently alluding to an exercise.<a name=39:4></a> There are exercises in a bad sense in this world; Cain and his posterity in chapter 4 of Genesis may be regarded in that light, and the result there is lust and violence: as James says, "When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death".<a name=39:5></a> <a href="../bible/James.htm#1:15">James  1:15</a>.<a name=39:6></a> There is much of that, for the world is made up of many desires and ambitions, but parallel with all this there is what God promotes and supports, and carries through to its results -- its results being for Himself.<a name=39:7></a> So we have Enoch, one who in the midst of corruption acquired the desire for holiness obviously, so that he speaks prophetically of "holy myriads".<a name=39:8></a> It does not appear that he had any holy companions in his day; he walked with God.<a name=39:9></a> He seems to have had no human companion to walk with -- he apparently had no companionship in holiness among his fellows, among men.<a name=39:10></a> One has pondered upon the possible population of the antediluvian world.<a name=39:11></a> It must have been large; but what Scripture notices is the increase of sin.<a name=39:12></a> Men had evidently acquired great efficiency in the practice of

	<div class="paragraph">
		lawlessness, of unholiness, of corruption, and the holy soul of Enoch must have felt these things; and in company with God he acquired light from God -- prophetic light -- in which he looked on to <i>myriads</i> of holy beings.<a name=40:1></a> Holy myriads and the Lord coming with them are seen in the vision of the prophet.<a name=40:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show how these holy myriads are being produced.<a name=40:3></a> Whatever be the light that Enoch had as to them we know that these myriads, in the midst of which the Lord will come will include ourselves -- will include the saints.<a name=40:4></a> I want to show also, by the Lord's help, how these are being called out and formed now so as to be fit to accompany the Lord as he comes out according to Jude.<a name=40:5></a> The passage emphasises the minuteness of the judgment.<a name=40:6></a> If you look at it, you will observe the frequency of the word 'all'.<a name=40:7></a> The Lord will "come" it says, "to execute judgment upon <i>all</i>, and to convince <i>all</i> that are ungodly among them, of <i>all</i> their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of <i>all</i> their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against them".<a name=40:8></a> You will see the minuteness of the judgment, as I have said, how that <i>all</i> are included, <i>all</i> the ungodly, and <i>all</i> their ungodly dealings, and <i>all</i> their hard speeches.<a name=40:9></a> No doubt Enoch had some knowledge of the population of his day, and he had some estimate of the sinfulness of the men and women around him, and he had knowledge of what was particularly hard, what he calls "hard speeches".<a name=40:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The correspondence of our times with all this is very striking -- the great efficiency which men have acquired to be lawless, the brazenry with which divine rights are disregarded and trampled underfoot, and then the immense number of huge cities which have developed; the enormous concentrations of populations add their quota to the lawlessness and intensify it.<a name=40:11></a> And then the hard speeches that are prevalent!<a name=40:12></a> Men get up and lecture even in the very

		before we can have what is official built up before we can have that in which divine service and testimony are to be rendered.<a name=42:1></a> And so in the book of Genesis, after the call of Abraham, the idea of the family is developed.<a name=42:2></a> It is true that Enoch had a son and evidently He was concerned about his son, in that he walked with God after he was born, but there is nothing developed in Enoch's immediate family for God; but we find in Noah a family and affections so that he prepared an ark for the <i>saving of his house</i>.<a name=42:3></a> But Noah was not the great father, nor was Enoch -- Abraham was the great father; hence Abraham is the first person, as Scripture records, to whom God <i>appeared</i>.<a name=42:4></a> I wish you to take notice of that because in appearing there was involved, that there was a showing of Himself in some feature to Abraham which should be the germ of what would be worked out in Abraham.<a name=42:5></a> It was the God of glory who appeared to Abraham.<a name=42:6></a> He had before him the unfolding of family relationships and affections.<a name=42:7></a> Take this away and what have you left?<a name=42:8></a> Only a shell!<a name=42:9></a> But, therein is the substance, the kernel, of what God had in His mind, and so you find in chapter after chapter in Genesis the great family feature developed, and in chapter 49 the family is <i>blessed</i>, and the gifts and calling of God are without repentance; as Isaac said, "Yea, and he <i>shall</i> be blessed".<a name=42:10></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27:33">Genesis  27:33</a>.<a name=42:11></a> There is no revoking of the divine blessing and the divine blessing is in the family.<a name=42:12></a> So the tribes -- the sons of Israel -- are called to hearken to Israel their father and he blesses every one of them.<a name=42:13></a> And the family thus blessed passes over into Egypt, and we find in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#1">Exodus  1</a>they are again enumerated -- the names of the sons of Israel.<a name=42:14></a> Then in chapter 4 God formally takes over these tribes as His; "Let my son go that he may serve me".<a name=42:15></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:23">Exodus  4:23</a>.<a name=42:16></a> "Israel is my son, my first-born".<a name=42:17></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:22">Exodus  4:22</a>.<a name=42:18></a> You can understand what the God of glory signifies when you hear Him speak thus.<a name=42:19></a> He has a son and that son

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, you see how the matter stands in Exodus.<a name=43:14></a> The Holy Spirit having arrived at the saintly family, the sanctified family, you have no other names, God as it were notifying that that is what He has in His mind.<a name=43:15></a> If He has brought us into the relation of brethren, of sons, He has in His mind that we should be priests, that we should be sanctified, and so "This is that Aaron and Moses".<a name=43:16></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6:26">Exodus  6:26</a>.<a name=43:17></a> We have arrived at the High Priest and we have arrived at the apostle: And now, as you see in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>, we have to learn everything from Christ from these two points of View -- the apostle and High Priest of our confession.<a name=43:18></a>

		So having arrived at Hebrews, I want to dwell a little on the idea of brethren, referring back to the passage already quoted, "I will declare, thy name unto my brethren".<a name=43:19></a> In chapter 2 we have the great

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I wish, for a moment, to revert to the gospels that you may see how the brethren are constituted.<a name=44:5></a> In the three synoptic gospels the idea is based on moral grounds.<a name=44:6></a> In Matthew the brethren of the Lord are said to be those who do the will of God.<a name=44:7></a> That, I need not say, is moral.<a name=44:8></a> They are marked off in this world as doing the will of God.<a name=44:9></a> The same applies to Mark, only that Mark adds that the Lord looked round in a circuit at those who were sitting around Him and said, "Behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother".<a name=44:10></a> <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:34">Mark  3:34</a> And then in Luke those who are His brethren are those who hear the word of God and do it; who <i>do it</i>.<a name=44:11></a> There is not only the will of God, but the word of God, the mind of God, and these features mark the brethren, and no one is entitled to the designation of brethren who is devoid of these features.<a name=44:12></a> But when I come to John I am on a different basis.<a name=44:13></a> You have the relationship in its most exalted character.<a name=44:14></a> It is not a mere question then of what is moral; it is a question, from his point of view, of divine counsel.<a name=44:15></a> We are brethren as the fruit of divine counsel.<a name=44:16></a> The Lord would have it so, and so the Lord, sends the message through Mary: "Go to my brethren" -- not a word about anything moral -- "and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=44:17></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=44:18></a> Need I say that this must underlie everything, for we cannot <i>acquire</i> the relationship of brethren, it must be a matter of calling, a matter of purpose emanating from God; and so the Lord has effected it,

		Now, in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>the writer addresses them as "holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling"; in other words what we get in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, and now He proposes to develop from that point the great subject of approach to God, so that he says, "Consider the apostle and High Priest of our confession".<a name=45:21></a> We have to learn from Him, particularly priesthood, for that is what is developed -- it is not apostleship, but priesthood from this chapter onwards, and priesthood based on sonship.<a name=45:22></a> So it goes on to say that Christ is Son over His house.<a name=45:23></a> I have to see Him, to consider Him now in the house.<a name=45:24></a> Think of being called upon, being exhorted rather, to consider Him thus!<a name=45:25></a> He is over

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing introduced is the Spirit.<a name=46:5></a> While the Son is over the house, the Holy Spirit is present there, and calls upon those who form the house not to be hard-hearted: "Even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts".<a name=46:6></a> We are considering the Son over the house, and presently we are reminded by the Spirit -- a present living voice -- not to harden our hearts.<a name=46:7></a> Oh, I say, beloved, this is a voice surely!<a name=46:8></a> I believe the ministry of the Spirit in all phases of the assembly has this bearing, "Harden not your hearts"!<a name=46:9></a> "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=46:10></a> And one thing He always says, "Harden not your hearts".<a name=46:11></a> A hardened heart is incapable of being affected by the covenant, for it is just what Israel's heart was, a heart of stone.<a name=46:12></a> God will take it away yet and give them hearts of flesh upon which He can write, and unless we learn to judge our hard hearts there will be no writing upon them.<a name=46:13></a>

		The reference to family designations must impress every one who reads Scripture, whether it be father, mother, husband, wife, brother, sister, children, sons, or daughters.<a name=62:1></a> No one who reads Scripture can fail to be impressed with these references, and so I have in mind on this occasion, to speak in this connection and to dwell upon the idea of the <i>mother</i>.<a name=62:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is obvious, both from Scripture and from ordinary circumstances, that the maternal feature exercises, next to the paternal, the greatest influence in the family, and I want to show, therefore, the divine idea in the mother.<a name=62:3></a> For this reason I read from <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>because we have presented there no less than the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, not indeed as she is presented literally in Mary, but as a symbolical personage clothed in divine thoughts.<a name=62:4></a> Israel, as in the purpose of God, is seen here.<a name=62:5></a> No mere woman personally could correspond with the great divine thoughts that are presented in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>; for only a divine Person could present divine thoughts perfectly.<a name=62:6></a> Hence in our Lord Jesus Christ we have every divine thought presented in perfection.<a name=62:7></a> He was the word.<a name=62:8></a> He was personally the presentation of all the mind of God; and He was not only the presentation of divine thoughts but of the divine nature, for it is said, "God has been manifested in flesh".<a name=62:9></a> <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=62:10></a> But Mary, wife of Joseph, could not personally present the thoughts of God as seen in this figure.<a name=62:11></a> They are presented in a symbolical personage.<a name=62:12></a> The idea of the mother is connected with the assembly as well as with Israel, and so if we are to arrive at the definite idea which is presented to us in the assembly, we shall have to understand the features presented

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is worth while, I believe, to dwell upon these features, especially as the idea of the mother is, as I have said, connected with the assembly, and that the assembly is to exercise these features in the absence of the Lord at the present time, even as she is to exercise them in a supreme degree in the coming day.<a name=63:4></a> She will descend out of heaven from God, as we read, "and her light like unto a stone most precious".<a name=63:5></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:11">Revelation  21:11</a>.<a name=63:6></a> She has all the marks of divine government and administration, so that she will exercise the most benign influence on this earth.<a name=63:7></a> A wonderful contemplation!<a name=63:8></a> especially as it is so near at hand, and as we shall have our part in it.<a name=63:9></a> How obvious, therefore, is the importance to each of us of understanding these maternal features as presented to us from God, and severally coming under their influence and being formed by them, so that we may be children with manners suited to the house, with ways suited to God, suited to that great system that will thus come down from God out of heaven.<a name=63:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show how these maternal features appear in the gospels, and what is to be observed is that they only appear in Matthew and Luke.<a name=63:11></a> Neither Mark nor John dwell on the birth of our Lord.<a name=63:12></a> You can understand how it would not fit in in John's gospel, for it is there a question of the <i>Person</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ, and His mother could not add to His Person Being God over all blessed for ever, as Scripture says, no such feature could add to Him.<a name=63:13></a> So John does not give us the birth of Christ, nor does he bring forward His mother or father in the flesh.<a name=63:14></a>

		Now in Luke you have a similar line of thought, only that it is not the people of God in the Old Testament that is in view, but rather <i>humanity</i>; for God would present the maternal side in that connection also, and in order that we might learn to respond to these views in the assembly we have to understand both Matthew and Luke.<a name=65:6></a> We have to understand royalty, that is to say there most be that royal dignity manifest, that superiority to petty feelings and recriminations; but when you come to Luke it is not royalty but sympathy; and if you have royalty and sympathy combined, you have that which can affect men and form them according to God.<a name=65:7></a> They must be combined.<a name=65:8></a> So in God's relations with His people in the Old Testament the idea of a king took form and it was never surrendered; and priesthood was connected with it.<a name=65:9></a>

		That is the divine idea and God took it up in Israel.<a name=66:8></a> Thus Melchizedek comes out in Matthew, king of the Jews, and then you have, as I said, linked with this the thought of priest which underlies the maternal side presented in Luke, for we are to be formed by sympathy as it is seen in Christ.<a name=66:9></a> It worked out specially in Paul, as we learn from the epistles to the Thessalonians and Galatians.<a name=66:10></a>

		Now I refer to these two features in the gospels that we might gather up the divine idea in the mother, for the intent is that every one of us has to be formed by what is presented in the mother.<a name=66:11></a> It is said of her in Proverbs that "Her children arise up and call her blessed".<a name=66:12></a> <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31:28">Proverbs  31:28</a>.<a name=66:13></a> Have I ever done that, I ask myself?<a name=66:14></a> And her husband praises her.<a name=66:15></a> The Lord looks upon the assembly as His own product.<a name=66:16></a> "A virtuous woman .<a name=66:17></a>.<a name=66:18></a>.<a name=66:19></a> the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her .<a name=66:20></a>.<a name=66:21></a>.<a name=66:22></a> her children arise up and call her blessed".<a name=66:23></a> <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31:10">Proverbs  31:10</a>,11,28.<a name=66:24></a> If you look at <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>you will see why she is called blessed.<a name=66:25></a> How carefully she looks after the house, and the children are clothed and fed; you feel she justifies the confidence placed in her by her husband.<a name=66:26></a>

		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#3">Song of Songs  3</a>, to show how the mother possesses these divine thoughts of royalty and dominion and administration; how having brought forth her son, she crowned him.<a name=66:27></a> The more we take on divine thoughts the more we connect them with

		I have before me to speak of the features of spirituality, bearing in mind that "the spiritual discerns all things, and he is discerned of no one".<a name=99:1></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:15">1 Corinthians  2:15</a>.<a name=99:2></a> That statement shows what a spiritual person is, what his value is as in this world, where sin and its workings have rendered everything complex.<a name=99:3></a> Now John aims at building up the believer in what is spiritual, and he has particularly in view that it should work out in family relationships; and he would indicate in what he has to say that natural family relationships interfere more than anything else with the working out of spiritual family relationships.<a name=99:4></a> It is said that that which was first was not spiritual.<a name=99:5></a> Adam was not created in that connection, that is as spiritual, although he had a spirit, but in the thought of God he was contemplated as natural.<a name=99:6></a> It is further said that he was earthy, as of the earth, and it is definitely stated that that which was first was not spiritual, but natural, and afterward that which was spiritual.<a name=99:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now John is occupied with what is "afterward" -- that which is spiritual, and so in the chapter preceding this, when the Lord is addressed by His mother after the flesh, who evidently assumed a right to address Him, saying, "They have no wine", He repudiated her claim, saying, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=99:8></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:3">John  2:3</a>,4.<a name=99:9></a> He was reminding her that that which was 'first', which was natural, was being superseded, that He was on the line of the spiritual.<a name=99:10></a> And the effect of His word shows itself immediately in her, for she submits.<a name=99:11></a> She gives us a lead in that way, saying to the servants, "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it".<a name=99:12></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:5">John  2:5</a>.<a name=99:13></a> She thus extricated

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now John has in mind, as I said, to develop this spiritual line in connection with family relationships; these are seen in chapter 20, so well known to us, "Go to my brethren".<a name=100:4></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=100:5></a> These are not His brethren after the flesh, nor are they even His brethren on moral lines (although the moral must underlie it) but they are His brethren from the standpoint of divine counsel -- the highest possible standpoint or platform upon which a family can be regarded.<a name=100:6></a> There can be nothing higher, dear brethren, than that we should be the subjects of divine counsels, which means that before the world was, it was designed in the heart of God that there should be brethren for Christ.<a name=100:7></a> The standpoint is so exalted, and the relationship so great for it is relationship to the One who ascends in personal right into heaven -- that it is obvious we must be formed for it, and to be formed for it we have to begin, as it were, at the bottom, and that we get in this chapter, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit".<a name=100:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was nothing born in Adam of the Spirit.<a name=100:9></a> He received his spirit from God, but the new thing begins with the idea of birth -- not creation, but birth, and so the family idea enters into the mind at the outset.<a name=100:10></a> The thing born (for it is neuter) is spirit.<a name=100:11></a>

		a divine denunciation of false brethren.<a name=101:1></a> God had in His mind brethren according to His eternal counsels, and these begin with the idea of being born throughout from top to bottom; and so in order to clear the ground for the great subject on hand in Ezekiel, a whole chapter is devoted to the fiercest denunciation of false brethren -- of Edom.<a name=101:2></a> He was a brother, but a brother marked by the flesh; a brother who throughout his career was opposed to him that was on the line of the Spirit.<a name=101:3></a> So Esau is to be desolate, his mountains are to be filled with his slain, he is not to continue with the brother born after the Spirit, any more than Ishmael was to occupy the house with Isaac.<a name=101:4></a> It is important, dear brethren, to bear this in mind, because the Old Testament helps us in understanding the mind of God in the New.<a name=101:5></a> And so before the thirty-sixth chapter of Ezekiel you have the thirty-fifth, which foretells, as I said, God's denunciation and judgment on Esau; as He says later, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated".<a name=101:6></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:13">Romans  9:13</a>.<a name=101:7></a> If we are to understand what that means, that God should love Jacob, we have to understand these chapters in John, for God loved, dear brethren, what was lovable.<a name=101:8></a> Are we to deny Him that?<a name=101:9></a> Certainly I could not deny God that; He asserts His right to love what is lovable, and to hate what is hateful.<a name=101:10></a>

		We are living in times in which there are not only many, but millions of people who are affected by externals.<a name=102:1></a> They are nominally Christians, and hence Christendom presents the most complex area in the whole world, and for that reason young believers, and even unspiritual persons who may be more advanced, are greatly exposed to deception by what they see around.<a name=102:2></a> Myriads of genuine believers are deceived by what they see.<a name=102:3></a> Hence, beloved, the importance of taking into account that someone knows -- and you want to find the Person who knows.<a name=102:4></a> Therefore it says in the end of the second chapter that "He knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man, for he knew what was in man".<a name=102:5></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:24">John  2:24</a>,25.<a name=102:6></a> I know tonight One who knows all men.<a name=102:7></a> He knows the Chinese, the Hindu, the African, the inhabitants of the islands of the sea innumerable, and He knows the Europeans -- He knows them all.<a name=102:8></a> He is not deceived by the veneer of <i>mere</i> religion; He is not occupied with externals, He knows the root of things, He knows the inner motives and springs that govern men.<a name=102:9></a> I know that One.<a name=102:10></a> He further says to Nicodemus, "If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?<a name=102:11></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:12">John  3:12</a> "We speak", He says, "that we do know, and testify that we have seen, and ye receive not our witness".<a name=102:12></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:11">John  3:11</a>.<a name=102:13></a> That is where the difficulty lies.<a name=102:14></a> We have One who knows, and He testifies accordingly, but men do not receive His testimony.<a name=102:15></a> They turn to all sorts of people for testimony, and we have all sorts of investigations going on in regard of man, whereas the truth is that it is all out; there <i>is</i> One who knows, but He says, no one receives our testimony.<a name=102:16></a> Men turn aside to listen to mortal man, and his wretched investigations as to what he finds on the earth, whereas the "Son of man who is in heaven" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a> knows all and He testifies of all.<a name=102:17></a> Wonderful, beloved, that we have a testimony from His lips to all!<a name=102:18></a>

		I have before me to speak of what is <i>new</i>.<a name=112:1></a> We have in Scripture, as of God, what is righteous, what is holy, and what is living, but we have emphasised also what is new; and perhaps we are less conversant with what is new than we are with these other features, especially as the material system of things, which is old, is what we are naturally most familiar with, and in itself is legitimate and right.<a name=112:2></a> God has not wholly given up what belongs to the old in that sense.<a name=112:3></a> Every creature of His is good.<a name=112:4></a> Our bodies are still in relation to the old, so that as accustomed to these things and these thoughts, it is perhaps difficult for us to enter on the new, but God has announced that He will make all things new.<a name=112:5></a> He announced by the prophet Isaiah, "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind".<a name=112:6></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#65:17">Isaiah  65:17</a>.<a name=112:7></a> So that in the Scriptures He prepares us for what is new.<a name=112:8></a> Peter says, "We according to his promise look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness".<a name=112:9></a> <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:13">2 Peter  3:13</a>.<a name=112:10></a> We have at the present time to practice righteousness in relation to the old, and in the millennium there will be a <i>reign</i> of righteousness in connection with the old, but for the <i>dwelling-place</i> of righteousness new heavens and a new earth are required.<a name=112:11></a> For if righteousness is to dwell it must be undisturbed.<a name=112:12></a> One idea of a dwelling-place in Scripture is a place undisturbed, a place into which nothing foreign enters, and I need not say that in the present order of things (what stands in connection with the present heavens and earth) there are such disturbances.<a name=112:13></a> Even the millennial kingdom, although perfect from its heavenly

		The Lord Himself had brought in the principle of preservation or salt, and under His influence they were a new cruse.<a name=118:4></a> They were a product of His own, wholly new, not born of flesh's will, nor of man's will; they were a wholly new thing born after Himself, and in them was this principle of salt -- of preserving things in freshness.<a name=118:5></a> So it says "The waters were healed to this day", that is to say, that the things of God continued long amongst the saints in their original freshness, for "to this day" always means that the thing had come down to the time of the writing, historic writing, divine writing, as shown long after the event.<a name=118:6></a> When you have "to this day" you may depend upon it attention is being called to the duration, the durableness of the thing.<a name=118:7></a> Among the early Christians there was the element of salt; divine things were preserved in freshness.<a name=118:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=125:3></a> I wanted to show, by the Lord's help, during this enquiry how Romans develops the priestly, believer, or as we may say, the spiritual feature; and that as it is thus developed, the believer is qualified to have part in the assembly in its relations Godward and manward; and I had particularly in view the relation of the priesthood to the law.<a name=125:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=125:7></a> That is what I was thinking, and that that feature -- the priestly feature -- begins as deliverance is known, indeed even before, because this passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>shows that the believer delights in the law of God even earlier than deliverance.<a name=125:8></a> His delight in it would increase, and chapter 8 shows how the righteous requirements of it are fulfilled in him now as walking after the Spirit; that is as he values the law of God, delights in it, and fulfils its righteous requirements, he becomes accustomed to law in its spiritual significance, because he sees that the law is spiritual.<a name=125:9></a> And as becoming accustomed to law, he is prepared to take up that principle as applying to the assembly; not that the law of Exodus applies directly to the assembly, but there is what corresponds in the commandment of the Lord as in 1 Corinthians.<a name=125:10></a> So the element of priesthood runs through all the types, showing that whether the assembly functions in relation to God, as in the offerings in Leviticus, or whether in discipline all would come under the hand of the priest.<a name=125:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=126:1></a> Yes, but the element of law necessarily comes under the hand of the priest.<a name=126:2></a> The law that governed the offerings of the people as in the early part of Leviticus, was given to Aaron and his sons.<a name=126:3></a> The discipline of the assembly -- the public government of the assembly -- also comes under the priests, and when it is seen that every believer is a priest, then it would be clear that each believer should accept the obligations of priesthood.<a name=126:4></a> The offerings of God are regulated by a law, under the hand of the priest; there was the law of the burnt offering, the law of the meat offering, and so in regard of all the offerings.<a name=126:5></a> Then, too, if there be matters requiring judgment, the priest has his part in that, and there is to be no appeal from a decision rendered in that priestly manner.<a name=126:6></a>

		I have in mind to speak about the element of newness.<a name=155:1></a> If Christianity as introduced into this world, is marked by anything it is by newness, and it occurred to me that the epistle to the Romans serves to unfold how this element comes about, and develops in the believer from the very beginning of his spiritual history.<a name=155:2></a> Other features run parallel in this epistle such as holiness, but I desire to speak about newness -- first, newness of life, then newness of spirit, and then newness in the renewal of the mind.<a name=155:3></a>

		One is reminded of the Old Testament facts, ever available in ministry to amplify in detail what is presented doctrinally in the New Testament, and so as early as the first chapter of the Bible we have this feature of newness of life.<a name=155:4></a> On the third day life appeared -- that is vegetable life.<a name=155:5></a> On the fifth day animal life appeared, but on the third day we have what I think may be regarded as corresponding with this sixth chapter of Romans.<a name=155:6></a> The earth emerged on that day from the waters of death.<a name=155:7></a> How long it had lain there is not disclosed, but the earth, the dry land, appeared on that day.<a name=155:8></a> It was for the moment bare, but presently there was life.<a name=155:9></a> It was to bring forth; life was in the thing, so it yielded the grass, the herb, and the tree.<a name=155:10></a> You can understand what freshness there was.<a name=155:11></a> There was not only life as there is today, but life in newness, and that is what God intends spiritually in us as Christians -- that there should be this newness, not only that we should be alive but that there should be newness.<a name=155:12></a> So we read "That like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father", so we as "buried with him by baptism into death" should emerge from the waters of death

		that we might walk in newness of life.<a name=156:1></a> You can understand, as I said, how delightfully fresh everything was on that fair day of creation.<a name=156:2></a> True enough, men were not there to enjoy it, but God was there, and primarily everything is for God: "All things were created by him and for him" <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:16">Colossians  1:16</a> and "For thy pleasure", referring to the very creation itself, it says "they are and were created", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:11">Revelation  4:11</a>.<a name=156:3></a> So that God had freshness on that day; and it was good.<a name=156:4></a> It must have been delightfully fresh as the earth, emerging from its long submerged condition in the waters of death began to yield.<a name=156:5></a> The earth brought forth grass, the surface was covered with it, and every blade of it was known to God.<a name=156:6></a> The earth thus yielded grass, for God had given the earth the element of life.<a name=156:7></a> God gives it a body, we are told; even today every farmer knows that; as he puts his seed into the ground, what comes up is not that seed, but the body which God pleases to give it.<a name=156:8></a> God is operating with the very seed, and He gives it a body as it pleases Him.<a name=156:9></a> And so the earth yielded its grass, its herbs, and its trees, and all in perfect freshness.<a name=156:10></a> It was indeed a newness of life.<a name=156:11></a> It was the divine thought that if the earth were brought out of the waters of death there should be something for God, and so there was the evidence of life, and life indeed, dear brethren, to which the Lord likens the product of His own death, for the vegetable figure is used, wonderful to say, in regard of His own blessed body.<a name=156:12></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone, but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit".<a name=156:13></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:24">John  12:24</a>.<a name=156:14></a> The "much fruit" as it comes up is marked by newness in every item of it; the freshness of that life, that life that shone here in Himself alone, is developed in all the much fruit.<a name=156:15></a> And so, as I said, on that third day there was under the eye of God, who knew everything from the beginning to the end, what should ultimately spring up for His pleasure

		Now, I press this, because many of us retain the old ways and habits.<a name=159:10></a> Whilst professing faith in Christ and accepting baptism, there is not that freshness, and even if we begin with it, we soon begin to develop grey hairs -- marks of decay -- instead of retaining the vigour of life.<a name=159:11></a> The Lord is described as having his hair black as a raven -- there is the energy of life.<a name=159:12></a> I retain that; not only do I begin with it, but I retain it.<a name=159:13></a> The divine idea is that things are new, are fresh in me, as we see in the heavenly city; she is as fresh and new at the end of the thousand years as she was at the beginning -- newness of life.<a name=159:14></a> The next thing in this epistle is newness of spirit.<a name=159:15></a> Chapter 6 has its bearing on me in every relation.<a name=159:16></a> It refers to me as in my body where I used to be; there is a complete change in me, and it is expressed in my body.<a name=159:17></a> Hence the emphasis is laid on our members in chapter 6.<a name=159:18></a> But now in chapter 7 it is a question of serving, and when we come to service

		What I wish to bring out from these scriptures on this occasion is the importance of restfulness, as being under the influence of Christ.<a name=167:1></a> The idea of influence is very wide in its bearings.<a name=167:2></a> There are, of course, bad influences.<a name=167:3></a> In the book of Revelation we find one of the vials of wrath poured out upon the rivers and fountains of waters.<a name=167:4></a> These refer to influences that are pernicious.<a name=167:5></a> To-day there are many such influences, diverse to a great extent, but all bearing against what is right and true, and pure, and holy.<a name=167:6></a> There are the theatres, the cinemas, the novels, and the magazines, the secret societies, and I may say, alas!<a name=167:7></a> the schools and universities; and again, alas!<a name=167:8></a> alas!<a name=167:9></a> the pulpits -- not all, however, thank God.<a name=167:10></a> All these exercise pernicious influences, some directed against God and against Christ in the way of blasphemous teaching, others directed against morals -- the evil woman, the strange woman who flattereth with her tongue, as in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#6:24">Proverbs  6:24</a>.<a name=167:11></a> These features of the world are under God's eye for judgment, so that the vial will be poured out on the rivers and springs of water; but over against all these, beloved friends, are good influences -- pre-eminently the influence, the direct influence of Christ.<a name=167:12></a>

		Now, in the physical system we have this principle of influence.<a name=167:13></a> It pervades, as I may say, everything in the physical creation.<a name=167:14></a> Without it, indeed, we could not have what we have; we could not have the system as it is, for it is held together on that principle.<a name=167:15></a> And then, too, in regard to this earth on which we live, we are dependent in every respect physically on

		I want now to show from the scriptures read how Mary is a model of what I have spoken of.<a name=170:2></a> The Lord is seen in Luke as visiting the cities and villages and places in order, one by one.<a name=170:3></a> You will see that it is a feature of Luke that when they would have detained Him in one of the cities He says "I must needs announce the glad tidings … to the other cities also, for for this I have been sent forth", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:43">Luke  4:43</a>.<a name=170:4></a> He would leave none out, and so He is seen visiting them.<a name=170:5></a> It was a combing-out process, as it were.<a name=170:6></a> Every city, and town, and hamlet must come under His influence.<a name=170:7></a> We read that in sending out the seventy, two and two, that He sent them "into every city and place where he himself was about to come", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:1">Luke  10:1</a>.<a name=170:8></a> It was to convey grace, so that grace might shine in all these cities and places in Palestine.<a name=170:9></a> And so in His blessed path on His way to Jerusalem He arrives at a "certain village" -- at Bethany.<a name=170:10></a> In Luke, you will observe, it was a question of a "certain village".<a name=170:11></a> In His service He could come to the smallest village.<a name=170:12></a> He could preach in Jerusalem, preach in the temple, but He could enter into and preach in the most insignificant village in the country; for the point was "To preach" the gospel to the poor.<a name=170:13></a> He was here for the good of the poor, of the despised; He belonged to a despised town Himself.<a name=170:14></a> And so reaching this village, "A certain woman named Martha received him into her house, and she had a sister called Mary".<a name=170:15></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:38">Luke  10:38</a>,39.<a name=170:16></a> She was well off to have such a sister, and so is any company of Christians who have such an one.<a name=170:17></a> Such a sister as Mary is a model.<a name=170:18></a> 'Well', you say, 'she was not doing much, Martha was doing all the work', but Scripture says, "She had a sister called Mary who also, having sat down at the feet of Jesus, was listening to his word".<a name=170:19></a>

		If Martha is wise, she will take account of Mary.<a name=171:1></a> She has in her a very spiritual sister; possibly there was not a house in Palestine that had a sister like her; she sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to what He was saying.<a name=171:2></a> I wonder how many are like her in this company.<a name=171:3></a> How many sisters are there like that?<a name=171:4></a> I may say here that my impression is that sisters are greatly undervalued.<a name=171:5></a> The Holy Spirit emphasises the spirituality, the devotedness, the intelligence, and the service of sisters; He emphasises it to the disadvantage often of the brothers, even the most distinguished of them.<a name=171:6></a> Now the secret of her spirituality largely was that she knew how to be restful under the influence of Christ; she was restful.<a name=171:7></a> She sat, but she did not sit lazily.<a name=171:8></a> There is such a thing as sitting lazily and Scripture takes account of it.<a name=171:9></a> We read, indeed, of people who "sit in darkness", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:7">Isaiah  42:7</a> which is a serious matter -- sitting down in <i>darkness</i>.<a name=171:10></a> And then we read of Eli the priest, who was rejected, sitting by a post of the temple.<a name=171:11></a> Now there is nothing said about seats in the temple or the tabernacle.<a name=171:12></a> The priests had to stand, their business was to serve, hence we read, "Ye servants of the Lord which by night stand in the house of the Lord".<a name=171:13></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#134:1">Psalm  134:1</a>.<a name=171:14></a> They are distinguished as devoted, as spiritual in that they stand, when other people are lying down, not only sitting down, but lying down.<a name=171:15></a> They <i>stand by night</i>, and that refers to the energy -- the spiritual energy -- that belongs to us as priests for God.<a name=171:16></a> And so we find that Eli, as accustomed to sit, developed fatness -- heaviness.<a name=171:17></a> He was a fat man, and fatness in that case indicates that God has not had His portion, for the fat belongs to God, whereas Eli was clothed with it.<a name=171:18></a> Although there was good in him and he had concern for the ark, he had a very sorrowful end, for he was old and heavy, and he fell from off his seat <i>backwards</i> and his neck brake and he died -- a very sorrowful end to a priest,
