		J.T.<a name=1:5></a> The first epistle to the Thessalonians is suggested because there are a great many young people among the brethren, relatively, in this country, and the epistles to the Thessalonians peculiarly apply to youth, to the young among the saints, to the young that existed in Paul's time and, we may thank God, in our time.<a name=1:6></a> There is quite an increase among the young, and especially among the young men that are available for service, for preaching; so the first epistle to the Thessalonians is selected because it contains such an appeal to youth, to young assemblies too, and to the youth among them.<a name=1:7></a> In fact it may be said that they are Paul's first epistles, and undoubtedly he had in mind the freshness that existed among the saints of God in his time and that they might be set on their way rightly.<a name=1:8></a> So we shall observe that he speaks of imitation.<a name=1:9></a> It says in verse 6, "and <i>ye</i> became our imitators, and of the Lord, having accepted the word in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Spirit, so that ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia: for the word of the Lord sounded out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith which is towards God has gone abroad, so that we have no need to say anything; for they themselves relate concerning us what entering in we had to you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and to await his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from among the dead, Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath".<a name=1:10></a> So there is great stress laid on the idea of imitation, imitation of

		others who have been long in the way and have known the truth, and ministered it, too.<a name=2:1></a> So the point is for the younger ones to think of what is needed and see how it is to be learned from those long in the way, from the elder brethren.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=2:3></a>S.<a name=2:4></a> So we have the opening and laying down at Thessalonica in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17">Acts  17</a>.<a name=2:5></a> Would that not bear on all who are young?<a name=2:6></a> We have examples in the elders, but the tendency in this country to which you alluded would be met by the opening up and laying down of the truth, would it not?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> Quite so.<a name=2:9></a> The opening up is the ministry that would bring out the truth, and the laying down is the authority that accompanies it, which is always needed.<a name=2:10></a> Opening up is one thing and laying down is another, and that implies the authority that goes with the truth.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=2:12></a>H.<a name=2:13></a> Would the term "to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father" be a term of affection?<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:15></a> Yes, implying the security of the position.<a name=2:16></a> How well they would be taken care of.<a name=2:17></a> It does not say that in Romans, or Ephesians, but it says it here.<a name=2:18></a> "in God the Father", it is a peculiar expression for an assembly.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=2:20></a>S.<a name=2:21></a> Would the laying down be in accord with the Holy Scriptures?<a name=2:22></a> They would be the basis for all that is said.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:24></a> Just so.<a name=2:25></a> The Scriptures are the only authority that we have, so that we have sure ground to stress authority.<a name=2:26></a> "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=2:27></a> It is not only that it is authoritative but it is profitable, that is to say, as we look into the Scriptures we see there is nothing else to compare with them.<a name=2:28></a> The young people need to get that into their minds and hearts, and that they are profitable.<a name=2:29></a> It would keep them from reading other things that are unprofitable and defiling.<a name=2:30></a>

		C.M.<a name=3:1></a> Would the fact that Paul identifies Timothy with him here in this first verse indicate something as to what you are saying as to the young coming into the truth and being usable in it?<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:3></a> He was a comparatively young man himself.<a name=3:4></a> He had learned the truth from his mother and grandmother, which is a good source for young people to learn from, their godly mothers and grandmothers in the houses.<a name=3:5></a> It is a question of household influence and authority.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=3:7></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17">Acts  17</a>they "joined themselves to Paul and Silas".<a name=3:8></a> Would that suggest the idea of a good lead and young people linking themselves on with the elder brethren?<a name=3:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:10></a> Yes.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:12></a> Would you preach from the New Translation (Darby Translation) of the Scriptures, or the King James version on Lord's day evening in preaching the gospel?<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:14></a> That is an important question.<a name=3:15></a> As far as I am concerned, whenever I try to minister the word, whatever it may be, I use the New Translation (Darby Translation) now, because it is accurate, and many of us are inaccurate and are apt to be misled by inaccurate statements.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>we have a verse in the King James version which is not genuine, and some have thought that as it is there it is all right to preach from it, which I would not do.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:19></a> I think that is worth while considering.<a name=3:20></a> At one time it was felt that it might appear that we had a Bible assumed to be our own, and that it took on the character of sectional feeling, whereas now the New Translation (Darby Translation) is so well known that we are perfectly safe in using it.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=3:22></a>S.<a name=3:23></a> In the preaching too?<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:25></a> I do.<a name=3:26></a> I would have no difficulty about it now, because it is so well known, and where the preaching goes on, as a rule the brethren are all there, a large number of them relatively anyway.<a name=3:27></a>

		The question, therefore, is whether we read the Bible enough, especially sisters, whether we read the New Translation (Darby Translation) and get the accurate translation that it contains.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.J.<a name=4:2></a>F.<a name=4:3></a> Mr.<a name=4:4></a> Darby said of Mr.<a name=4:5></a> Raven to watch that young man for his mind is formed by Scripture.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> Just so.<a name=4:8></a> I would extend that to the sisters.<a name=4:9></a> They should read at home and privately and incessantly themselves, not only wait for the household reading but read themselves.<a name=4:10></a> "From a child thou hast known the sacred letters".<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:12></a> You suggested the other night that we should read our chapters five times and Mr.<a name=4:13></a> Darby's Synopsis once.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:15></a> I would say that.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:17></a> I thought it would confirm the importance of getting things from the Scriptures.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:19></a> Quite so.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=4:21></a>S.<a name=4:22></a> In all our meetings then, including the preaching of the word of God, we are quite right to use the New Translation (Darby Translation).<a name=4:23></a> Is that what I understand?<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:25></a> I think so.<a name=4:26></a> Why not use the best?<a name=4:27></a> The notes, too, in the New Translation (Darby Translation) are very copious and useful and we all should read them if we can, read the notes and commentaries on the text.<a name=4:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=4:29></a>S.<a name=4:30></a> Then our Bibles in the meeting rooms should be the New Translation (Darby Translation) instead of the Authorised version.<a name=4:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:32></a> Well, I would say so.<a name=4:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:34></a>G.<a name=4:35></a> Should not the brethren bring their own Bibles?<a name=4:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:37></a> Very good.<a name=4:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=4:39></a>S.<a name=4:40></a> I mean the Bibles for strangers who come into the rooms.<a name=4:41></a> They should be the New Translation (Darby Translation).<a name=4:42></a> We have a good many Authorised Translations in our meeting rooms.<a name=4:43></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=5:1></a>M.<a name=5:2></a> Is it not important for every brother and sister to have a New Translation (Darby Translation) and read it?<a name=5:3></a> It should be laid on our consciences.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:5></a> Just so and read the notes as well as the text.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=5:7></a>M.<a name=5:8></a> It should be an exercise that those who do not own one should have one.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.J.<a name=5:10></a>F.<a name=5:11></a> In Oxford University they use Mr.<a name=5:12></a> Darby's translation as the best French as a model to learn from.<a name=5:13></a> It ought to be no difficulty for us who love the truth to have it in our homes and in our meetings.<a name=5:14></a> No doubt the Romish authorities are aware of the ministry that is published by us.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:16></a> I quite believe that.<a name=5:17></a> Someone was sitting by a priest who was reading one of our books and the brother nearby to him made an inquiry about it.<a name=5:18></a> He said 'we get all the books that are published'.<a name=5:19></a> So it shows that if we circulate books they ought to be authoritative.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:21></a> Would <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>help us to be attending on the word and accurately acquainted with it?<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:23></a> Quite so.<a name=5:24></a> Of course, we try to get accuracy in these meetings.<a name=5:25></a> We attempt to be accurate and if any brother gives out anything that is not quite accurate, the thing is to question him and point out what is accurate.<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:27></a> You mean if I were to say something that is not quite accurate now, you would check me now?<a name=5:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:29></a> Just so, and whatever you say elsewhere too, I question that if I hear about it.<a name=5:30></a> Every brother should be ready and open to be questioned, because there is so much current among the brethren in different parts of the world that it is right that everything should be accurate.<a name=5:31></a> What is said and done should be accurate.<a name=5:32></a> In some places we get special customs, whereas our customs should all be accurate and agree with each other.<a name=5:33></a>

		F.J.<a name=6:1></a>F.<a name=6:2></a> A priest spoke to me the other day in this country when I was speaking to a man in the hospital.<a name=6:3></a> I said, 'Salvation is found only in Jesus', and the priest said, 'Yes, it is found in Jesus and His church'.<a name=6:4></a> The priest is right, that salvation is not only in the Lord, but in its present aspect it is in the church.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:6></a> Just so.<a name=6:7></a> Mr.<a name=6:8></a> Raven stressed that very particularly, and God used it and has used it ever since, that salvation is not only in Christ but in the assembly.<a name=6:9></a> Why should it not be?<a name=6:10></a> If the assembly is Christ's spouse, she should know everything as taught of Him.<a name=6:11></a> These special meetings now are of first rate importance.<a name=6:12></a> God has greatly blessed them in this country for the last fifty years.<a name=6:13></a> These meetings are little, relatively, but God is blessing them and the thing is that we should agree with each other.<a name=6:14></a> That is to say, we should be catholic; the word would mean that it is universal and we are in agreement with each other.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:16></a>G.<a name=6:17></a> Would you say something as to the three things mentioned in verse 5?<a name=6:18></a> "For our glad tidings were not with you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance".<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:20></a> "Our glad tidings", that is Paul's.<a name=6:21></a> Then again we have corresponding to that, "knowing of whom thou hast learned them", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:14">2 Timothy  3:14</a>.<a name=6:22></a> We should know the persons who say things, that we can rely on what they are saying.<a name=6:23></a> So we have here, "For our glad tidings were not with you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance".<a name=6:24></a> That is to say, the thing is manifest that it is in the power of God.<a name=6:25></a> It is not simply that it is accurate, it is from the Scriptures, but it is in power.<a name=6:26></a> Evidence should be there that it is in power.<a name=6:27></a>

		the glad tidings, so that the Holy Spirit could identify His power with them?<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:2></a> Quite so.<a name=7:3></a> "Knowing of whom thou hast learned them".<a name=7:4></a> So it pleases God if He takes up any whom He would use, to see to it that they arc instructed according to the Scriptures, otherwise we have local customs and local ideas.<a name=7:5></a> In our country people say, 'Well, we say so and so', but it should be accurate or it should not be said.<a name=7:6></a> We should have the Scriptures behind us or we should not say anything.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=7:8></a>B.<a name=7:9></a> The Spirit of truth would bear on this question of accuracy, would it?<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:11></a> Quite so, not only the letter of truth but the spirit of it.<a name=7:12></a> The word <i>spirit</i> has a peculiar meaning in that sense and it ought to be understood, the spirit of a <i>thing</i>, not the spirit of a person.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.K.<a name=7:14></a>C.<a name=7:15></a> Is that why the Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:38">John  7:38</a> "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water"?<a name=7:16></a> It was the Spirit of truth the Lord was bringing forward.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:18></a> Quite so.<a name=7:19></a> "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said".<a name=7:20></a> It is what the scriptures say, not only what the letter is; it is what they say.<a name=7:21></a> Then "out of his belly" means his inwards.<a name=7:22></a> It is not simply external, what is said with his mouth, but his inwards.<a name=7:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=7:24></a> In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4">2 Corinthians  4</a>Paul, speaking about his ministry, says, "We have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.<a name=7:25></a> But if also our gospel is veiled it is veiled in those that are lost".<a name=7:26></a> Would that support what you have in mind as to the importance of the truth?<a name=7:27></a> Is the idea of the Spirit of truth involved in this?<a name=7:28></a>

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:1></a> I would say that.<a name=8:2></a> The Corinthian epistle contains more questioning than any other epistle because Paul himself was questioned there.<a name=8:3></a> It is a humbling thing when the brother who is ministering the truth is questionable, but it is still more humbling if he is questioned unwarrantably.<a name=8:4></a> In Philippians Paul says that some were preaching out of contention, evidently having something against Paul.<a name=8:5></a> It is very humbling that there should be a tendency to question the brethren who are ministering the truth, whereas if they are ministering the truth, the truth ought to commend them.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=8:7></a>B.<a name=8:8></a> When Paul said, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>), did he mean that they were to discern the authoritative element in his ministry?<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:10></a> It is not only that Paul was accurate, but it is the Lord's commandment, and that is what he was stressing.<a name=8:11></a> Let him recognise that the things we minister are the truth, he says, the Lord's commandment.<a name=8:12></a> If the Lord has spoken, there is no more to be said, but to bow to it.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=8:14></a> The Lord Jesus says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:40">John  8:40</a>, "Now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I have heard from God".<a name=8:15></a> Then Paul says in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:16">Galatians  4:16</a>, "So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you?<a name=8:16></a>" It is a serious matter if a brother who seeks to minister the truth is set aside on account of personal feeling.<a name=8:17></a>

		R.W.<a name=8:20></a>S.<a name=8:21></a> Is it not a favour of God that in this country, which is relatively new, you might say, the testimony has been sustained and, we might say, augmented so that there are models whom we can follow?<a name=8:22></a> There are persons whom we can imitate.<a name=8:23></a>

		R.W.<a name=9:6></a>S.<a name=9:7></a> I note in his letters he was here and in Canada, but then he went back to England.<a name=9:8></a> I was thinking of those who came here and stayed here and had children here, and meetings were established here, whether that does not go back to probably 1880, 1890 or 1900 so that young people now have an advantage which young persons did not have forty years ago.<a name=9:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=9:25></a> What has been said in regard to reading the New Translation should help us in relation to the spirit of the truth.<a name=9:26></a> While there is "the scripture of truth" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#10:21">Daniel  10:21</a>), there is the spirit of the truth which has its present bearing on us.<a name=9:27></a>

		J.T.<a name=17:1></a> Referring again to the matter of youthfulness indicated in this epistle, it might be remarked that the word <i>children</i> is used in different senses, not only here, but in John's epistles.<a name=17:2></a> We have stressed the idea of youthfulness and the idea of children, but the first sense is that the word <i>children</i> alludes to the saints generally irrespective of age or growth, whereas on the other hand, the word <i>little children</i> in John's epistle refers to growth.<a name=17:3></a> It corresponds a good deal with what we have in this epistle.<a name=17:4></a> I mention it because some of us may carry away the thought that 'children' is used only of youthful persons, whereas the word sometimes conveys the thought of children generally; that is, God's children.<a name=17:5></a> So we have in John's epistle, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:1">1 John  3:1</a>.<a name=17:6></a> That refers to the saints generally.<a name=17:7></a> It is not a question of youthfulness but rather derivation.<a name=17:8></a> On the other hand, in that same epistle we have the idea of little children, first the idea of children in the general sense, and then we have fathers, and young men and little children.<a name=17:9></a> The latter alludes to youthfulness, to growth and the like.<a name=17:10></a> It is important to keep this in mind so that we are not misled by any expressions as to the saints, because God is thinking of us in the main as His children.<a name=17:11></a> "See what love the Father has given to us".<a name=17:12></a> It is the Father; He has bestowed this on us that we are to be called, not His sons, but His children.<a name=17:13></a> Then the little children refer to the saints who are young in the faith, which is the point in our first epistle, that the saints may be regarded as not developed very much in the truth.<a name=17:14></a> Of course, it is a humbling thing if we are not developed when we

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=57:1></a> From the outset of these meetings it has been commented upon that the coming of the Lord is prominent in this epistle.<a name=57:2></a> The Lord's coming is a phrase familiarly used.<a name=57:3></a> It appears in this chapter peculiarly, not simply His appearing but His coming for us.<a name=57:4></a> It is a hope that we have.<a name=57:5></a> What is noted particularly is those that have fallen asleep; those of the saints who have died are particularly important.<a name=57:6></a> So verse 13 says, "But we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are fallen asleep, to the end that ye be not grieved even as also the rest who have no hope.<a name=57:7></a> For if we believe that Jesus has died and has risen again, so also God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.<a name=57:8></a> (For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we, the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord, are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep; for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice, and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord.<a name=57:9></a> So encourage one another with these words.<a name=57:10></a>)".<a name=57:11></a> I read all the passage that relates to the Lord's coming so that we might have it all clearly before us before we proceed fully in the chapter, and with a view, too, of the further thought of the Lord's coming in chapter 5.<a name=57:12></a> We want to begin with the first thought in chapter 4, which is sanctification.<a name=57:13></a> It says in verse 3, "For this is the will of God, even your sanctification", and it goes on to say, "that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=58:3></a>S.<a name=58:4></a> Paul says in verse 1, "For the rest, then, brethren".<a name=58:5></a> Does that not seem to characterise Paul's epistles, as if having completed the body of the epistle, he brings in some final thoughts in saying, "For the rest"?<a name=58:6></a> This seems to contain a most important part of the epistle.<a name=58:7></a> He sometimes brings in great matters as an appendix.<a name=58:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=58:9></a> That is to say, what remains to be said.<a name=58:10></a> Of course, there is a second epistle which we are not going to look into, but, as you say, "For the rest" would imply what remains to be said now.<a name=58:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=58:12></a>L.<a name=58:13></a> Would verse 10 of the previous chapter help in that, "beseeching exceedingly to the end that we may see your face, and perfect what is lacking in your faith", as if that might have a connection with the beginning of chapter 4?<a name=58:14></a> In all the chapters read, belief or faith seems to have a very important place.<a name=58:15></a> It is only on the basis of our faith and belief that we can come into these truths you are bringing before us.<a name=58:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=58:17></a> Just so.<a name=58:18></a> And the idea is not simply faith in the sense of the profession of Christianity.<a name=58:19></a> It is not simply that, but it is "your faith", that which each one of us has, "a measure of faith", faith being the measure of things for a Christian.<a name=58:20></a> Without faith it is impossible to please God; whatever we have heard as to doctrine, we must have faith or we cannot please God.<a name=58:21></a> Faith is a peculiar thing that God appreciates in His people.<a name=58:22></a> And hence here, "if we believe", that is to say, the coming of the Lord is in mind, but faith underlies all that.<a name=58:23></a> It can only be for those who have faith.<a name=58:24></a> Those who have not faith are awaiting judgment.<a name=58:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=59:1></a> Exactly.<a name=59:2></a> That is the idea of sanctification.<a name=59:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=59:4></a> Sanctification and honour are in contrast to uncleanness, as it says in verse 7, "For God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification".<a name=59:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=59:6></a> Sanctification implies holiness, not simply that we are clean but that we are holy.<a name=59:7></a> It is a great thought with God, to be holy.<a name=59:8></a> "Be ye holy", He says, "for <i>I</i> am holy".<a name=59:9></a> We cannot attach faith to God; faith is not applicable to God, but it is applicable to Christ, however.<a name=59:10></a> He is the Author and Completer of faith.<a name=59:11></a> Holiness belongs to God.<a name=59:12></a> "Be ye holy, for <i>I</i> am holy".<a name=59:13></a> Therefore, this first paragraph refers to sanctification, not only cleanness but sanctification; that is to say, one is to be holy.<a name=59:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.J.<a name=59:15></a>F.<a name=59:16></a> Does that imply that the vessel is ready and suitable to be changed at any moment?<a name=59:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=59:18></a> Just so.<a name=59:19></a> An elect vessel.<a name=59:20></a> Paul himself was an elect vessel unto the Lord, to bear His name before kings.<a name=59:21></a> So God is very concerned about the vessel, that is to say, what it contains, and then the character of the vessel.<a name=59:22></a> It is what you contain or have in you, but character too is in mind.<a name=59:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=59:24></a>S.<a name=59:25></a> Does not the present ministry as to the Holy Spirit directly bear on this?<a name=59:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=59:27></a> There is a word here about that.<a name=59:28></a> Verse 7 says, "For God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification"; and then verse 8, "He therefore that in this disregards his brother, disregards, not man, but God, who has given also his Holy Spirit to you".<a name=59:29></a> The vessel is in mind, but what is in it is the prime thought; that is the Holy Spirit.<a name=59:30></a> There cannot be anything greater than that in anybody.<a name=59:31></a> There must be the idea of the vessel.<a name=59:32></a>

		J.T.<a name=60:1></a> Yes.<a name=60:2></a> "Also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance".<a name=60:3></a> So the vessel is of prime importance in view of what is in it.<a name=60:4></a> The Holy Spirit is in the assembly, of course, but each person, each believer has the Holy Spirit; that is, if he has really received the Holy Spirit.<a name=60:5></a> A person may be born again or at least in some sense a vessel of something in the sense of quickening, but the prime thought is that of a vessel possessing the Holy Spirit, the greatest thing that can attach to us, because it is the presence of God Himself here on earth, in view of His place in the assembly that "God is indeed amongst you".<a name=60:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=60:7></a>H.<a name=60:8></a> Would that be consistent with <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6">1 Corinthians  6</a>, "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?<a name=60:9></a> for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:19">1 Corinthians  6:19</a>, 20?<a name=60:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=60:11></a> Quite so.<a name=60:12></a> Therefore, each vessel here today is of prime importance, that is, not only a believer who is in some sense quickened, but one having faith, a true believer and knowing that he has the Holy Spirit.<a name=60:13></a> So in Ephesus the first point made is "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=60:14></a>" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:2">Acts  19:2</a>.<a name=60:15></a> They did not know about the Spirit, and that is the question, whether we all know about it, and whether we all have the blessed Spirit of God, and thus that our vessels are pure and sanctified.<a name=60:16></a>

		Ques.<a name=60:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>it says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God".<a name=60:18></a> Is that individual?<a name=60:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=60:20></a> Yes, but it might be the assembly, too.<a name=60:21></a> Because of your relation with other believers, you may grieve the Spirit.<a name=60:22></a> You may be all right yourself, but you may affect other believers.<a name=60:23></a> We may not honour other believers as we should.<a name=60:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=61:14></a> The second epistle is just to enforce and enlarge what is contained in the first epistle, the first is the prime thought.<a name=61:15></a> We are being held in our conversation to this matter of sanctification, to get a grasp of it inwardly and carry it away with us.<a name=61:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=61:17></a>M.<a name=61:18></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>Peter says, "And the heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit as to us also".<a name=61:19></a> Faith must precede the Spirit, would you say that?<a name=61:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=61:21></a> That is the idea exactly.<a name=61:22></a> The whole dispensation stands thus; it is a dispensation of faith, but then it is not only that, but there are certain characteristics that this epistle peculiarly stresses.<a name=61:23></a> What we are engaged with now before coming to the thought of the Lord's coming, is sanctification.<a name=61:24></a> The saints should be clear of this world, but especially in this matter of personal relations with others that would defile them peculiarly.<a name=61:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=62:8></a> Well, externally, God would look at them not only in themselves but in relation to their parents, because God is reserving His thought as to what He thinks of parents.<a name=62:9></a> He attaches much to parents, not only individual persons, but their children.<a name=62:10></a> But then they may not all have the Spirit, but God looks at them in relation to their parents.<a name=62:11></a> Then the next thing is for parents to bring up their children "in the discipline and admonition of the Lord".<a name=62:12></a> The parents have to see to that, but at the same time the person may not have anything beyond what we might call quickening, which is not complete, but something of that kind in a person who believes.<a name=62:13></a> If his parent believes, it is more to the point with God that He should refer to the parent as well as to the child, so that the whole household should be saved.<a name=62:14></a> Hence the first reference to salvation is that Noah prepared an ark for the saving of his house and that implied, in principle, what God has effected in the gift of the Spirit in this dispensation.<a name=62:15></a> There were no gifts in the old dispensation, but there was a work of God with men but no completeness.<a name=62:16></a> The law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope does, by which we draw nigh unto God.<a name=62:17></a> It must be the better hope, implying the presence of the Spirit.<a name=62:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=78:1></a> We have already remarked on the subject of the Lord's coming as seen in this epistle, that it is to be divided into two parts, first, the Lord Himself presented by the apostle and a direct word on the point.<a name=78:2></a> "For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that <i>we</i>, the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord, are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep; for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then <i>we</i>, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air".<a name=78:3></a> Now this is the first great part or feature of what is called the Lord's coming.<a name=78:4></a> The second feature is the fifth chapter.<a name=78:5></a> So the word is "concerning the times and the seasons", that is to say, the public coming of the Lord Jesus enters into the idea of times and seasons.<a name=78:6></a> It goes on, "brethren, ye have no need that ye should be written to, for ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night".<a name=78:7></a> Now this is called "the day of the Lord".<a name=78:8></a> It is implied in the expression "the coming of the Lord" but the "day of the Lord" is a longer period.<a name=78:9></a> It would appear in the book of Revelation that it is to be a thousand years, but any way, it is spoken of here as "the day of the Lord".<a name=78:10></a> Our reading this afternoon will cover this latter phase of the so-called Lord's coming.<a name=78:11></a> In the first phase in the fourth chapter it is the Lord coming for His people, and we are to be with Him forever.<a name=78:12></a> "The day of the Lord" involves more; it involves a certain period which may be regarded as the millennium, the period of a thousand years.<a name=78:13></a> It is a day in which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=183:1></a> Before we come on to this chapter, which may be rightly called a parabolic chapter, there is just one word to say about the end of chapter 12.<a name=183:2></a> It seems that there is a slight reflection on Mary, the Lord's mother there, and it may be as well for us to face it and inquire why it should be.<a name=183:3></a> The same thing appears in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>where the Lord's mother refers to Him as if she were directing Him to do something and complaining as to things not being done.<a name=183:4></a> It is only a question now of whether it is seemly for us to refer to it, but I think it is, and needful too, because she is perhaps unduly thought of and exalted.<a name=183:5></a> Although she is a wonderful person, she is not a divine Person; she is just a creature, and the Lord is pleased to make certain reflections, and it is a question for us to inquire why that should be.<a name=183:6></a> We should be guarded too, ourselves, lest any of us should fall into the same error of exalting ourselves at the expense of Christ or of divine things.<a name=183:7></a> In John's gospel she undertakes to say to the Lord, "They have no wine", as if the Lord did not know, and that gives rise to a right inquiry as to why a person such as Mary, great though she was, should, in any way, indicate a reflection on the Lord, because there can be no reflection in any degree at all on any action or doing of Christ.<a name=183:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=183:9></a> Is it not a remarkable thing the way the enemy has seized on this, and established the idea in the great Romish system, that Mary is greater than the Lord?<a name=183:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=183:11></a> Just so.<a name=183:12></a> That is just the very thought that is in mind, lest any of us should in any way fall into that error.<a name=183:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=184:1></a>L.<a name=184:2></a> The Lord seemed to cover that Himself earlier in our book, where He said, "Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve".<a name=184:3></a> He was careful to bring that in at that time.<a name=184:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=184:5></a> That was in answer to the devil, and, of course, what we are saying about Mary has not to be compared with him in any sense.<a name=184:6></a> But at the same time what has just been said is quite right.<a name=184:7></a> It is here in Matthew, and it is also in John.<a name=184:8></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>it was a marriage time, and Jesus was invited to the marriage and so was Mary, and Mary undertook to say to Him, "They have no wine", and the Lord answered immediately, "What have I to do with thee, woman?<a name=184:9></a>".<a name=184:10></a> It would be a very humbling thing that the Lord should say that to her, but still it was needed as a correction, because women are apt to say things like that; not that one would speak of women very much in that sense, but they should be on their guard not to allow themselves to say anything derogatory in any way to divine things, or about divine Persons, or even about the brethren.<a name=184:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=184:12></a>Jr.<a name=184:13></a> It says of Levi according to <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>"Who said to his father and his mother, I see him not, and he acknowledged not his brethren".<a name=184:14></a> Is that the principle the Lord is setting out here?<a name=184:15></a> The natural side is to be rightly in its place so that it may make no intrusion on the levitical service.<a name=184:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=184:17></a> I am sure it is quite apposite at the present time to bring all this up, especially as to Levi, but above all as to the Lord, and as to Mary His mother after the flesh.<a name=184:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=184:19></a>E.<a name=184:20></a> Does all this come forward to assist us in our regard for the Lord as to who He is in Himself, and is it not significant that He is never presented to us as actually addressing Mary as mother?<a name=184:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=185:7></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=185:8></a> In Luke, she is beautifully subject: "Behold the bondmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word".<a name=185:9></a> It is right to bring out the position of Mary and how subject and simple she is, in that sense, according to Luke.<a name=185:10></a>

		P.L.<a name=185:11></a> Does the new generation to which the Lord refers in verses 49 and 50 warrant the parabolical ministry of chapter 13, and is that ministry on the one hand to confirm what is genuine, and, on the other hand, to baffle imitation?<a name=185:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=185:13></a> To confirm what is genuine and to baffle imitation -- I would say that is just the truth.<a name=185:14></a>

		Ques.<a name=185:15></a> Do you think that this matter is intensified in that there were several of them in it?<a name=185:16></a> It says, "his mother and his brethren", as though they were standing together.<a name=185:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=185:18></a> Just so.<a name=185:19></a> John's gospel would enlarge a little on that, too.<a name=185:20></a> It says, "After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days", <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:12">John  2:12</a>.<a name=185:21></a> And again in Luke it says, "he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was in subjection to them", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:51">Luke  2:51</a>.<a name=185:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.A.<a name=186:7></a>T.<a name=186:8></a> Yes.<a name=186:9></a> I noticed how the scripture brought the two expressions together.<a name=186:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=186:11></a> So that that matter is clear, I hope, to all the brethren.<a name=186:12></a> It is well that it should be, and especially because of what obtains in the system alluded to.<a name=186:13></a> I do not feel like speaking much about that system, but it is to be spoken of because what that system sets out is a discredit to the whole testimony, the whole service of God, and the brethren ought to be wholly clear of it.<a name=186:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=186:15></a> Was Mary adjusted in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>when she said: "Whatever he may say to you, do"?<a name=186:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=186:17></a> Quite so.<a name=186:18></a> She is making suggestions for the servants.<a name=186:19></a> There is not very much m it; but still there it is.<a name=186:20></a> She more or less corrects herself.<a name=186:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=186:22></a> Would you say something about the Lord's expression, "for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother"?<a name=186:23></a> Does the Lord use the opportunity to point out that a new generation was coming to light, morally akin to Himself, as doing the will of His Father, and He claims them in kinship with Him?<a name=186:24></a> I wondered whether we were left with that impression that there was something there.<a name=186:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=186:26></a> Yes, just so.<a name=186:27></a> But the question is who these persons are.<a name=186:28></a> The Lord says, "Behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother".<a name=186:29></a> You mean that there is a new generation in those that the Lord

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=187:5></a> Quite so, and the Lord was able to speak freely to them at that time; He was able to speak to them with deep mutual feeling: "Behold my mother", He says, "and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother".<a name=187:6></a> That is a beautiful thing that the Lord should thus speak to His disciples in that sense.<a name=187:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=187:10></a> Just so.<a name=187:11></a> 'Pleasurable selection' is a fine phrase, I would think.<a name=187:12></a> We ought to be glad of phraseology that adorns the Scriptures.<a name=187:13></a> The Lord is Himself alluding to the brethren -- even ourselves -- those that do the will of God.<a name=187:14></a> The greatest thing morally, we might say, is the doing of the will of God, whoever we may be.<a name=187:15></a> Of course, we might easily follow up this thought in the other gospels, but there is not time.<a name=187:16></a> We should proceed now with the gospel of Matthew.<a name=187:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=187:18></a> Are you going to say something now on those sections of the chapter which would be a help to us; a kind of basic outline of the truth that underlies this?<a name=187:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=187:20></a> Well, the next thing is the idea of parables -- parabolic service.<a name=187:21></a> Verse 10: "The disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?<a name=187:22></a> And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given; for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=198:1></a> The brethren will be aware of the occasion we had in Edinburgh, when we started the gospel of Matthew.<a name=198:2></a> The proposal, at that time, was that we should be occupied with the first half of the gospel in the meetings in Edinburgh, and that the second half (especially in view of the assembly) should occupy us at these meetings in London.<a name=198:3></a> Chapter 13 is in mind now because it is a parabolic chapter and treats of things that, we might say, are judicial.<a name=198:4></a> Christendom is on the way to apostasy, not yet openly, but on the way to it, and the thought is that these parables will enable us to deal with what is judicial, as applying to the whole position of Christendom.<a name=198:5></a> Although many who are not walking in the truth fully are Christians, and we do not disregard them, yet the principle of apostasy has set in.<a name=198:6></a> After we have considered this chapter, the thought is to take up the truth of the assembly, not the judicial side of it, but the idea of the whole assembly as the vessel of the Spirit of God here on earth.<a name=198:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=266:1></a> We come here to authority vested in the assembly.<a name=266:2></a> We have had it vested in Peter in chapter 16, but now it is vested in the assembly.<a name=266:3></a> Again, we have here power vested in two or three gathered to the Lord's name.<a name=266:4></a> Thus we have come to what has been enjoyed for many years in the assemblies as regards power; then another thing is that there is power vested not merely in two or three, but in "two of you" as it says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter .<a name=266:5></a>.<a name=266:6></a>.<a name=266:7></a> it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=266:8></a> So that the chapter affords remarkable help, and thus we need not be driven to the wall in any circumstances.<a name=266:9></a> There is a way out for us in the number of the persons mentioned.<a name=266:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=266:11></a> Is the thought of authority in Matthew's gospel first connected with the Lord?<a name=266:12></a> It speaks of Him having authority, and then in chapter 10 He gives authority to the apostles.<a name=266:13></a> Is this chapter authority in the assembly?<a name=266:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=266:15></a> That is right.<a name=266:16></a> An authority that has been used much of late and blessed of God.<a name=266:17></a> That is, the whole assembly is in mind, even though there be twenty or ten or less sub-divisions.<a name=266:18></a> The whole assembly is in mind for the exercise of this authority.<a name=266:19></a> No one of the assembly, or two, or even all the brothers, have the authority committed to them; it is assembly authority, including the brothers and sisters.<a name=266:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=267:3></a> Well, it might be two or three sisters.<a name=267:4></a> In Esthonia, for instance, there were only a few sisters and one brother, and the brother misbehaved and the sisters acted in discipline upon him and withdrew from him, and God owned it.<a name=267:5></a> So that as I was saying, we are never driven to the wall, so to speak.<a name=267:6></a> There is power amongst the brethren, even a few sisters, two or three, in fact "two of you", it says.<a name=267:7></a> So that there is a great power vested in the assembly and in the two or three, even if it be only two or three, or two by themselves, of the assembly.<a name=267:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=267:9></a> Is that why the chapter opens with the reference to the little child?<a name=267:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=267:11></a> Before that is said, the disciples wanted to know who was the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens; a very unbecoming remark or enquiry.<a name=267:12></a> They say "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?<a name=267:13></a>" And the Lord answers that by calling a little child and He says, "Verily I say to you, Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens".<a name=267:14></a> In the second verse it says that Jesus having called a little child to Him "set it in their midst".<a name=267:15></a> That is to say, it is set up in their midst, not exactly as standing by Him, as called to Him, but He set it in their midst.<a name=267:16></a> The force of the words "in their midst" has a great place in this gospel.<a name=267:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=268:6></a> Quite so.<a name=268:7></a> He is never called 'a babe' in Matthew; it is in Luke He is called 'a babe'.<a name=268:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=268:9></a> Herod called Him "the child", but eight times after that, in the second chapter, the Spirit calls Him "the little child".<a name=268:10></a> "Take to thee the little child".<a name=268:11></a> I was thinking of the affecting and attractive way in which the Lord Jesus is thus spoken of as "the little child", wholly at the disposal of another.<a name=268:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=268:13></a> But wholly under the care of another, too -- His mother.<a name=268:14></a> "Take to thee the little child and his mother".<a name=268:15></a> That is, the mother is supposed to be immediately in care of Him.<a name=268:16></a> But then as regards chapter 18, the position is that of a little child.<a name=268:17></a> It is literally a little child and then it develops into a saint, that is a believer.<a name=268:18></a> I mean to say there is elasticity in the divine way at times that is not to be overlooked, and that affords much latitude, in a certain sense, and rightly so.<a name=268:19></a> A person may thus act with a good conscience within the latitude implied.<a name=268:20></a> The Spirit of God Himself brings in latitude, affording latitude to the saints.<a name=268:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=268:24></a> The little child is callable, the Lord can call him.<a name=268:25></a> That is to say, he is supposed to be available to the Lord at His call, and if you develop that into a saint, it brings out the same thought, namely that you are subject to the Lord, according to what the Lord said of Himself, that He was that with the Father.<a name=268:26></a> "Lo, I come (in the roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will".<a name=268:27></a> That all

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:7></a> That is, Timothy was an apostolic delegate; he is representative of Paul.<a name=269:8></a> Paul could send him as his delegate at any time, and he often did so too.<a name=269:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=269:10></a> Would you say a little more in regard of the question of latitude, to which you were referring?<a name=269:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:12></a> God is God, and He would have us to understand that man was made in the image of God, and we should regard ourselves in that light, as representative of God.<a name=269:13></a> He can thus use us at His pleasure, and, of course, what underlies that is subjection on the part of the saints.<a name=269:14></a> Even in the case of a little child literally the principle must be there because of his parents; the parents have control over him; he is always under orders; and so the sisters too are under orders.<a name=269:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=269:16></a> Does not the thought here run on to representation, for the Lord says: "Whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receives me"?<a name=269:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=269:18></a> Exactly.<a name=269:19></a> Then, moreover, little children have angels.<a name=269:20></a> It is a very remarkable thing that angels are allocated to little children.<a name=269:21></a> But then that would also work up to the thought of little children morally.<a name=269:22></a> There is the protection of angels, for we are always under divine protection.<a name=269:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is recorded twice in the passage I read, that He was received up, or taken up, and, of course, it ought to appeal to our hearts, that ours is a going-up time.<a name=395:4></a> The going up belongs to us also, so that we are not concerned with the glory of this world or what it affords to the natural mind.<a name=395:5></a> We are referring to <i>that</i> world, "that world, and the resurrection".<a name=395:6></a> The Lord Himself spoke of those who are counted worthy to have part in <i>that</i> world, and the resurrection; but, as I said, I wanted to come to the word 'worlds' in this first chapter of Hebrews.<a name=395:7></a> As lovers of God, the brethren love to think of His word, the word of God.<a name=395:8></a> It is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and is a divider asunder of soul and spirit, and joints and marrow, and of the thoughts and the intents of the heart.<a name=395:9></a> Who is the Christian that is not exercised on these lines?<a name=395:10></a> and so it is, that I would say a word as to this word 'worlds'.<a name=395:11></a>

		They are made by the Lord Jesus, and the question is, how many worlds there are.<a name=396:1></a> It is a question really involving the Deity, the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, but particularly the deity of Christ; and the question is, how many of us know anything about this great subject of the 'worlds'.<a name=396:2></a> We know something of the present one, the one we are in.<a name=396:3></a> It can be measured geographically; the school-children often know something about it geographically, the solar system and all that, but the solar system does not include all the worlds.<a name=396:4></a> We are to be directed to the greatness of Christ; He is the Maker of all the worlds, as it says here, "by whom also he made the worlds".<a name=396:5></a> <i>He made</i>; that is, He is God.<a name=396:6></a> The "He" is God; therefore the making of the worlds is a creatorial, or rather, I should say, a mediatorial term.<a name=396:7></a> It is creatorial, of course, but I was rather thinking of the idea of mediatorship, of the Mediator.<a name=396:8></a> God has effected redemption through Christ, and many other things, but Christ is Mediator of creation.<a name=396:9></a> The idea of mediatorship was brought out largely in Moses, and so the study of Moses becomes of immense importance as to all these matters.<a name=396:10></a> But now I am speaking of the worlds.<a name=396:11></a> Moses did not speak of that; he did not speak of the mediatorship of the worlds; he spoke of the mediatorship of Moses, and we are told that the law was ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.<a name=396:12></a>

		Well now, I am coming back to my subject, and that is the word 'worlds' -- whether we know anything about the worlds; that is to say, about <i>them</i>.<a name=398:4></a> We know something about the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and they are worlds, of course, in a certain sense, but they are not everything.<a name=398:5></a> There are worlds that we have never seen, or heard of in the ordinary way; we have heard of them, of course, because the scripture speaks of them, here in this very chapter, the Son made the worlds, for they were made mediatorially.<a name=398:6></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>it is said that "All things received being through him".<a name=398:7></a> That is the Son, the Lord Jesus, a divine Person.<a name=398:8></a> He is the Maker of everything.<a name=398:9></a> He is a divine Person.<a name=398:10></a> Not one thing, it says, received being without Him; and so now the question to be worked out a little is, What about these worlds?<a name=398:11></a> Are they anything to us?<a name=398:12></a> Are they anything to wonder at in our minds; anything to bring in reverence, seeing that God has made them, that Christ has made them?<a name=398:13></a> Think of the vastness of the idea!<a name=398:14></a> Of course, even the earth itself is a small thing relatively.<a name=398:15></a> The sun is small, larger than the earth, but still small; and the stars appear small, of course, but then they are all made by the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jesus made everything, not one thing was made without Him.<a name=398:16></a> We are not even told that angels had anything to do with it.<a name=398:17></a> Not one thing was made without Him -- incomparable, the magnitude of it!<a name=398:18></a> and yet it belongs to Christians.<a name=398:19></a> It is one of the things that belong to us, that we should revel in, that we have part in all this vast universe.<a name=398:20></a>

		Now, in the passage I refer to here, in the second verse, this word 'worlds' is said to be a Jewish expression, though that is not in the scripture.<a name=399:1></a> In Scripture it is called 'worlds', it is a plural word.<a name=399:2></a> Possibly the word <i>cosmos</i> is involved, but that usually refers to the earth, things that are made that we know of; but it is not 'the universe' here, it is the word 'worlds' that is here; we do not know how many, and that is what I am saying, that there are so many, the things that we have to deal with are so immense, that they cause reverence and respect, and, we might say, joy as we think of what we are brought into, that the world in itself, that is, the earth, disappears, you might say, in its nothingness.<a name=399:3></a> I repeat, that we do not know, dear brethren, how many worlds there are, but we do know the Creator, we do know the Maker of them, and we worship Him.<a name=399:4></a> We love Him and we worship Him, and that is the great point at the moment.<a name=399:5></a> I would think that all ministry must reduce itself to that.<a name=399:6></a> All ministry must reduce itself to that, to what is in the Father, and what is in the Son, and what is in the Spirit; but, to come now to the point, God made the worlds, by the Son; that is to say, the Lord Jesus has made them, but He has made them mediatorially, in that sense.<a name=399:7></a> He wrought redemption too, mediatorially, but there are things beyond that, that we cannot fathom or reach in our minds, but we do well to ponder them and be worshipful, to think of their existence, and that we have part in them.<a name=399:8></a>

		I hope the brethren will be patient with me, in trying to say what I am saying, because I think everybody will realise something of the magnitude of it, and however big the systems of the worlds are by themselves, they are God's creation and they cause worship in our hearts; and that is the whole point, dear brethren, what causes worship, for we

		are to worship God.<a name=400:1></a> As the angel said to John, "Worship God".<a name=400:2></a> Whatever we may speak about, the first day of the week, and the Lord's supper, the result, the outcome, the thought in all is that we are to worship God.<a name=400:3></a> John bowed down to the angel, but he said, "Worship God"; and that is the word that I would say to every young person here today, 'Accustom yourself to the worship of God'.<a name=400:4></a> "Worship thou Him", it says elsewhere.<a name=400:5></a> And so I go back again to my text, and that is, "By whom also he made the worlds".<a name=400:6></a> I do not go beyond that, although there is much that could be said, that some of us have often spoken of, and that is about the Lord Jesus, "who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made by himself the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high, taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they".<a name=400:7></a> So now I pass on to the book of Acts, having spoken about the worlds.<a name=400:8></a> It is just, as I said before, that the brethren may begin to think of these things, and to think of the vastness that we are brought into; that we are to be worshipful because of it, that we have part in it.<a name=400:9></a>

		So now I want to say a word about the first chapter of the Acts.<a name=400:10></a> The dear brethren will be aware that all one is endeavouring to do is <i>to help</i>, especially the young people who are here, and who perhaps have not much taken account of these great and glorious things.<a name=400:11></a> The book of Acts is the work of the Spirit of God, of course, we might in a way say, the acts of the Spirit of God.<a name=400:12></a> In a sense, the book comprises the works of the Spirit of God; and the thought now is just to call attention to what is going up, what going up means, because it implies what we have in the service of God the worship of

		God, so that in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>we have: "Wherefore he says, Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men.<a name=401:1></a> But that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?<a name=401:2></a> He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=401:3></a> And then again Paul's own remarks in the epistle to the Corinthians, that he said "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago .<a name=401:4></a>.<a name=401:5></a>.<a name=401:6></a> such a one caught up to the third heaven.<a name=401:7></a> And I know such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows;) that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter".<a name=401:8></a>

		Well now, that helps me to say a further word as to the passage in the Acts that we have read; that is to say, the service of God is in mind, and the epistle to the Ephesians exemplifies what it implies, that we have to with such a realm, a non-created realm, and perhaps someone would say it is impossible to know what that means, but it is a fact, it is a non-created realm, for the Lord Jesus has ascended up beyond all the heavens, it says, gone beyond <i>all</i> the heavens, and where are they?<a name=401:9></a> We must stop and think of these things, and become worshipful about it.<a name=401:10></a> Where are they?<a name=401:11></a> Where are these heavens, all the heavens?<a name=401:12></a> How many are there?<a name=401:13></a> We must inquire about these things.<a name=401:14></a> And so, as I said, in this verse, "having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up".<a name=401:15></a> He was taken up; that is, the Lord was taken up, and so when we take part in the service of God on the first day of the week, what do we understand about being taken up?<a name=401:16></a> What do we understand about the third heavens, "above all the heavens"?<a name=401:17></a> I am just endeavouring to say a word to the brethren to stir up our affections as to the magnificence of all

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, as I said, we have the word, "having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up".<a name=402:2></a> And then again we are told in Luke that He lifted up His hands and blessed them, and He was carried up into heaven.<a name=402:3></a> Well, who carried Him up?<a name=402:4></a> Where did He go?<a name=402:5></a> Where is He now?<a name=402:6></a> We might say, bringing the thoughts down to such as Moses, or Elijah.<a name=402:7></a> Where are they now?<a name=402:8></a> Are we inquiring about them?<a name=402:9></a> We belong to this wonderful system of things, even the creature system.<a name=402:10></a> There is the heavenly system of creatures, like the heavens, and we belong to it, we have part in it.<a name=402:11></a> We shall not ever enter into what belongs to divine Persons; at the same time, we are not far away from Them.<a name=402:12></a> They are not far from any one of us, it says; and so we read in John of the nearness of God, and yet the inscrutability of God, that no one has seen God at any time.<a name=402:13></a> No one has seen Him at any time.<a name=402:14></a> We may as well accept that, because it is a fact.<a name=402:15></a> And yet we read in Matthew, that certain ones see God (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:8">Matthew  5:8</a>), but we have to understand.<a name=402:16></a> Philip said to the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest?<a name=402:17></a>" and that is a good question for everybody, as we read the Scriptures.<a name=402:18></a> "Understandest thou what thou readest?<a name=402:19></a>" And be in the things, that you see properly belong to you.<a name=402:20></a>

		Now I am just going to say a word about the last verse of this paragraph, verses 1 - 9.<a name=402:21></a> It says, "And having said these things he was taken up", the same expression as in verse 2.<a name=402:22></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>we read that as He blessed the saints He was carried up.<a name=402:23></a> But where has He gone?<a name=402:24></a> How do we reckon where He has gone, because we only see what we call the sidereal heavens; we do not see everything.<a name=402:25></a> Many things are not visible; the visible and the

	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is that I now close with this thought, in the last verse here, "And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding him" -- they beholding Him -- "and a cloud received him out of their sight".<a name=403:12></a> They beheld Him for a short time, but He was received out of their sight.<a name=403:13></a> So that it is an invisible state of things, dear brethren, and yet we have part in it; though we are but creatures, we have part in it.<a name=403:14></a> We are going to be taken up to heaven, as the Lord was, but only to a point, not as fie was taken up.<a name=403:15></a> That is, He has gone beyond all the heavens, but we are to be taken up, and are going into heaven.<a name=403:16></a> That is what we are enjoying the thought of, that we are going into heaven, that heaven is our place, and the assembly knows that heaven is <i>its</i> place.<a name=403:17></a> In the book of Revelation the assembly of God is seen coming down out of heaven, having the glory of God.<a name=403:18></a> So I leave that with all the dear brethren, and the Lord may give a further word.<a name=403:19></a>
