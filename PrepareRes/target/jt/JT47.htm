		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> What is in mind this evening, in commencing to read the book of Ezekiel, is to show the character of the prophet's gift and of his mission.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapters from which we have read are introductory.<a name=1:5></a> It will be necessary for us in pursuing our subject to keep in mind the description of the living creatures; for it presents much detail, which will only be intelligible to us as we consider the scenes presented in this wonderful book.<a name=1:6></a> Dates have a great place in this book; we read in verse 1: "Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth of the month" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:1">Ezekiel  1:1</a>, and then in verse 2 it says, "it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:2">Ezekiel  1:2</a>.<a name=1:7></a> These two dates are to be understood, if we are to see how ministry is to be prospered, for it is the prophet's ministry which will come before us.<a name=1:8></a> The first date, the thirtieth year, according to a backward computation of the reigns of various kings, alludes to Josiah's reign, and more specifically to the year in which he held the passover -- the eighteenth year of his reign -- and it is evidently implied here that Ezekiel had that in mind; a time of revival and prosperity amongst the saints.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then the reference to Jehoiachin's captivity, of course, suggests the adverse side.<a name=1:10></a> It is a humiliating thought, reminding us of failure and the awful state of the people.<a name=1:11></a> Those two things are necessary in the servant's soul; the idea of a revival as in Josiah's day, thirty years before, and then the sorrowful failure of his family; for Jehoiachin, a grandson of Josiah, is here referred to as in captivity, having been captive for five years when this vision was seen by Ezekiel.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.R.<a name=2:1></a> One who was faithful to God and to man is referred to here as priest; not as prophet.<a name=2:2></a> His priesthood is emphasised.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:4></a> It is not simply a priest but <i>the</i> priest.<a name=2:5></a> "The word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:3">Ezekiel  1:3</a>).<a name=2:6></a> It was characteristic of him.<a name=2:7></a> Now, as remarked, the thirtieth year alludes to the lapse of time since the year of Josiah's passover, which was a landmark in Israel (see <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#35">2 Chronicles  35</a>).<a name=2:8></a> Computing the different periods given, you reach back to that year; the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, a point of great significance as a revival.<a name=2:9></a> There had been no passover like it from the days of Samuel.<a name=2:10></a> That God gives such occasions as that would be a matter of positive importance to the soul of the prophet in his ministry.<a name=2:11></a> A minister ought to have that in mind in his service, for God can cause it to recur.<a name=2:12></a> The other date is sorrowful: one of Josiah's family had failed, and was a captive.<a name=2:13></a> That a king of Judah should be in captivity was indeed a sorrowful matter.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=2:15></a>P.<a name=2:16></a> Do you suggest that in Ezekiel's mind the time dates from the passover?<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:18></a> Evidently.<a name=2:19></a> We do not know if there was any other incident in Ezekiel's mind, but we do know it refers to <i>that</i> year, a most important year in Israel's history.<a name=2:20></a> We can understand that a man like Ezekiel would have it in his mind, as we have the beginning of the great revival in our day, in our minds.<a name=2:21></a> But then there are sorrowful things that have happened during the last hundred years that we have to remember, too.<a name=2:22></a> The <i>date</i> of Josiah's passover is carefully given both in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:24></a>M.<a name=2:25></a> Would these two happenings synchronise?<a name=2:26></a> Would one be seen as from God's side, in blessing, and then would the other be governmental?<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:28></a> Yes, thirty years back, and five years back.<a name=2:29></a> The five years refer to what is humiliating; the captivity of one of the kings of Judah.<a name=2:30></a> I think in that way dates are especially important for those who are serving; that

		is, what has happened in the history of God's people must be kept continually in mind.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:2></a>M.<a name=3:3></a> Would the first date give a sort of impetus to the ministry?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:5></a> Yes.<a name=3:6></a> And the second date would challenge us as to whether we are in captivity or whether we are going on in the energy of revival, looking for another, or looking for the maintenance, to the end, of that which God has recovered.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=3:8></a>E.<a name=3:9></a> The second date is in a parenthesis, as if it were added in a secondary way to strengthen the thought of date.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> It was thirty years from one date and five years from the other; so that Jehoiachin was taken in captivity twenty-five years after the first date.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=3:13></a>P.<a name=3:14></a> Does the reference to Jehoiachin indicate that the ministry of Jeremiah had been refused?<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:16></a> Yes.<a name=3:17></a> Jeremiah's ministry in that period was at Jerusalem.<a name=3:18></a> Ezekiel is ministering away in the east at the river Chebar, where the people had been taken.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:20></a> Is it right to say that in relation to ministry we have what is substantial to look back to, as well as what God may disclose to us in the midst of difficulty, such as the "visions of God" here?<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:22></a> Quite so; the two dates we have referred to would be in the prophet's mind, but now there is something fresh coming in on this particular date; the heavens are opened.<a name=3:23></a> What stimulation there is in that!<a name=3:24></a> Ezekiel says, "the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.<a name=3:25></a> On the fifth of the month, (it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,) the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:1">Ezekiel  1:1</a> - 3).<a name=3:26></a> God is operating now far away from Jerusalem, following up the captives, and a greater thing happens here than perhaps we can find elsewhere in the prophets: the heavens were opened.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:1></a> Do you connect that in any way with matters being directed from heaven?<a name=4:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3 the position would seem to be heavenly, although what is seen is on earth.<a name=4:3></a> The Lord is really in charge of the matter, whether on earth or as directing from heaven.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:5></a> Yes; the heavens are opened; heaven is intervening now.<a name=4:6></a> Influence no longer emanates from Jerusalem; it is from heaven.<a name=4:7></a> So the scene corresponds with incidents in the New Testament: what happened at the banks of the Jordan, and particularly at the death of Stephen, who beheld the heavens opened.<a name=4:8></a> The Son of man was operating from heaven instead of from Jerusalem.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=4:10></a>W.<a name=4:11></a> There are the "visions of God" and "the word of Jehovah".<a name=4:12></a> The "visions of God" seem to be connected with Josiah, and "the word of Jehovah" with Jehoiachin, are they not?<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> Yes; the expression, "visions of God" appears in verse 1; but "the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel" appears in verse 3.<a name=4:15></a> The latter is what he is going to <i>say</i>.<a name=4:16></a> We need not say everything that we <i>see</i>, but the word of Jehovah is urgent.<a name=4:17></a> The vision is not said to be express, but "the word" is.<a name=4:18></a> It is a message.<a name=4:19></a> You may ponder over and enjoy what you see; it may build you up; but the message is express, as it says, "the word of Jehovah came expressly" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:3">Ezekiel  1:3</a>.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=4:21></a>S.<a name=4:22></a> Is this not very similar to the circumstances surrounding John's being at Patmos?<a name=4:23></a> Ezekiel is a captive by the river Chebar, and John was a captive in Patmos; also, John was called up to heaven, and Ezekiel sees the heavens opened as he remains on the earth.<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:25></a> Quite so; there is a correspondence, I am sure, particularly with chapter 4 of Revelation.<a name=4:26></a> The Son of man is seen on earth among the candlesticks in chapter 1 of that book; in chapters 2 and 3 it is "the things that are" (that is the church period), "and the things that are about to be after these" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:19">Revelation  1:19</a> would refer to

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		chapter 4.<a name=5:1></a> The scene of operation is transferred to heaven, so John is caught up to heaven.<a name=5:2></a> We do not get that kind of thing here in Ezekiel, but rather a great system portrayed for us, which God has ordered for the maintenance of His government, Jerusalem having failed Him.<a name=5:3></a> Although the house of David has failed Him, He has this wonderful array of power among the gentiles; hence, it is the Son of man that is in mind; Christ in relation to the nations.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=5:5></a>S.<a name=5:6></a> Why is the first date connected with the reign of Josiah, for Ezekiel at this time was amongst the captives at the river Chebar?<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:8></a> Well, we might go back in our thoughts to what happened in Ireland over a hundred years ago and recognise how God brought about such wonderful recovery; but then, we may be in captivity now.<a name=5:9></a> The position is different, and it is humiliating.<a name=5:10></a> For, in Ezekiel's day, one of the kings of Judah was in captivity, and he refers to that also in mentioning dates.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=5:12></a> Going back a hundred years, we find most of the people of God in captivity, but a remnant was delivered, would you say?<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:14></a> Quite so.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B. Your reference to Ezekiel and the word coming expressly to him is like what is said of the apostle Paul.<a name=5:16></a> The men that were with him at the time of his conversion saw the light, but they "heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:9">Acts  22:9</a>.<a name=5:17></a> Paul could record exactly what he heard in the message.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:19></a> Quite so.<a name=5:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:7">Acts  9:7</a>, it is said they heard the voice, but that would be in the sense of 'sound' as the margin reads.<a name=5:21></a> Saul heard <i>words</i>: he heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?<a name=5:22></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=5:23></a>S.<a name=5:24></a> Would the second date given suggest the moral conditions that obtained at the time Ezekiel ministered?<a name=5:25></a> Reference has been made to the refusal of Jeremiah's prophecy.<a name=5:26></a> Ezekiel evidently was one who
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		had accepted it, and in those deplorable moral conditions there was this priest to whom the word of God came expressly.<a name=6:1></a> Is it not an encouragement to us at the present time that there are still possibilities?<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:3></a> Quite so; you would want to be a priest so that God could trust you with a message.<a name=6:4></a> The apostle Paul says, "the Spirit speaks expressly", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:1">1 Timothy  4:1</a>.<a name=6:5></a> It is an urgent matter.<a name=6:6></a> You want to be available to the Lord, and I believe that is the force of the expression "Ezekiel the priest".<a name=6:7></a> Jeremiah was one of the priests, but Ezekiel is a distinctive priest, evidently characteristically so, so that God can trust him with this message.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The nearer we get to the beginning of that thirty years, the brighter things will be found to be.<a name=6:9></a> Ezekiel was reverting to a brighter period.<a name=6:10></a> Whether or not he had part in it we cannot definitely say; but it would recall the blessed time they had in the days of Josiah.<a name=6:11></a> One can understand how a priest of God would revert to such a time as that.<a name=6:12></a> Why not have times like it again?<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:14></a> Will you say something more about the vision in contrast to speaking?<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:16></a> Well, what you <i>see</i> is one thing; what you <i>say</i> is another.<a name=6:17></a> Take Stephen, for instance.<a name=6:18></a> We are told that he saw the glory of God and <i>Jesus</i>, but he does not say that.<a name=6:19></a> He says, "Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:56">Acts  7:56</a>.<a name=6:20></a> The account of the Spirit of God in verse 55 is: "But being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>, but when Stephen spoke in testimony he called Him "Son of man".<a name=6:21></a> The time had come to announce the truth as to the Lord's position as the Son of man, which is a wider thought of Christ; His operations would now extend out to the whole race of man.<a name=6:22></a> So that the servant does not always say just what he sees.<a name=6:23></a> The levitical touch means that I know <i>what</i> to say.<a name=6:24></a> You find it constantly in Scripture with servants of God.<a name=6:25></a>

		They see something and then present in testimony what is suitable at the moment.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:2></a> Paul also, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>, saw a vision.<a name=7:3></a> The Lord said to Ananias, "behold, he is praying, and has seen in a vision a man" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:12">Acts  9:12</a>.<a name=7:4></a> Is there any suggestion in the introduction of vision there of the setting aside of the speaking at Jerusalem?<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:6></a> The vision in Saul's case was Ananias coming in and putting his hands on him.<a name=7:7></a> In our chapter, Ezekiel says, "the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:1">Ezekiel  1:1</a>.<a name=7:8></a> Then we have the description of what he saw, and in order to grasp this we have to look over the chapter carefully.<a name=7:9></a> He says: "And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass, out of the midst of the fire.<a name=7:10></a> Also out of the midst thereof, the likeness of four living creatures.<a name=7:11></a> And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.<a name=7:12></a> And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.<a name=7:13></a> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled as the look of burnished brass.<a name=7:14></a> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings: their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.<a name=7:15></a> And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.<a name=7:16></a> And their faces and their wings were parted above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.<a name=7:17></a> And they went every one straight forward: whither the Spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:4">Ezekiel  1:4</a> - 12).<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be helpful for all, I think, to see that the general appearance of this great array is the appearance

	<div class="paragraph">
		of a man.<a name=8:1></a> It is not the presentation of the beasts, but it is a question of <i>man</i>.<a name=8:2></a> There are the four heads of creation, but the general appearance has the <i>likeness</i> of a man.<a name=8:3></a> And then there is a man's <i>hand</i>, and then the likeness of their faces was the <i>face</i> of a man.<a name=8:4></a> These three items help us to understand what is in mind; that they are not heartless, like the beasts of the gentile monarchies.<a name=8:5></a> Man is the characterising thought in them.<a name=8:6></a> The idea of "man" runs right through, both as to their general appearance and their faces and then the operative part -- the hands -- were the hands of a man.<a name=8:7></a> All is human.<a name=8:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=8:9></a> Is this array of power in the living creatures connected with the movement of testimony from Jerusalem to Chaldea?<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:11></a> That is the thought; God has this immense power among the gentiles, and He is bringing Ezekiel into it.<a name=8:12></a> It is to give character to Ezekiel's prophecy, as I hope we shall see as we go through the book.<a name=8:13></a> The "man" runs through the governmental dealings of God.<a name=8:14></a> The gentile monarchies are likened to beasts, but here the characterising feature is man.<a name=8:15></a> There is sympathy for men in it.<a name=8:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=8:17></a>M.<a name=8:18></a> Does it suggest special regard for men in contrast to the dealings of God with Israel?<a name=8:19></a> Israel was set aside, and now in the Son of man, God acts in affection towards recovery in the race of men.<a name=8:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:21></a> Of course sympathetic consideration marked God's dealings with Israel too.<a name=8:22></a> But here the threefold allusion to man is striking.<a name=8:23></a> Then finally a <i>Man</i> on the throne; supreme authority above is in Man.<a name=8:24></a> The first part of the description runs on to verse 12, where we have the living creatures and their wings moving with the Spirit.<a name=8:25></a> And then the general operative power in verses 13 and 14; there is no idea of presenting concreteness here.<a name=8:26></a> These are symbols; hence the frequency of the words "likeness" and "appearance".<a name=8:27></a> The intent is to impress our minds with the ideas

		suggested.<a name=9:1></a> It is really what marks the agencies of the government of God.<a name=9:2></a> The operative part is most energetic and rapid and characterised by fire.<a name=9:3></a> And then we have, from verse 15 to the end of verse 21, the idea of wheels and unity in the movement, and the same spirit was in the wheels and in the living creature, and they all moved together; the wheels allude to the contact with the earth.<a name=9:4></a> This government makes contact with the earth, because wheels have to do with solid earth.<a name=9:5></a> And then, in verse 22, we have an expanse or firmament over the heads of the living creature, and above that expanse, a throne (verse 26).<a name=9:6></a> The whole domain of God's operations would be suggested; the wheels on the earth, and then the expanse above, which has the look of a "terrible crystal", so that we are impressed with the majesty of God, and the greatness, the incomprehensibleness of the means and sphere of His government.<a name=9:7></a> It is intended to subdue us and cause us to fear Him in all this.<a name=9:8></a> Then, over this, the throne, as it says: "And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.<a name=9:9></a> And I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the appearance of fire, within it round about; from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.<a name=9:10></a> As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.<a name=9:11></a> This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah.<a name=9:12></a> And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke" (verses 26 - 28).<a name=9:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=23:1></a> At our first reading in Ezekiel, we considered chapters 1 - 3, which deal mainly with the fitting of the prophet for his great service.<a name=23:2></a> Chapters 4 - 7 (particularly chapter 4) depict his initial service, into which personal suffering entered.<a name=23:3></a> Chapters 8 - 11, taken together, are a subdivision of a great section which extends to chapter 19.<a name=23:4></a> In our two readings today we should cover, in a general way, the teaching of chapters 4 - 11, inclusive, so that we can begin with chapter 12 next time.<a name=23:5></a>

		The first subject to be considered is the sign which portrays a siege against Jerusalem: "And thou, son of man, take thee a brick, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, -- Jerusalem: and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast a mound against it, and set camps against it, and place battering-rams against it round about.<a name=23:6></a> And take unto thee an iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: this shall be a sign to the house of Israel", <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#4:1">Ezekiel  4:1</a> - 3.<a name=23:7></a> This is the first solemn lesson in relation to an apostate condition of things; how God has laid siege against it; the prophet being used to represent the besieging power, from which there is no possible escape.<a name=23:8></a> The city is completely circumvented for destruction.<a name=23:9></a> Then the prophet himself endures suffering during two periods of three hundred and ninety days, and forty days, respectively.<a name=23:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:3></a> That is the thought.<a name=24:4></a> It brings those who serve into the character of signs, for God employs signs; and He employs His people as signs.<a name=24:5></a> This book is very much marked by that; indeed, all the prophets are marked by it, more or less; and the Lord Jesus brings in the same idea Himself.<a name=24:6></a> The book of Revelation was written on this basis, for it is "signified"; that is, it is set out by signs; so that evidently those whom God uses should be ready to be employed in this way.<a name=24:7></a> The people later ask the prophet what he means by these things, and he tells them.<a name=24:8></a> Something which happens in the way of a sign from God would occasion inquiry, which gives opportunity to bring in the mind of God in detail.<a name=24:9></a> So that Ezekiel's portrayal of the city would be that: the apostate condition of things was to be entirely circumvented.<a name=24:10></a> There was to be no escape; utter destruction is in mind.<a name=24:11></a> In like manner, the book of Revelation shows that utter destruction will fall upon the present apostate state of things.<a name=24:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:16></a> Well, his prophetic writings certainly help as to these signs, because they open up the truth.<a name=24:17></a> Prophetic ministry was a great feature of the recovery of the truth; not simply prophetic ministry in the sense that we have had it before us recently, as bringing to us the mind of God on current conditions, but opening up the detail of future events.<a name=24:18></a>

		It is important that we have the force of the word as to the siege clearly in our minds, first, that God is dealing with the apostate condition that exists, and will deal with it thoroughly.<a name=25:2></a> There is no possibility of escape.<a name=25:3></a> This sign shows that.<a name=25:4></a> It was a siege.<a name=25:5></a> The forts are built <i>against</i> it.<a name=25:6></a> Notice the word "against".<a name=25:7></a> "Cast a mound against it, and set camps against it, and place battering-rams against it round about.<a name=25:8></a> And take thou unto thee an iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between thee and the city" (it would be a protection for the besieging power); "and set thy face against it .<a name=25:9></a>.<a name=25:10></a>.<a name=25:11></a> and thou shalt lay siege against it" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#4:2">Ezekiel  4:2</a>, 3).<a name=25:12></a> It is very remarkable language, showing the thoroughness of the judgment that God announced.<a name=25:13></a> The system is to be completely destroyed.<a name=25:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=25:17></a> If people do not hear, they may <i>see</i>, in spite of themselves, and this extraordinary intervention did cause them to inquire what it meant, as we see later on.<a name=25:18></a> In view of the current thought in the world that there will be continual evolution to a perfect state of things, it is well to see that complete destruction is in the mind of God for the whole system.<a name=25:19></a> There is no possibility of escape!<a name=25:20></a> It is a very solemn matter, because we are in the midst of a state that is doomed, in this sense; so that Jeremiah, whose ministry corresponds to this testimony, was in the very midst of the city, and the gospel to those in it called upon them to go out from it.<a name=25:21></a> That is the gospel that Jeremiah preached.<a name=25:22></a> It was a very sorrowful service, for he had to announce the destruction of what he loved -- the city of Jerusalem -- and likewise with Ezekiel too, for the city is called

		J.T.<a name=32:13></a> Yes.<a name=32:14></a> His ministry in the synoptic gospels was mainly outside of Jerusalem.<a name=32:15></a> John gives us more in Jerusalem than the others, but He operated outside of it; and His ministry invariably pointed to the destruction of the current system, and when He drew near to Jerusalem, He formally stated that her enemies would come and build a palisaded mound against her; "these are days of avenging", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21:22">Luke  21:22</a>.<a name=32:16></a> But then He was about to die in the midst of it, as Ezekiel was here, in type; so that the besieging was really in the ministry of Christ.<a name=32:17></a> The atoning sufferings typified in chapter 4 of Ezekiel were also fulfilled in Him.<a name=32:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=44:12></a> Yes; but then, in regard to the terrible judgment of chapter 7, as though the commercial ability of the Jew were in mind, it says, "The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for fierce anger is upon all the multitude thereof.<a name=44:13></a> For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, even though he were yet alive amongst the living: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof; it shall not be revoked; and none shall through his iniquity assure his life" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#7:12">Ezekiel  7:12</a>, 13).<a name=44:14></a> The allusion is to mercantile pursuits, which so characterise that people,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=45:3></a> Do you think that the expression, "none shall through his iniquity assure his life" would include the thought of unions in the commercial world?<a name=45:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=45:5></a> Quite so; they set forth the idea of iniquity assuring your life, but the saints cannot do things on those lines, for it is iniquity, as has often been pointed out.<a name=45:6></a> Trade unions involve iniquitous associations and murder.<a name=45:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=45:8></a> The purpose in the back of one's mind in connecting with a trade union would be to "assure" things.<a name=45:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=45:10></a> Quite so; so you can see that the judgment in chapter 7 is a complete breaking up of that sort of thing, including commerce.<a name=45:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=45:16></a> Quite so.<a name=45:17></a> Now, in regard to chapter 8, it says in verses 3 and 4, "And he stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entry of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.<a name=45:18></a> And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the valley" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#8:3">Ezekiel  8:3</a>,4.<a name=45:19></a> It seems to me that this links on with what we have had before us.<a name=45:20></a> The hair in chapter 5 is ornamentation, but the person is shorn of it with a razor, and a terrible process of discipline is seen in what follows there, but now we have the hair on the head and strong enough to be used to hold the man up.<a name=45:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=47:1></a> Although we have read in chapters 9, 10, and 11 tonight, it should be kept in mind that our section begins with chapter 8 and is a sub-division of a great section that runs from the beginning of chapter 8 to the end of chapter 19.<a name=47:2></a> According to what has previously come before us, the testimony is presented in the power of resurrection, as typified in the lock of the hair of the prophet.<a name=47:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last verse we have read tonight should be kept in mind as we proceed with our reading.<a name=47:4></a> The prophet says, "And I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had shewn me" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#11:25">Ezekiel  11:25</a>); showing that what is received from the Lord by those who minister amongst the saints is shown to all; here those of the captivity are particularly in view.<a name=47:5></a> This verse closes the section we are considering and would help us to bear in mind that ministry is the outcome of what we receive from the Lord, and that we do not reserve it for any special or personal reasons, but give out what we receive.<a name=47:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 8 shows that what is current at Jerusalem is the spirit of idolatry, provocative of jealousy.<a name=47:7></a> So that we have: "And he brought me to the entry of the court, and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall.<a name=47:8></a> And he said unto me, Son of man, dig now through the wall; and I digged through the wall, and behold, a door.<a name=47:9></a> And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.<a name=47:10></a> And I went in and looked, and behold, every form of creeping thing and abominable beast, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.<a name=47:11></a> And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it will be observed that these chapters have in mind personal conduct; names of specific persons are mentioned, one of whom dies in chapter 11, and Jehovah is seen calling attention to the evil, and directing the judgments against it in a personal way.<a name=48:5></a> So that this section would call upon us to <i>be with God</i> in what He is doing today.<a name=48:6></a> There is the general evil condition, but there are also certain persons who are prominent in the evil, and then there are certain persons, beside the prophet, who are brought into the service of judgment with God.<a name=48:7></a> Personalities are stressed as being involved in the evil, but in these circumstances, God Himself acts directly and calls others in a personal way into action with Him; so that they become workers with God.<a name=48:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=48:9></a>P.<a name=48:10></a> Is there significance in the fact that the living creatures, and other details of the vision which the prophet saw at Chebar, are referred to in this section?<a name=48:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=48:12></a> I think so.<a name=48:13></a> It is to bring out that it is all one matter.<a name=48:14></a> It began at the river Chebar, where the saints were in captivity; the scene now is transferred to Jerusalem, but it is the same array of power; the same instrumentalities; the same system of judgment.<a name=48:15></a> That is not to be lost sight of.<a name=48:16></a> But I think this section brings out, peculiarly, individuality in God Himself, and in persons He uses.<a name=48:17></a> The idea of individuality has a great place in the Scriptures, set out in persons who minister and who call attention to themselves.<a name=48:18></a> For example, we find the expressions, "I Daniel", "I Paul", "I John", and the Lord Jesus uses the same expression, "I Jesus".<a name=48:19></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=49>[Page 49]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that is to stress the idea of individuality in divine service.<a name=49:1></a> This is confirmed in the reference (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#8:2">Ezekiel  8:2</a>), to "the appearance of his loins" downward and upward.<a name=49:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B-w.<a name=49:3></a> You referred to resurrection in chapter 8, and the glory there.<a name=49:4></a> Does that connect with this section?<a name=49:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=49:6></a> Yes.<a name=49:7></a> These chapters present the glory seen in judgment and show that the divine lustre does not deteriorate.<a name=49:8></a> It is seen in judgment later in Stephen, when his face shone as an angel.<a name=49:9></a> The glory was there -- judicial glory -- and, of course, God's glory does not deteriorate when it enters into judgment.<a name=49:10></a> God's glory shines unchangeably; so that in the scripture before us the glory appears, and Jehovah Himself comes in and directs everything in a personal way.<a name=49:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B-w.<a name=49:12></a> In chapter 8 both the image of jealousy and the glory are seen, but later, the glory departs.<a name=49:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=49:14></a> One of the thoughts that run through this section is the departure of the glory, It is a humbling and sorrowful contemplation.<a name=49:15></a> The wife of Phinehas, when dying, named her child Ichabod, saying, "The glory is departed from Israel", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#4:21">1 Samuel  4:21</a>.<a name=49:16></a> But its departure is in view of the recovery of the people and its return.<a name=49:17></a> Here it is very slow to leave, for judgment is God's strange work, but alas!<a name=49:18></a> the glory has to leave: "And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.<a name=49:19></a> And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#11:22">Ezekiel  11:22</a>, 23).<a name=49:20></a> It is the glory, but it is gradually departing; it is not <i>ceasing</i>; we shall see it coming back later.<a name=49:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=49:22></a>M.<a name=49:23></a> You spoke of individuality and of God Himself coming in; do you think that would be a feature of latter church history, which would conform to what was at the beginning?<a name=49:24></a> We read of distinctive persons in the Acts, but we might be slow to realise that the same idea is in the mind of the Spirit for the present time.<a name=49:25></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=50>[Page 50]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=50:1></a> I thought we might see that there is such a thing as that; that God Himself is acting.<a name=50:2></a> There is the general thought of judgment in the siege; but God is not seen in the siege.<a name=50:3></a> It is rather that others are besieging, but this section, from chapter 8 on, I think, brings out that God Himself acts, and others are brought into it, in the sense of personality.<a name=50:4></a> The section stresses judicial action, but at the same time has in view that another order of things is presently to come into view.<a name=50:5></a> The Acts would give us this same view of things; judicial action on the part of God against Jerusalem, but, at the same time, another order of things in view -- "Jerusalem above" -- awaiting Paul's ministry for its introduction and development.<a name=50:6></a> Our part is to carry on the <i>positive</i> side of the truth.<a name=50:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=50:8></a>W.<a name=50:9></a> Would the thought of the individuality of God which has been referred to, be illustrated in the matter of the sin of Ananias and Sapphira, as being against the Holy Spirit?<a name=50:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=50:11></a> I think that is good; God is seen in the three Persons there; divine personality is seen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>; "God" in verse 4; "the Holy Spirit" in verse 3; and "the Lord" in verse 9.<a name=50:12></a> Peter alleges that the sin was against each.<a name=50:13></a> Divine personality is clearly brought in there.<a name=50:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=50:15></a> Then also in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, the thought of personality is stressed, where the upper chamber is alluded to, where were staying "Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude the brother of lames" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:13">Acts  1:13</a>).<a name=50:16></a> And then also "the crowd of names who were together, was about a hundred and twenty"; each one is distinguished.<a name=50:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=50:18></a> Quite so; personality is in mind in the <i>names</i> mentioned, and then in the <i>crowd of names</i>, too; and I think, at the end of the dispensation, it is very suggestive that God is helping us as to the Persons of the Godhead, and how They stand in the testimony.<a name=50:19></a> I think we may

		refer to that here, because it is touching that God Himself is directing everything in our scriptures, especially in chapters 9 and 10.<a name=51:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.N.<a name=51:2></a> The scriptures read seem to make a difference between those who dwell at Jerusalem and Judah, and those in the captivity.<a name=51:3></a> Would you define that for us?<a name=51:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=51:5></a> Well, we have a word in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#24">Jeremiah  24</a>about two baskets of figs; one basket full of very good figs, and the other basket had very bad figs.<a name=51:6></a> The latter would refer to those who were left in Jerusalem, for the principle for the moment was to leave Jerusalem.<a name=51:7></a> Nebuchadnezzar was said to be Jehovah's servant; not Zedekiah, the reigning king in Judah.<a name=51:8></a> Zedekiah was regarded as lawless, and those remaining with him in Jerusalem were viewed in the same way; as bad figs.<a name=51:9></a> They did not submit to the governmental dealings of God.<a name=51:10></a> They stayed in Jerusalem, as though things were right there.<a name=51:11></a> <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#11">Ezekiel  11</a>is the same thing; they suppose the position is right, when it is wrong.<a name=51:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the figs were said to be very bad -- a very remarkable word and it applies as much today, where there is disregard for the governmental dealings of God.<a name=51:13></a> It is a time for governmental dealings, and there are those who disregard them altogether, paying no attention to them, assuming that things are all right, when they are <i>not</i> right.<a name=51:14></a> God is dealing judicially with them, as it says, "whosoever has not, even what he seems to have shall be taken from him", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:18">Luke  8:18</a>.<a name=51:15></a> That is what is going on all around us, and people are paying no attention to it.<a name=51:16></a> But then, there is the other side, for it also says, "whosoever has, to him shall be given".<a name=51:17></a> So that in the prophet Jeremiah, the good figs are those whom Nebuchadnezzar took away in the first captivity: the king, the princes, the craftsmen, and the smiths; they were honoured in that way, being persons of usefulness, constructive persons.<a name=51:18></a> They were carried away captive, but were viewed as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		submissive to the government of God, and God's hand was over them for good.<a name=52:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the same idea is found in Ezekiel, for those who were in Jerusalem were not subject to the government of God, and God Himself directed the judgment against them, whilst those in the captivity are viewed in the light of favour, and the message through Ezekiel is taken to them, namely, "all the things that Jehovah had shewn me" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#11:25">Ezekiel  11:25</a>).<a name=52:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.N.<a name=52:3></a> Referring again to Jeremiah, the good figs as brought back and presented at the door of the temple would be for food.<a name=52:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=52:5></a> Quite so.<a name=52:6></a> The Lord sought for figs when here; He was hungry, but He found none.<a name=52:7></a> But now there are good figs in one basket -- those viewed as subject to God's dealings, as we have seen.<a name=52:8></a> But those actually at Jerusalem were very bad; worse than if there were none.<a name=52:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=52:10></a> The condition is called "wicked" in this book: it says, "she hath rebelled against my judgments in wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for mine ordinances have they refused; and my statutes, they have not walked in them" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#5:6">Ezekiel  5:6</a>).<a name=52:11></a> I was thinking of what you were saying about what is committed.<a name=52:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>, the bondman who disregarded the proper use of what was committed to him was called a "wicked bondman".<a name=52:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=52:14></a> Yes; an ordinary judge would hardly pronounce that upon him.<a name=52:15></a> He just hid the talent in the earth; did not use it.<a name=52:16></a> That is wickedness, for he is called a "wicked bondman".<a name=52:17></a> I think we are perhaps too slow to recognise that insubjection to the government of God is wickedness, whatever form it may take.<a name=52:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=94:1></a> It is thought that we should at this time cover the section from chapters 20 to 24.<a name=94:2></a> There is a correspondence between chapters 16 and 20, a noteworthy distinction, however, being that chapter 16 deals with <i>Jerusalem</i>, enlarging upon the divine service in taking her up, beautifying her, and entering into marriage relation with her, and then stresses in great detail her unfaithfulness; whereas in chapter 20 it is the <i>nation</i>, taken up from Egypt, to stress its history from the side of the incorrigibleness of the flesh.<a name=94:3></a> The chapter takes up the history in sections: they began to sin in Egypt -- even before they entered the wilderness they sinned; and then as in the wilderness they sinned (the wilderness period being enlarged upon), and then they sinned as in the land; as much as to say that the flesh is incorrigible under all circumstances.<a name=94:4></a> It becomes a most important chapter in the book from that point of view.<a name=94:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing which we should bear in mind in a practical way, is that this chapter calls upon Ezekiel to judge, as does also chapter 22.<a name=94:6></a> Verse 3 of chapter 20 says, "Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel", and then in verse 4, "Wilt thou judge them, wilt thou judge, son of man?<a name=94:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#20:3">Ezekiel  20:3</a>,4.<a name=94:8></a> Also in verse 2 of chapter 22: "And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city?<a name=94:9></a>" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#22:2">Ezekiel  22:2</a>.<a name=94:10></a> It seems as though these verses are a call to us now to have a judgment as to the whole professing position.<a name=94:11></a> God has judged it, but is there any one in accord with His mind?<a name=94:12></a> "Wilt thou judge them?<a name=94:13></a>" It would seem as if God, as acting judicially, brings His people, however few, into accord with His mind.<a name=94:14></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#18:20">Revelation  18:20</a>, "for God has judged your judgment upon her".<a name=94:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=116:1></a> In view of the ground to be covered, we should look at chapters 25 to 32 at this reading.<a name=116:2></a> These chapters deal with the subject of God's judgment on certain nations in proximity to Israel: Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyre, Sidon and Egypt.<a name=116:3></a> In chapter 32 other nations are mentioned as showing the judgment of Egypt, but she is in mind throughout chapters 29 - 32.<a name=116:4></a> The Lord would help us in the understanding of what is represented by each nation mentioned.<a name=116:5></a> Each is presented as representing some feature of the world with which we have to do.<a name=116:6></a> They do not include all the ancient nations, but rather those that were specially in relation or proximity to Israel.<a name=116:7></a>

		And what should be before us initially is the position in which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, is seen.<a name=116:8></a> He is called "king of kings", in the midst of these nations; and as about to be used of God in His judgment upon them, Nebuchadnezzar represents the element of government which is owned of God.<a name=116:9></a> This should be distinguished from the features of those nations mentioned; they are brought forward to represent different moral features of the world; whereas Nebuchadnezzar is on God's side in the midst of all that, as representing His government.<a name=116:10></a> He has the title "king of kings", that is, his is universal dominion, divinely given; an element which we should understand in our day, for he represents the rule that has come down to our times.<a name=116:11></a> The Spirit of God has grouped these nations together for our instruction at the present time, as representing the features of the world with which we must contend; whereas Nebuchadnezzar, as the universal ruler, is outside of all that.<a name=116:12></a> He is the emperor -- the beginning of the great system of government which God inaugurated, when He set Israel aside.<a name=116:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=117:4></a> That is how he is regarded here; he is not judged in this book.<a name=117:5></a> Babylon is not seen as judged.<a name=117:6></a> Other prophets speak of the judgment of Babylon, but not Ezekiel, in any precise way.<a name=117:7></a> So that Nebuchadnezzar would represent the element of government inaugurated by God, until the restoration of Israel, which we should respect and for which we should pray, whereas the other nations would represent features of the world, as the Lord said: "Woe to the world because of offences!<a name=117:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:7">Matthew  18:7</a>); it is the world in a moral sense in its varied features.<a name=117:9></a>

		The important subject in view of Israel's recovery, or in view of the saints of today entering on their privileges, is that we should understand the judgment of the world in these features which come near to us -- Jerusalem itself is included in the pronouncement earlier.<a name=117:10></a> The setting aside, in judgment, of the ornament of the earth -- the temple in Jerusalem, represented figuratively in Ezekiel's wife -- should affect us as it affected Ezekiel in chapter 24.<a name=117:11></a> What God primarily set up in a religious way becomes an object of endearment to us, and if we are unduly occupied with externals, we are apt to allow too great a place to it and contravene the judgment of God.<a name=117:12></a> So Ezekiel is told not to mourn the death of his wife.<a name=117:13></a> I believe that chapter 24 is to regulate us in our attitude toward what has been peculiarly of God in a public way, lest we overlook that it has come under judgment.<a name=117:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=118:15></a> Quite so; features of the world which are seen in the profession.<a name=118:16></a> Then we have the Philistines, who are not related to us; they have no natural link with the saints, but they are in Canaan and so in proximity to the saints.<a name=118:17></a> The Philistines have a nearer place than such as Tyre and Egypt.<a name=118:18></a> So we have to distinguish between these four features; they are grouped together in chapter 25.<a name=118:19></a> Comparatively small space is given to each of the four, but when we come to Tyre and Egypt, each has a large place in the book, especially Egypt.<a name=118:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=119:5></a> Because of the ground they occupied.<a name=119:6></a> They were rivals in the same territory; the other three are rivals, not exactly in our own territory, but in lineal relation; but all four are against what is of God.<a name=119:7></a> So that with regard to Ammon it says, "prophesy against them; and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah .<a name=119:8></a>.<a name=119:9></a>.<a name=119:10></a> Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity: therefore behold, I will give thee to the children of the east for a possession" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#25:3">Ezekiel  25:3</a>, 4).<a name=119:11></a> You can see what their attitude was.<a name=119:12></a> When God's people were under His judgment and discipline, there was a bitterness against them, and God takes account of that.<a name=119:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, of the Moabites, Jehovah says, "Because Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations, therefore behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities even to the last of them .<a name=119:14></a>.<a name=119:15></a>.<a name=119:16></a> unto the children of the east" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#25:8">Ezekiel  25:8</a> -10).<a name=119:17></a> They say that the people of God have become like the rest, on the same plane as all the nations, there is no distinction; whereas God never gives up the thought of what His real people are to Him, whatever discipline they may be enduring.<a name=119:18></a>

		Chapter 35 reminds us of the sorrowful side of our position -- referring to Edom, the false brother and the appeal to us to be true.<a name=156:11></a> A true brother is born for adversity, which is the direct opposite to Edom; the brother who is characteristically adverse, as we have here: "Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword, in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#35:5">Ezekiel  35:5</a>).<a name=156:12></a> Edom from his very birth was to be set aside, with the final result that God said, "I hated Esau", <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#1:3">Malachi  1:3</a>.<a name=156:13></a> The first epistle of John helps us as regards the true and false brother.<a name=156:14></a> We are to be like David; that is, like Christ as seen in David, we are to lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=156:15></a> Today there are imitations of what is characteristic of brethren.<a name=156:16></a> There is no opposition more specious than imitation of what is of God.<a name=156:17></a>

		At our last reading we considered the dimensions of the sanctuary of God recorded in this book of the prophet Ezekiel, as seen in a vision by the prophet, who was taken by the Measurer to the various parts of the house.<a name=206:1></a> In chapter 43, which is before us now, we have the divine approval of the sanctuary, so measured, for we are told that the glory entered, "And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#43:2">Ezekiel  43:2</a>); and then, "the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose front was toward the east" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#43:4">Ezekiel  43:4</a>).<a name=206:2></a> And then the prophet hears one speaking to him out of the house saying, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#43:7">Ezekiel  43:7</a>).<a name=206:3></a>

		There is a certain correspondence in this instruction as to the incoming glory, with that which we have upon the completion of the tabernacle in Exodus, and the temple built by Solomon; so that the first element of teaching this evening refers to the conditions which God can approve amongst His people, enabling Him to be among us.<a name=206:4></a> Then secondly, we have the altar -- its dimensions and dedication -- having the service of God in view; and thirdly, chapter 44, which gives particulars as to the gate which looks toward the east, suggesting how exclusive it is, for it was to be kept shut and used only by the prince.<a name=206:5></a> Thus provision is made for the distinction of our Lord Jesus above the saints; provision is made for Him personally.<a name=206:6></a> Then the priesthood is referred to in verses 15 - 31 of the same chapter.<a name=206:7></a> The two chapters may be thus subdivided into these main sections, and what is developed in them deserves careful consideration, for it is a question of what is suitable to God, whether in the

		What is in mind, dear brethren, this evening is divine resource, flowing out and becoming available to us.<a name=293:1></a> The section of this book, in which I have read, beginning with chapter 40 to the end of the book, is unique in Scripture.<a name=293:2></a> It is marked by measurement, not generally of what should exist and does not, but of what actually exists -- specially the house of God.<a name=293:3></a> Most of the section is taken up with this structure and its approaches, and accompanying and accessory buildings, but all viewed as existent.<a name=293:4></a> This chapter contemplates the sanctuary as existing, divinely measured, that we might have the concrete thing before us.<a name=293:5></a> It is to exist in actuality in the future and in every way according to God.<a name=293:6></a>

		By the Lord's help I would use these scriptures to develop a little the thought of <i>faith</i>, but faith linked with the Holy Spirit.<a name=305:1></a> We are told by the apostle Paul, in his first letter to Timotheus, that the dispensation of God is in faith.<a name=305:2></a> But the very thought of dispensation involves more than faith, the word "dispensation" there alludes to what is dispensed, quoting from the New Translation; it involves the house of God, the centre down here of His operations.<a name=305:3></a> Heaven indeed is our centre, our metropolis, but the assembly is God's centre here on earth, and those who undertake to operate on God's behalf must show that they have part in the house and are subject to its order, recognising that God is indeed there.<a name=305:4></a> This challenges all operations professedly in the gospel, missionary enterprise, so-called: all evangelical work is unauthorised, except as it issues from the house.<a name=305:5></a> What I am saying I know affects much activity which professedly is in the Lord's name, but God has not changed His mind at all since Pentecost, since the apostolic days, and all gifts were set in the assembly (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:28">1 Corinthians  12:28</a>), and all services were under the Lord.<a name=305:6></a>
	</div>

		In the prophet Ezekiel we have a river which typically represents the power in which operations professedly on God's behalf are to be carried on.<a name=305:7></a> He who describes the river was in the inner court of the house, and he saw it there first, coming down out of the house on the right side under the threshold, on the south side of the altar.<a name=305:8></a> Then, brought round by the north gate, he sees it issuing forth at the gate looking eastward, and it becomes a great river.<a name=305:9></a> These are facts known to most of us, but they deal with what I am saying,

		that divine operations centre in the house of God, and all otherwise centred have no divine mandate at all, and that is what the apostle has in mind in saying that the dispensation of God is in faith, but faith working out in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=306:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In selecting these scriptures I wish to show how the Spirit is linked with faith, and faith with the Spirit, first in the epistle to the Ephesians, which, we may say, corresponds with the river, not only as ankle deep, but as waters to swim in.<a name=306:2></a> The fulness of the gospel is in mind in that epistle, not only the terms, as in Romans, but "the unsearchable riches of the Christ" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>.<a name=306:3></a> Ezekiel speaks of the river that cannot be passed over; nor is the gospel ever compassed, even by the preachers, it is the glad tidings of the <i>unsearchable</i> riches of the Christ.<a name=306:4></a> It is the gospel of God concerning His Son.<a name=306:5></a> The more we proceed in it, the greater, fuller, and, we may say, the more infinite, it becomes.<a name=306:6></a> So the apostle alludes to the reception of the Holy Spirit, and, in speaking of this matter, I may say that one has for many years been convinced that there are many who have faith and have not the Spirit; and there are those, too, who assume that the Spirit is given automatically as faith exists, which is not true.<a name=306:7></a> The Spirit is a gift, it is the gift of God to us -- Christ <i>for us</i>, the Spirit <i>to us</i> -- and He reserves His right to give in His own way.<a name=306:8></a> We can never assume that He acts automatically; He is God, He acts from Himself, acts sovereignly, and as He pleases, always consistently with Himself.<a name=306:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in reverting to the early history of the assembly at Ephesus, tracing the river to its source, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>brings out the inquiry made of the twelve men that were there as to whether they had received the Holy Spirit since they had believed.<a name=306:10></a> The Holy Spirit had been on earth, He had been in the assembly, for a good while, but they had to say, "We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:2">Acts  19:2</a>.<a name=306:11></a> You can see, therefore, that a certain state in persons is essential to the gift

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is much that is called gospel that cannot be said to be the word of truth, and I believe that is the secret of so much weakness among christians; the gospel, involving the word of truth, has not been received.<a name=307:7></a> The word of truth makes way for the Spirit of truth, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth.<a name=307:8></a> As the condition effected in our souls by the word of truth exists, there can be no doubt that there will not be much delay in the gift of the Spirit, but, as I said, it is not given automatically.<a name=307:9></a> The gift of the Spirit is for believers, but these things that I am saying are to be observed, they are most important.<a name=307:10></a> Another thing is that God gives the Holy Spirit to those that obey Him.<a name=307:11></a> Lawless persons and the reception of the Spirit are quite incompatible, and yet we find persons alluding to themselves as having the Spirit and yet moving in lawlessness; not even in the fellowship of God's Son, or of His death, but standing aside from it, and even having part in other fellowships which are worldly, and not according to God.<a name=307:12></a> These facts are not compatible at all with the reception of the Holy Spirit; morally God cannot give His Spirit to lawless persons.<a name=307:13></a>

		I stress this a little at the beginning, because one has felt for years that the weakness among those who are nominally brethren is largely due to the fact that many have not the Spirit, for the reason that they have not received the word of the truth, the gospel of their salvation, nor have they practised obedience, submitting themselves unqualifiedly to the authority of God in Christ.<a name=308:1></a> The Ephesians had, and it is a very beautiful account in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>, they received Paul's word immediately -- "when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:5">Acts  19:5</a>; that would mean that they were detached from whatever else they had been in.<a name=308:2></a> The truth detaches us from what is not of God, and it also attaches us to what is of Him -- a dual operation.<a name=308:3></a> So that these twelve men accepted baptism to the name of the Lord Jesus, and then Paul laid his hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came upon them.<a name=308:4></a> Let us not weaken the words of Scripture in these matters.<a name=308:5></a> These men were not sealed as they were baptised, but as Paul laid his hands on them.<a name=308:6></a> How careful Scripture is as regards this matter!<a name=308:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, having said all that, I want to show from the scripture in Genesis how this period is marked by light -- by information or instruction received from the Holy Spirit.<a name=308:8></a> This present dispensation is one of faith, and all is to be worked out by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit; the coming dispensation will be one of sight, the Holy Spirit will be there too according to the prophecy of Joel which Peter quotes in the Acts.<a name=308:9></a> A consideration of the truth governing the reception of the Spirit will show that we have the Holy Spirit in a peculiarly exclusive way, and we are entirely dependent on Him for what we know; if we are to know divine things we must get our knowledge from Him.<a name=308:10></a> That, I believe, enters into this passage in Genesis, the Scriptures being minutely accurate, even in the types -- indeed, one wonders at their accuracy.<a name=308:11></a> There are two transactions noted here.<a name=308:12></a> You will observe that Noah

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we may profitably notice, and accept it as applying at the present time, that if we are to be rightly informed as to anything, it must be through the Holy Spirit.<a name=309:5></a> I am not ignoring the ways and means He has of communicating things to us.<a name=309:6></a> He uses this and that one whom He has fitted in some way to serve us, but it all comes through the Spirit.<a name=309:7></a> Of course it is under the Lord; the economy requires the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.<a name=309:8></a> The Father, in whom the supreme thought of the Deity is presented to us, to be worshipped and revered; the Son in the office of Lord over all the operations; and the Spirit here permanently knowing everything accurately.<a name=309:9></a> Of course all the divine Persons know things accurately, but the presence of the Holy Spirit carries the thought of first-hand knowledge of everything, whether in God or here below; He searches the depths of God, and is also conversant with all conditions here, specially among the brethren; so that the instruction comes through Him, and it is well for us if we accept it.<a name=309:10></a> There may be signs of the times, these refer to sight, people speak of them and bring in prophetic subjects; but any information or instruction that can be relied upon must come through the Holy Spirit.<a name=309:11></a>

		We should notice that Noah sends out the dove three times; first she comes back and he takes her to him into the ark; the second time she comes back at eventide with an olive leaf plucked off, meaning that there has been a day's work, as it were, at eventide, and a result involving instruction; that is, fruit was there, for the leaf was plucked off -- it was attached to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is, I believe, a helpful link in our subject and will keep our minds steady in our walk here, that we should not be deceived by what the eye sees.<a name=310:10></a> We shall be more dependent on God and on the Holy Spirit, so that we may get the true thoughts of God about everything, as the apostle says further about the Spirit to the Corinthians, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=310:11></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>.<a name=310:12></a> The keenest prognosticators of things that are occurring, if they have not the Holy Spirit, are very untrustworthy; whereas those who have the Spirit of God get, not only direct teaching in words, but feelings and sensibilities, and acquire a certain way of assurance as to everything.<a name=310:13></a> "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=310:14></a>" -- one of the greatest facts is thus presented to us; not only that the Spirit is here, but He dwells in the

		Another scripture that helps us in this way is <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>.<a name=311:2></a> Many of us will have noticed that on the great day of atonement there is no scape-bullock; there is a scapegoat; and the epistle to the Hebrews enlightens us as to the bullock: "The Holy Spirit also bears us witness of it", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:15">Hebrews  10:15</a>.<a name=311:3></a> The Holy Spirit is a witness to us as to the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=311:4></a> It is to <i>faith</i>; the scape-goat is for sight.<a name=311:5></a> The new covenant is quoted immediately to bring out that forgiveness of sins is involved in it.<a name=311:6></a> So it is not what we see, for Christ has been taken out of view; "a cloud received him out of their sight" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:9">Acts  1:9</a>; hence the period of faith, and the Holy Spirit makes good what the absence of a scape-bullock means.<a name=311:7></a> The Holy Spirit witnesses to us, so that the believer today has more sense of real forgiveness than men will have in the future; it is through the Holy Spirit in us.<a name=311:8></a> The witness to us is by the presentation of what is in the Scriptures, but nevertheless there is the Holy Spirit; it is not what we see, but the Spirit confirming our faith.<a name=311:9></a>

		I want to go on to speak of the other scriptures a little, so as to point out how faith works with the Spirit, and, before proceeding to Stephen and Barnabas, I would call attention to Thomas.<a name=311:10></a> The Lord singles him out to bring out the truth that I am stressing now.<a name=311:11></a> He says to him, "blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed" <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:29">John  20:29</a>; there is a peculiar blessing attached to faith.<a name=311:12></a> The Lord had in His mind this present wonderful period, and every one of us surely would seek to understand the blessing to which the Lord refers.<a name=311:13></a> In connection with that, I want to point out how absenting ourselves from the gatherings of the brethren tends to weaken our faith, to make us sceptical.<a name=311:14></a> There is much more scepticism than many of us will admit.<a name=311:15></a> The questions that are being asked constantly indicate a certain amount of scepticism in the saints, and I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to what has been said, normally the gatherings of the saints involve the temple, the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=312:4></a> Even the meetings for prayer bring in the sense of the presence of God by the Spirit.<a name=312:5></a> "But <i>ye</i>, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life", <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#20">Jude  20</a>, 21.<a name=312:6></a> Praying in the Holy Spirit -- I cannot afford to be absent from such a meeting for prayer.<a name=312:7></a> Of course private prayer is most important, but where the Holy Spirit is present, as in the meetings for prayer, the advantage is special.<a name=312:8></a> So in all the other gatherings of the saints.<a name=312:9></a> How often people slip away for a holiday from a meeting like this, for instance, turning their backs on it for a little bit of relaxation.<a name=312:10></a> What do they see on the beach?<a name=312:11></a> I am not saying that the ocean is not a testimony to the power of God, not that physical gain does not accrue from contact with it, but people see things there that damage their souls.<a name=312:12></a>

		I am speaking now of how easily we slip away from our greatest advantages by which our faith is confirmed, and where the Holy Spirit can affect us in a living way, causing our hearts to rejoice.<a name=312:13></a> The believers at Antioch, after Paul and Barnabas had been there, are said to have been filled with joy and the Holy Spirit; that is the true effect of the gospel.<a name=312:14></a> Not only joy, as with Philip's converts in Samaria; without the Spirit that would not

		last, and hence the Spirit soon came.<a name=313:1></a> But at Antioch, where Paul and Barnabas preached, the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.<a name=313:2></a> I am bringing these things in so that we may see the greatness of all we are brought into, and how easily we may miss it and the blessed features of it, and become sceptical.<a name=313:3></a> Thomas was sceptical, avowedly so -- he said, "Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe" <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:25">John  20:25</a>.<a name=313:4></a> He was avowedly sceptical, and how often one notices people indicating unbelief as to the things of God, and they exhibit no sense of shame in it.<a name=313:5></a> Faithful attendance at the meetings, dear brethren, will greatly help to promote faith, and also joy in the Holy Spirit.<a name=313:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I want to show how Stephen and Barnabas exemplify this matter of faith and of the Spirit.<a name=313:7></a> They refer to what I may call crises in the history of the saints; these are coming up constantly and they call for faith and the Spirit.<a name=313:8></a> The first crisis was the murmuring of the Hellenists against the Jews; the Hellenists, having come from a distance, assumed they were not as favourably treated as those near by -- a very common thing -- but they were murmuring.<a name=313:9></a> Even if there is some cause for it, murmuring is a naughty element among the brethren; it is foreign to the assembly, viewed normally, and what is needed to meet it is faith and the Holy Spirit, and that was what marked Stephen.<a name=313:10></a> The direction of the apostles was that the people should choose out men full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, and Stephen is mentioned first; he is said to have been "a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:5">Acts  6:5</a>.<a name=313:11></a> A crisis usually brings out a man like that.<a name=313:12></a> In a small measure today, of course, it is to be looked for, for God is never taken by surprise; He is always ready, and Stephen was the man; there were six others.<a name=313:13></a> Stephen and Philip stand out, although Philip is not said to have been full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; there is a certain shortage

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is said of Stephen that he was "full of grace and power", as he "wrought wonders and great signs among the people" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:8">Acts  6:8</a>.<a name=314:2></a> See what a man he was.<a name=314:3></a> He is one of the most remarkable servants of God, and he began as a deacon.<a name=314:4></a> We are not given any account of his work as a deacon, but the <i>man</i> is placed before us in the Scripture, and he is a model for us in crises: one ready under God's hand for an occasion, and the Spirit of God directs the minds of the saints to him.<a name=314:5></a> Full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and full of grace and power; and then his countenance was as the face of an angel.<a name=314:6></a> That is the man; the Spirit of God causes him to stand out before us.<a name=314:7></a> Let us not lose the sense the Spirit would give us in directing our view to Stephen.<a name=314:8></a> He is a man of glory, a man who goes "from glory to glory" in his service.<a name=314:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Barnabas also comes in with peculiar distinction; he is introduced before Stephen, as a son of consolation; that is another thing, a man that can comfort the brethren, a son of consolation.<a name=314:10></a> We much need that, too; brethren who are going on -- even the brightest of us -- need consolation.<a name=314:11></a> The apostles evidently had consolation in Barnabas.<a name=314:12></a> You can picture him coming up with his money, laying it at the apostles' feet.<a name=314:13></a> As a Levite he should not have had land; but the thing is done publicly, he is not hiding anything.<a name=314:14></a> He is now ministering consolation to the brethren, and proving what he is, a work of God; and opportunity for service suited to him is near.<a name=314:15></a> It is no longer a question of crises, such as we have in chapter 6, but a great work of God among the nations; the assembly characteristically has ears for that.<a name=314:16></a> It has not ears for all the things that occupy those of this world, but it has ears for all that God is doing.<a name=314:17></a> The Spirit of God sees to it that all

		J.T.<a name=317:1></a> What is in mind is the thought of rest; first in the bearing of it in regard to the dispensations of God which in Scripture are said to have come upon us.<a name=317:2></a> It is particularly in mind to dwell on 2 Chronicles, the account given of the ark as in rest in the temple, which is followed by service of a peculiarly rich kind that is not found recorded in the corresponding passage in 1 Kings.<a name=317:3></a> As it is obvious that the books of Chronicles were written in remnant times, the bearing of this passage on ourselves is specially to be noticed.<a name=317:4></a> It has come down to us; the dispensations having come upon us.<a name=317:5></a> The first book gives us a beautiful phrase: "after that the ark was in rest" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#6:31">1 Chronicles  6:31</a>); but chapter 5 of the second book, from which we have read, records historically how it entered into rest; and in view of the glory coming in at that time we should inquire as to whether the period in which we are corresponds in any way.<a name=317:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage in 1 Corinthians is read just because it speaks of the end in a formal way.<a name=317:7></a> All these periods of divine operations and their results in men have this end in mind; the state of things in which God is "all in all".<a name=317:8></a> The state of the saints is in mind; He is all as <i>in</i> us.<a name=317:9></a> It is clearly not what He is in abstract Deity, but what He is in revelation, dwelling in the results He has reached: "all", but all in us, "all in all".<a name=317:10></a> This gives a rather wide range, but the thought to be before us is the practical side of this matter, especially in 2 Chronicles.<a name=317:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is a remarkable paragraph of Scripture; and then the fulness of that, the fulness that God would have and look for, is opened up to us in chapter 2.<a name=318:14></a> It is the thought of response to any position of that kind; here God in rest.<a name=318:15></a> He rests, of course, in Himself abstractly, In His Deity, but then He is resting now in relation to what He has made; not indeed leaving it to operate by itself, but the great operation was finished, and now there would be <i>fulness</i>.<a name=318:16></a> In chapter 2 God continues to open up His thoughts as to His creation, especially in Adam and Eve: "Ish" and "Ishshah".<a name=318:17></a>

		So the addition to <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8">1 Kings  8</a>is in verses 11 - 13 of our chapter: ".<a name=366:3></a>.<a name=366:4></a>.<a name=366:5></a> (for all the priests that were present were hallowed without observing the courses; and the Levites the singers, all they of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, clad in byssus, with cymbals and lutes and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets) -- it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever; that then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#5:11">2 Chronicles  5:11</a> - 13.<a name=366:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings out the great enlargement in the mind of the writer of the books of Chronicles; and surely it should appeal to us now as to whether we are ready for enlargement, or whether we are simply living in the past.<a name=366:7></a> Is the Spirit inactive?<a name=366:8></a> Not at all!<a name=366:9></a> The Spirit is here.<a name=366:10></a> "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts", <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#4:6">Zechariah  4:6</a>.<a name=366:11></a> Zechariah enlarges on that in remnant times; and it is for us, that we might make room for the Spirit to enlarge us.<a name=366:12></a>

		I confess that I am very little able to speak much about glory, though I find myself speaking a good deal of it; but that one should speak of it with understanding is what one is concerned about.<a name=366:13></a> The glory of Jehovah (for that is the word here) filled the house of <i>God</i>: God is the great Ultimate, dear brethren in all this -- not the Father, exactly, nor Jehovah, but <i>God</i>; God as presented to us in the Scriptures.<a name=366:14></a> The first verse of Scripture uses a word to express Him which implies that we are to worship Him, that He is to be served, that He is to be revered, that He is supreme.<a name=366:15></a> Here

		"the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God".<a name=367:1></a> It seems to me that it is a beautiful touch, a touch that such a man as wrote this book was able to give by the Spirit, in order to direct our minds to God as the great Ultimate of all things: "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:36">Romans  11:36</a>.<a name=367:2></a> The glory of Jehovah fills <i>the house of God</i>.<a name=367:3></a>

		What is to be noticed in verse 13 is "to make one sound to be heard".<a name=367:4></a> It is not simply that the sound is there, but it is to be heard.<a name=367:5></a> I was speaking earlier of sound from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>; but now it is one sound from human musicians, but worshippers, qualified worshippers, and they are able to make <i>one</i> sound.<a name=367:6></a> Is God not leading us to that?<a name=367:7></a> Is He not seeking to help us to repudiate all selfishness, and pride, and rivalry, and ambition, in His service; that there might be unison -- not only the unity of the Spirit and the unity of the faith, but the unity of <i>sound</i>?<a name=367:8></a> We do not get this in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>it is the supreme thought in relation to what I am saying, and it is to be <i>heard</i>.<a name=367:9></a> There is no use in talking about these things unless they are to be realised.<a name=367:10></a> Here we have one voice heard "in praising and thanking Jehovah".<a name=367:11></a> It is very touching to connect this with the prison in Philippi: the sound was heard coming from those two sufferers, who in prayer praised God with singing.<a name=367:12></a> The prisoners listened to them.<a name=367:13></a> The sound was heard.<a name=367:14></a> The children in the temple were praising the Lord, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21:15">Matthew  21:15</a>.<a name=367:15></a> Who heard it?<a name=367:16></a> -- the Lord heard it.<a name=367:17></a> His enemies said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying?<a name=367:18></a> He says in effect, I hear!<a name=367:19></a> What they were singing was to be heard.<a name=367:20></a> So, as I said, in the prison at Philippi, the singers were heard: "the prisoners listened to them", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:25">Acts  16:25</a>.<a name=367:21></a>

		What is in mind is to enlarge on these scriptures as presenting the important thought of <i>standing before God</i>.<a name=368:1></a> It is seen in Zechariah, where God is said to be the "Lord of all the earth".<a name=368:2></a> It is hoped, by the Lord's help, first to call attention to these "four spirits of the heavens", as they are called in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6">Zechariah  6</a>, and these "two anointed ones", also standing before the Lord of all the earth, in chapter 4.<a name=368:3></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#15">Jeremiah  15</a>, to remind us of the danger, as in this attitude of standing before God, of becoming discouraged, being complainants (whether verbally or in our hearts) as if God were unfair to us.<a name=368:4></a> Fourthly, how young people come into this favour through obedience, especially to parents; and finally we may see the great privilege afforded to us as priests, that we may stand before God and minister to Him.<a name=368:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is of peculiar importance at the present time, as embodying the idea of government, the four monarchies seen in this chapter under the heading of horses being spoken of as "the four spirits of the heavens" <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:5">Zechariah  6:5</a>.<a name=368:6></a> This is a unique explanation, but one which is to be noted, in view of the apparent danger in some quarters of disregarding governors: those whom God has appointed to maintain things, in His government, pending the return of Him to whom the government belongs -- the King of kings and Lord of lords -- that is to say, our great and glorious Emperor, still rejected, is about to take unto Himself His great power and reign.<a name=368:7></a> These four powers designated here as the four spirits of the heavens are, from the very designation itself, evidently appointed of God.<a name=368:8></a> Be they Babylonians or Medes or Persians or Greeks or Romans; be they what they may personally, they are designated in this way by God, and all who love God and who

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then correlative with that, there is the question of "all the earth", not merely a particular country, specially favoured.<a name=369:12></a> There are those of us who consider our own particular country or countries, and pray for them and rejoice in their prosperity, but the spirit of the heavens would enable us to think of <i>all</i> the earth.<a name=369:13></a> The Lord Jesus, we are told, is seen coming down from heaven with the rainbow on His head, and He puts His right

		So we have these two "sons of oil".<a name=370:6></a> We may have no part in the government -- save through our prayers -- but we certainly, as I assume, take on this second designation, namely, the "anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth" <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#4:14">Zechariah  4:14</a>.<a name=370:7></a> The four spirits of the heavens make the testimony of these two a possibility and, dear brethren, it is our privilege to occupy this place of testimony.<a name=370:8></a> Thank God, we do take it up a little, but one would urge the great importance of taking our places under this heading -- two anointed ones, or, as the margin reads, <i>sons of oil</i>; typically, persons who are developed in the thought of the Spirit.<a name=370:9></a> How important at this juncture that we should read Scripture, read it in the spirit of it, as the Holy Spirit gives us understanding, that we should understand what this oil means!<a name=370:10></a> It is the Holy Spirit, as I said, not as the earnest of our inheritance, but as seen publicly in us, the correlative witness to the rule of the four monarchies.<a name=370:11></a> The service of these two sons of oil is to continue.<a name=370:12></a> How this thought enlarges us as to the little we may be doing!<a name=370:13></a>

		It is in mind to speak of confirmation; confirmation in what is right, of course, what is of God; that, as we have been led by light into the things of God, and taken up a public attitude in relation to them, we might be confirmed.<a name=396:1></a> Many have not been confirmed and have receded from ground taken up: so in regard to many now -- it may be in this hall -- although from one cause or another they have taken up a public position in relation to Christ, they are not confirmed in it and are thus in danger of recession, affording the enemy in each instance an opportunity of attack on the position of the testimony -- the position proper to it.<a name=396:2></a> These three scriptures will serve to show, as I hope, how confirmation comes about; for it were better we never took up a position in relation to Christ than that we should subsequently recede from it, because in doing that we discredit it.<a name=396:3></a> I may say here, that taking up a position in the testimony, in the fellowship, as we speak, and receding from it is not optional: it cannot be done with impunity.<a name=396:4></a> Some assume that they can withdraw from it as they might resign an ordinary occupation or appointment, but this cannot be, for heaven's records have to be borne in mind; and if one is on the rolls, he has to give account; after taking his place with the people of God, he can never be afterwards what he was before.<a name=396:5></a> These records have to be looked into, and the conscience of the assembly here normally is the transcript of what is up there, hence there must be a balancing of the matter in each case.<a name=396:6></a>

		My remarks, dear brethren, will centre in Abraham -- in Christ, of course -- but Abraham will be regarded as the subject.<a name=431:1></a> He has a great place in Scripture, not only in the Old Testament, but also in the New.<a name=431:2></a> With Moses and David he has the most outstanding place in the New Testament, that is, of those honoured men, servants of God, mentioned in the Old Testament.<a name=431:3></a> Generally the mention of a man in the New Testament indicates his place in the service and testimony of God.<a name=431:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham is employed, not only as an example for us of faith and works, but he is used by the Lord in the well-known parable in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16">Luke  16</a>.<a name=431:5></a> He is selected to fill a remarkable place, in a figurative way, no doubt, but still Abraham is mentioned as representing peculiar privilege in the unseen world.<a name=431:6></a> And the Lord elsewhere refers to him as living, saying that God is "the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:37">Luke  20:37</a>); adding "For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living".<a name=431:7></a> Although he is used in a symbolical way in the parable (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16">Luke  16</a>), yet he is brought into it, and that is not accidental.<a name=431:8></a> The Lord had pleasure in bringing Abraham into such distinction, mentioning even his bosom, showing that he must have been a man of great affection.<a name=431:9></a> Lazarus, when he died, "was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16:22">Luke  16:22</a>.<a name=431:10></a> The Lord referred to Abraham in this parable as a man worthy of such mention.<a name=431:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not that the departed saints are literally employed as in their disembodied condition; it would be very fallacious to assume that they are used in a general sense.<a name=431:12></a> But there is nothing impossible with God, and, as it is said, He brought Moses and Elijah on to the mount of transfiguration; it was so; and that <i>He</i> brought up Samuel is a fact.<a name=431:13></a> God was acting in a <i>special</i> way.<a name=431:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He has a right to do this, honouring certain of His saints at the same time.<a name=432:1></a> It was not merely to accomplish a certain purpose in the testimony, but also included the place that they had in the divine mind; and nothing is more precious than to be held in the divine mind in this practical way.<a name=432:2></a> Abraham is outstanding in this respect.<a name=432:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So one may freely bring him forward in a service of this kind, in order that lessons may be learned from him.<a name=432:4></a> The first scripture read introduces him to us as "<i>believing</i> Abraham".<a name=432:5></a> Paul by the Spirit refers to him in this way.<a name=432:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:16">Romans  4:16</a> he refers to him as "the father of us all", a statement that has to be understood by the context; for God is our Father, but the Spirit of God comes down to us and speaks so as to make the truth intelligible, not, of course, to the natural mind, but to the spiritual; although it may be only of small development, as in the Corinthians.<a name=432:7></a> Paul said he could only speak to them as babes; but he did speak to them as christians -- they were "babes in Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:1">1 Corinthians  3:1</a>.<a name=432:8></a> Their status therefore was equal to others in Christ.<a name=432:9></a> One is honoured, however small his measure, as in that position.<a name=432:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have this way of divine teaching, God taking up a man like Abraham and stating that he is the father of believers; that is to be understood in the same sense in which he is said to have a bosom into which Lazarus was carried.<a name=432:11></a> Thus in Galatians he is "believing Abraham!<a name=432:12></a>" The word <i>faithful</i>, as in the Authorised Version, is hardly correct; it is a question of faith rather than being faithful.<a name=432:13></a> Faith is a word scarcely used in the Old Testament, although it is used, and Abraham is the father of all who had faith, and who <i>have</i> faith.<a name=432:14></a> Here he is "believing Abraham", a word we should all take to heart, as other similar points, in an educational sense; such as "repenting", that one is a "repenting sinner", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:7">Luke  15:7</a>.<a name=432:15></a> It is not that he repented historically, at a given time, or that he believed, but that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=433>[Page 433]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		he is a repenting sinner and believing, as Abraham was believing.<a name=433:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So "believing Abraham" entering into the present dispensation, is of first-rate importance; for whilst history enters into our training and growth, it is always what we <i>are</i> that counts.<a name=433:2></a> One challenges oneself as to whether one <i>is</i> believing, for believers "are blessed with believing Abraham".<a name=433:3></a> No believer wishes to isolate himself; of course he values individual blessings, but love is always correlative, in the growth of the christian, with other features, and would always include the brethren.<a name=433:4></a> Love for all saints would say that one is blessed with them, but then, blessed with all <i>believing</i> ones, we are "blessed with believing Abraham".<a name=433:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Faith is that without which we cannot please God, but that does not simply mean that I believed in the Lord Jesus at a certain time, but that I am a believer <i>characteristically</i>.<a name=433:6></a> So in regard of assembly material, in the first great missionary journey of Paul he observed a man that had faith, before it is said that the man believed.<a name=433:7></a> The apostle discerned that he had faith, that is, the lame man at Lystra (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14">Acts  14</a>).<a name=433:8></a> He represents a feature of assembly material.<a name=433:9></a> It is useless to talk of assembly service and assembly material aside from faith; the present time is the period of faith; "God's dispensation, .<a name=433:10></a>.<a name=433:11></a>.<a name=433:12></a> is in faith" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:4">1 Timothy  1:4</a>) -- that is the principle governing it, involving faith in us.<a name=433:13></a> Believers are essential to the dispensation -- an important thing to bear in mind, for it is the dispensation of faith.<a name=433:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next thing is works, the accompaniment of faith.<a name=433:15></a> James refers to Abraham, distinguishing him, and says, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works?<a name=433:16></a>" <a href="../bible/James.htm#2:21">James  2:21</a>.<a name=433:17></a> He alludes to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, where it is said that he offered up Isaac, and then says: "Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?<a name=433:18></a>" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#2:22">James  2:22</a>).<a name=433:19></a> So that we are in an imperfect state, a one-sided growth, where faith is assumed to exist, and perhaps does in a measure, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=434>[Page 434]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		without works.<a name=434:1></a> The dispensation is not to be discredited by malformation.<a name=434:2></a> James and Paul taken together present perfection from the standpoint of which I am speaking, faith is perfected by works.<a name=434:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James goes on to say: "And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God" <a href="../bible/James.htm#2:23">James  2:23</a>; he has this very great distinction, which is mentioned three times.<a name=434:4></a> James quotes from the Old Testament when he refers to him as "the Friend of God".<a name=434:5></a> It is mentioned in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#20:7">2 Chronicles  20:7</a> and <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#41:8">Isaiah  41:8</a>.<a name=434:6></a> Being mentioned three times thus, it is significant: there is one man a friend of God.<a name=434:7></a> Is there anyone here who would elect himself out of that category?<a name=434:8></a> Friends of God are greatly needed at the present time.<a name=434:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord regarded His disciples as friends, meaning that there was confidence.<a name=434:10></a> This remarkable appellation of Abraham, that he was the "Friend of God", is especially to be noticed as fitting in with the remarkable testimony to the man: "believing Abraham".<a name=434:11></a> Abraham being our father, and believers being blessed with him, we may well aspire to be with him, the friends of God.<a name=434:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham signalises the truth of it on a most important occasion: he filled out the occasion by this feature.<a name=434:13></a> Jehovah, and the two men who came with Him, moved away; for God as in testimony is always moving on.<a name=434:14></a> God had turned aside to visit Abraham, who was pleasurable to Him, and He waited under the tree for Abraham to prepare Him a meal.<a name=434:15></a> How beautiful that is!<a name=434:16></a> God thus comes down to us and touches our hearts.<a name=434:17></a> As They move on, Abraham would go with Them on Their way.<a name=434:18></a> Then God says in effect, Abraham is showing still that he is My friend, and I am not going to hide from him what I do.<a name=434:19></a> That is, he is moving on with God; the men went on to Sodom, but Abraham still stood before Jehovah, and God opened up His thoughts to him.<a name=434:20></a> The patriarch remained what he

	<div class="paragraph">
		was; it came into evidence on a great occasion that he was God's friend.<a name=435:1></a> We all want to be that, I am sure; it enters into the matter of works, Abraham's works perfecting his faith.<a name=435:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And in this most remarkable chapter (8) of John's gospel we have the subject of Abraham's works introduced.<a name=435:3></a> It is one of the most affecting chapters; satanic power in the reprobate Jews is showing itself throughout, so that the Lord goes so far as to say, "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:44">John  8:44</a>).<a name=435:4></a> We have to do with all this; so the Lord says: "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:39">John  8:39</a>).<a name=435:5></a> You see, dear brethren, how this fits in at the present time; I have been speaking of friendship of God, God's friends, taking sides with Him.<a name=435:6></a> It should appear in our prayers; speaking to Him about the powers that be, how He set them up -- Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Alexander, the Caesars, how they behaved.<a name=435:7></a> Is it nothing to God?<a name=435:8></a> Is their behaviour nothing to God?<a name=435:9></a> It <i>is</i> something to God.<a name=435:10></a>

		As I was remarking as to this chapter, there is in it the terribleness of what the Lord met, Satan himself, not as he tempted Him in the wilderness, but attacking Him through the reprobate Jews; that is, apostate people as all around us now.<a name=436:8></a> The Lord said: "Ye are of your father the devil" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:44">John  8:44</a>).<a name=436:9></a> The Lord did not mince matters in talking to them; "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:39">John  8:39</a>).<a name=436:10></a> That is the point: "the works of Abraham" balanced his faith so that he was "justified by faith" and "justified by works" too.<a name=436:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=455:13></a> Not of necessity, because if we refer to God in His love, we include it; the love of God includes it, although the word love is not attached to the new covenant in the terms of it.<a name=455:14></a> The love of God is surely greater; Romans develops all that for us.<a name=455:15></a> Romans is basic both as regards the first and the second parts of assembly service, because chapter 8 brings us to the Father.<a name=455:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is particularly in mind, is what the last two scriptures speak of -- the bride.<a name=459:1></a> The earlier scripture is to be considered as leading up to this day.<a name=459:2></a> The responsible assembly in the first chapter is in view under the numeral seven; not simply seven different cities in a designated province, for we must bear in mind that the book is symbolic in most of its language.<a name=459:3></a> Although these assemblies existed at the time John wrote, we look at them as representing the whole responsible body from Pentecost until the coming of the Lord Jesus from heaven.<a name=459:4></a> We have been reminded today that the letter kills, but the spirit gives life; so we are to consider this chapter -- and indeed the whole book -- not in the letter, but in the spirit, in its symbolical sense, as treating of responsible believers formed into assemblies.<a name=459:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The saints of God in this book are contemplated as capable of understanding the book and, in order to induce the reading of it, and the understanding of it, a special blessing is offered to those who read and understand.<a name=459:6></a> Understanding is of all importance in approaching the Revelation; it is addressed to professing bodies of christians, viewed not as so many christians, but as formed assembly-wise.<a name=459:7></a> The assembly is that which is possessed of the highest intelligence; hence the regrettableness of so little understanding of this book, for we are furnished with the means of understanding it, and to this end we are enjoined, as having ears, to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.<a name=459:8></a> It is not a question of understanding the gospel, but of what the Spirit says to the assemblies.<a name=459:9></a> The time had come to direct the assemblies as such -- that which was responsible here on earth -- to the mind of God as to what was coming: the things that John saw, the things that are, and the
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		things that should be after these.<a name=460:1></a> So that we are to be intelligent as to the whole history of the assembly, and what is concurrent: the history of the rulers of this world, the great emperors from Nebuchadnezzar until the end; and also the concurrent history socially, commercially and religiously.<a name=460:2></a> So that we should be in no doubt as to anything happening or anything that has happened.<a name=460:3></a> The mind of God for us is that we should be intelligent as to all these matters, even as to the beast -- "He that has understanding let him count the number of the beast", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13:18">Revelation  13:18</a>.<a name=460:4></a> We should not be called upon to count were it not that it is countable; that is to say, that the characters amounting to it are visible and to be understood.<a name=460:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John, as we see in the verses read, addressed himself to the assemblies apart from their failure; and it is a principle with God to view us, in so far as He may, according to conditions, abstractly.<a name=460:6></a> Whilst He would reprove us as to our failures and instruct us, He would have us to understand our abstract relations with Him, through the death and resurrection and ascension of Christ.<a name=460:7></a> The actual condition of the assemblies is depicted in the next chapter, but the Spirit of God has in mind in this first chapter to call us aside in an abstract way.<a name=460:8></a> I mean abstract in the sense of our minds being free from general history to pay attention to what we are as in the mind of God through redemption; and then to go on to what the Spirit has to say to us as to our responsibility.<a name=460:9></a> So we understand that we are in the confidence of God as He establishes a link with us on these lines, then He will speak to us as to failures.<a name=460:10></a> God, being God, cannot deny Himself, but He is entitled to view us abstractly, that is, according to His work in us, and according to His own thoughts in Christ; yet He cannot deny Himself, and will not fail to point out the failures, whatever they may be.<a name=460:11></a> He would have us to be restful in what He says to us in this remarkable address by John, as listening to it:
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:4">Revelation  1:4</a>,5.<a name=461:1></a> The Trinity is included in these verses: God in His infinite greatness, "who is, and who was, and who is to come" -- we are set up in His presence -- and the seven Spirits, alluding to the Holy Spirit symbolically, and then Jesus Christ, according to these well-known titles in verse 5.<a name=461:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the address would set the mind of the saints moving, and draw our hearts into what is to be said, for it goes on, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:5">Revelation  1:5</a>.<a name=461:3></a> How touching that is!<a name=461:4></a> Is there anyone, young or old, who is not affected, as the Spirit of God brings Jesus in thus?<a name=461:5></a> -- "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages.<a name=461:6></a> Amen" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:5">Revelation  1:5</a>,6.<a name=461:7></a> We are <i>made</i> a kingdom, that is how it should read, implying that we may regard ourselves as impregnable whatever men are doing, not only that we are brought into the kingdom, but we are <i>made</i> one; and as made priests, we have access to God in all the strength of what we are as a kingdom.<a name=461:8></a> We are set up according to these facts, and the Holy Spirit proceeds in this book to further fortify us, as He goes on to say, "Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him.<a name=461:9></a> Yea.<a name=461:10></a> Amen.<a name=461:11></a> I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:7">Revelation  1:7</a>,8.<a name=461:12></a> It is not only that John says something as representative of God, but God Himself speaks directly to our souls, setting us up before Him as the One <i>who is</i>.<a name=461:13></a> John then proceeds to speak of what he saw on the Lord's day.<a name=461:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is to keep our minds on assembly lines; we are addressed as the seven assemblies which are in Asia,

		<a name=462>[Page 462]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and our minds are to be kept on assembly lines, for this whole book is for us, directly given to us; and John gives us an example of a suitable state of this, in order to reach the end in mind, namely, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:10">Revelation  1:10</a>.<a name=462:1></a> John is a brother, as he says, "your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>.<a name=462:2></a> Another thought, already referred to today, that belongs to us is tribulation; the great servant Paul spoke of it and wanted the saints to know of his excessive tribulation.<a name=462:3></a> It is the order of the day, for what is in mind is the Lamb's wife, and the Lamb's wife is a sufferer, if she corresponds with the Lamb.<a name=462:4></a> John gives us a lead in this, not restricting the suffering to himself only, but bringing the saints into it, even as Paul did, "your .<a name=462:5></a>.<a name=462:6></a>.<a name=462:7></a> fellow-partaker in the tribulation" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>.<a name=462:8></a> This is the ministerial position, and ministers are to be examples, so that John would draw us along with him in connection with what he has to say in this book.<a name=462:9></a> He is in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus -- two distinct things, the word of God disclosing His mind in this dark world, and the testimony of Jesus, what He died for, what He lives for, what He is on the right hand of God for, and the power of the Spirit down here to testify: that is our position.<a name=462:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having all this clearly in mind, we can follow the great thought in the passages read at the end, namely, the bride.<a name=462:11></a> The thought runs through Scripture, from the second of Genesis onwards and finds its completest concrete expression in this book as a city.<a name=462:12></a> This should never be out of our minds, and as it is in our minds we shall understand the epistles: they develop us in relation to light and rule and order and government; and as we keep in our minds clearly that what is dearest to the heart of Christ, and what is before God, is a city, and this city is the bride, we shall pay more attention to the development of the instruction and the discipline which makes it effective in us as to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		light, government, and testimony generally in this world.<a name=463:1></a> God's testimony implies all these things, and so, in introducing the thought in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, the Spirit says that God builded a woman; that is, she is to reflect man, but man was not said to be builded, for Adam was a figure of Christ, of Him that was to come.<a name=463:2></a> Ishshah, that is Eve, was to reflect him in government.<a name=463:3></a> Rebecca, the second great type of the bride, carries the thought of a woman occupying the place of another -- Sarah.<a name=463:4></a> All these thoughts were vested in Israel, but when we come to more detail it is <i>Jerusalem</i>.<a name=463:5></a> The book of Ezekiel shows how God entered into marital relations with Jerusalem; it was the assembly typically.<a name=463:6></a> Paul's assembly is the idea and Rebecca represents that, but she represents it in the place of another, and what developed in the history of the testimony is that Rebecca, the assembly viewed under Paul's ministry, eclipsed Sarah.<a name=463:7></a> It is the idea right through of what fully answers to God in Christ; that is, all His features in the universe are to be seen in this great vessel.<a name=463:8></a> So we find in the Pentecostal assembly, as seen in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, set in the most intrinsic preciousness, and answering to all measurement according to God.<a name=463:9></a> These names are set in every precious stone.<a name=463:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention all that, so that we may have clearly in mind what is involved in the bride, not only to know in thought, but to understand the idea and how it is to be reflected in the universe in light and order and government.<a name=463:11></a> In dwelling on this, I would make prominent Paul's ministry, which brings out the full thought, for he is said not only to be a new covenant minister, but also minister of the assembly; he received three ministries, including that of reconciliation, and each is distinctive.<a name=463:12></a> In order to understand what I am speaking about we have to understand these ministries of the apostle Paul, which he received directly from the Lord to carry out and to fulfil here in the saints.<a name=463:13></a> He says of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=503:1></a> What is in mind is to look into the subject of the glory of the Lord.<a name=503:2></a> 1 and 2 Corinthians speak of it; they speak much of the glory of God too, but the first epistle speaks about the Lord as the Lord of glory, meaning that He has in His hand the administration of glory.<a name=503:3></a> The second epistle speaks of His own glory as Lord, and in connection with the new covenant.<a name=503:4></a> The epistle also speaks about the giving of the saints as connected with this glory, "the glory of the Lord himself".<a name=503:5></a> Those who carried the money of the saints to dispense it were said to be "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:23">2 Corinthians  8:23</a>.<a name=503:6></a>

		So it is thought the Lord would help us in confining ourselves as much as possible to this point of the glory of the Lord, and incidentally to see that His supper enters into it; the new covenant, of course, entering into the Lord's supper also as given to us in the first epistle.<a name=503:7></a> That is connected with His glory.<a name=503:8></a> Then the passage in Peter gives us His glory as <i>Son of God</i>, which is a somewhat advanced thought on the glory of the Lord.<a name=503:9></a> The instruction we have as to the Lord's supper in 1 Corinthians connects it entirely with the Lord Himself; and Canticles in the Old Testament helps to fill out the service in connection with the Lord's supper, for it is a question there of reciprocated affection typically between Christ and the saints.<a name=503:10></a> There is hardly a reference to God or Jehovah in the book.<a name=503:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=504:3></a> Would the sight of the glory of the Lord lead on normally to the second part, the heavenly side, and would the thought in the mountain suggest the glory of sonship?<a name=504:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=504:5></a> That is what I thought.<a name=504:6></a> Peter mentions the voice from heaven as the glory, he has this in mind besides that which appeared in the Lord on the mountain.<a name=504:7></a> The Lord was transfigured personally before them; this in itself was glory.<a name=504:8></a> It was not conferred; it was of Himself.<a name=504:9></a> We are changed as beholding His glory, but the glory on the mount of transfiguration is of Himself, and then there is the glory that is seen in Moses and Elias; they appeared "in glory" too.<a name=504:10></a> So the scene is glorious before the voice from heaven comes, but it is the voice from heaven that Peter alludes to especially, the heavenly side of the position; the acknowledgment of His sonship from heaven.<a name=504:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=504:16></a> It is a question of what "the Lord the Spirit" is doing for us.<a name=504:17></a> It is the glory of the Lord we are looking at, which includes His effectuation of the covenant, not only making it a fact, but applying it; making it effective.<a name=504:18></a> Of course He made it a fact by dying, but the Lord of glory alludes more to the effectuation of it in us.<a name=504:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=505:11></a> Yes.<a name=505:12></a> Appearing in glory implies this.<a name=505:13></a> They were men like ourselves; but they were men of great experience with God, who had to do with Jehovah in the Old Testament in a striking way; men who took on glory and became formed in it.<a name=505:14></a> It was said of Moses, "the form of Jehovah doth he behold" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:8">Numbers  12:8</a>.<a name=505:15></a> They "appeared in glory".<a name=505:16></a> Peter leaves that part out, but Luke mentions it.<a name=505:17></a> Peter confines himself to the glory of sonship; "he received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom <i>I</i> have found my delight; and this voice <i>we</i> heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain" <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:17">2 Peter  1:17</a>,18.<a name=505:18></a> So Peter has sonship in mind, acknowledged in this remarkable way.<a name=505:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=536:3></a> That is brought in in a parenthetical way.<a name=536:4></a> That chapter treats of the blood of Jesus in a wider sense than the new covenant.<a name=536:5></a> The theme of the chapter is largely the blood of Christ, and the new covenant part is brought in there.<a name=536:6></a> The idea of a testator, that is, a man making a will, is brought in only to stress the idea of death, which is the leading thought of the chapter.<a name=536:7></a> So, if we apply it to ourselves, we are not the subjects of the will at all literally, but in spirit we come into it; nor is the idea of the administration of the will involved in the parenthesis (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:16">Hebrews  9:16</a>, 17).<a name=536:8></a> There will be nothing lost if we bear that in mind when, in the service, we come to God to speak to Him about His love in Christ.<a name=536:9></a> The love of God shed abroad in our hearts is more than the covenant; it is the love of God without any modification.<a name=536:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=537:23></a> In Luke, the memorial is connected with the bread only, and the breaking of the bread undoubtedly affects our minds, so that the Lord may come in; the cup is the completion, or fulness of the thought of memorial.<a name=537:24></a> According to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:35">Luke  24:35</a>, the Lord was made known at Emmaus in the breaking of bread, but the cup is an integral part of the Lord's supper, and the Lord adds, "as often as ye shall drink it".<a name=537:25></a> While attention is focused on the memorial rather than on the drinking, yet the drinking enables us to remember the Lord with greater ease, and enjoyment, and feeling, because drinking is a suggestion of satisfaction.<a name=537:26></a>
