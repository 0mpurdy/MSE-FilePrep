		In reading these scriptures I am thinking of a passage in the New Testament which enjoins us to "go on unto perfection".<a name=1:1></a> The passage is preceded by a reference to the "senses"; these being exercised mark manhood, or "full age", so that there is discernment of good and evil.<a name=1:2></a> Thus the groundwork is stated there for definite progress so that we may go on.<a name=1:3></a> That is what I had in view, that there should be, as the outcome of our meetings, a moving on.<a name=1:4></a> As the passage reads, "Let us go on to what belongs to full growth", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:1">Hebrews  6:1</a>.<a name=1:5></a>

		I have selected Numbers to develop this subject as being the account of the experience of Israel in the wilderness.<a name=1:6></a> The wilderness being viewed as a scene contrary to us, brings out the worst features unless we are on our guard in self-judgment, and if we are on our guard, kept by the power of God through faith, the wilderness brings out our best features.<a name=1:7></a> As Scripture says: "To humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or not;" <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:2">Deuteronomy  8:2</a>.<a name=1:8></a> God selects the testing circumstances Himself, but notifies us that He knows perfectly what they are.<a name=1:9></a> He has selected the circumstances because they are difficult.<a name=1:10></a> The book opens, "And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness".<a name=1:11></a> He spake out of the tabernacle, but <i>in the wilderness</i>; meaning that He is taking account of us in those circumstances; that He has not placed us in them without the means of going through them; that indeed He has come into them Himself.<a name=1:12></a> He "walked in a tent" with them; <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:6">2 Samuel  7:6</a>.<a name=1:13></a> That is the book of Numbers.<a name=1:14></a> Every young brother should read the book of Numbers especially noting the opening

		remarks of Jehovah.<a name=2:1></a> In the first ten wonderful chapters we have the unfolding of the provision for the wilderness according to the statement that had become proverbial in Israel, "On the mount of Jehovah will be provided".<a name=2:2></a> As we are in the wilderness we find this mount there.<a name=2:3></a> If you read <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>, you will find that He shines forth on His people out of the setting of mountains; Sinai, Seir, and Paran.<a name=2:4></a> In view of the adverse nature of the wilderness God connects with it these symbols of spiritual strength, and He shines forth upon His people according to this provision.<a name=2:5></a> In keeping with all this Aaron was to bless the children of Israel saying unto them, "The Lord bless thee and keep thee; the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#6">Numbers  6</a>.<a name=2:6></a> So you can see how God has at the very opening of these adverse circumstances made abundant provision for us as in them.<a name=2:7></a>

		In those chapters it is a question of what God is to us in Christ as set up in testimony in this world.<a name=2:8></a> But we have to face in chapters 11 to 15, the sad disclosure of the flesh in the people.<a name=2:9></a> As I said, the circumstances bring out the worst features unless the heart is kept with all diligence, and we have noted, thirteen vicious things in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#7">Mark  7</a>, that proceed out of the heart of man.<a name=2:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>, immediately they began to move, the ark of the Lord went before to seek out a resting place for them, a touching thought.<a name=2:11></a> Christ in His humiliation taking the pioneer position, meeting every possible condition to seek out a resting place for them.<a name=2:12></a> And when the ark set forward Moses said, "Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.<a name=2:13></a> And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel".<a name=2:14></a> How interesting to see the scattering of the enemy and the return of

		In chapter 11 you find the murmuring of the people in spite of all that.<a name=3:3></a> We may think little of murmuring; it is the first evil feature here.<a name=3:4></a> The flesh is beginning to show itself and I speak of it so that we might learn to judge the spirit of murmuring.<a name=3:5></a> It may be assumed that this refers to an unregenerate people who wanted to go back to Egypt, but the solemn thing is that the next one to fail is <i>Moses</i>; so that it is not simply the rank and file who give way, but the most distinguished.<a name=3:6></a> We do not indeed find evidence of gross features of the flesh in Moses, he was a man who knew how to keep himself, a model man in the main indeed, but the wilderness brought out something that was distasteful.<a name=3:7></a> What a voice to some of us who are more prominent!<a name=3:8></a> The wilderness will bring out something of the flesh unless there is vigilance to keep our hearts with all diligence.<a name=3:9></a> Moses complains to the Lord as if the Lord had put too much upon him.<a name=3:10></a> After all that provision displayed in the mount, he complains of God putting too much on him.<a name=3:11></a> Does any one of us complain of our labour, assuming that God has not measured what He put upon us?<a name=3:12></a> He is "the God of measure" and so does not lay on us what we cannot bear.<a name=3:13></a> Moses says, "Wherefore hast thou afflicted me .<a name=3:14></a>.<a name=3:15></a>.<a name=3:16></a> that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom".<a name=3:17></a> God never said that.<a name=3:18></a> How unreasonable the flesh becomes as allowed to show itself!<a name=3:19></a> Then he says, "Whence should I have flesh to give all this people?<a name=3:20></a>" and as Jehovah proposes to give them flesh in abundance, he replies, "The people among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen .<a name=3:21></a>.<a name=3:22></a>.<a name=3:23></a> shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them .<a name=3:24></a>.<a name=3:25></a>.<a name=3:26></a> or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,

		Next you have Aaron and Miriam, great servants; they too failed, failed worse than Moses.<a name=4:7></a> Miriam and Aaron envied Moses.<a name=4:8></a> Who can stand before envy?<a name=4:9></a> And the most distinguished servants are capable of it.<a name=4:10></a> Unless we maintain self-judgment the flesh in us is sure to show itself if another servant excels us.<a name=4:11></a> Are these not searching things?<a name=4:12></a> The most distinguished are thus exposed in wilderness circumstances.<a name=4:13></a> Look at the man they are envying!<a name=4:14></a> He is a very different man in chapter 12 from what he was in chapter 11.<a name=4:15></a> "The man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth".<a name=4:16></a> That he should be envied, made the matter more serious.<a name=4:17></a>

		Another feature appears in the spies; twelve men were selected, one from each tribe to go up into Canaan and search it out; a very honoured mission.<a name=4:18></a> What will they do?<a name=4:19></a> Surely as going into Canaan all the flesh will be withered up by the beauty, bounty and attractiveness of that land.<a name=4:20></a> Returning, they all bear testimony to the fruitfulness and general goodness of the land; later ten of them belied the fact.<a name=4:21></a> Caleb and Joshua alone stood true.<a name=4:22></a> Against the testimony of these ten liars the two faithful witnesses stood.<a name=4:23></a> You see in this another feature of the flesh brought out by the wilderness as a result.<a name=4:24></a> God decrees that not one of these six hundred thousand footmen, save Caleb and Joshua, should enter the land of promise.<a name=4:25></a> Another generation should go in.<a name=4:26></a>

		by the Lord's help I will now show the latter to you.<a name=5:1></a> Chapter 15 is this though not much understood.<a name=5:2></a> It begins thus, "When ye be come into the land".<a name=5:3></a> It is not "if".<a name=5:4></a> You might expect that from the previous chapters, but there is no "if" in the counsels of God.<a name=5:5></a> They must go through.<a name=5:6></a> So that in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>you get "the good pleasure of his will", you get "the mystery of his will", and "the counsel of his will".<a name=5:7></a> You see the will of God enters into all these things, and the love and power of God are behind that.<a name=5:8></a> Thus we have here, "When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you".<a name=5:9></a> First, there is the certainty of the people going in.<a name=5:10></a> Who the individuals are is not the point.<a name=5:11></a> Those in the counsels of God are going in, and as there they will serve or worship Him.<a name=5:12></a> Everything is in your favour now, as in a land flowing with milk and honey, watered by the rain of heaven, possessing waterbrooks, etc.<a name=5:13></a> The God of it is in your heart and you will bring Him an offering, but in this you are to show that you are regular in your growth.<a name=5:14></a> One's offering represents his thought of God.<a name=5:15></a> God loves that thought, however small.<a name=5:16></a> I would say to young people, the smallest thought of God is delightful to Him, you come before Him with it in perfect liberty.<a name=5:17></a> But your meat offering, oil and drink offering must correspond; you thus do not appear to be a "young man" or a "father" when you are only a little one; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2">1 John  2</a>.<a name=5:18></a> Some young brothers, having keen minds, take in all they hear, and speak like an old brother; but the meat and drink offerings are lacking.<a name=5:19></a> The kind of man you are, in everyday life is implied in these; and you cannot leave that out when appearing before God.<a name=5:20></a> If these things, the meat offering, oil and wine, do not accompany, in the prescribed proportions the creature presented, it will be manifest that the offerer has not developed regularly; his intelligence is out of proportion with

		There is an ascending scale in the passage.<a name=6:9></a> Thus in verse 6 a ram is mentioned.<a name=6:10></a> That would mean a person fully matured and possessing energy.<a name=6:11></a> The ram is a fully developed creature.<a name=6:12></a> If there be energy of mind, of soul, of voice, there must be the incense in keeping with the perfect humanity of Christ.<a name=6:13></a> You have one-third with the ram instead of one-fourth as with the offering mentioned previously.<a name=6:14></a> Then you come to the bullock, which suggests a very large conception of Christ.<a name=6:15></a> It is what the apostle had in mind in his prayer of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, that ye may "know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge".<a name=6:16></a> We are to go on to this.<a name=6:17></a> But the meat and drink offerings must be in accordance.<a name=6:18></a> These things are practical if we are to have a right conception.<a name=6:19></a> We must not be out of proportion; we must grow uniformly.<a name=6:20></a> God looks for <i>perfection</i>.<a name=6:21></a> Then there is the heave offering in verse 19, "Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough".<a name=6:22></a> In a cake you come to a <i>whole</i> thought.<a name=6:23></a> The whole thought of God is presented in Christ, who is the Word; what is in His mind.<a name=6:24></a> Now God looks for a corresponding effect in us, what

		This is a most instructive and important matter.<a name=9:1></a> Paul may be taken as an example.<a name=9:2></a> He speaks in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>about things treasured in his heart.<a name=9:3></a> He had been up to heaven fourteen years before.<a name=9:4></a> He was there as "a man in Christ".<a name=9:5></a> Wonderful thought!<a name=9:6></a> It refers to what we shall be eternally.<a name=9:7></a> "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows); such a one caught up to the third heaven .<a name=9:8></a>.<a name=9:9></a>.<a name=9:10></a> and heard unspeakable things said".<a name=9:11></a> We may know a good deal, but there is much that we do not know; it is, however, a comfort that God knows, and believers are to be "filled to all the fulness of God".<a name=9:12></a> Thus we see in Paul, abstracted as a man in Christ, the idea of the basket handed over and before God, containing the first fruits of the land.<a name=9:13></a> Christ takes all the baskets, as it were, into His own hands and sets them before God.<a name=9:14></a> On the other hand, the offerer, viewed as a responsible man, makes a becoming confession.<a name=9:15></a> He owns his past history, and God's wonderful deliverance of himself and His people.<a name=9:16></a> "A Syrian ready to perish was my father .<a name=9:17></a>.<a name=9:18></a>.<a name=9:19></a> and he went down into Egypt .<a name=9:20></a>.<a name=9:21></a>.<a name=9:22></a> and when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers .<a name=9:23></a>.<a name=9:24></a>.<a name=9:25></a> the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt .<a name=9:26></a>.<a name=9:27></a>.<a name=9:28></a> and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey".<a name=9:29></a> We say, "God, who is rich in mercy for his great love .<a name=9:30></a>.<a name=9:31></a>.<a name=9:32></a> hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=9:33></a> There is the acknowledgment of what we were, and of what God in His great love has done for us.<a name=9:34></a> He has taken us out of one status and condition and set us down in another.<a name=9:35></a> He has set us in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=9:36></a> The Israelite brought his first fruits and set them down before Jehovah and worshipped Him, rejoicing in every good thing which God gave him.<a name=9:37></a>

		These passages serve to show the difference between Matthew and Luke.<a name=11:1></a> Matthew, having the assembly in view, makes the formal separation from Judaism -- the withdrawal from the religious system of the earth -- a prominent feature; and hence you get the mount of Olives, that being a link outside the established order, a link with heaven.<a name=11:2></a> Luke, on the other hand, having the reign of grace in view, leaves the disciples in Jerusalem.<a name=11:3></a> Truly he "led them out as far as to Bethany", but representing the remnant, they returned to Jerusalem, and there they were to remain till they were clothed with power from on high.<a name=11:4></a> In order to understand the governmental setting aside of the religious system on earth, we have to understand Matthew.<a name=11:5></a> In chapter 24 we read, "Jesus went forth and went away from the temple" -- there is a definite break.<a name=11:6></a> Earlier in the gospel (chapter 16) He left <i>them</i>, but in chapter 24 it is the system itself; He withdraws from it and seats Himself on the mount of Olives.<a name=11:7></a> As going away from it the disciples call his attention to the buildings, showing what a hold these things have upon our minds.<a name=11:8></a> But the Lord says, "Not a stone shall be left here upon a stone which shall not be thrown down".<a name=11:9></a> It is after this that He takes His place on the mount of Olives and they have their private questionings with Him.<a name=11:10></a>

		Here in Matthew there is a formal withdrawal from both the orthodox and the modernists of that day; the orthodox and the sceptics are both withdrawn from, and the whole system is left, and He takes up a position on the mount of Olives.<a name=12:4></a> In chapter 26, after partaking of the supper, it says, "They went out to the mount of Olives" -- showing the intelligence which governed them; in the power of the Spirit the final withdrawal took effect.<a name=12:5></a> Every stone thrown down shows the government of God; Hebrews synchronises with this, and the Christians are exhorted to go forth to Him without the camp.<a name=12:6></a> There is a definite break with the Jewish system.<a name=12:7></a>

		In Matthew you get the mount of legislation (chapters 5 - 7); the mount of transfiguration; the mount of intercession, and the mount of Olives.<a name=12:8></a> These have each to be understood if the believer is to be delivered from the places of strength in this world.<a name=12:9></a> You have to have faith as a grain of mustard seed before you can say to the mountain "Be thou removed hence".<a name=12:10></a> We have to beware of our unbelief.<a name=12:11></a> In Luke it is the city all through.<a name=12:12></a> When it is a question of the end of the dispensation, God does not leave it to us; He marks it out; so here the <i>Lord</i> leads them out as far as to Bethany.<a name=12:13></a> There are other steps which are left to our own intelligence and power.<a name=12:14></a> But the Lord is available for all our questionings; private communications mark the present time.<a name=12:15></a> We have access to the Lord in a private way.<a name=12:16></a> His relations with Israel will be public.<a name=12:17></a> The official system of religion in this world is on the principle of publicity, whereas our privilege is inside; it is private.<a name=12:18></a> In Solomon's temple there were inner

		In the, second letter to Timothy the apostle states that every scripture is divinely inspired and is profitable for doctrine, "that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works".<a name=19:1></a> It is therefore appropriate to use the passage from the Old, Testament as serving to help in the teaching of Matthew and 2 Timothy.<a name=19:2></a> Matthew may be regarded as the ecclesiastical evangelist; his gospel supports the economy set up by the twelve, the assembly economy, as we may call it, and so he makes much of the assembly in its outward bearing.<a name=19:3></a> Chapter 16 is that which Christ builds, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail, and in chapter 18 it is to be appealed to; it is brought in there as that to which one may have recourse in his dealings with his brother, that which God recognises, so that what is bound on earth is bound in heaven.<a name=19:4></a> It runs along with 1 Corinthians, in which epistle the saints are locally addressed as the assembly of God, so that the economy took the form of local administration.<a name=19:5></a> The assembly is never regarded as having a universal administration: administration takes form <i>locally</i>.<a name=19:6></a> So we have in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:16">1 Corinthians  11:16</a> assemblies; it is plural.<a name=19:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is mentioned to show the position of the assembly in the beginning.<a name=19:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#15">Numbers  15</a>, which corresponds with 1 Corinthians in that sense, we have a case of discipline: the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath.<a name=19:9></a> They wait on the Lord for guidance as to what to do with him.<a name=19:10></a> The direction is that all the congregation should stone him with stones outside the camp.<a name=19:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16">Numbers  16</a>we have, not an individual

		Two or three "gathered together" would not form a separate company, but would consider themselves as part of the whole.<a name=21:9></a> The point there is that the assembly holds a certain responsibility.<a name=21:10></a> The Lord treats of the kingdom; He brings in the assembly as a court of appeal.<a name=21:11></a> That involves heavy obligations; so the Lord immediately adds, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.<a name=21:12></a> You can reckon on heaven's ratification of what you do.<a name=21:13></a> Then He pursues, "If two of you shall agree", etc.<a name=21:14></a> We rightly connect it with matters of discipline requiring special support.<a name=21:15></a> When you have to meet evil, then you need His support specially.<a name=21:16></a> It is another thing to claim the power in an external way; that is where the mischief lies.<a name=21:17></a> Inwardly you know the Lord is with you; there is no change; but outwardly it is very different.<a name=21:18></a> The assembly is broken up, and the only thing is to admit the ruin, as

		I, desire to say a word about the assembly as it appears publicly.<a name=27:1></a> The expression "the invisible church" has become current; it may be taken in various ways; but I had in mind to speak about the visible assembly, that which was once visible, and how it is organised in order that its visibility should be apparent here.<a name=27:2></a> I hope with the Lord's help that I may be able to show something of this feature of the assembly, because, as with other features of the truth, so with the assembly, we have to go back to the beginning in order to see it.<a name=27:3></a> We are entitled to look on to the end; indeed, nothing but encouragement can fill our hearts as we do so, because the assembly is seen prophetically in the book of Revelation coming down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God, untrammelled by any human features; not indeed an invisible assembly but a visible one, and one that the Lord can not only identify Himself with in the way of administration, but in the marital relation, so that she is in every way suited to Him; as it says in Ephesians, "not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing".<a name=27:4></a> It is a most glorious prospect that we cannot dwell upon too much; indeed, it is intimated in the expression, "the latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former".<a name=27:5></a> The former glory was that which was seen in its administration in an adverse scene; but when she comes out of heaven, she comes into a scene which is not adverse, but which is wholly congenial, whereas the former position of the assembly involves adverse circumstances.<a name=27:6></a> She was to maintain that which was due to the Lord here in this world; according to Proverbs, she was to he the virtuous woman.<a name=27:7></a> The word 'virtue' would have no force

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I apprehend it was under Paul's ministry that the assembly came out in the way I have been referring to here.<a name=28:5></a> She was composed, as an antitype of the tabernacle, of material that was like Christ; and in reading the passage from Canticles I wanted to bring in how at the outset the Lord asserted His claim over that material.<a name=28:6></a> If He asserted it then, He asserts it today.<a name=28:7></a> The boards of the tabernacle were to stand up in sockets of silver, denoting the redemption work of Christ, and involving therefore His redemption rights, for His redemption work involves His redemption rights.<a name=28:8></a> So that in <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#8:11">Song of Songs  8:11</a> there is undoubtedly a typical allusion to Christ's rights over those who form the assembly.<a name=28:9></a> "Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon", which signifies that he is "master of a multitude".<a name=28:10></a> He is a master of every one of the redeemed; in fact, He has redemption right over every one, over the whole creation.<a name=28:11></a> Paul says, "For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living".<a name=28:12></a> He has redemption rights over all, so that it is a question with us whether we have admitted those rights.<a name=28:13></a> He is "master of a multitude".<a name=28:14></a> Now in being master of a multitude, He has in mind being master of assemblies.<a name=28:15></a> The expression occurs in <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#12:12">Ecclesiastes  12:12</a>; it is an expression that applies to Christ.<a name=28:16></a> He is a master of assemblies as well as being master of a multitude.<a name=28:17></a> I need not say that the former is more what is suited to His heart than the latter.<a name=28:18></a> The thought of a multitude is not

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in speaking of Ecclesiastes I wanted to enlarge on the word 'Preacher'.<a name=29:3></a> The word has good authority for it, signifying not only one who preaches, but one who forms assemblies; he not only announces the gospel of the mind of God, but has in view the formation of companies or assemblies.<a name=29:4></a> Now I am sure you will not fail to be interested in seeing this as applying to the Lord.<a name=29:5></a> It is well to have Him before us in the varied ways in which He carries on the work of the word of God at the present time.<a name=29:6></a> Presently He will take up administration of another kind, and rule the nations.<a name=29:7></a> There can be no doubt that "master of a multitude" refers to His mastery of the nations.<a name=29:8></a> He is not only King of the Jews, but King of kings and Lord of lords.<a name=29:9></a> He has supreme rights everywhere; He will take them up and carry them out, so that the house of Jacob is brought in and set up.<a name=29:10></a> God never gives up any thought that He has given expression to.<a name=29:11></a> He had a garden at the beginning, and He will have a garden at the end on this earth; Christ will present that garden in suitability to God.<a name=29:12></a> There shall be no enemy in it; those who exalt themselves, who walk in the garden of God in the pride of their heart, all such will be removed from it, and the will of God will prevail.<a name=29:13></a> It is a most encouraging thought in regard to this earth.<a name=29:14></a> The law will be in men's hearts and in men's minds.<a name=29:15></a> What a wonderful thing it will be when men's thoughts and affections are regulated by the law of God.<a name=29:16></a> Christ can do all that; He can bring it about The knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.<a name=29:17></a> How perfect is the result of Christ's work.<a name=29:18></a>

		In reading these passages, my hope is by the Lord's help to speak first of what may be termed the external position of the assembly here -- that is, our public position, and then of our hidden, or secret position in relation to Christ, which is in mystery.<a name=36:1></a> The former is set out in the gospel of Matthew, the latter is developed in the epistle to the Ephesians, supported by the ministry of John.<a name=36:2></a> The gospel of Matthew treats of the assembly in its public function, and in that function it stands related to the heavens, as the centre of rule and light on earth, so that, to refer to the principles governing navigation as a figure, the spiritual mariner, according to Matthew, takes his bearings from the heavens, and this agrees in large measure with Paul's first letter to the Corinthians.<a name=36:3></a> In that letter he gives directions, including what may be termed in ordinary ecclesiastical language, the ritual of the assembly; for we must not overlook that there were divine instructions given for the maintenance of assembly order.<a name=36:4></a>

		In the apostle's own personal history we have indicated that a time should arrive in which the heavens should be black as regards the public profession, and accordingly the need for what, in nautical terms, is called <i>dead reckoning</i>, and John, as I understand, supplies guidance for that; that is to say, the saint has not only to look up, but under certain circumstances he is to make soundings in order to determine his spiritual whereabouts.<a name=36:5></a> For instance, according to John, if we wish to be sure that we have passed out of death into life, the proof is that we love the brethren.<a name=36:6></a> I refer to that as a "sounding".<a name=36:7></a> One has to look in, so to say, to determine whether there is in one's heart love for the brethren.<a name=36:8></a> That love

		Matthew treats of the "kingdom of the heavens", and so the position of the assembly is in that relation.<a name=37:5></a> It is here in relation to the rule of heaven.<a name=37:6></a> It therefore is a testimony against what may be called "democratic principles"; not that I wish to speak of that, I only refer to it by the way.<a name=37:7></a> The assembly is a witness to the great principle set forth in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, that God has set in the heavens two great lights, the assembly, typified by the moon, being one of these.<a name=37:8></a> One light was to rule the day, and the other to rule the night; but they are both <i>in the heavens</i>.<a name=37:9></a> So while the assembly is literally on earth, she is morally in heaven, and that is Ephesians.<a name=37:10></a> She is heavenly, but here, during the night, let us not forget that it is night, dear brethren; the assembly sheds light on this poor benighted earth, and in that way is a witness to divine thoughts in regard of government.<a name=37:11></a> In Matthew the Lord is seen on the mount, transfigured, with His countenance shining <i>as the sun</i>; that is the point of view there; His face shone as the sun, the great symbol to the creation of light, government, and regulation.<a name=37:12></a> That is what Christ is, and all that was perfectly set out in His ministry according to Matthew is left here in the assembly.<a name=37:13></a> It is left here in a delegated way, so that there should be light on earth during His absence; a very great conception, and that is the position in Matthew.<a name=37:14></a>

		At the same time there was that which was external, which needed to be cared for, to be supported, as bearing the burden and heat of the day, the heavy burden of responsibility to maintain for God here.<a name=38:12></a> The Lord has the utmost consideration for His people, and so I ventured to read this verse, because it brings before us what He says, "I have compassion on the multitude".<a name=38:13></a> I know the multitude was not the assembly; it is distinct even from the disciples, but

		The Lord through the apostle, in writing to Corinth, says, "To the assembly of God which is in Corinth .<a name=39:4></a>.<a name=39:5></a>.<a name=39:6></a> with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours".<a name=39:7></a> The apostle had gone to Corinth, he had laboured there for eighteen months.<a name=39:8></a> In his service in that city he became not only an evangelist, but we may call him, in the language of the book of Ecclesiastes, "a former of assemblies".<a name=39:9></a> He was the former of that assembly.<a name=39:10></a> The word 'Preacher' in the book of Ecclesiastes, we are told on good authority, signifies not only one who announces a message, as a herald, but one who by his service calls together an assembly and not only so, but forms an assembly.<a name=39:11></a> Paul in his service at Corinth, not only brought a congregation together, but formed an assembly.<a name=39:12></a> We have to distinguish between a congregation and an assembly.<a name=39:13></a> An assembly involves order, which implies that those together are in a certain mutual relation with one another.<a name=39:14></a> Thus in writing to the Corinthians afterwards, the apostle says, "I speak as to intelligent persons" -- and as such they were to consider what he said.<a name=39:15></a> They had a very important place as brought together in that way, and so he gave them directions, and they wore responsible to keep those directions.<a name=39:16></a>

		And so the Lord sets before us the example in His own blessed life, as to how one is to be in one's own locality or place according to God.<a name=40:11></a> It says of him in the prophet Zechariah, "He"; that is, the Branch, "shall grow up out of his place".<a name=40:12></a> But mark you, in that position He is a branch; it sets forth the Lord taking up His place in perfect obedience to His Father's will, and remaining in it in perfect dependence on His Father.<a name=40:13></a> He was cast upon Him from His infancy, in blessed, holy dependence, and, he grew "up <i>before him</i> as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground".<a name=40:14></a> But He grew up in Nazareth, where, as the scripture says, "he had been brought up".<a name=40:15></a> He went down from Jerusalem, after showing

		in the temple that He was about His Father's business, to Nazareth with His parents and was "subject unto them".<a name=41:1></a> How perfectly did Christ set forth and exemplify every divine thought!<a name=41:2></a> What delight there was for God, what food for the blessed God, in that holy One growing up in this way, in outward littleness, a carpenter's son, yea, Himself a carpenter, for He is so spoken of, but every moment of His life growing up before the Father in His own place, in the place assigned to Him by the Father.<a name=41:3></a> He was there in entire submission to the Father's will, and so He is the One who "builds the temple of the Lord".<a name=41:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, as I have already remarked, suppose one is in an outpost (I am not speaking of the present time; it is for us to gather up light now from what appeared at the beginning and act on it in our several circumstances), for there are divine outposts, and it may please God to set one in such a position, deprived in great measure of practical sympathy and fellowship, yet he can call on the Lord in that position, in that "place", whatever its name may be, he is calling on the Lord there.<a name=41:5></a> Mark you, it is not simply to all that call on the name of the Lord promiscuously, but "to all that <i>in every place</i> call on the name of the Lord".<a name=41:6></a> The directions are for you, the precious volume, the precious letter of the apostle is for you.<a name=41:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next question is, How long have you continued in it?<a name=41:8></a> The Lord says here, "Because they continue with me now three days".<a name=41:9></a> The Lord knows how long you have borne the burden there.<a name=41:10></a> He may move you; in other words, He may give you levitical work, and then you will be entitled to move yourself under His direction, and in this again He sets before us the model.<a name=41:11></a> When at Capernaum, they would have detained Him, but He says, "I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also, for therefore am I sent".<a name=41:12></a> He is now in the exercise of His levitical service, and that is general; so it is

		I am persuaded that in any locality where a brother stands for God in the maintenance of the principles that govern the assembly, he will acquire greater influence than he could possibly acquire on natural lines, for God is with him.<a name=42:3></a> Think of being supported, with, it may be, only one or two others, in that position by all the power of heaven, as one may say, for the Lord said, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven".<a name=42:4></a> You will understand, I am speaking of what was at the beginning, for I am supposing an isolated one in Paul's day; for such, all that is done is supported, is ratified in heaven.<a name=42:5></a> That is not said of any action of any government on earth; although God supports such powers in measure by angelic means, yet He does not commit Himself to any government on earth, but He did commit Himself to the assembly.<a name=42:6></a> What a wonderful position for each company of God's people, or it may be even but a few individuals who maintain divine principles here on earth during the absence of Christ.<a name=42:7></a> So in that position the Lord had the greatest consideration for them.<a name=42:8></a> He says, "I have compassion .<a name=42:9></a>.<a name=42:10></a>.<a name=42:11></a> because they continue with me now three days".<a name=42:12></a> The Lord considers for you in that position.<a name=42:13></a>

		In Hosea we read, "After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight".<a name=43:11></a> That is one thing, but this passage says not only that we shall live in His sight, but that we shall live together with Him.<a name=43:12></a> If we love the brethren now, we are going to live with them; as I said, we know that we have passed from death into life because we love them.<a name=43:13></a> Our life spiritually is a life of love.<a name=43:14></a> Our spiritual life is a life of love.<a name=43:15></a> As we enjoy the love of Christ we also enjoy and reciprocate the love of the brethren; that remains.<a name=43:16></a> Hence John's writings, as I said, may be taken as "dead reckonings", but sure reckonings by which we are made certain in a spiritual way of our whereabouts.<a name=43:17></a>

		<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:11">John  20:11</a> - 22
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My object in reading this scripture is to seek to show that the great end in John's ministry is to bring about in the saints a state of faith and of spirituality, especially the latter.<a name=87:1></a> This chapter particularly presents the climax of the instruction, and my hope is that each of us may be led to emulate this remarkable woman, Mary Magdalene, who seems to stand out as the representative believer from John's point of view.<a name=87:2></a> Mary of Bethany expresses Luke's standpoint; she ministers to the heart of Christ here; that is the thought connected with Bethany, but John presents the heavenly position.<a name=87:3></a> Not that he presents the fact of the ascension as Luke and Mark do, but he leads us on to the spiritual apprehension of the heavenly position, set out in Christ as ascended.<a name=87:4></a> Now this remarkable woman is let into the secret of it; she comes into the good of it spiritually.<a name=87:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having this great end in view, the apostle and evangelist, John, hangs all he has to say on certain "signs", which he says were done by the Lord in the presence of His disciples.<a name=87:6></a> They are not presented as done publicly, to convince men, but as instruction for the disciples.<a name=87:7></a> Luke presents the works of the Lord in their public bearing, for he sets forth Christ as expressive of grace here, but John selects particular works of the Lord, such as suit the object he has in view.<a name=87:8></a> Hence if we are attentive to the Spirit, and if there is corresponding exercise with us, we shall become believers as John looks for them, and we shall become spiritual and heavenly.<a name=87:9></a> In that way we shall answer to the mind of God, not only in regard to His millennial thoughts, but those thoughts of His which are, so to say, of permanent bearing, eternal thoughts, as we read elsewhere, "afterwards

	<div class="paragraph">
		that which is spiritual".<a name=88:1></a> It is that "afterwards" which the Spirit would impress upon us in this gospel, "that which is spiritual".<a name=88:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the first <i>sign</i> here shows the Lord's rebuke on the intrusion of what is natural into that which is divine.<a name=88:3></a> The natural is the snare today.<a name=88:4></a> We see many governed by family considerations, governed by nature.<a name=88:5></a> So this sign comes in to deliver us.<a name=88:6></a> The whole scene presents what is natural, for it is the occasion of a marriage, and that is pre-eminently an occasion for nature to assert itself.<a name=88:7></a> Well, the Lord was invited to this marriage, and not only the Lord, but His disciples also, showing that the principal actors in the event were not indifferent to Him.<a name=88:8></a> They represent such as have a certain appreciation of Christ, they would not leave Him out, and yet He is only invited as One of the guests; He was not known as supreme.<a name=88:9></a> His mother was there also.<a name=88:10></a> Mothers, if they are spiritual, become wonderful instruments in the hand of God for the promotion of what is spiritual.<a name=88:11></a> We see that in Timothy's mother.<a name=88:12></a> What a contribution to the assembly we see in her, through her education of Timothy.<a name=88:13></a> The question I would raise with mothers is, What is each mother contributing to the assembly of God?<a name=88:14></a> You may wonder that I speak to the mothers, but there are many such, and I desire to raise exercise.<a name=88:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thank God for the mothers if they are spiritual.<a name=88:16></a> Timothy's mother, instead of being on the line of nature, was on the line of faith, and it is only as mothers are on that line, that they can minister to the assembly of God, through their education of their children.<a name=88:17></a> Timothy is a typical man for the last days, and in him we can see the value of spiritual mothering in the house of God, if I may so express it.<a name=88:18></a> The mother of Jesus here was on natural lines, and she says, "They have no wine".<a name=88:19></a> She is intruding her natural link with the Lord into His service.<a name=88:20></a> Now as

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=89>[Page 89]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I said, this is largely pattern for us, and as I have spoken to the mothers, so now I would speak to the young man.<a name=89:1></a> Jesus says, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=89:2></a>" That was seemingly a hard way to speak to a mother, but nothing is too hard if it is a question of the intrusion of nature into the things of God; if it is a question of robbing God of His due from me in regard to His service.<a name=89:3></a> The Lord would utterly refuse the claims of nature in divine things.<a name=89:4></a> Israel might have its natural claim to Him, but that claim must be deferred; it was not the moment for the introduction of that claim, and His mother falls into her place of subjection.<a name=89:5></a> The natural is subordinated to what is spiritual, for the dispensation is marked by spirituality.<a name=89:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, this sign comes in to show that spirituality begins in every one of us, in subjection to Christ, as the mother says here, "Whatsoever <i>he</i> says to you, do it".<a name=89:7></a> I would say to us all: Let not nature intrude itself into our relations with God, let us refuse it and rebuke it, as the Lord did here.<a name=89:8></a> When the work of the Lord was finished, He graciously directs that His mother should be cared for, but she must not intrude in regard to what is spiritual, on the ground of nature.<a name=89:9></a> So this is the beginning of signs, and in the initial sign we can see what is in the mind of the Spirit with regard to believers.<a name=89:10></a> It is a question of disciples of Christ, and the first sign to them teaches the refusal of natural ties in the things of God.<a name=89:11></a> Such would recognise it in its place, but we have to learn to refuse it entirely in regard to our service to God; it can have no place there.<a name=89:12></a> In my relation to God, all must be on spiritual lines, nature must not intrude there.<a name=89:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the next sign, connected with Cana of Galilee, in chapter 4 we see a man captured for God, and not only the man himself, but his whole house.<a name=89:14></a> If nature is allowed in your house, you cannot look

		<a name=90>[Page 90]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for what is spiritual in your children.<a name=90:1></a> So here we find a nobleman, one with a certain status in this world; he was, as we say, a man of means and position.<a name=90:2></a> Well what discloses itself with regard to him is that his child is at the point of death; his position and status and nobility is powerless to relieve him or his house of the ravages of disease and death.<a name=90:3></a> I would raise the question, How is it with our houses?<a name=90:4></a> Are we living in our natural nobility?<a name=90:5></a> Are we boasting in our worldly status?<a name=90:6></a> It will be powerless to relieve in the moment of death.<a name=90:7></a> The escape is in faith.<a name=90:8></a> In the first sign the Lord secures the faith of His disciples.<a name=90:9></a> That glorious Man manifested forth His glory; the bridegroom and the bride are not the chief objects in the feast, but it becomes an occasion of His manifesting forth Christ's glory.<a name=90:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then later in the chapter we get an additional thought.<a name=90:11></a> The Jews ask what sign He would show, and He answers, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".<a name=90:12></a> He spake of the temple of His body, and when He arose from the dead it says, "His disciples remembered that he had said this unto them, and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken".<a name=90:13></a> Do we believe the scripture?<a name=90:14></a> I have great anxiety as to the effort of the enemy to undermine and undervalue the Old Testament scriptures; it is to those scriptures that this passage refers.<a name=90:15></a> In Luke it tells us that He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.<a name=90:16></a> So that it was a great point with the Lord; and here, too, we are told they remembered what He had said, and "they believed the scriptures and the word which Jesus had spoken".<a name=90:17></a> It was in the light of the resurrection of Christ that all was recalled to remembrance, and they believed the scriptures.<a name=90:18></a> Now the nobleman in chapter 4 believed "and his whole house"; that is, the man came into the appreciation of Christ as the One who
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		quickens.<a name=91:1></a> What a triumph for Christ, not only to have secured the faith of His disciples, but now of this nobleman and his house with him.<a name=91:2></a> Henceforth, instead of considering for the nobility of his house, he would consider for Christ and for God.<a name=91:3></a> That is the effect of the second sign.<a name=91:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next sign implies public power.<a name=91:5></a> As regards power, the nobleman was no better off than the impotent man at the pool, but as the subject of the ministry of the Lord, the man becomes a testimony to the power of God.<a name=91:6></a> Then next we have what sustains that power, the living bread.<a name=91:7></a> It is the Son of man, clothed with humility, coming down from heaven in order that He might die.<a name=91:8></a> Think of it!<a name=91:9></a> He died!<a name=91:10></a> Think of the reproach of it!<a name=91:11></a> It is His flesh that He gives for the life of the world, and in the eating of it we are sustained in power.<a name=91:12></a> Eating His flesh is intensely spiritual; to make it an ordinance is just Romanism, but as the Lord says Himself, the "words that I speak unto you are spirit and life".<a name=91:13></a> His flesh is meat indeed, and His blood drink indeed.<a name=91:14></a> It is in thus eating and drinking that one gets a spiritual constitution which enables one to be nothing at all in this world, but to live to God; one can afford to let all go that has to do with our place in this world as one feeds on this wonderful food.<a name=91:15></a> What a constitution it builds up, so that one is happy and free with God, though deprived of all else.<a name=91:16></a> There is spiritual sustenance in this food which will maintain us in life.<a name=91:17></a>
	</div>

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to present from these Scriptures and from others to which I may feel obliged to refer, the place a model or pattern occupies in the things of God.<a name=97:1></a> You will recall how, when the tabernacle was to be constructed, God said to Moses that he was to be careful in regard to the pattern of it, that in the building of God's dwelling there was to be no deviation from the pattern.<a name=97:2></a> It was a question of God's habitation, and God was concerned that it should be in every way as the word says, "according to the fashion thereof which was showed thee in the mount", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#26:30">Exodus  26:30</a>.<a name=97:3></a> Now, we have obviously in that, a word which should be ever before us in regard of our position here in relation to the house of God.<a name=97:4></a> I do not know if it can be said that the physical system was made exactly by pattern although everything was the result of the word of God.<a name=97:5></a> We have a word in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>which is suggestive in that respect: "The worlds were framed by the word of God".<a name=97:6></a> We know from other scriptures that the creation was the result and outcome of God's commandment.<a name=97:7></a> "He commanded and it stood fast" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#33:9">Psalm  33:9</a>), but there was at the same time a speaking, and God speaking necessarily suggests some expression of His mind.<a name=97:8></a> The worlds were framed by the word of God, in fact it says they were made by the Son, "By whom also he made the worlds", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a>.<a name=97:9></a> In the formation of the physical universe, wisdom was there, indicative of the fact that whatever was done, was done according to wisdom, but there is no reference that I know of to a pattern, in fact you could scarcely think of a pattern when the direct workers were divine Persons, but when we come to human agency in divine work, a

		I read that word in Matthew from the Lord's own lips, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me", having in mind that the Lord is about to introduce the great subject of the assembly and it was important that His disciples, and indeed all who believe on Him through them should have a pattern before them.<a name=98:3></a> It may be observed that in approaching this great subject of the assembly, the Lord was very deliberate and measured in His instructions.<a name=98:4></a> Some subjects in the gospels are presented, notwithstanding their importance, very briefly; but this great subject of the assembly is unfolded to us, as I said, in measured and deliberate discourses, and accompanied by examples, so that those who had become followers of Christ through faith, should know how to act, when <i>they</i> had to do with the assembly.<a name=98:5></a> Hence the Lord presents the idea in Himself of a model.<a name=98:6></a> "Learn from me", He says.<a name=98:7></a> We are also to listen, but that is more Luke.<a name=98:8></a> I think Mary of Bethany suggests to us the ideal of the Spirit in Luke.<a name=98:9></a> She was a listener, and there is no habit more important to cultivate in divine things than to listen.<a name=98:10></a> "Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God", the word says, "and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools", <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#5:1">Ecclesiastes  5:1</a>.<a name=98:11></a> The house of God is the place for hearing, and I take it that Mary of Bethany is a model hearer.<a name=98:12></a> She could listen notwithstanding very great interference and complaint.<a name=98:13></a> You may be able to adduce very good reasons for not paying attention to what the Lord is saying at the present time, reasons which are more or less satisfactory to yourself, but no reason can be satisfactory to the Lord for your withholding your ear if He is speaking.<a name=98:14></a> So Mary is set before us in Luke as a model in that regard, a model listener, and she could listen in spite of interference, in spite of severe criticism.<a name=98:15></a> It is said, "Mary

		Well, that is Luke, but Matthew, as I remarked, is presenting the assembly and he contemplates the followers of Christ as becoming members of it, as having part in it, so he sets the Lord before us as saying, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me".<a name=100:7></a> What were the circumstances at the time the Lord said this, dear brethren?<a name=100:8></a> Circumstances such as would fill the ordinary heart with dismay and discouragement, whereas the Lord is seen in triumph.<a name=100:9></a> "At that time", as we read in the earlier verses He turns to the Father and says, "I thank thee -- because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes".<a name=100:10></a> He is in the spirit of thanksgiving; He is in the presence of the Father, as sovereign ruler of heaven and earth, and He is presented there as the model of every one that should believe on Him from that time onwards.<a name=100:11></a> Now you will understand in speaking thus, I would desire to bring the thought of a model down to ourselves, and one has ample warrant for it in the epistles, not

		And now, what about young men?<a name=103:4></a> John has a letter for them, and one is always reminded of Timothy when it becomes a question of a young man, and so the apostle knowing full well how Timothy would be looked to as his child, and realising how important it was that he should be in every way in keeping with himself, urges on him to take heed to himself and to the doctrine.<a name=103:5></a> Let me just read to you what he says about this point in the first letter.<a name=103:6></a> "Let no man despise thy youth".<a name=103:7></a> That was an obligation resting on Timothy; "but be thou an example of the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity"; <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:12">1 Timothy  4:12</a>.<a name=103:8></a> What an obligation!<a name=103:9></a> what a word for young men!<a name=103:10></a> The elders are to be ensamples or models, but the younger are to see to it by their deportment that no one despise their youth, and that there should be a model presented in these features, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.<a name=103:11></a> How does that come home to one?<a name=103:12></a> I have to be a model to my brethren as Paul says to Timothy, "Thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:10">2 Timothy  3:10</a>, 11.<a name=103:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe God would hold us together not with the thought that we can leave things indefinitely, but rather with the sense that we are in God's hands, and He will reveal what is obscure and meanwhile we are to be followers together, as far as that is possible, of Paul who followed hard after Christ who, as he says, is our model.<a name=106:12></a> May God bless the word.<a name=106:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is before me after much consideration to speak this evening on the subject of prayer.<a name=107:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:18">Ephesians  6:18</a>, the saints are enjoined to pray "at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit" -- a fitting end to an epistle that unfolds the whole purpose of God; for the more light vouchsafed, the more sense there is, in those who value it, of the need for prayer, especially in the light of the statement that God "is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think".<a name=107:2></a> This is a great incentive to prayer.<a name=107:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in introducing so important and practical a subject, one would refer to the fact that the beginning of the great work of God in Europe was marked by prayer, as if the instinct were present that tremendous opposition stood in the way of its progress in that part of the world, hence the need is expressed in prayer.<a name=107:4></a> First, the man of Macedonia beseeches that extraordinary vessel of the light of God from heaven to come over.<a name=107:5></a> It was an urgent prayer to come over and help; then, arriving at Philippi, Paul and those with him found a place of prayer, perhaps the first formal prayer meeting mentioned, not that collective prayer is not found earlier, but here we get a place for it.<a name=107:6></a> The apostle and his company are led to that spot, and in connection with it they find engaged in commerce a woman of Thyatira, whose heart the Lord opened so that she attended to the things spoken by Paul Light came into her soul, and having been baptised, she besought Paul to come into her house.<a name=107:7></a> Then we are told that, as they went to prayer, a female slave met them, as if the enemy was now aroused, knowing what was involved in this form of service, and started to oppose.<a name=107:8></a>

		This woman had a spirit of Python, by which, in prophesying, she brought much gain to her masters, showing that Satan was entrenched in the spirit of commerce in that part of the world, and would not have his domain touched, for a prayerful people would spoil that order of things.<a name=108:1></a> The building up of a commercial system is not compatible with prayer.<a name=108:2></a> Prayer gives God His place, who created all things and gives them to us richly to enjoy.<a name=108:3></a> They are sanctified by the word of God and prayer, but the great commercial systems of the world, in any country, are not sanctified by the word of God and prayer, and we have to be on our guard against them.<a name=108:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the great snares of the present time is the world of commerce: it offers much attraction to young people, whereas they fail to see that Satan is entrenched in it; indeed, it is a remarkable fact that in the Old Testament the king of Tyre (Tyre being the great commercial centre) is a type of the devil himself (see <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#28">Ezekiel  28</a>).<a name=108:5></a> This female slave, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>, who brought much gain to her masters, becomes the agent of the devil to oppose a people who were going to prayer.<a name=108:6></a> This really brought about the arrest of Paul and Silas, who were thrust into the prison, but we find the indomitable spirit of prayer there.<a name=108:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to this because prayer lay at the root of the great work of God that spread into Europe, and eventually into this country, and it is doubtless the thought of God that the end should be as the beginning.<a name=108:8></a> The testimony obviously remained in Europe, and at the outgoings of Europe.<a name=108:9></a> There, in the ways of God, it has stood and will stand; and it is with that thought before me I speak, that at the end there should be a people characterised by prayer.<a name=108:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to illustrate the great results of prayer from the blessed Lord Himself, guarding my remarks with the thought that the Lord is unique, and that there are features in each instance that belong to Him

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are eight instances in Luke's gospel in which the Lord Jesus is seen engaged in prayer.<a name=109:4></a> In speaking of these my thought is to interest the young people specially.<a name=109:5></a> In chapter 3 it is the Lord identifying Himself with the remnant of God's people; and it is your privilege to follow His example.<a name=109:6></a> It is not enough to have light in your soul in regard to your sins, or your eternal destiny.<a name=109:7></a> God looks for definite identification, with His people, on the part, of every one having light.<a name=109:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses, when he became great, chose to suffer affliction <i>along with</i> the people of God; that is the example the Lord sets here.<a name=109:9></a> All the people having been baptised, Jesus was baptised and He prayed.<a name=109:10></a> I wish to impress upon the young ones the thought that your entrance amongst the people of God must be marked, if you are to progress, by this.<a name=109:11></a> The Lord had come and definitely <i>identified</i> Himself with the repentant people of God.<a name=109:12></a> He was the Son of God and outside of this personally, having no sins to confess, but He identified Himself with them.<a name=109:13></a> All the people being baptised, He was baptised.<a name=109:14></a> He did not go in first.<a name=109:15></a> You see it is identification.<a name=109:16></a> He is not giving a lead here, but is taking His place humbly with a repentant people.<a name=109:17></a> He comes in last, but coming in last, He is morally first, for of Him alone it is said that <i>He prayed</i>.<a name=109:18></a> He did not take up His baptism lightly, but seriously.<a name=109:19></a> Unless we take up our position in connection with the people of God seriously and in prayer, we shall not progress.<a name=109:20></a> It is for the youngest to begin thus, not indeed necessarily in the assembly, audibly, you must begin in your closet.<a name=109:21></a>

		Now what you see here is the Lord Jesus praying as He is baptised, and the heaven is opened.<a name=110:6></a> I should not like to be with the people of God except with the approval of heaven.<a name=110:7></a> You must, of course, seek the approval of the saints; one great principle in Christianity is reception, but the saints are particular as to their reception.<a name=110:8></a> It is said of Jesus, He was "received up in glory", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=110:9></a> Do you not think that heaven exercised the keenest discrimination in that reception?<a name=110:10></a> Indeed it did.<a name=110:11></a> Though the Creator of the heavens, He was Man, and had walked this earth under the eye of heaven.<a name=110:12></a> He was "justified in the Spirit"; we are told that He "has appeared to angels, .<a name=110:13></a>.<a name=110:14></a>.<a name=110:15></a> has been received up in glory".<a name=110:16></a> <i>Received up</i>!<a name=110:17></a> So, if I am to be amongst the people of God, it is with the approval of heaven.<a name=110:18></a> How do I know that I have that approval?<a name=110:19></a> The Lord had it by the extraordinary opening of the heaven upon Him.<a name=110:20></a> Wonderful!<a name=110:21></a> The angels could look down, and the Father saw Him and announced His pleasure.<a name=110:22></a> "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:22">Luke  3:22</a>.<a name=110:23></a>

		You say, I cannot expect that.<a name=110:24></a> No, but for us heaven's approval is found in the assembly.<a name=110:25></a> I do not wish to be with the people of God without their approval.<a name=110:26></a> The saints normally reflect the mind of heaven, and you may be assured of this, that if it can be said of you, as it was said of Saul of Tarsus: "Behold he prayeth", you will find the approval of the saints.<a name=110:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with the second prayer, the Lord is in the wilderness.<a name=111:7></a> Young believers do not care much about that place.<a name=111:8></a> They like to be in the crowd; one often dreads large meetings for the reason that young people are apt to be governed by natural feelings among other young people, whereas the truly exercised soul wants to get alone, he wants to withdraw from the crowd.<a name=111:9></a> The Lord was in the wilderness in a desert place, but was praying there.<a name=111:10></a> The desert does not hinder prayer, it aids you in that exercise, for there is nothing in the wilderness to attract the flesh in us.<a name=111:11></a> The Lord was there as withdrawn from the crowds.<a name=111:12></a> I would urge that feature in regard to prayer -- the acceptance of the actual situation that the world is a <i>wilderness</i>.<a name=111:13></a> You may come to the meeting and be amongst the people of God on worldly lines.<a name=111:14></a> The Lord "withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed".<a name=111:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us pass on to chapter 6.<a name=112:6></a> This scripture suggests that you cannot do things of yourself, even your ordinary prayers do not suffice; and so the Lord is seen apart on the mountain -- a whole night in prayer -- with a view to <i>selection</i>.<a name=112:7></a> One marvels at it.<a name=112:8></a> I have often said it (and practised it, too), that the best way to spend wakeful hours is in prayer.<a name=112:9></a> I have not a doubt that God gives wakeful hours, orders them for us, so that we may pray.<a name=112:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The responsibility of things is so overwhelming; but as you are with God, you find an outlet in regard to the need of men and the people of God.<a name=112:11></a> The Lord spent a whole night in prayer.<a name=112:12></a> In the morning He chose out twelve from His disciples whom He named apostles.<a name=112:13></a> You see the work is so great you cannot do it of yourself, even if you had the power of a Paul.<a name=112:14></a> This is one of the greatest lessons a servant has to learn.<a name=112:15></a> And so the Lord (not that I am limiting His power, but am speaking of Him as an example) would have twelve working with Him, for the need was so great.<a name=112:16></a> Then He descends from the mountain with them and stands on a level place.<a name=112:17></a> He is down where the need is, and with Him are the twelve vessels of His power.<a name=112:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point is to see the need; then there is the accompaniment of prayer, through which great results are brought about.<a name=112:19></a> As it says: "Supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest that he may send

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the fourth prayer is in chapter 9.<a name=113:4></a> You will see there is progress.<a name=113:5></a> What comes out in this scripture is that, as the Lord is praying alone, He makes inquiry of His disciples as to who men said He was.<a name=113:6></a> Abroad in Christendom there are a thousand and one thoughts about Christ which are entirely wrong, some of them are blasphemous thoughts.<a name=113:7></a> Can I be indifferent to them?<a name=113:8></a> I cannot.<a name=113:9></a> No one who is with God can be indifferent to anything that affects Christ.<a name=113:10></a> As He is praying here this question is raised; for it is important that the disciples at least should know <i>who He was</i>; and it is important that we, as surrounded by these thousand and one views (blasphemous many of them), should know who He is.<a name=113:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reading these verses, I have no thought of confining myself to what they present; my thought is to show what accrues to God from the gospel as presented in this remarkable letter to the saints at Rome, namely, that believers as set up on the ground of redemption should be here for the will of God, or to refer to the types, should become boards for the tabernacle.<a name=119:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gospel, as spoken of elsewhere, is perhaps more comprehensive than the letter to the Romans sets forth.<a name=119:2></a> We have "the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God" spoken of; then we have also the "glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ", but Romans is "the gospel of God", or God's glad tidings, and has in view, as I said, that God should have men and women here on this earth, subject to His will, and whom He can employ, according to that will, in setting forth what they have proved Him to be in their own souls through the Gospel.<a name=119:3></a> The heavenly position is not in view in this epistle, although the basis for it is laid.<a name=119:4></a> The word heaven is scarcely used in the epistle, indeed only in one instance, and in that instance it is to tell us that wrath comes from heaven, "for there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety", so that it is not the glad tidings of the land, as we may speak, that is presented to us here.<a name=119:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>you will remember, it is said that certain had the glad tidings presented to them, but it did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard; that was the glad tidings of the land.<a name=119:6></a> It refers to the report, brought by the twelve spies who had been sent to investigate and report to Moses and the congregation what the land was; it is their report that is alluded

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is not Romans.<a name=120:3></a> Romans is simply "the gospel of God", and Paul "a called apostle" is said to have been separated to it, as if to intimate that every primary movement in the gospel originated with God.<a name=120:4></a> The sending of the Lord Jesus Christ first of all, and the call of the apostle Paul, both speak of the initiative being with God; and so in regard of those in Rome that had received the gospel; they are said to be "beloved of God, <i>called</i> saints"; that is, <i>He</i> had called them.<a name=120:5></a> It was not simply that they went by that name, but that they were called to that.<a name=120:6></a> Paul was a called apostle, and they were called saints.<a name=120:7></a> Then the apostle announces that he was not ashamed of the gospel, not because it spoke of a heavenly position, but because it was the "power of God unto salvation"; but note it was "unto salvation to <i>every one that believeth</i>" as Paul says elsewhere, "Unto us which are saved it is the power of God" that is, the preaching of the cross.<a name=120:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to ask the question, whether we, as believers, have come to that, for I assume that we are all believers here tonight, or nearly all, and I would put it to you as to whether you have come to it in your soul, that the gospel is the power of God.<a name=120:9></a> It is an immense thing to realise the power of God in your soul, for that is where it is operative now, the power that wrought in raising Christ from the dead is operative now in the souls of believers; as it is said in a fuller sense in another scripture, "the power that worketh in us".<a name=120:10></a> That is what we get in the opening of this epistle, and now I want to show you when the apostle comes to his point, for one may say the early part of the epistle; that is, the first two chapters and the second half of the third chapter, are introductory.<a name=120:11></a> When he comes to the working out of the

		gospel, he introduces a thought that should ever be before our souls, <i>namely, the glory of God</i>.<a name=121:1></a> "All have sinned", he says, "and come short of the glory of God".<a name=121:2></a> That is a remarkable expression, and it is one that, as I said, should be ever before our souls, because it intimates a certain standard that God has before Him in regard to things on this earth.<a name=121:3></a> As yet it is not a question of His glory in heaven, it is a question of what is on this earth.<a name=121:4></a> In order to show the bearing of the expression, I would refer you to the well-known <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:61">Psalm  78:61</a>.<a name=121:5></a> He "delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand".<a name=121:6></a> It referred to Christ; that is the ark, to use a type; the ark was the glory; it was that in which, figuratively, God could overthrow the enemy's power, and find a resting place for His people, who in turn found a resting place for Him.<a name=121:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want you to bear in mind what God has embodied in this way; that is, He has brought in in Christ One who delighted to do His will.<a name=121:8></a> A wonderful Person to have here on earth!<a name=121:9></a> "I delight", He says, "to do thy will, O my God".<a name=121:10></a> Even if that will involved His going down underneath the dark waters of death and judgment, He would take that way.<a name=121:11></a> So when the ark moved, Moses says, "Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee".<a name=121:12></a> That was Christ going into death.<a name=121:13></a> "Let thine enemies be scattered", what a scattering there was of the enemies of God when Christ went into death and rose out of it!<a name=121:14></a> They were all banded together there, all the elements of evil were banded together at the cross against Jehovah and against His anointed, but the ark went forward, and as the ark went forward the enemies were scattered, and all that hated God fled before Him.<a name=121:15></a> As we read the records of the resurrection of Christ in the four gospels our souls are filled with the sense of victory.<a name=121:16></a> You see the enemies melting away

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then there was not only the moving, the setting forward of the ark, but there was the returning of the ark.<a name=122:5></a> When the ark rested, Moses said, "Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel".<a name=122:6></a> Now you come to the circle of faith.<a name=122:7></a> If the ark found a resting place for the people, if Christ has found a resting place, for our consciences and our hearts through His death and resurrection, what is it for, but that we should find and afford a resting place for Him?<a name=122:8></a> I have no doubt that in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>we get the circle of the enemies, "bulls of Bashan", "dogs", the "assembly of the wicked", "the lion's mouth", but in verse 21 the Lord says, "thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns".<a name=122:9></a> From that extreme point of evil where He stood for God, where He maintained God's righteousness and His holiness, God heard Him, and so in the next verse He says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the assembly will I praise thee".<a name=122:10></a> It was, as it were, the returning of the ark unto the many thousands of Israel; and I would have every one of us here tonight to know that we belong to <i>that</i> Israel, the Israel of God.<a name=122:11></a> God would have a resting place in the midst of the myriads, the thousands of Israel.<a name=122:12></a>

		So the glory of God, the standard that God sets before the soul in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>, is what Christ was here as doing His will.<a name=122:13></a> We all come short of that, but then God is going to bring all into accord with it.<a name=122:14></a> The pre-eminence of the Son of God as maintaining all according to the divine standard, the glory of God, is set forth, but God's proposal through the gospel is

		But now I would ask, what are you to be for God?<a name=124:6></a> That is what I wanted specially to emphasise.<a name=124:7></a> I shall just touch on one point so that you may have it before you.<a name=124:8></a> Chapter 7 works out in the experience of some man, indeed, it may be, what one may call abstract experience, but it is worked out in this way, that the writer says, "I delight in the law of God after the inward man".<a name=124:9></a> That is a remarkable statement.<a name=124:10></a> He does not say that he does it, that he fulfils it, but he <i>delights</i> in it.<a name=124:11></a> Have you come to that as a believer?<a name=124:12></a> I have already spoken about forgiveness, justification and peace, all of which are from God's side through Christ.<a name=124:13></a> But now, here is a man who is in the light of these things, and although he has found out that the flesh in him is against God, that it is incorrigible, unalterable, and remains ever what it was and what it is, yet he speaks of what he calls an "inward man", and according to that inward man he delights in the law of God.<a name=124:14></a> Remarkable result!<a name=124:15></a> In other words, by his profession he is a board of the tabernacle.<a name=124:16></a> One can hardly say that he is yet standing up as a board, but he is a board in his inward feelings and resolve.<a name=124:17></a>

		The dimensions of the ark are peculiar, as you will observe if you read <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, and their peculiarity speaks of the Person of Christ, what He is; but when you come to the boards, what is said of them is they are "standing up".<a name=125:1></a> "Thou shalt make", He says, "boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up", that is very remarkable.<a name=125:2></a> Ordinarily, in making them they would not be standing up, if we judge according to nature, but Scripture is written not according to nature, but according to spirit.<a name=125:3></a> We are to read Scripture in the spirit of it, and indeed it is said, "the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=125:4></a> It is in the Spirit of the Lord that we take up the Old Testament, and in the Spirit of the Lord we have liberty to go through and see Christ in it, and, indeed, not only Christ, but all that concerns Christ.<a name=125:5></a> The boards refer to the saints in their relation to Christ.<a name=125:6></a> Now do you understand, as a believer, that God's thought is to set you up here in relation to Christ?<a name=125:7></a> He has no other thought for you as you are down here, nor indeed has He any other thought for you in heaven, than that you should be set in relation to Christ.<a name=125:8></a>

		But to refer to the type in detail: we read that the boards were ten cubits high, and a cubit and a half in width.<a name=125:9></a> There were forty-eight of them.<a name=125:10></a> I suppose the number has its own spiritual significance.<a name=125:11></a> It is a remarkable number, having a combination of ideas, of <i>administration</i> in the number twelve and <i>universality</i> in the number four; there is also the idea of responsibility in the height of the boards, ten cubits.<a name=125:12></a> I want you to follow, in a spiritual way, what I am saying, because the divine intent is that we should be set up in relation to Christ in <i>responsibility</i>, at the same time having the thought of administration in our souls, the administration of the blessings of God and that the <i>whole world</i> should be before us, and nothing less than that; indeed, the

		Now in chapter 15, the Lord introduces an agricultural simile, and again you have the elements of divine sovereignty.<a name=135:5></a> In the presence of religious corruption and human traditions, replacing the commandments of God, the Lord says, "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up".<a name=135:6></a> If He is Lord of heaven and earth, He will have His way in the heavens and on the earth.<a name=135:7></a> Planting obviously refers to the earth, and no plant which the Father has not planted shall remain.<a name=135:8></a> Am I one of the Father's planting?<a name=135:9></a> Have I through religious effort and manipulation found a place of conspicuousness for myself?<a name=135:10></a> I am not the Father's planting.<a name=135:11></a> It is for each to answer in his soul as to the position he occupies, is it of the Father?<a name=135:12></a> He is Lord, as Jesus said, of heaven and earth.<a name=135:13></a> And not a plant of all the plants on earth which He has not planted shall remain.<a name=135:14></a> The point therefore for each is to determine in his own soul before God as to whether the Father hath planted him?<a name=135:15></a> The Father, being the sovereign Ruler shall have His way on the earth, and so He sees to the planting.<a name=135:16></a> You will recall how He planted a garden eastward in Eden, He did it Himself, and so, beloved, He continues to plant.<a name=135:17></a> The Lord grew up before Him as a tender plant, as a root out of dry ground, He grew up before Jehovah.<a name=135:18></a>

		And so when you come to chapter 16, you have the well -- known passage all of which I did not read for I only want to occupy you this evening with the Father.<a name=136:16></a> The Lord refers to the Father's revelation as being different from what is known to flesh and blood.<a name=136:17></a> I think, dear brethren, that we need to be reminded that there is such activity, there is such service as a service that is outside flesh and blood.<a name=136:18></a> "Flesh and blood", said the Lord, "hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven".<a name=136:19></a> In other words, the Father's work in this instance refers to a spiritual, an wholly spiritual structure.<a name=136:20></a> And I dwell on that side because of the need of the saints advancing on spiritual lines, for we naturally tend to the flesh and blood side.<a name=136:21></a> I suppose what we see about us in Christendom is built up on the lines of flesh and blood.<a name=136:22></a> I need not seek to emphasise that

		Now the Father is connected with the idea of a stone in chapter 16 and I want to emphasise that which is spiritual, that the building is altogether spiritual.<a name=137:6></a> The Father begins to work by introducing the foundation.<a name=137:7></a> This is not the foundation that Paul laid exactly; what he laid was in keeping with it.<a name=137:8></a> What he was aiming at in his service was to shut out the natural man, hence he says, "other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ".<a name=137:9></a> The order of man that is to be in the structure is after Christ; no other is admitted, but the Father had introduced the thought of the Christ, not Jesus Christ, as Paul said, but <i>the Christ</i> the Son of the living God.<a name=137:10></a> What light in the soul of Peter!<a name=137:11></a> and in a way there is hardly anything that one can speak about more important at this moment than this light, a wholly spiritual thought!<a name=137:12></a> in regard of Christ, that He is the Christ, He is the One in whom God accomplishes all His will.<a name=137:13></a> What light that is in the soul in view of the religious activities around us!<a name=137:14></a> <i>The Christ</i> is to do everything, and then He is the Son of the living God.<a name=137:15></a> He is entirely outside of death, He has annulled it and brought life and incorruptibility to light, there is no corruption in this foundation.<a name=137:16></a> Such, dear brethren, is the foundation upon which the structure is to be reared up and the Father Himself introduces it.<a name=137:17></a> Therefore we have the sovereign act of the Father in connection with every stone in the building.<a name=137:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While the record of Peter's service practically ceases at the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>, the thread of it is resumed in chapter 9, and I desire to show the result of this new service or exercise of apostolic power.<a name=150:1></a> The early chapters are full of Peter's service, indeed so prominent was he and so effective, that even his shadow was looked to and reckoned upon for relief.<a name=150:2></a> Yet notwithstanding the great effectiveness of his service, there is a break, and chapter 6 introduces a development among the saints of a certain sectional feeling.<a name=150:3></a> The Hellenist believers murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.<a name=150:4></a> Notice it was <i>their</i> widows, those in the Greek provinces.<a name=150:5></a> Had they complained about the neglect of widows in general, it would have been a different matter, though indeed it is serious to complain at all in regard to the things of God; any complaint must be established on a solid foundation to be justifiable at all.<a name=150:6></a> I think the word "murmuring" is used for the first time in Scripture in this chapter in relation to Christians, and it certainly is a sinister feature.<a name=150:7></a> Now the Hebrew widows were of just as much interest to Christ as the Hellenist widows; both were equally precious, as believers, to Christ.<a name=150:8></a> <i>He</i> has no sectional feeling at all.<a name=150:9></a> He is concerned about all.<a name=150:10></a> The house of God being a general thought and embracing all the saints, is cared for by Christ, watched over by Him and He has no preferences of any kind as regards persons, nations or cities.<a name=150:11></a> Hence the development recorded in chapter 6 is a sinister one, for the element of murmuring is introduced as the result of sectional feeling.<a name=150:12></a>

		I mention this at the outset as giving rise to the

		new movement on the part of the Lord, for if the enemy moves, taking advantage of a low state among the people of God, the Lord will also move and His movement will more than outwit and withstand that of the enemy.<a name=151:1></a> So here we have a completely new departure on the part of the Lord.<a name=151:2></a> The apostles meet the complaint raised, by suggesting to the brethren that seven men be appointed to take up the matter.<a name=151:3></a> We have other business to do, they virtually say, than serve tables, that is to minister the word and pray.<a name=151:4></a> Most worthy work surely!<a name=151:5></a> -- but then widows and needy ones <i>have</i> to be attended to, we cannot evade that.<a name=151:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The need of the saints, whether spiritual or other wise, is of paramount importance, indeed, as Paul says, things are to be on the principle of equality; there is to be a levelling up, so that need be met.<a name=151:7></a> Even the apostle Paul himself was ready to carry the saints' bounty to Jerusalem, so that all that was necessary might be supplied.<a name=151:8></a> Here the twelve, realising that there was sectional feeling working among the saints said, "Look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business".<a name=151:9></a> That was very wise.<a name=151:10></a> The saints were cast on themselves, they were to select seven men <i>from themselves</i>, and it is to be noted that the Hellenists got the advantage, showing that the Spirit of Christ was dominant among the saints.<a name=151:11></a> The Hebrews did not arrogate anything to themselves, the deacons, judging by their names, were mostly Hellenists.<a name=151:12></a> So the Lord triumphs here, as He will in relation to anything that arises, even when it is the product of a low state among the people of God.<a name=151:13></a> The sectional feeling is met; right men came forward to deal with the matter, and among them Stephen, a man "full of faith and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=151:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 8 we have Philip's service in Samaria, and the apostles are introduced in verse 14, to link on with that work which the Lord had been carrying on through him apart from them.<a name=152:7></a> They pray, and the Holy Spirit is given through the laying on of their hands.<a name=152:8></a> It seems to indicate that if there is any retirement on the part of those immediately responsible in the house of God the Lord proceeds in His own way, for the work must be done.<a name=152:9></a> If we impose limits on the spheres of our activities, the Lord can say: If your sphere is not as great as Mine, I shall go on with Mine.<a name=152:10></a> "Lift up your eyes", He said to the disciples, "and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest", <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:35">John  4:35</a>.<a name=152:11></a> The harvest belongs to Christ, and if my service does not extend to the whole field, the Lord will bring in others, for the harvest must be attended to and He is Lord of it.<a name=152:12></a> A very great obligation rests on those who have light from the Lord; if <i>He</i> imposes limits we must abide by them, but let us not impose limitations for ourselves, nor let our sphere of responsibility be any less than the whole house of God.<a name=152:13></a>

		The next case is that of Dorcas, and she does not need to be told to do anything like this, for she was a woman of very great activity, so much so that her name has been handed down in connection with work done for the poor and needy.<a name=154:9></a> But we find that in spite of her good works and almsdeeds, this woman dies; her activities do not keep her alive.<a name=154:10></a> We do not minimise what she did, but emphasise this, that she died; and we may glean from this passage that we too may do much and yet come short of living.<a name=154:11></a> The close of the narrative makes prominent that Peter presents her to the saints and widows, <i>living</i>; it is no longer the idea of Dorcas, not a word is said as to what she did then, all that we have is a living woman presented to the saints.<a name=154:12></a> That is enough; if you have a woman alive spiritually, you do not need to say much.<a name=154:13></a>

		You will notice here also that widows are spoken of.<a name=155:1></a> It was not surprising that it should be so, for Dorcas had befriended them, but it is noteworthy that before Peter meets the situation he puts them all out.<a name=155:2></a> Now, spiritual people are not put out.<a name=155:3></a> Verse 14 states that Peter "having called the saints and the widows presented her living".<a name=155:4></a> Saints are distinguished from widows in this verse, and the widows were the weeping ones.<a name=155:5></a> I want you to recognise that what you do must not be just something that calls out the sympathy of unspiritual people; what is of interest is the sympathy of spiritual people, hence the Spirit of God distinguishes between widows and saints -- widows are obviously not always saints in that sense.<a name=155:6></a> They remembered the good deeds of Dorcas -- praiseworthy indeed they were, but the fact remains that in spite of their tears, the widows were put forth.<a name=155:7></a> This is solemn.<a name=155:8></a> The Holy Spirit is working through Peter, there is a spiritual movement, and I may be faced with having no part in it, in spite of the fact that I am moved and weeping.<a name=155:9></a> My very emotions might become a hindrance spiritually.<a name=155:10></a>

		Life is a great thing.<a name=156:2></a> This fits in with John's ministry, and it seems as if Peter in this lapse between chapters 5 and 9 had been spiritually helped of God (one speaks of it with great satisfaction), for he says in effect, Now it is a question of life, people must live for themselves and be known as living.<a name=156:3></a> So he presents her to the saints, as if to say, Here is a living Dorcas for you -- a living one -- not now a garment maker, but a living woman.<a name=156:4></a> It is spiritual life, I need not remind you, that is contemplated, that which would answer to God.<a name=156:5></a> "The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day", Hezekiah said (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:19">Isaiah  38:19</a>) .<a name=156:6></a> If there is anything one would love it is to be among the saints as alive spiritually.<a name=156:7></a> We want that, as the apostle says, "God .<a name=156:8></a>.<a name=156:9></a>.<a name=156:10></a> has quickened us with Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:5">Ephesians  2:5</a>.<a name=156:11></a> He quickens each of us in our souls so that we live Godward.<a name=156:12></a> But we are quickened together also (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:13">Colossians  2:13</a>), so this woman is presented living to the saints; henceforth they have a living woman in their midst, whose heart from that moment will be wholly for God, for Christ and for the saints.<a name=156:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Inasmuch as the book of Revelation is written for the assembly directly, it is a book that should command the careful attention of every Christian, and whilst its main parts have reference to a coming day on the earth, its moral teaching is intended for the seven assemblies, that is, for the assembly viewed as it is historically in this world.<a name=181:1></a> The moral teaching in the book is for us.<a name=181:2></a> Indeed, the book begins with the assembly as one may say, the seven assemblies, and it ends with the assembly, so that it is quite obvious that the Lord had the assembly in view.<a name=181:3></a> In fact, John was to write down what he saw and send it to the seven assemblies which were in Asia.<a name=181:4></a> It is clear, therefore, that he had in mind that we should be instructed as to what is coming, and that, at the same time, we should get the benefit of the moral teaching which the book contains.<a name=181:5></a> So I ventured to read these verses, because they set before us the fact that there is a divine estimate made of what may exist for God at any given time.<a name=181:6></a>
	</div>

		Now, in the addresses to the seven assemblies we have the comforting word, "I know", addressed to each assembly.<a name=181:7></a> How comforting for those who love the Lord, that He knows.<a name=181:8></a> <i>He knows</i>.<a name=181:9></a> It is a serious matter, surely, for those who may be in the paths of sin; it is solemn that He knows, for He is presented as having eyes as a flame of fire.<a name=181:10></a> It is solemn for those who may, in any way, be serving their own wills; but, on the other hand, for those who love Him, it is most comforting that He says, "I know".<a name=181:11></a> Whatever others may think or say, <i>He knows</i>.<a name=181:12></a> To my mind, it is extremely comforting, that the Lord is cognisant of all that love would do in these days, and, in saying that, one has in mind many who may

		If we refer to the tabernacle position for a moment, there are the pegs, very insignificant parts, and yet all-important parts.<a name=182:2></a> It may be a bed-ridden person who loves the Lord and is carrying the interests of the Lord in her heart in prayer.<a name=182:3></a> She is holding things in that way, although the enemy may be endeavouring to disrupt and to destroy.<a name=182:4></a> There is no greater service, beloved, than prayer.<a name=182:5></a> In the great assembly gospel, that is Matthew, the Lord says, "enter into thy chamber and having shut the door, pray to thy Father who is in secret", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:6">Matthew  6:6</a>.<a name=182:6></a> There is no publicity there, but there is effectiveness of service.<a name=182:7></a> So that, as I remarked, many are in extreme obscurity, but love's activities are there, and the Lord says, "<i>I know</i>".<a name=182:8></a> He would say, 'I know that things would have gone were it not for you'.<a name=182:9></a> It is, as it were, the tent peg holding down the tabernacle.<a name=182:10></a> And so, in many other relations; dear brethren, whatever it is that may be classified under the heading of love's works, love's activities, the Lord knows.<a name=182:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you, dear brethren, to take it in, that the divine thought in Christianity is that of outward simplicity.<a name=183:12></a> The Lord says to His own, "Fear not, little flock!<a name=183:13></a>" He had no other thought than that.<a name=183:14></a> A little flock, exposed to the opposition, the derision, and scorn of the world; but the little flock is not to fear.<a name=183:15></a> When it becomes large and outwardly self-sustaining, then there is good reason to fear, but whilst it retains simplicity, outward littleness, unpretentiousness, there is nothing to fear, for the Lord will defend and protect it.<a name=183:16></a> In the Acts we read that Saul ravaged the assembly; he entered into houses and dragged men and women and hailed them to prison and to death.<a name=183:17></a> But then, in the next chapter, it says, "Saul, breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:1">Acts  9:1</a>.<a name=183:18></a> However few and defenceless the disciples were outwardly, they were the Lord's, and who can contend successfully with Him.<a name=183:19></a> No one !<a name=183:20></a> And so Saul was levelled to the ground; the Lord in His grace intercepted him.<a name=183:21></a> If we accept outward littleness, we come under the wing of the Lord, and every opposer goes down.<a name=183:22></a> It

		I select John to begin with because he speaks much of the work of God.<a name=200:2></a> You will find that the word 'work' is employed more frequently by him than by any of the evangelists, for the reason that he would bring forward what would subsist if what was outward gave way; the work of God stands.<a name=200:3></a> So the Lord calls attention to it throughout, and indeed, the evangelist mentions not only the fact of God's work, but he constantly refers to the effect of it and brings in a very practical word in chapter 3, "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:21">John  3:21</a>.<a name=200:4></a> The Holy Spirit throughout enlarges on the work of God and the evidence of it.<a name=200:5></a>

		You will recall that at the end of chapter 4 when the Lord had accomplished miracles, relieving all kinds of need, a crowd gathered about Him; and it is well to remember that a crowd is not a divine thought.<a name=201:3></a> The divine thought is an <i>assembly</i>; that is to say, a body in which each member recognises mutual obligation, and in which indeed there is a common ground on which all the members stand in relation to Him who is Head of it.<a name=201:4></a> So the apostle says in dealing with the subject of the assembly: "I speak as to intelligent persons", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:15">1 Corinthians  10:15</a>.<a name=201:5></a> One does not necessarily need to be intelligent to form part of a crowd, nor is there the idea of responsibility attached to a crowd, whereas God would give us to understand that responsibility attaches to each one whilst he remains here in this world as set in the assembly; the cherubim is, so to say, on the curtains.<a name=201:6></a> God has rights in regard to each one.<a name=201:7></a> The veil, as we all know, represents Christ as in manhood, and nothing can be more interesting than to trace the cherubim in His blessed life here on earth.<a name=201:8></a> I do not intend to trace it now, but if you read the gospels you will find how perfectly it is seen.<a name=201:9></a> The curtains, also, made of the same material as the veil, had the cherubim.<a name=201:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 19 we see the effect of the testimony in a public way, in chapter 20 we see the circle of the saints who are affected by this testimony, therefore we see the activity of love.<a name=225:7></a> Love is saintward here; it is a proof that there was love towards Christ; love one to another is evidence of love to Christ.<a name=225:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle's embrace is suggestive of the love of Christ, and their embracing him, in falling on his neck, showed how much they loved the Lord.<a name=225:9></a> If we see these features here we can understand the Lord's remark to the assembly at Ephesus: "thou hast left thy first love" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:4">Revelation  2:4</a>; although this did not all happen at Ephesus.<a name=225:10></a>

		It is obvious that the assembly in Philadelphia had love like it in character; "first love" is marital.<a name=226:7></a> It is like that spoken of in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:2">Jeremiah  2:2</a>, "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown".<a name=226:8></a> It is love developed in a <i>known relationship</i>.<a name=226:9></a> The love of the assembly for Christ is a love developed in the knowledge of union.<a name=226:10></a>

		We get both unity and union in Ephesians.<a name=235:1></a> Would you say what is the difference?<a name=235:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Unity is taught in this chapter; union in chapter 2.<a name=235:3></a> The word 'union', although a very much used word, and a right one, and expressive of the truth, is not itself found in Scripture; but the thought of it is in Scripture and is indicated in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, reminding us that it was a great thought with God before sin came in.<a name=235:4></a> The necessity for unity arose as a consequence of sin.<a name=235:5></a> The testimony of unity came out in Israel, but not union.<a name=235:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes.<a name=235:9></a> It was never brought about, it <i>existed</i>.<a name=235:10></a> "God is one"; that truth came out to meet divided conditions.<a name=235:11></a> It is expressed in God Himself, therefore it takes character from Him.<a name=235:12></a> Conditions in creation deviated from the divine thought; in the physical universe things remained in accord.<a name=235:13></a> As to what was said as to the effect of sin, we see in a parallel way that righteousness and holiness ever existed with God, but they came out as the answer to sin, and eternal life is revealed to meet conditions which came in through death.<a name=235:14></a> As exigencies arise things are met.<a name=235:15></a> These things ever existed in the Godhead, and they are set out in view of things here.<a name=235:16></a> The testimony of unity among the brethren is seen in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>and is that which is reached in Israel.<a name=235:17></a> It is seen in the loaf, too, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>.<a name=235:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of Christianity implies that we are brought together in spiritual affection.<a name=236:5></a> In this epistle unity is the state in which we are reconciled.<a name=236:6></a> Jew and Gentile are reconciled "<i>in one body</i> by the cross"; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:16">Ephesians  2:16</a>.<a name=236:7></a> Unity is a bond of peace; the Holy Spirit in developing spiritual affections tends to unite in a bond.<a name=236:8></a> You and I love one another; that brings about peace; there is a bond in that.<a name=236:9></a>

		The unity of the Spirit is never local; the Spirit dwells in all.<a name=236:18></a> The bearing of Ephesians is universal; Jew and Gentile are brought together; "that he might form the two in himself into one new man, making peace", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:15">Ephesians  2:15</a>.<a name=236:19></a> That is how <i>peace</i> is brought about; it is not effected politically.<a name=236:20></a> The <i>new man</i> is a creation and there is only <i>one</i> new man.<a name=236:21></a> That creation which included all the saints must of necessity bring about unity.<a name=236:22></a> "And might reconcile both in one body to

		What I have to say is particularly to call attention to the effect of John's ministry.<a name=256:1></a> As you will recall, he begins his gospel with life and ends it with life, the last chapter being an appendix.<a name=256:2></a> He begins, after introducing the Lord as to His deity, with the statement, "In him was life; and the life was the light of men"; and ends with the statement that the signs were written that the saints "might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing they might have life in his name", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a>.<a name=256:3></a> If life is the light, it is clear that it is to produce life.<a name=256:4></a> We can take account of the sun as ruling, which is Matthew's point of view, but we can also take account of it as a life-giver.<a name=256:5></a> Without it I suppose there would be no life, animal or vegetable, on the earth, so that John is astronomical in his remarks in the setting of his gospel; not from the governmental, or, as I might call it, cherubic aspect, but rather from the seraphic.<a name=256:6></a> That is, he would bring in <i>living</i> creatures.<a name=256:7></a> You will remember that in Revelation there are four "living creatures" whose employ is the celebration of the holiness of Him who sits upon the throne, and they recognise that for His pleasure all things were created.<a name=256:8></a> The living creatures recognise that and celebrate it: "For thy pleasure they are and were created", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:11">Revelation  4:11</a>.<a name=256:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in speaking of John being, in that way, seraphic, as I venture to do, one cannot refrain from saying a word about Matthew, who may be regarded as cherubic.<a name=256:10></a> It has been on my mind that the one word that spells the need of the world today is <i>government</i>.<a name=256:11></a> In the ordering of things before sin came in God spoke of government, that Adam was to

		Noah, alas!<a name=257:11></a> quickly shows that he is unable to govern himself; but God holds to His thought, so He, "the God of glory", appears to Abraham.<a name=257:12></a> I am not quoting from Genesis, but from Stephen, a man who spoke as full of the Holy Spirit.<a name=257:13></a> He says, "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:2">Acts  7:2</a> and I connect that just briefly with another beautiful expression in the New Testament; "the cherubim of glory", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:5">Hebrews  9:5</a>.<a name=257:14></a> I venture to say that the glory of God, the maintenance and preservation of it here on earth, and indeed in the whole universe, depends on the cherubim of glory.<a name=257:15></a> "The cherubim of glory", says the writer to the Hebrews, "shadowing the mercy seat".<a name=257:16></a> Those holy eyes were looking down on

		J.T.<a name=273:1></a> Going back to the beginning, the day of Pentecost was the great start; much light was vouchsafed there; the Holy Spirit came down from the Lord, who, we are told in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, had been made by God both Lord and Christ; prominence, as you will notice, being given to His title as Lord.<a name=273:2></a> Lordship has to do with subjugation; whereas the anointing has to do more with what had to be effected for God.<a name=273:3></a> The truth of the Christ involves what God would do, and it came out more in Paul, because through him things were brought to light that answer to the mind of God.<a name=273:4></a> But the first great thing was subjugation.<a name=273:5></a> The Lord having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, shed it forth; and the result was that those who were converted, continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, breaking of bread, and prayers.<a name=273:6></a> That is to say, they recognised the authority of the Lord, and there was subjection to Him.<a name=273:7></a> That, I think, was the chief feature after the coming in of the Spirit.<a name=273:8></a> There was unity of affection, too, they had all things in common.<a name=273:9></a> The assembly being formed, the Lord could add to it.<a name=273:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=310:3></a> We continued the consideration of the Ark of the covenant, viewing it as in <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#6">Joshua  6</a>.<a name=310:4></a> It is seen there as carried by the priests round the city of Jericho.<a name=310:5></a> The Lord appeared at that juncture in a new way; that is, He appeared to Joshua militarily, announcing Himself as Captain of the Host of Jehovah; so that he was to understand that what was to ensue was warfare.<a name=310:6></a> The Lord Jesus is typically seen as leading in the conflict; the form it should take would be the carrying of the Ark and the sounding of the blast-trumpets.<a name=310:7></a> On the one hand, the testimony is sounded out, and on the other the Lord Jesus is seen in His power.<a name=310:8></a> So that, as it is said in 2 Corinthians, strongholds were brought down, and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God.<a name=310:9></a> The world and its teachers are overcome by faith in the testimony that was rendered by the apostles in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that the saints can enter on their own portion, the portion which God purposed for them.<a name=310:10></a> On the one hand, strongholds were brought down, while on the other, the whole counsel of God was declared.<a name=310:11></a> Thus, Christianity was set up.<a name=310:12></a> It was pointed out that what the apostles in that way effected by their testimony was to be maintained by the saints.<a name=310:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What we have before us now is another side of the truth; that is, what is brought about for God through the Ark.<a name=310:14></a> What we have had before us so far is connected with what is for us.<a name=310:15></a> The Ark, for instance, went to find a resting place for the people; but then there is the other side, namely, a resting

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=311:6></a> Joshua is the military side, bringing down the world power through the testimony, so that the people might enter upon the inheritance.<a name=311:7></a> There is an inheritance among the sanctified, proposed in the gospel.<a name=311:8></a> But then there is also God's inheritance.<a name=311:9></a> His heritage is His people.<a name=311:10></a> And I think that David and Solomon taken together bring in the people in connection with the Ark.<a name=311:11></a> All Israel brought up the Ark, it says here; <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#15:28">1 Chronicles  15:28</a>.<a name=311:12></a> They were all in the movement to bring the Ark to Zion; they are in this respect secured for God.<a name=311:13></a> The gospels have to be taken account of in that way; each gospel sets out some particular feature for God, whether it be in Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John.<a name=311:14></a>

		E.M.<a name=325:1></a> Why does the apostle address the Corinthians in this way: "I speak as to intelligent persons?<a name=325:2></a>" Would it be that he desired to gain them by writing in a courteous way?<a name=325:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=325:4></a> I think he addressed them in what we may call an abstract way.<a name=325:5></a> You take account of the saints in that way.<a name=325:6></a> The principle of intelligence was there, because they had the Holy Spirit; and I think there is also an appeal to them in it.<a name=325:7></a> So we ask ourselves the question, What have I been marked by?<a name=325:8></a> By intelligence?<a name=325:9></a> One is pulled up when addressed thus.<a name=325:10></a> Then what Paul was about to say depended upon their intelligence.<a name=325:11></a> He says, "Purge out .<a name=325:12></a>.<a name=325:13></a>.<a name=325:14></a> the old leaven that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened;" abstractly they were unleavened.<a name=325:15></a> I refer to this as a parallel passage.<a name=325:16></a>

		I have before me to speak about <i>preparedness</i>, and I have selected these two verses to begin with because they show that the work of the Spirit in the assembly has brought about this state in her.<a name=448:1></a> She <i>has made</i> herself ready, it is said; not that she is <i>making</i> herself ready, but she has done it.<a name=448:2></a> This is in keeping with John's presentation of the truth, who shows that certain assured results accrue from the Spirit's work.<a name=448:3></a> Whatever may have come in since Pentecost, the work of the Spirit asserts itself at the end.<a name=448:4></a> That is, what is required is available.<a name=448:5></a> The Lamb's wife, the marriage time having come, has made herself ready.<a name=448:6></a> The work is completed, and the Lord, having this in mind, no doubt by way of contrast, said to Sardis, "I have not found thy works complete before my God".<a name=448:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They may have appeared to have been complete before men; careful organisation and establishment of state churches and confessions of faith may have seemed to indicate a certain completeness, that certain finished products were there, but the Lord says, "I have not found thy works complete before my God".<a name=448:8></a> It is what is before God that is taken into account, so it all the more enhances what is said here of the Lamb's wife, that <i>she has made herself ready</i>.<a name=448:9></a> The thing is done, and so I would refer for a moment, before turning to other scriptures to elucidate what I have to say, to the fact that in the apostle Paul we have suggestions by the way, so that the saints should be kept on the move in regard to readiness.<a name=448:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, I would refer to a passage in the first letter to Corinth, the last chapter, in which in speaking of collections, Paul directs that each should lay

		<a name=449>[Page 449]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		by at home as God prospered him, "that there may be no collections when I come" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:2">1 Corinthians  16:2</a>; the thing should be all ready.<a name=449:1></a> That is, suggestions of that kind check in us our disposition to procrastinate in regard to righteous obligations.<a name=449:2></a> They remind us, like signposts, that a <i>great coming</i> is imminent, a coming of One greater than Paul, and that we should be ready.<a name=449:3></a> So he says, "that there may be no collections when I come".<a name=449:4></a> It would be a poor thing to be taking up a collection when <i>Paul</i> was present.<a name=449:5></a> So the Lord will look for fulfilled obligations when He comes.<a name=449:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing to Timothy the apostle refers to his coming: "These things I write to thee", he says, "but if I delay in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself <i>in God's house</i>", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:14">1 Timothy  3:14</a> - 15.<a name=449:7></a> That surely is an important word for us all.<a name=449:8></a> And he says further to Timothy, "Till I come give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:13">1 Timothy  4:13</a>.<a name=449:9></a> Not <i>when</i> I come, but <i>till</i> I come.<a name=449:10></a> I mention this because they are, as I said, reminders by the way in the great apostle that the saints should be in continuous readiness, and if your behaviour in the house is not right you will not be ready.<a name=449:11></a> And if you do not read you will not be ready.<a name=449:12></a> "Give attendance", he says, "to reading".<a name=449:13></a> There is great neglect of reading and hence a very unsuitable state in the saints.<a name=449:14></a> <i>Reading</i> here, no doubt, refers to service among the saints, coupled with exhortation and doctrine.<a name=449:15></a>

		Well now, having mentioned that as regards the apostle, I turn to a scripture that will perhaps lead us to what I want to come to, if the Lord help me, in Colossians and Ephesians.<a name=449:16></a> These epistles afford the most delightful areas for ministry, as for the saints, but I want to turn now for the moment to the prophet Hosea, chapter 11.<a name=449:17></a> "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt".<a name=449:18></a> I want to show from this prophet how God leads on His people with a view to the great result that He has

		I have been thinking of the expression, "God is with us", in this section; it is the meaning of the word "Immanuel", and it is the name introduced in Matthew, which bears on the testimony of the assembly, especially in remnant days.<a name=462:1></a> I trust we may be able to see that the presence of God is as realisable today as it was at the beginning, and that it is dependent on the principles that God introduced being maintained.<a name=462:2></a> These principles may be likened to the "little city" in Ecclesiastes.<a name=462:3></a> From the very outset of God's dealings with man He had introduced principles, but these principles have always been attacked by Satan.<a name=462:4></a> A great king, we are told, came up against the city, but there was there the poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#9:14">Ecclesiastes  9:14</a>, 15.<a name=462:5></a> So I thought that in this section we may see how the presence of the Lord may be realised here in connection with the maintenance of divine principles as already existing -- "the law and the testimony"; they were to be bound up and sealed among His disciples.<a name=462:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It says, "Jesus, having turned and seeing them following" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:38">John  1:38</a>), that is to say, they were already on the way of discipleship; they were leaving one master for another, and He says to them, "What seek ye?<a name=463:11></a>" and they said to Him, "Rabbi".<a name=463:12></a> Then the Holy Spirit tells us what that means, so that we might have no doubt about it; it means "teacher", showing that this was the point.<a name=463:13></a> The passage in John is to that effect.<a name=463:14></a> The first followers of Jesus were on the line of instruction.<a name=463:15></a> In following they were qualifying to be instructed, to be disciples; they were moved by the effect of John's testimony.<a name=463:16></a> It was when the Lord saw them following that He asked them what they sought, as if there were something there already that qualified them, and they say, "Rabbi .<a name=463:17></a>.<a name=463:18></a>.<a name=463:19></a> where abidest thou?<a name=463:20></a>" They not only wanted to be instructed, but they wanted to know where He abode, they wanted to learn from Him there, no doubt.<a name=463:21></a>

		Then there is another child of which mention is made, his name meaning that judgment should come, that God would deal governmentally, and the remnant must necessarily share in the governmental dealings of God.<a name=465:3></a> That we are not immune from the government of God is a very important thing for Christians to note, but there is a way out of that, and that is in laying hold of the fact that Immanuel has come, that the instrument of God's judgment can only go so far; it may come up to "the neck", but it is "Immanuel's land".<a name=465:4></a> Any one who interferes with God's rights in His people He will cause to halt; saints see that, and take advantage of it, and say, "God is with us".<a name=465:5></a>
