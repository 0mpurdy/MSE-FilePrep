		My intention is to present kingship as it is seen in Christ, and I believe it is brought before us in these four scriptures.<a name=1:4></a> I think it is necessary to present this subject, on account of the general trend towards lawlessness in the world, and also on account of the negligence of the saints with regard to the commandments of the Lord.<a name=1:5></a> The apostle Paul said that he was "legitimately subject to Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:21">1 Corinthians  9:21</a>), and that the proof of spirituality is seen in that we recognise the things that he wrote to the Corinthians as being "the Lord's commandment", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>.<a name=1:6></a> "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment".<a name=1:7></a>

		-- Our subject this morning was the kingdom as it is presented to us in Christ, when He said to Pilate that He was born to be King.<a name=7:1></a> We considered Melchisedec, Moses and David, as illustrations of what the king is and of the kingly office which is presented to us perfectly in Christ.<a name=7:2></a> In virtue of the position of Christians with relation to the King, the kingly features seen in Christ ought to be reproduced in us.<a name=7:3></a> It is not merely a question of the position and office which they involve, but of moral power which accompanies the one and the other, so that we learn to act in a manner suitable to the King.<a name=7:4></a> In the book of Proverbs, we see how this moral power is developed in the kingdom.<a name=7:5></a> The four things that have a stately step are presented to us in the order in which they are reproduced in the Christian.<a name=7:6></a> The lion represents the believer who has been made courageous, so that he confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord.<a name=7:7></a> The smallest believer in Christ does not fear opposition.<a name=7:8></a> The lion "turneth not away for any".<a name=7:9></a> It is in this way that kingly features begin to show themselves by this courage in face of opposition.<a name=7:10></a> Then there is the war-horse.<a name=7:11></a> The lion does not fear opposition, but a war-horse goes forward to attack.<a name=7:12></a> "He goeth forth to meet the armed host .<a name=7:13></a>.<a name=7:14></a>.<a name=7:15></a> neither turneth he back from before the sword .<a name=7:16></a>.<a name=7:17></a>.<a name=7:18></a> .<a name=7:19></a> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage, and cannot contain himself at the sound of the trumpet: At the noise of the trumpets he saith, Aha!<a name=7:20></a> and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting" <a href="../bible/Job.htm#39">Job  39</a>.<a name=7:21></a>

		On this occasion I should like to speak of wisdom and bring out how wisdom appears in the presence of apostasy and the antichristian rebellion.<a name=60:1></a> The epistle of James specially distinguishes between the wisdom which comes down from above and earthly wisdom.<a name=60:2></a> We shall see both exemplified in the second book of Samuel; but for the moment we are going to be occupied with the wisdom which comes down from above.<a name=60:3></a> It is this wisdom that normally characterises Christians, who are indeed children of wisdom, as the Lord Jesus Himself said, "Wisdom has been justified of all her children" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:35">Luke  7:35</a>.<a name=60:4></a> And in which epoch of the history of the people of God has there been a greater need of wisdom than at present?<a name=60:5></a> We have come to the days of antichrist.<a name=60:6></a> John says, "According as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is the last hour" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:18">1 John  2:18</a>.<a name=60:7></a> An "hour" indicates a crisis; the last hour is an hour of trial; wherefore it is necessary to have wisdom from above.<a name=60:8></a> And James says, "If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not, and it shall be given to him" <a href="../bible/James.htm#1:5">James  1:5</a>.<a name=60:9></a> Now you can see how the matter stands in Scripture.<a name=60:10></a> There is a very special emphasis on wisdom.<a name=60:11></a> In Daniel it says, "The wicked shall do wickedly", (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12:10">Daniel  12:10</a>) and that is all we can expect from them; whatever modification there might be in this world, the wicked will do wickedly; then it says, "None of the wicked shall understand" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12:10">Daniel  12:10</a>); they are outside divine understanding, and have not wisdom.<a name=60:12></a> "But the wise shall understand" <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12:10">Daniel  12:10</a>.<a name=60:13></a> "And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the

		I have in mind to say a few words on the subject of a model.<a name=77:1></a> I need not say that Christ is the Model.<a name=77:2></a> I believe that, from the outset, God has worked in relation to a model.<a name=77:3></a> In the creation of Adam, God had a model before Him; and Adam typified Him who was to come.<a name=77:4></a> The principle comes to light particularly in relation to moral and spiritual things.<a name=77:5></a> It does not speak of a Model when it is a matter of the physical creation.<a name=77:6></a> Nevertheless, it is written that the worlds were framed by the word of God.<a name=77:7></a> His word was the expression of what was in His mind; there was the divine plan of this world.<a name=77:8></a> No natural man can even understand that.<a name=77:9></a> By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God.<a name=77:10></a> Men who have not faith may give themselves up to speculations, but they do it to their own cost and they never arrive at a right thought of the physical universe.<a name=77:11></a> Only by faith can we apprehend that it was framed by the word of God.<a name=77:12></a> Those who know God are interested in what comes from His word.<a name=77:13></a> We recognise the things that are made as representing a spiritual order of things; the invisible things of Him are seen in the things created, His eternal power and His divinity.<a name=77:14></a> These things are laid hold of by the mind of the believer, but on the principle of faith.<a name=77:15></a>

		When we come to things which concern the moral universe, God is careful to show that on this point He has always had a model before Him.<a name=77:16></a> For example, Moses was taken by God on to the mountain, and during forty days God made His model pass before Moses.<a name=77:17></a> During forty days he neither ate nor drank, so that he was ready to receive and understand

		-- I intend to pursue the subject we had this afternoon.<a name=125:1></a> At the close of our meeting, we were occupied with Gideon's present.<a name=125:2></a> We remarked that he had by him the means of presenting an offering to God; he brought a kid and unleavened cakes.<a name=125:3></a> These things speak to us of the Lord Jesus Christ, as Man on earth, presented to God; the kid as being slain and presented speaks to us of the Lord put to death, and the broth relates to what He was essentially as known to God, and in a certain measure, to the believer; the ephah of flour, that is to say, a measured portion of flour, speaks to us of His perfect humanity, and Gideon was accepted in the value of these offerings -- the one would be the burnt-offering and the other the oblation.<a name=125:4></a> We were led to contemplate the priestly features in Gideon, for no brother, and no sister, can have power with men before having power with God.<a name=125:5></a> But there was still something lacking in Gideon's instruction: he did not know God revealed in love.<a name=125:6></a>

		1 Corinthians 11:17 - 34
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- The desire of the brethren is that we should have a reading.<a name=201:1></a> At Valence we were occupied with the first epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=201:2></a> I was thinking that it would be good to pursue the consideration of that book, and to speak of the Lord's supper in chapter 11: we will read verses 17 to 34.<a name=201:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yesterday, in our consideration of this subject, we referred to chapter 10, verse 15 and onwards, as treating of the fellowship.<a name=201:4></a> It speaks of the cup of the Lord's supper as being the communion of the blood of the Christ, and it is said of the bread that it is the communion of the body of the Christ.<a name=201:5></a> The bearing of chapter 10 refers to our conduct every day of the week.<a name=201:6></a> Chapter 11 gives us light as being gathered together in assembly.<a name=201:7></a> In chapter 10, we are to be consistent with the fellowship.<a name=201:8></a> In our daily life we are responsible to be consistent with the death of the Lord; and the bread, in the Lord's supper, represents not only Christ's body, but all saints.<a name=201:9></a> We are therefore responsible towards all the saints, in our daily life.<a name=201:10></a> It says that, "we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:17">1 Corinthians  10:17</a>.<a name=201:11></a> So, as partaking of the bread, we are responsible to be consistent with the death of Christ; and we are responsible, not only to Him, but to all the saints.<a name=201:12></a> We must therefore be ready, if need be, to give account of our behaviour to the saints.<a name=201:13></a> To stress that principle, Paul says again, "Ye cannot drink the Lord's cup, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the Lord's table, and of the table of demons" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:21">1 Corinthians  10:21</a>.<a name=201:14></a> If we make light of these instructions, the Lord will have something to say to us as to it.<a name=201:15></a> So it says, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?<a name=201:16></a>

		-- In our reading yesterday afternoon we read part of chapter 11.<a name=215:1></a> We considered the question of fellowship and the Lord's supper.<a name=215:2></a> We remarked that the celebration of the feast of unleavened bread, spoken of in chapter 5, preserves us from being inflated.<a name=215:3></a> Leaven is what inflates.<a name=215:4></a> Unless we celebrate the feast of unleavened bread, we shall be selfish.<a name=215:5></a> In such circumstances, the part that we might take in the assembly will have in view our personal importance, while the unleavened bread is intended to keep us humble, and we can thus consider others as better than ourselves.<a name=215:6></a> It says that at Corinth, when they came together, certain were taking their own supper before others.<a name=215:7></a> The one who was doing that was not considering the others; he was selfish.<a name=215:8></a> As we were saying yesterday, we have not, in our days, the gross things spoken of in that chapter; but nevertheless, it might be that a brother only thinks of himself, not taking account of others, in the part that he takes in the assembly.<a name=215:9></a> So it says, at the end of the chapter "When ye come together to eat, wait for one another" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:33">1 Corinthians  11:33</a>.<a name=215:10></a> Waiting for one another implies consideration for one another.<a name=215:11></a> If I wait for my brethren, I give them liberty, and they have opportunity to take part.<a name=215:12></a> If each one is governed by this principle of waiting for one another, each one will also be able to act.<a name=215:13></a> Being freed from ourselves, and delivered from our own importance, the Lord's supper has its voice to remind us that the Lord Jesus devoted Himself for us even to death.<a name=215:14></a> So there is developed what we learn in chapter 12.<a name=215:15></a> The members function in their relative place; and there are no divisions in the body.<a name=215:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has made particular use of the evangelist Luke in this regard.<a name=227:2></a> He lays emphasis on method, on order and on furnishing.<a name=227:3></a> The passage we have read relates the fact that it was the Lord Himself who had the thought of preparation for the passover.<a name=227:4></a> In Matthew and Mark, the thought arises with the disciples.<a name=227:5></a> It is a true sign of exercise before God, when we are exercised with regard to preparation and furnishing in relation to the service of God.<a name=227:6></a> Luke has in mind the vessel of service.<a name=227:7></a> So he begins his gospel with the presentation of Zacharias and Elizabeth, who were both of the priestly family.<a name=227:8></a> It says of Zacharias that he was serving God according to the order of the priesthood; "he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:8">Luke  1:8</a>.<a name=227:9></a> Then, we have the angel Gabriel, who must have been very well acquainted with divine order in heaven.<a name=227:10></a> Without doubt he had had his part in the celebration of praise, when the foundations of the earth were laid.<a name=227:11></a> It says that at that time "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy" <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>.<a name=227:12></a> The "sons of God" spoken of in the book of Job, are angels.<a name=227:13></a> So, in carrying out his service, Gabriel would have had in mind that order of things in which God is praised.<a name=227:14></a> He appeared to Zacharias in the temple.<a name=227:15></a> Then he appeared to Mary.<a name=227:16></a> Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth, as well as Mary, unite in a tribute of praise at the beginning of Luke's gospel.<a name=227:17></a>

		disciples who had most intelligence and experience to prepare it.<a name=229:1></a> The importance of the preparation was such that He chose these two principal apostles.<a name=229:2></a> We may therefore learn from that what importance attaches to these external things, and see how necessary order and spiritual furnishing are in the mind of God.<a name=229:3></a> We may say that that is in view throughout the epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=229:4></a> The apostle refers to commandments, to directions, and to customs, and he makes it clear that he had not mentioned everything in the letter, because he says, "But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:34">1 Corinthians  11:34</a>.<a name=229:5></a> Further, he refers elsewhere to Ephesus, saying that he had left Timotheus there that he might set in order certain things; and in writing to the Colossians, he says that he rejoiced, seeing their order.<a name=229:6></a> The details of which the apostle speaks are so minute that he is even occupied with the necessity that a woman should have her head covered; he appeals to nature to teach these principles.<a name=229:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, the Lord sent Peter and John to prepare: "Go and prepare the passover for us".<a name=229:8></a> And it says, "And having gone they found it as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover".<a name=229:9></a> We may be assured, dear brethren, that they omitted nothing of what the celebration of the passover for our Lord Himself required.<a name=229:10></a> Then we see that the place of the preparation was to be "a large upper room".<a name=229:11></a> It was a <i>large</i> room, an <i>upper</i> room, and it was <i>furnished</i>.<a name=229:12></a> The largeness of the room suggests the increase that the Lord contemplated.<a name=229:13></a> He was indicating beforehand that the apostles were to be prepared for many conversions.<a name=229:14></a> These converts were not to remain without a home, and the largeness of their number was not to occasion any uneasiness, any embarrassment.<a name=229:15></a> So we find that after Peter's first preaching, on the day of Pentecost, a large number of persons were converted; and the Holy Spirit tells us that

		David had been reminded of the divine claims in a very serious manner, when he placed the ark of God upon a cart; in the thirteenth chapter it says that "they carried the ark of God on a new cart" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#13:7">1 Chronicles  13:7</a>); then it says that "the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he had put forth his hand to the ark" <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#13:10">1 Chronicles  13:10</a>.<a name=233:1></a> The oxen had stumbled, and he had put forth his hand to hold the ark.<a name=233:2></a> It was a, solemn warning to David, that God took great account of the furnishing.<a name=233:3></a> And we find, in chapter 15, that David "<i>prepared</i> a place for the ark of God, and <i>spread</i> a tent for it".<a name=233:4></a> Then he said, "None <i>ought</i> to carry the ark of God but the Levites, for them has Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God, and to serve him for ever".<a name=233:5></a> We see that David had profited by the severe discipline occasioned by the death of Uzza.<a name=233:6></a> This is for us, dear brethren, that we may not neglect the divine principles and divine customs that ought to characterise us in the service of God.<a name=233:7></a> So it says that "David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place that he had prepared for it.<a name=233:8></a> And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites".<a name=233:9></a> We see how David had understood what Jehovah had done to Uzza, and how he had profited by it.<a name=233:10></a> He sees that the ark can only be carried by the Levites.<a name=233:11></a> From this point of view the Levites are in effect priests.<a name=233:12></a> So in our days, God would assemble the sons of Aaron and the Levites.<a name=233:13></a> The ministry of John introduces the family; but the ministry of Paul, supported by Luke, introduces the priestly order.<a name=233:14></a> As possessing the Spirit, we must know that we have to do with the service of God; and the apostle says, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>.<a name=233:15></a> There is therefore an appeal to the saints; we are to have part in the service of God, and the

		J.T.<a name=302:1></a> For those who were not at our meeting last evening, it may be remarked that we dwelt on the earlier part of this chapter, fixing our minds on the house from which the Lord departed, as recorded in the first verse; that it had allusion to the then accepted religious system of the world, viewed as in its family or social features; a 'house' suggesting what relates to family and social affairs.<a name=302:2></a> The Lord left that house, the features of which were laid bare in chapter 12.<a name=302:3></a> And it may be remarked further that He sat down "by the sea" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:1">Matthew  13:1</a>) -- not that He intended to remain by the sea, but to indicate that He had taken up <i>another</i> position, which had a wide bearing, the sea denoting access to the Gentile world.<a name=302:4></a> I thought that tonight we might consider the question asked in verse 36, and what developed from it.<a name=302:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=302:9></a> Yes; as you were remarking in prayer, the Lord indicates those who should be in family relation with Him, and that family relation must find its place in the second house into which He entered "whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:50">Matthew  12:50</a>.<a name=302:10></a> The second house into which He entered must include those who are in family relationship with Him, based on the doing the will of His Father who is in heaven.<a name=302:11></a>

		I am thinking at this time, dear brethren, about sonship, and how it appears in difficult days such as these in which our lot is cast; and so I have taken up these passages in Matthew that we may see how sonship is presented in this evangelist, as bearing on the assembly; that is, how it may bear in a collective way, how sons were together.<a name=314:1></a> And I may remark, here, that it is as sons that we shall be together in heaven.<a name=314:2></a> It is indeed involved in the hope of our calling.<a name=314:3></a> We have to understand <i>God's</i> calling, and we have to understand <i>our</i> calling; as we have to understand God's inheritance, and our inheritance.<a name=314:4></a> Our calling is involved in sonship, so that as sons we shall be together.<a name=314:5></a> Unless we learn the relationship now, we shall not cherish our calling, for it implies what we shall be.<a name=314:6></a> The wise man in Proverbs speaks of his desire rather "It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman, and a house in common" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:24">Proverbs  25:24</a>.<a name=314:7></a> We have thus to learn how to discriminate in regard to living companions; how to dwell in a most inconvenient, uncomfortable place, physically, rather than to be in contentious companionship.<a name=314:8></a> The book of Proverbs bears on the assembly; and what I refer to is one of the maxims that may be put down by each of us as of first-rate importance.<a name=314:9></a> Christians, of all others, are intended to be very discriminating in the choice of living companions.<a name=314:10></a>

		I wish now to show briefly in closing, from Malachi, how all this fits into a day of small things.<a name=323:13></a> Matthew 18 treats of the assembly; that is to say, it treats of the spirit in which we regard and deal with one another as in the assembly of God.<a name=323:14></a> The Lord speaks of the assembly as the final court of appeal: "If thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone .<a name=323:15></a>.<a name=323:16></a>.<a name=323:17></a> if he do not hear thee, take with thee one or two besides .<a name=323:18></a>.<a name=323:19></a>.<a name=323:20></a> But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:15">Matthew  18:15</a> - 17.<a name=323:21></a> The man that refuses to hear the assembly is treated

		as unfit for fellowship.<a name=324:1></a> "Let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer".<a name=324:2></a> Such is the greatness of the assembly, and such the solemnity of refusing to hear it.<a name=324:3></a> But then He says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>.<a name=324:4></a> And then He goes on to say, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>, That is to say, in these last words He makes provision for a day of small things; He speaks of "two", and then of "two or three".<a name=324:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show that this great principle of sonship works out in a collective way in a day of small things.<a name=324:6></a> In Malachi we have reference, in a general way, to God and His servants; in chapter 3 we read, "Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes, and have not kept them" <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:7">Malachi  3:7</a>.<a name=324:7></a> Then in verse 13, "Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but ye say, What have we been speaking against thee?<a name=324:8></a> Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts" <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:13">Malachi  3:13</a>.<a name=324:9></a> That is to say, they are disregarding the service of God; for them there is no profit in it.<a name=324:10></a> It is a dreadful state of things that Malachi depicts.<a name=324:11></a> And, mark you, he is dealing, not with the mass of Israel, but with the returned remnant.<a name=324:12></a> Decay had set in even in these; God's word was disregarded, and His service disregarded; there was no profit in it.<a name=324:13></a> One looks abroad now in nominal Christendom, and sees the difficulty they experience to keep things going; spirituality is waning, dying out; men who will serve God are scarce.<a name=324:14></a>

		I need not enlarge on that, beloved friends, in regard to Christ; how John presents Him as becoming flesh, and dwelling "among us"; he says, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>.<a name=328:11></a> He saw Him in relation to the Father.<a name=328:12></a> And again He says, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>.<a name=328:13></a> He is in the bosom of the Father!<a name=328:14></a> That is to say, Christ is in the heart of God.<a name=328:15></a> He was loved before the foundation of the world, it says (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:24">John  17:24</a>); but John alludes to Him as become flesh, and that He is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=328:16></a> Thus the whole problem to be worked out in hearts begins in the heart of God.<a name=328:17></a> The One who declares God is in His bosom.<a name=328:18></a> At His baptism we have the announcement from heaven, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:11">Mark  1:11</a>.<a name=328:19></a> It is as if God had been looking for it, and now He has found it in Him.<a name=328:20></a> Again on the mount of Transfiguration the announcement is made, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:5">Matthew  17:5</a>.<a name=328:21></a> God thus shows the kind of Man that had found a

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so David makes it a statute in Israel: "as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike".<a name=334:2></a> Mark you, he dignifies them; he does not call them weak ones, though that is what they were; he credits them with abiding by the stuff.<a name=334:3></a> And so it may be with fathers having something in their care, or mothers looking after little ones -- whatever is legitimate -- so the word applies if they cannot go.<a name=334:4></a> But, if any could go, and would not -- that makes a very great difference.<a name=334:5></a> God knows which.<a name=334:6></a> Whatever the spoil -- and there is spoil where the people of God are moving on by the Spirit -- whatever the spoil, you get your share; and the Scripture says the statute remains unto this day; whatever the date of the writing of the book, that statute was recognised by the Spirit of God; it remained; I hope it does with us!<a name=334:7></a>

		Well, the next great principle is in 2 Samuel 1, and it is in keeping with this.<a name=334:8></a> What you will observe is that David is at Ziklag; that is to say, he is in the sphere where this statute was formulated, and he is going to add to it; he is building up a code of principles, involving a right spirit; a spirit cultivated by the epistle to the Romans, and other epistles, a spirit by which we overcome evil with good.<a name=334:9></a> That is the spirit.<a name=334:10></a> And so David was at Ziklag; and on the third day a messenger comes to him, thinking that he was bringing good news for him, that is to say, good news for the flesh.<a name=334:11></a> (The flesh is always at cross purposes with the Spirit, however amiable and philanthropic it may be.<a name=334:12></a>) David, the spiritual man, said to him, "Whence comest thou?<a name=334:13></a> And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.<a name=334:14></a> And David said to him, What has taken place?<a name=334:15></a> I pray thee, tell me" <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#1:3">2 Samuel  1:3</a>,4.<a name=334:16></a> And then the messenger

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what David sets up here.<a name=335:7></a> He sets an example.<a name=335:8></a> His enemy, bitter to the last degree, was slain, but David is above that; he is not thinking of the malice of Saul; he is thinking of God.<a name=335:9></a> How this bears him above the malice of the flesh!<a name=335:10></a> He recites his feelings, they were from his heart.<a name=335:11></a> Saul and Jonathan!<a name=335:12></a> he grieved for them.<a name=335:13></a> Saul was anointed with oil, and he could not but respect him; and so, beloved brethren, we must respect the Spirit by which our brethren have been anointed as with oil; whatever their attitude towards us, the grace of God enables us to regard whatever is of God in them.<a name=335:14></a> David wept, and he rent his garments.<a name=335:15></a>

		Now you will see how all this is added to what we dwelt on in speaking of 1 Samuel 30; and thus we have what is a sure guard against resentment or jealousy.<a name=335:16></a> The believer in the light of David is superior to it; he has always the victory, he is always overcoming evil with good.<a name=335:17></a>

		Now I wish to carry all this forward to chapter 6.<a name=335:18></a> David now becomes, not exactly a type of Christ, but a type of the believer.<a name=335:19></a> He sees the ark now; and the ark, as it were, supersedes him.<a name=335:20></a> It is a question of spiritual apprehension.<a name=335:21></a> The ark was in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom, and all his household; and

		In reading these scriptures I have in mind to speak about the present dispensation, and to bring out its salient features, especially at the beginning.<a name=340:1></a> It was inaugurated in suffering, it was perpetuated in suffering as at the outset, and if it is to end as it began, it must be maintained in the same way, that is, in suffering -- in those who <i>accept</i> suffering, as it is said in 2 Timothy 1, "but suffer evil along with the glad tidings, according to the power of God" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:8">2 Timothy  1:8</a>.<a name=340:2></a> Indeed, what we are called upon to follow in that epistle, namely, "righteousness, faith, love, peace" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>), taken as a whole, implies the maintenance of the dispensation according to that which marked it at the beginning.<a name=340:3></a>

		You will observe that righteousness is placed first, the other things follow; and I would like to show, by the Lord's help, that Luke emphasises that feature in presenting to us the sufferings of Christ; and in presenting it he brings out the great moral supremacy over the sufferings of Christ as man.<a name=340:4></a> Luke alone presents to us this petition of Christ to His Father on the cross; "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do".<a name=340:5></a> He alone, too, presents the recognition of His righteousness, first by the thief, and then by the centurion.<a name=340:6></a> None of the other evangelists speak of the conversion of the thief, nor do any of them put on record the centurion's estimate of Christ as a righteous man, so we can readily see that Luke by the Holy Spirit is concerned about righteousness in thus presenting Christ.<a name=340:7></a> He is also emphasising the moral greatness of Christ as man; when the women of Jerusalem bewailed Him,

		trees are viewed as on the banks of the mighty stream of spiritual power and grace which marks this dispensation.<a name=342:1></a> It began with suffering, for you will remember how, according to the chapter in Ezekiel, the river flows down from under the right side of the house, at the south side of the <i>altar</i>, thus alluding to the atoning <i>sufferings</i> of Christ.<a name=342:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet was turned round to view the gates, particularly the gate northward, and the gate that looked eastward, "and behold, waters ran out on the right side" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:2">Ezekiel  47:2</a>.<a name=342:3></a> He was led that way in order to be impressed with the judgment of God on the one hand, and with the favour of God on the other, for the river flowed from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar, the one indicating the favour of God, and the other the righteousness of God.<a name=342:4></a> These features appear at the <i>source</i>, so we see in Luke how the Lord in that solemn hour, as He was crucified, evidenced the former feature -- the favour of God: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"; forgiveness was in His heart in spite of their murderous attitude; He asks that God would be favourable toward them.<a name=342:5></a> It is in the light of this marvellous request of Christ that the thief is converted.<a name=342:6></a> The character of the dispensation is disclosed in this wonderful request of Christ, and it was evidently made in the hearing of the thief.<a name=342:7></a> "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do".<a name=342:8></a>

		a man's soul must be ever in accord with the divine light presented to him, so you see how the work of God in the soul of this man brought him into accord with what was there in Christ; he thus becomes righteous; he is righteous in judging himself: "we indeed justly", he says, "but this man has done nothing amiss".<a name=343:1></a> The Lord is recognised at the outset of the dispensation as a righteous Man.<a name=343:2></a> And so it was also with the centurion, he heard the Lord crying with a loud voice, and having seen what was done, said, "In very deed this man was just".<a name=343:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then God takes the issue between Christ and the world and the decision into His own hand, for God is far more concerned about righteousness than we are disposed to think: "Having come, he" (that is, the Spirit) "will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment" <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:8">John  16:8</a>.<a name=343:4></a> God will not leave it to the decision of the thief and the centurion, but will Himself vindicate His Son, so when the Holy Spirit came from heaven, He brought demonstration to the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.<a name=343:5></a> What was the sin?<a name=343:6></a> "because they do not believe on me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:9">John  16:9</a>); and the demonstration of it was brought to the very streets of Jerusalem.<a name=343:7></a> The Holy Spirit came to the followers of Christ; it was to them that God gave His Spirit, not to the Jews.<a name=343:8></a> The Spirit of God tells us that they were all together in one place, and "there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it <i>sat</i> upon each one of them" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:3">Acts  2:3</a>), showing how the Holy Spirit could discriminate; there was a moral reason, for He did not sit on any one who did not believe.<a name=343:9></a> He thus brought in demonstration that the Jews were guilty because they did not believe on Christ, but He also brought in demonstration of righteousness.<a name=343:10></a> The thief and the centurion both witnessed to righteousness in Christ; but God witnessed to it also, for Christ's position in heaven is witnessed to on the ground of

		righteousness.<a name=344:1></a> God would have the world to know it, and He sent the demonstration of it in the Spirit.<a name=344:2></a> Righteousness is morally the greatest thing, and the Lord is said to have <i>loved</i> it: "Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:9">Hebrews  1:9</a>.<a name=344:3></a> Such is God's estimate of, and delight in those who have it and practise it, that He would send demonstration of it into the world -- righteousness as expressed in His beloved Son.<a name=344:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The river flows out from beneath the altar -- the witness of righteousness, and in Ezekiel 47:6 we have the simple statement that the trees were on the bank of the river, not that they <i>grew</i> there.<a name=344:5></a> I have no doubt the allusion is to the apostles; they were there, whereas verse 12 refers to trees that <i>grew</i> upon the bank, and that is where <i>we</i> come in.<a name=344:6></a> None of us come in on apostolic ground, and whatever men came in after the apostles are growths, the results of the fructifying life and power of this mighty stream of the Holy Spirit; and the fact that He continues here is a guarantee for the production of such men.<a name=344:7></a> You will remember how the apostle Paul urges upon the Corinthians to be men; "Brethren, be not children in your minds, but in malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:20">1 Corinthians  14:20</a>.<a name=344:8></a> If you wish to know the cause of the scarcity of men in that sense, you may consult that letter of Paul's to the Corinthians; you will find that they were not concerned as to what is spiritual, they were carnal, babes, and in that sense did not exhibit a testimony to the power of the dispensation.<a name=344:9></a>

		But I want to show now from the Acts what I conceive to be antitypes of these trees.<a name=344:10></a> I refer first to Peter and John, for after <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>attention is directed to individuals.<a name=344:11></a> In chapter 2 we read that every day the Lord had brought in additions, such

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I touch now on Peter and John, who are singled out.<a name=345:3></a> You will remember that when the Lord found Peter he was with Andrew his brother, and when He found John he was in the company of his brother James, but now the Lord takes them out of their natural settings, out of what might hold them naturally.<a name=345:4></a> It is important to recognise the sovereignty of the Lord in His choice of His people and in His setting them together.<a name=345:5></a> Peter and John are presented as a lovely picture of two brothers in the spiritual sense, taken out of their natural settings -- Peter taken from Andrew, and John taken from James -- and then set together spiritually, and they are truly together.<a name=345:6></a> If you were to analyse the influences which draw saints together in any special way, you would be surprised to find how much of the natural there is, but these men are taken out of their natural settings and are truly set together in a spiritual way.<a name=345:7></a> It is a great thing to find "two of you" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>) at the present time -- not two persons in the flesh, not two relatives, not two with the same dispositions naturally, but "two of you" -- two of the assembly.<a name=345:8></a> The assembly is a spiritual conception in Matthew, and the materials are the result of the Father's revelation.<a name=345:9></a> Peter and John were two who were set together spiritually, and they are found going up together to the temple at the hour of prayer.<a name=345:10></a> What a spectacle for heaven to look upon!<a name=345:11></a> It was at the ninth hour -- the hour of prayer.<a name=345:12></a> Not many weeks before this the Lord Jesus had died at that very hour,

		and no doubt their thoughts would be going back to <i>that</i> event, and they are found united spiritually as they went up to the temple at the time of the day in which it occurred.<a name=346:1></a> I would put it to you to consider the value of prayer under such conditions: "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>.<a name=346:2></a> Mark what it says, "It shall come to <i>them</i>", and God will see that it does come to them.<a name=346:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the next example of manhood -- another of the trees, so to speak, growing on the banks of this great river of grace and power, namely, Barnabas.<a name=346:4></a> He is a <i>prince</i>, according to God, and being possessed of land, having sold it, he brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.<a name=346:5></a> He is spoken of in the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>as coming forward in a princely way; he is not mean or small.<a name=346:6></a> Sometimes there are those who have no means spiritually, but the book of Deuteronomy provides for such; the poor brother should be taken care of bountifully.<a name=346:7></a> No demand is made upon Barnabas; he simply came forward, as of old the princes of Israel came forward, each prince upon his day, and for twelve days the wonderful procedure detailed in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>went on, until the twelve great men of Israel had each made his offering.<a name=346:8></a> The Holy Spirit spreads it all out before us in that long chapter of eighty-nine verses, so that we might get some idea of what a prince really is.<a name=346:9></a> Princes are men of spiritual means -- not petty men, and they look at things from the divine side; and so Barnabas is named "son of consolation" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:36">Acts  4:36</a>); he becomes a great binding influence between Jerusalem and the work of God at Antioch.<a name=346:10></a> He had the confidence of his brethren and so was sent down by the assembly in Jerusalem to Antioch as fitted to meet the need there.<a name=346:11></a> "He was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:24">Acts  11:24</a>.<a name=346:12></a>

		Then we come to Stephen; he is a witness to another feature of manhood -- his face shone as the face of an angel.<a name=347:1></a> There was in him a reflection of what is in heaven.<a name=347:2></a> He had no definite appointment save that he was a deacon, but as such he had purchased to himself "a good degree, and much boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:14">1 Timothy  3:14</a>.<a name=347:3></a> Stephen represents what is within our reach on the line of exercise; it is not a question of appointment; it is a great result reached through devotedness; he becomes a marvellous witness, one who boldly faces the enemies of Christ, and brings in demonstration by the power of the Spirit as to their guilt.<a name=347:4></a> He is a great servant, and a martyr.<a name=347:5></a> We are of little account unless we are prepared for martyrdom, and Stephen represents manhood which shows itself in martyrdom -- a man who can stand up for the truth before the fiercest opposition and suffer for it.<a name=347:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next one we come to is Philip -- another example of most remarkable development in service.<a name=347:7></a> The need for servants at the present time is very great; the Lord said to His disciples, "The harvest is great, and the workmen are few; supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workmen unto his harvest" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#9:37">Matthew  9:37</a>,38.<a name=347:8></a> Philip represents a true servant; he went down to Samaria.<a name=347:9></a> Had he been governed by national feeling he would have avoided Samaria, for it was a rival of Jerusalem.<a name=347:10></a> He preached Christ there.<a name=347:11></a> We have no mention that any special gift for preaching had been given to him before this.<a name=347:12></a> You may say, 'I have no gift for preaching', but how can you know you have no gift, if you have not even tried to preach?<a name=347:13></a> We read that there was great joy in that city; he had preached Christ unto them; one of the best marks in a preacher is that he preaches <i>Christ</i>.<a name=347:14></a> I am seeking to point out how the ability for preaching is attained, but in order to find that you have it, you must first preach.<a name=347:15></a>

		Philip no doubt realised that <i>he</i> could do nothing, but the preaching of Christ implies that <i>He</i> can do everything, for He was anointed to effect all for God.<a name=348:1></a> All the preaching is by Christ; He "preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:17">Ephesians  2:17</a>); it is all done by Christ Himself: "Whether Christ should suffer; whether he .<a name=348:2></a>.<a name=348:3></a>.<a name=348:4></a> should announce light both to the people and to the nations" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:23">Acts  26:23</a>.<a name=348:5></a> This feature of manhood on the banks of the river, so to speak, attained a great result in Samaria, and there was divine recognition of it, for when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent down Peter and John.<a name=348:6></a> Then Philip is recognised by heaven -- through the angel.<a name=348:7></a> The angel represents the providence of God; another sphere of service is opened up to him.<a name=348:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As there is a disposition to serve, God in His providence makes way for you; it is not always necessary to leave your secular employment, for in the providence of God your employment may be the means of placing you where you can serve effectively.<a name=348:9></a> Here it is the divine recognition of Philip in a providential way, and although you cannot always know God by providence, yet it is evident here that the providence of God is concerned with the preaching.<a name=348:10></a> God may thus send you to some place where you would not naturally go; thus we need to be careful not to allow our natural feelings to act.<a name=348:11></a> Paul says, "if I announce the glad tidings, I have nothing to boast of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe to me if I should not announce the glad tidings.<a name=348:12></a> For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with an administration" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:16">1 Corinthians  9:16</a>,17.<a name=348:13></a>

		I have in mind in linking up these four scriptures together, to speak of the work and the workmen.<a name=351:3></a> It is not my thought to confine my remarks to those who are, as we say, actively engaged in the Lord's work, but that all may see that it is a time of work, calling for work-people; some, as we may say in ordinary language, skilled, others relatively unskilled, but all responsible to have a part in the work.<a name=351:4></a> Of old, as you will remember, the Levites representing the saints from this point of view, were numbered from a month old and upward (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#2:15">Numbers  2:15</a>); all were held for service, and the service which we speak of as levitical was no light service.<a name=351:5></a> The word in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4:3">Numbers  4:3</a> implies labour, toil, and so, having this in view, the Lord Jesus, who is "the prince of princes of the Levites" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#3:32">Numbers  3:32</a>), sets out for us the true idea of workmanship; indeed, it begins with God Himself.<a name=351:6></a> We are therefore in no mean company, however menial our part may be in the work.<a name=351:7></a> It is a work in which God Himself has His part.<a name=351:8></a> The Lord says, "My Father worketh hitherto", <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:17">John  5:17</a>.<a name=351:9></a> God had wrought in what we speak of as the material universe, the workmanship being pieced out by the day, and indeed it is only a day at a time even with God Himself.<a name=351:10></a> The work was by the day, each day having its own work; but He ceased from His labour, we are told, having finished it.<a name=351:11></a>

		In the apostle Paul we have that work carried on connected, as we may say, with one man.<a name=352:4></a> Others, indeed, had been taken up, as we know, but he says that he laboured more abundantly than they all.<a name=352:5></a> I wish you to note the recurrence, the frequency of the recurrence of the words 'work', 'workmen' and 'workmanship' in his epistles, his epistles having in mind as a feature to induce the spirit of working and to discredit the spirit of idleness.<a name=352:6></a> And not only that, but in him we get what we get in God, what we get in Christ, that is to say, <i>completion</i> of work.<a name=352:7></a> You will all remember how the Lord upbraids the assembly at Sardis, saying, "I have not found thy works complete before my God" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:2">Revelation  3:2</a>.<a name=352:8></a> Whatever they may have been before men, they were not complete before God.<a name=352:9></a> Much has been done, and is being done in what assumes to be the assembly, much that draws out the praise and admiration of men; notables of history, divines come under review as great workers, highly approved and commended by men; but in our work, beloved, it is with God we have to do.<a name=352:10></a> And so the Lord says, "I have not found thy works complete <i>before my God</i>" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:2">Revelation  3:2</a>.<a name=352:11></a> That church stands over against workers who complete what is given them to do, or what they undertake to do; hence, as I have been saying, God finished His work -- the work was completed.<a name=352:12></a> The Lord Jesus Christ finished His work; as He said, "I have completed the work which thou gavest that I should do it" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:4">John  17:4</a>), and so of Paul -- honoured as he thus is, as in many other respects -- after his first missionary journey with Barnabas, it is said of them that they finished the work which had been entrusted to them (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:26">Acts  14:26</a>) -- a most important feature,

		Now I want to show you from Zechariah -- coming back to Timothy later -- how the spirit of workmanship appeared in Christ.<a name=353:2></a> The earlier verses of chapter 13 speak of false prophecy, of which, alas!<a name=353:3></a> there is much at the present time, and what comes out is that in the latter day the father and the mother of a false prophet will put him to death.<a name=353:4></a> We are thus notified of the importance of the disallowance of natural feelings and affections in regard of those who serve.<a name=353:5></a> We know how Barnabas was affected in regard of John Mark; it was natural affection, and resulted in the severance of the two great servants who together had fulfilled the work that had been given them, and for which they had been committed to the grace of God.<a name=353:6></a> Mothers favouring their sons, fathers favouring their sons, and sisters favouring their brothers, all has to be dealt with, and refused, if the work is to go on according to God in a true levitical way.<a name=353:7></a> And so in the chapter it goes on to speak of the prophet denouncing all this, and refusing to wear hairy garments to deceive.<a name=353:8></a> Garments worn to distinguish us for service are disallowed in this passage, even although they be hairy ones -- garments which may cause us discomfort; for the flesh goes a long way in order to obtain religious distinction and reputation.<a name=353:9></a> What we speak of as 'the cloth' is disallowed.<a name=353:10></a>

		I want now to go on to Luke, to show from the Lord's words how He intended that His apostles should be marked as workmen by His own spirit and ways.<a name=356:7></a> You will observe in looking at the passage that the apostles, as such, had asked that their faith might be increased.<a name=356:8></a> The passage deals with his apostles; the word is "apostles" there, not 'disciples', as is usual.<a name=356:9></a> Now apostleship, as I understand it, implies representation, it implies authority.<a name=356:10></a> The Lord intended that as going out of this world, He should be represented in it.<a name=356:11></a> When here He maintained divine authority in heavenly grace, as He said to His opponents, "That ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralysed man, I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy little couch and go to thine house" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:24">Luke  5:24</a>.<a name=356:12></a> The miracle was to establish that He had authority, and the apostles in Luke represent His authority.<a name=356:13></a> I think that Luke makes more of apostleship than the other writers, for it is essential to the effective working of grace.<a name=356:14></a> The apostles were to be furnished; they were to be able to say to the sycamine tree, "Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17:6">Luke  17:6</a>); that is to say, all that stood in the way of grace should be removed, and it was

	<div class="paragraph">
		You cannot care for cattle save by getting up early.<a name=357:12></a> Jacob is the great type in Scripture of one who cared for cattle: "In the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#31:40">Genesis  31:40</a>.<a name=357:13></a> Cattle need continual attention; he who cares for them has to be attendant on them at all times.<a name=357:14></a> But the master after all that the servant has done when he comes in says, "Prepare .<a name=357:15></a>.<a name=357:16></a>.<a name=357:17></a> and gird thyself and serve me".<a name=357:18></a> The servant might say, I have done something, I have done a hard day's work, it is surely my due that I should now be waited on.<a name=357:19></a> How many of the Lord's professing servants expect that, expect to have the very best!<a name=357:20></a> I am not now speaking of what is their due, for Paul insists that he who preaches the gospel should live of the gospel; that is another side to what I have in view; but the servant here comes in and the Master says, 'Set on for Me'; of what

	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to Mark's gospel, and, as you might expect, it is not there the onerous nature of the work, the arduous character of it, but the work itself, and what yours is to be; that is to say, it is a question of distribution, for one is not to do all the work, as it says, "he has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>.<a name=358:8></a> There is variety in the workmen and in the work, and the Lord is the distributor.<a name=358:9></a> And so He speaks about the man going out of the country, going a long way, and the house being left.<a name=358:10></a> Note it is not now ploughing or looking after cattle; these are not mentioned; but it is the house.<a name=358:11></a> There is the house here, and the Lord says He gives authority to His bondmen, or as it should read, <i>the</i> authority.<a name=358:12></a> I have been speaking about authority in apostles; the apostles have gone, but the authority has not gone; it remains -- "<i>the</i> authority" relative to the house.<a name=358:13></a> We must never overlook that the authority has been given; He gave the authority, it says, and to each one his work; that is Mark.<a name=358:14></a>

		I want to speak to you this evening about leadership -- leadership in the things of God.<a name=362:1></a> It is God's way in carrying His people through this world to employ this means -- that of leadership, and the Lord may help us in our inquiry to see some of the features that mark true leadership.<a name=362:2></a> As in all else, we have to learn <i>from</i> and <i>in</i> Christ, for He is not only the Teacher, but He is what He teaches.<a name=362:3></a>

		I have selected the epistle to the Hebrews first, because the idea is emphasised there, being seen more in that epistle in relation to the Jewish Christians than in relation to others, for they were encompassed as connected with God's ancient economy, with what tended to darken and make the path difficult.<a name=362:4></a> The position of these Jewish Christians in the early days corresponds to a great extent with our own, for around us there are similar conditions.<a name=362:5></a> What claims to be connected with God, but is not really so, implies much that darkens and bewilders, so that the path of the people of God is extremely difficult.<a name=362:6></a> The epistle to the Hebrews, therefore, is of peculiar value to us in many respects, and not the least in this, that it emphasises the idea of leadership.<a name=362:7></a> In it we have a beautiful touch in regard to God's leading His people of old.<a name=362:8></a> It says He "took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:9">Hebrews  8:9</a>.<a name=362:9></a> It is not stated that He led them <i>in</i> by the hand, but that He led them <i>out</i> by the hand.<a name=362:10></a> He led them in also, but He led them in through their minds and their affections, for they had advanced; but He took them by <i>the hand</i> to lead them out.<a name=362:11></a> We read, too, that He "taught Ephraim to walk", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:3">Hosea  11:3</a>.<a name=362:12></a> These are infantile references, showing how God can come down

	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel in Egypt was in a normal infantile condition; it was such a condition as occasioned and drew out the love of Jehovah; He said, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:1">Hosea  11:1</a>.<a name=363:6></a> There was that freshness and beauty of youth at the outset which drew out the affections of God; then follows, "and out of Egypt I called my son" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:1">Hosea  11:1</a>), but there is first the freshness and beauty as seen in early spiritual life, which is delightful to God, and which corresponds to the epistle to the Thessalonians, which epistle treats of Christians in their early youth -- a normal youthfulness.<a name=363:7></a> Nor are they treated as so many persons; for although very young in their spiritual life, they are treated as an assembly: "The assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:1">1 Thessalonians  1:1</a>.<a name=363:8></a> It is the only assembly addressed in this way.<a name=363:9></a> They were beloved of God and so the apostle says, "but have been gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse would cherish her own children" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:7">1 Thessalonians  2:7</a>); and then again, "ye know how, as a father his own children, we used to exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:11">1 Thessalonians  2:11</a>.<a name=363:10></a> God thus indicates to us what early spiritual life is, and it should be encouraging to the youngest of us.<a name=363:11></a>

		Now, whilst God leads His people, He leads them mediately, that is to say, He leads them through others, first of all through Christ, so that, as I said, we have to learn this thought in Him.<a name=364:7></a> I have selected these verses in Hebrews because the apostle emphasises the idea of leadership particularly in this passage, where the word 'author' or 'leader' is used in the sense of one who, as many of us here know, sets the thing forward, who inaugurates it, originates it, so that we are at the very source of the thing.<a name=364:8></a> We are called upon to look on Jesus, for it is a question here, not of what He teaches by word, but by example; hence it is that we look <i>on</i> Him, and in order to look on Jesus, the author and completer of faith, we have to understand the gospels.<a name=364:9></a>

		The Spirit of God comes back to the thought of trees -- men; having mentioned them in verse 7, we have them again in verse 12, so as to develop more fully what He has in His mind with regard to them -- that they should bear fruit, that there should be variety, that they should be evergreen.<a name=382:6></a> These ideas of fruitfulness, of freshness, of the energy of life are to be seen in men -- in the trees.<a name=382:7></a> How lovely is the picture!<a name=382:8></a> Scripture enlarges on it elsewhere.<a name=382:9></a> I only dwell on it here as the outcome typically of the operations of grace, connected with the Spirit of God, within certain doctrinal limitations.<a name=382:10></a> I believe that what is needed in the gatherings of the Lord's people is just this growth; a growth from the babe-state into the state of manhood; and not simply that we are men in our minds, having the right thought of everything, but that there should be that holy state, that fruitfulness, that evergreenness, which is delightful to God, and refreshing to man.<a name=382:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I would desire first of all to dwell upon is the passage in 2 Corinthians, connected as it is with material giving on the part of the saints, for whilst wealth through material things has become defiled, called indeed the "mammon of unrighteousness" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16:9">Luke  16:9</a>), yet in the hands of the Christian, as held in relation to God, it becomes sanctified, for "every creature of God is good" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:4">1 Timothy  4:4</a>), and there can be no wealth apart from the creatures of God.<a name=386:3></a> The believer regards them as from God, and what comes to him through them he holds normally in relation to God; and so they become sanctified, and may, indeed, become the very expression of divine love operative in him.<a name=386:4></a> Those who bore the bounty given by the saints for the relief of the poor are regarded in this epistle as messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory; <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:23">2 Corinthians  8:23</a>.<a name=386:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what I have to say, therefore, I am in no wise disparaging what may be in the hands of the saints in a material way, as held in relation to God and used for the promotion of His interests at the present time, but the riches spoken of in the verses I read are not these.<a name=386:6></a> Material things perish in the handling, whereas the riches which God has in His mind for us are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whilst recognising fully the value, relatively, of material things as used for the Lord, we have always to remember the warning to those who are, or would be, rich, that whilst riches may be honourably used for God, as they were in the case of Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a rich man, yet it is to be noted that the Lord was with him in <i>His death</i> -- not in His life.<a name=387:2></a> He was "with the rich in his death" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:9">Isaiah  53:9</a>) -- a very solemn reminder of the relative value of riches.<a name=387:3></a> They were useful in that case to procure the tomb; it was the fulfilment of prophecy, and it is a very remarkable reference to the use of riches in a material sense, but nevertheless the word is that He was "with the rich in his death" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:9">Isaiah  53:9</a>.<a name=387:4></a> The death of Christ, beloved, in no sense enhances the riches of this world, possessed by whomsoever; the death of Christ signifies the end of them; they can go so far and no farther; useful at His burial, they have nothing to do with His resurrection.<a name=387:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, therefore, I would desire to speak about the spiritual, the durable riches, those which set us up before God, and what is to be noted is that the Lord Jesus had to become poor in order that we might be rich; not surely that we might be rich in this world's goods, for thousands and millions of people had been rich in these before He died, before He became poor.<a name=387:6></a> There was a man who had been rich, of whom indeed He Himself speaks in a most touching manner.<a name=387:7></a> One came to Him saying, "Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:13">Luke  12:13</a>.<a name=387:8></a> What inheritance?<a name=387:9></a> Not the inheritance of God, but some property that had come down to them both from their forefathers.<a name=387:10></a> The Lord had nothing to do with that.<a name=387:11></a> He was not here in connection with that.<a name=387:12></a> "Who established me as a judge or a divider over you?<a name=387:13></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:14">Luke  12:14</a>) the Lord replies, and then He

	<div class="paragraph">
		briefly of certain features of spiritual riches which God would have appear in us.<a name=389:1></a> First there is faith.<a name=389:2></a> I shall only touch on one or two features.<a name=389:3></a> James speaks of certain who were poor in "the world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom" <a href="../bible/James.htm#2:5">James  2:5</a>.<a name=389:4></a> "Rich in faith" involves that I take in richly the light presented to me in Christ, that I am not living according to sight, that I am not looking at seen things at all, but that I am apprehending the things of God in Christ; in other words, that I am in another world.<a name=389:5></a> I am laying hold of God, I am laying hold of His power, of His love, of His counsels, and I am resting in regard of everything on what has come out in Christ on the part of God.<a name=389:6></a> Apart from these things there is no definiteness in us at all, nor any moral power in our words, in our walk, or in our ways.<a name=389:7></a> We are to walk by faith, to walk in the light of the mind of God, of the power of God, of the love of God, of the counsels of God, and as knowing that I am included in the counsels of God.<a name=389:8></a> I am living in a divine unseen system instead of a system that is seen.<a name=389:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to another feature, and that is what the apostle speaks of as marking the Corinthians in what I may call a semi-objective way -- they were enriched, he says, in all knowledge and word of doctrine; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:5">1 Corinthians  1:5</a>.<a name=389:10></a> 1 do not say that the Corinthians were <i>characterised</i> by these, but the presence of the Holy Spirit in them had brought all that to light -- in everything, it says, they were enriched in Christ, in all knowledge and in all word of doctrine according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in them, so that they came behind in no gift.<a name=389:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to dwell for a moment on these two features -- all knowledge and word of doctrine.<a name=389:12></a> At the present time the world is full of teaching, full of books, full of theories.<a name=389:13></a> What is called science is simply knowledge.<a name=389:14></a> It is the same word.<a name=389:15></a> But what you will find in it is the absence of finality, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		absence of definiteness.<a name=390:1></a> One would wish that the Lord's people, as possessing the Spirit come down from heaven, should be marked by definiteness, by knowledge, by finality, that is to say, that they know something, and that they are not dependent upon what man has said, or upon theory, but that there may be, as the Lord says, something of "We speak that which we know" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:11">John  3:11</a>.<a name=390:2></a> I do verily believe that the Lord would impress upon us the importance of definiteness in what we believe, in what we say, in what we profess to know, so that there should be the word of doctrine amongst us, and that as we come together there should be something definite.<a name=390:3></a> It is surely not the Lord's mind that there should be the absence of help of this kind, that there should be poverty amongst us.<a name=390:4></a> The apostle says to Titus that God has shed the Holy Spirit upon us richly.<a name=390:5></a> If the Holy Spirit has been poured out on us richly, why should there be poverty?<a name=390:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The saints are to be enriched in all knowledge and word of doctrine, so our Bible readings should be simple, dignified, and take on a spiritual intelligence.<a name=390:7></a> Nothing can ever come out of discussion.<a name=390:8></a> You will remember that when the Lord came down from the mount of Transfiguration the disciples were in a discussion.<a name=390:9></a> The scribes were discussing with them -- there was a sort of controversy, but nothing in it!<a name=390:10></a> A poor man had come with a child who had a demon, and he says to the Lord, "I have brought to thee my son .<a name=390:11></a>.<a name=390:12></a>.<a name=390:13></a> I spoke to thy disciples, that they might cast him out, and they could not".<a name=390:14></a> It is a question of being able to help.<a name=390:15></a> "O unbelieving generation", He says, "how long shall I bear with you?<a name=390:16></a>" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:17">Mark  9:17</a> - 20.<a name=390:17></a> If the Holy Spirit has been poured upon us richly, why should we be in poverty?<a name=390:18></a> It is a want of industry, a want of drawing from the right source, so that there should be knowledge and the word of doctrine and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I refer to another thing, namely, richness in good works.<a name=391:9></a> We are to be "rich in good works" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:18">1 Timothy  6:18</a>.<a name=391:10></a> The need around us is very great, and to be representative of God there must be something of this nature; if there is to be any testimony it must be according to what shone in Christ.<a name=391:11></a> It is said of Him that He "went through all quarters doing good .<a name=391:12></a>.<a name=391:13></a>.<a name=391:14></a> because God was with him" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>.<a name=391:15></a> I have no doubt that the good works spoken of in Ephesians which God has prepared that we should walk in them, refer to the works that shone in Christ.<a name=391:16></a> If the assembly is to be the fulness of Christ, the expression of Christ here, there must be something in the way of good works, and these are to be taken up as an obligation.<a name=391:17></a> I do not understand simply giving what may be put in the box, as we speak, as answering to good works.<a name=391:18></a> What I understand by good works is a reckoning as to the need, a taking account of the need and meeting it to the utmost of our ability.<a name=391:19></a> If thy brother hunger you must feed him; if he thirst, you must give him drink.<a name=391:20></a> How dwells the love of God in him who disregards a hungry or a naked brother?<a name=391:21></a> You must take account of his hunger and his nakedness and meet them; the divine thought in Christ is to meet the need.<a name=391:22></a> "Good

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to go on now to Deuteronomy, because what I have in mind is what is due to God.<a name=392:4></a> If we are to worship God and carry out the service of God in the sanctuary, the entrance to which is thrown open to us, we must go in by the priest.<a name=392:5></a> "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:1">Hebrews  8:1</a>), and it goes on to say that, being a high priest, He must have something to offer; in other words, He must have means.<a name=392:6></a> The point there is not what He offered, but that He had something to offer.<a name=392:7></a> There were infinite riches in Christ; there was nothing lacking in Him, I need not say, as to the service of God; it was met in every way.<a name=392:8></a> Hence in Hebrews 9 we have what is called the "eternal inheritance" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:15">Hebrews  9:15</a>.<a name=392:9></a> The way into the sanctuary is indicated, but who are to go in?<a name=392:10></a> We go in by the priest, by the new and living way, but then, who is to go in?<a name=392:11></a> Those who are possessed of the eternal inheritance.<a name=392:12></a> Now I wish you particularly to notice this, because the service of God in Scripture is made to depend on the wealth of the saints; not that they can be a source in themselves, surely, for whatever we have is from God.<a name=392:13></a> He has shed upon us abundantly the means of wealth, and so you find in the book of Exodus that the very material of the sanctuary came from the people, and then too in regard of the temple the <i>abundance</i> came from the people.<a name=392:14></a> All the material came from the people.<a name=392:15></a> Hence, in Hebrews 9, as I said, we have an "eternal inheritance" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:15">Hebrews  9:15</a>), and in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:14">Ephesians  1:14</a> the Spirit is said to be the earnest of it, so that in possession of the inheritance we have means.<a name=392:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I believe that God looks for this in the most practical way.<a name=393:5></a> He looks for a state marked by a certain amount of wealth amongst His people; so that in coming to Him in the light of the sanctuary, in the light of the new and living way, we come there with <i>something</i>, we come with some measure of spiritual wealth, and hence the inheritance, the eternal inheritance, of which the Holy Spirit is the earnest.<a name=393:6></a> Thus the believer is enriched, he is enabled to draw near to God with something in his hands.<a name=393:7></a> Is it so with us?<a name=393:8></a> Is it so that every believer nominally in fellowship has accepted the obligation of drawing near to God with something in his hands -- some wealth?<a name=393:9></a> This is a very searching question.<a name=393:10></a>

		THE WAY OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I had in mind to speak about the continuance of effective service among the people of God.<a name=413:1></a> This gospel is intended to promote such service, and so it presents the Lord in this connection.<a name=413:2></a> "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:1">Mark  1:1</a>.<a name=413:3></a> Effective service can only be in servants divinely fitted and sent forth, and in order to understand the qualifications for it, we need to pay attention to what marked the Lord as presented in this gospel.<a name=413:4></a> As I said, He is presented as Son of God.<a name=413:5></a> There is no reference to genealogy, either from man to God, as in Luke, or from the roots of promise, David and Abraham, as in Matthew.<a name=413:6></a> He is simply introduced to us as the Son of God.<a name=413:7></a> He had already been declared, or "marked out" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:4">Romans  1:4</a>) to be the Son of God by resurrection of the dead, but this evangelist shows that at the outset of His service the heavenly intervention was, as it were, for Himself, indicating that for service there must needs be private relations with heaven.<a name=413:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will have been observed by those who have read carefully that in this gospel the opening of the heavens, the coming of the Spirit, and the announcement from heaven that He was Son of God were for Himself.<a name=413:9></a> It speaks of the heavens opening, and the Holy Spirit descending, and then the voice, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:11">Mark  1:11</a>), suggesting heaven's interest, heaven's honour, and His relationship to God.<a name=413:10></a> In the other two synoptic gospels the incident recorded is not so personal.<a name=413:11></a> In Luke the Holy Spirit is said to have descended in a bodily form as a dove upon Him, but it is not said that He saw it; the announcement of the relationship

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=414>[Page 414]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is addressed to Him, but the coming of the Spirit is not so personal.<a name=414:1></a> In Matthew He sees the Spirit coming, but the word there is, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>); attention is called to Him, whereas in Mark all is personal; He sees the heavens opened and the Spirit coming, and the voice is to Him.<a name=414:2></a> And so in aspiring to service, I think we have in Mark an indication of a necessity for a private understanding with heaven, so to speak.<a name=414:3></a> There is a power that comes, and you know it is upon you; others will see it presently, but <i>you</i> know it, otherwise there is no moral right to set up as representing God and Christ here.<a name=414:4></a> And then in addition to that there is the conscious knowledge of your relationship with God.<a name=414:5></a> Service can only be carried on in the dignity and liberty that belong to sonship.<a name=414:6></a> So I would emphasise at the outset two features with regard to what I have presented: on the one hand, that if there is to be effective service maintained, there must be the private understanding with heaven of the power and the honour conferred by the reception and anointing of the Spirit, and on the other hand, of the relationship into which we are brought.<a name=414:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus, I would say, was Son inherently; it was no question with Him of <i>receiving</i> sonship as with us, but of the announcement by God of what was there: "Thou art my beloved Son" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:11">Mark  1:11</a>.<a name=414:8></a> With us sonship is received, as it says in Galatians 4, "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship.<a name=414:9></a> But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:4">Galatians  4:4</a> - 6), that is to say, with the relationship conferred, the power to enjoy it is conferred, but that is in our <i>hearts</i>; it is not the same thought as the anointing.<a name=414:10></a> What I have in my heart is for my own enjoyment and for my own response to God as a son, but for

		service it is <i>upon</i>, and so the Holy Spirit came upon them all.<a name=415:1></a> This has reference to the anointing -- the external evidence of divine honour conferred to represent God in this world.<a name=415:2></a> We should not be afraid of the idea of representation, for the primary thought of God with regard to man was that he should represent God.<a name=415:3></a> "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>.<a name=415:4></a> I think the reception of sonship and of the Spirit of God's Son in our hearts implies that we are to be like God, but the Holy Spirit coming upon us implies much more; we are to be representative of God in this world.<a name=415:5></a> It is the thought of God that He should be represented.<a name=415:6></a> God never intended it otherwise than that He should be represented here, and be represented in those who serve.<a name=415:7></a> The assembly itself is called "the Christ" in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>, meaning that there was to be representation here in it as anointed.<a name=415:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now having said this, I have to come to the dark picture of the people of God exhibiting inability to help in spite of the greatest light and privileges.<a name=415:9></a> I refer to the passage in chapter 9.<a name=415:10></a> The early part of that chapter, as applied to saints now, supposes the Spirit.<a name=415:11></a> Three persons selected by the Lord are taken up into a high mountain apart, where He was transfigured before them, and where the voice of God from heaven spoke to them calling attention to Him.<a name=415:12></a> This was a wonderful privilege.<a name=415:13></a> And now He comes to His disciples and there is a great crowd around them, and He finds that the scribes are disputing with them; He makes enquiry as to what they were disputing about, and one of the crowd said, "I have brought to thee my son".<a name=415:14></a> Evidently he understood that he would find the Lord with His own.<a name=415:15></a> Is it always so, dear brethren, that He is found among us?<a name=415:16></a> We speak much of the Lord Jesus in the midst, but is it so that He is found among us always?<a name=415:17></a> He was not found amongst them here.<a name=415:18></a> There may be

		Here is a man in need, and evidently he assumes the Lord would be found among His own, and normally it should be so.<a name=416:4></a> Certainly it was not so on this occasion.<a name=416:5></a> The father of the child says, "I have brought to thee my son", and then he says, "I spoke to thy disciples, that they might cast him out".<a name=416:6></a> Alas!<a name=416:7></a> they were unable to cast out the demon.<a name=416:8></a> The disputation had gone on, but disputation is not power; what is needed to help is power, and the disciples, although they could dispute, could not cast out the demon.<a name=416:9></a> It says they <i>could not</i> do it.<a name=416:10></a> How discreditable it was, how it denied the great ministry of the Lord Jesus!<a name=416:11></a> If the Lord Himself had not come in, the man must have gone away without help; he had come expecting the Lord to be there -- he says, I have brought him unto <i>Thee</i>.<a name=416:12></a> Where should He be save among His disciples?<a name=416:13></a> But there is a disputation, and no power to help.<a name=416:14></a> Well, I speak all this so that we may take to heart any inability to help of which we may be conscious.<a name=416:15></a> It places us on a level in regard of service with those around us in Christendom.<a name=416:16></a> See the Lord's rebuke!<a name=416:17></a> "O unbelieving generation!<a name=416:18></a> how long shall I be with you?<a name=416:19></a> how long shall I bear with you?<a name=416:20></a>" The disciples are included in this rebuke.<a name=416:21></a> Unless we have power to help what is it but that we resemble the world?<a name=416:22></a> We are like the religious world about us, and so we are condemned with it.<a name=416:23></a> "O <i>unbelieving</i> generation".<a name=416:24></a> This includes all; the disciples and the scribes would both be included in the Lord's words.<a name=416:25></a> They had no power to help the man.<a name=416:26></a> The Lord says, "Bring him to me".<a name=416:27></a> I need not go into detail, I only wished to touch on one point -- the inability in those known to be disciples of Christ to relieve need, to help.<a name=416:28></a>

		We see in this incident how the impotency of the disciples being disclosed, the Lord Himself takes the matter in hand; He says, "Bring him to me", for the testimony can never fall to the ground.<a name=417:1></a> The Lord will always come in and adjust things by Himself; He will never let things go, you may be sure of that; He is "the faithful and true witness" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:14">Revelation  3:14</a>.<a name=417:2></a> The work will go on, the relief will be administered; the Lord will see to that.<a name=417:3></a>

		I turn now to chapter 16, where we see the women with the best possible intent and purpose, and with love to Christ, at the sepulchre at the sun-rising, and they see there on the right side a young man.<a name=417:4></a> He was on the <i>right</i> side, and is clothed with a white robe.<a name=417:5></a> He is there as a witness to the divine requirements -- to the qualifications needed in the service of God as a young man.<a name=417:6></a> The Lord is looking for young men.<a name=417:7></a> The testimony is to go on, and He looks for young men.<a name=417:8></a> There is a wonderful opportunity for such at the present time; old ones necessarily pass away to be with the Lord as the dispensation continues, as it says, "One generation passeth away and another generation cometh" (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#1:4">Ecclesiastes  1:4</a>), but the generations overlap, that is to say, the old and the young have occasion to mingle.<a name=417:9></a> We see in Matthew that the Lord finds an ass and a colt and He rides <i>both</i>.<a name=417:10></a> The disciples brought them, and we read, "He sat on <i>them</i>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21:7">Matthew  21:7</a>.<a name=417:11></a> We find frequently a division between the old and the young, but it was never intended to be so.<a name=417:12></a> The old have experience and wisdom, the young have the energy, the life and freshness, and so the divine intention is that there should be a happy blending of both.<a name=417:13></a> The assembly, I may say, is made up of both old and young, and the young are not to isolate themselves from the old, nor the old from the young; they are to be held together, they are to be so together that the Lord can use both at one time.<a name=417:14></a> He rode upon them <i>both</i>.<a name=417:15></a>

		In the presence of all this these women are affrighted and perturbed, and instead of going forth with the wonderful tidings committed to them they speak to no one.<a name=418:10></a> It is better, surely, to be silent if you have nothing to say, but when you are entrusted with a divine message it is disobedience to be silent.<a name=418:11></a> You all remember how Zacharias is spoken of by Luke; he was serving "in the order of his course" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:8">Luke  1:8</a>), you could not point a finger at the order, or the rectitude of his service, but when the angel Gabriel came to him with glad tidings he was <i>unable to believe</i>; and if one does not believe, one should not speak.<a name=418:12></a> Unless you can present something by faith it is better to be silent; and Zacharias was rendered silent (dumb) until what the angel promised should be fulfilled, and then he blesses God and announces the mind of God.<a name=418:13></a> If you have a message, it is sinful to hold your peace.<a name=418:14></a> These women were silent.<a name=418:15></a> How unworthy it is to go about pursuing the circumstances of daily life and saying nothing to anyone of Christ in resurrection!<a name=418:16></a> What a wonderful privilege it is to speak of Him thus!<a name=418:17></a> How humbling to refrain from it!<a name=418:18></a> Are these things not applicable more or less to us?<a name=418:19></a> How

		I have spiritual progress in mind in linking these scriptures, believing that it is only as we are progressing spiritually that we are safe.<a name=423:1></a> Christianity does not contemplate our being stationary, but our being in movement, and I wish to show that movement in a spiritual sense is upward.<a name=423:2></a> David's history, therefore, affords an apt type in this respect, as it does in others, of the present dispensation.<a name=423:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The books of Samuel afford a much more life-size picture of David than the other book does which records his history, namely, 1 Chronicles, which presents to us David in relation to the ark.<a name=423:4></a> In Samuel we have what is more personal and more extended, and so we have much more typical detail as to Christ personally, and also as to the believer, and I wish to show that these passages that we have read depict how the Lord, as identifying Himself with us, leads us forward, instructing us as we go, until we reach, in the apprehension of our souls and in our experience, the highest point of spiritual elevation, that is to say, the truth presented in Ephesians.<a name=423:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of elevation is prominent throughout Scripture -- the idea of great elevation.<a name=423:6></a> We have it in the ark of Noah, built, you will remember, in first, second, and third storeys.<a name=423:7></a> In connection with these storeys there were cells, as if in the divine system God would afford us, not only a great elevation, an ascent which can be taken in spiritual power, but also spheres of privacy in which to contemplate and take account of things in an undisturbed way, for God furnishes us bountifully with educational advantages.<a name=423:8></a> The divine system of education is much more

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the history of David, as I hope to show, these features appear as peculiarly typical of the present time.<a name=424:5></a> In <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#22">1 Samuel  22</a>he is seen as the gathering centre; his brethren and his father's house, and all who are in distress come to him in the cave of Adullam, which is indicative of believers in their initial history coming to Christ and finding Him, in His great moral superiority, acquiring rule over them.<a name=424:6></a> David became captain, it says.<a name=424:7></a> It was not that anyone appointed him to that position, it was a question of his moral greatness; he secured that place.<a name=424:8></a> It is the safety of the believer at the outset to recognise the moral supremacy of Christ; it is due to Him that He should rule over us, because of what He is morally.<a name=424:9></a>

		What I wish to call attention to is that blessed as that experience of coming under the influence of Christ is, the mind of God is that we should progress, and so the prophet Gad is introduced.<a name=424:10></a> The prophet is to bring the mind of God to us unsolicited.<a name=424:11></a> A prophet represents God's patience with us and he would not, therefore, have us to continue in the cave.<a name=424:12></a> The word of the prophet was that they should go up into "the land of Judah".<a name=424:13></a> The mind of God for the believer is that whilst he has come under the rule and the influence of Christ, his foot is to be planted on

		I desire first of all to say a little about the tabernacle as it was originally set up.<a name=434:4></a> The great feature in Exodus is dwelling, and so the tabernacle is filled with the glory; it is the divine dwelling-place, anointed in every part of it, for God will have it in its completeness.<a name=434:5></a> Before it was anointed, every part of it was brought to Moses, item after item was brought to him, and he, as it were, passed it -- saw and beheld that they had done it as Jehovah commanded -- and then blessed it.<a name=434:6></a> It was then set up and anointed in every part of it with the holy oil, and then it was filled with the divine glory.<a name=434:7></a> It was the complete setting out of the tabernacle as set up in every detail according to the mind of God -- nothing wanting, no discrepancy in the least degree, and as anointed God comes into it and dwells in it.<a name=434:8></a> We have therefore presented to us the tabernacle from the divine standpoint in Exodus, suitable for God, the residence of His glory.<a name=434:9></a>

		When we come to Numbers, we find God speaking to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tabernacle.<a name=435:3></a> Now it is the tabernacle as capacitated to be in the wilderness, to be with us in every circumstance.<a name=435:4></a> It is so constituted that it can be with us in every circumstance, and not only that God can be with us Himself, but with us in His ordered abode.<a name=435:5></a> He says, so to speak, I will be with you, but I will be with you tabernacle-wise.<a name=435:6></a> The first speaking we have in Numbers is in the wilderness of Sinai -- in the tabernacle but in that position.<a name=435:7></a> "Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1:1">Numbers  1:1</a>.<a name=435:8></a> This really suggests a most touching thing; He is to journey with them morning, noon, and night, week after week, month after month, year after year, for the whole period of the wilderness.<a name=435:9></a> A most affecting reference, for "in all their affliction he was afflicted" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#63:9">Isaiah  63:9</a>.<a name=435:10></a> God Himself was with His people, but He was with them tabernacle-wise.<a name=435:11></a> The wilderness involves suffering, hence when the tabernacle was set up and anointed, the princes of the people approached with their offerings for the dedication of the altar -- the altar being typical of suffering.<a name=435:12></a> In Leviticus the altar is anointed seven times, in Numbers it is dedicated by the twelve princes of Israel -- <i>dedicated</i>, meaning that the saints, viewed in their spiritual wealth and understanding, recognise unitedly what is involved in the wilderness position -- that is suffering.<a name=435:13></a> It pointed to our Lord Jesus Christ becoming Man, and suffering.<a name=435:14></a> There could be no tabernacle without that; its bases were of silver; as we have often remarked, redemption must underlie it; the sufferings of Christ must be undergone, if God is to be with His people in the wilderness.<a name=435:15></a> You see, therefore, how Christ becomes

		endeared to us as we apprehend the position in Numbers.<a name=436:1></a> The dedication by the princes shows what an apprehension they had, at least typically, of the sufferings of Christ.<a name=436:2></a> And perfect unity prevailed.<a name=436:3></a> I need not go over it, it is a long chapter, 89 verses, at the end of which it says that Moses went in to speak to God, but we read, "then he heard the voice speaking to him" (Numbers 7:89), as if to convey God's appreciation of the wealth of Israel's expression in regard of the sufferings of Christ.<a name=436:4></a> And so He spoke to Moses.<a name=436:5></a> Where did He speak from?<a name=436:6></a> He spoke from off the mercy-seat; He said virtually, What is expressed in your offerings enables Me to be with you, it enables Me to speak to you.<a name=436:7></a> This dispensation is marked by mercy, for it is "according to his own mercy he saved us" (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:5">Titus  3:5</a>); so that the mercy-seat is the basis of the position of this dispensation, and God speaks from off it.<a name=436:8></a> But further it adds, "the mercy-seat which was upon the ark of testimony" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7:89">Numbers  7:89</a>) -- the latter referring to the Person of Christ; God speaks in relation to that, and then from between the two cherubim.<a name=436:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus you see the position in Numbers implies that the saints, in the power of the Spirit, have come to recognise the altar; there is the united recognition of the value of the altar, which speaks of Christ's sufferings, and God recognises that and speaks.<a name=436:10></a> He ever speaks where these conditions exist in any measure, and the speaking covers the whole dispensation.<a name=436:11></a> There is the mercy-seat, the ark of testimony -- the Person of Christ -- and the cherubim of glory, which refers to the government of God, the majesty of God; divine speaking, at all times where these conditions in any measure exist, covers the dispensation.<a name=436:12></a> So we have the whole truth implied in the way God spoke to Moses on that memorable occasion.<a name=436:13></a> And then it says Moses spoke to Him; God makes it plain in His speaking that we may speak to Him.<a name=436:14></a> Christianity is marked by the word of God and prayer

		Corinthians and Romans run together, dealing with believers in their initial stages of growth.<a name=455:3></a> Romans treats of the individual -- the side of the truth that appertains to us severally, leading up to our being set together as "one body in Christ" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:5">Romans  12:5</a>.<a name=455:4></a> The epistles to the Corinthians treat of Christians as so set, regarded as the assembly of God, and in both the epistle to the Romans and in those to the Corinthians the idea of the faithfulness of God is emphasised.<a name=455:5></a> In Colossians and Ephesians the thought is not so evident, for it is young believers who need it particularly, that is to say, believers in their early growth.<a name=455:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is what may be called the <i>tender</i> stage to which the faithfulness of God applies as a steadying factor, but as we advance in the knowledge of God, and have learnt to reckon upon His faithfulness, then we think more of His love, we rest more in His love.<a name=455:7></a> We never lose sight of His faithfulness; if not for ourselves directly, certainly for our households, and for the saints in general.<a name=455:8></a> The faithfulness of God as reaching "unto the clouds" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#36:5">Psalm  36:5</a>) ever remains with us, but we rest more in His love.<a name=455:9></a> As we know His love we do not ask for promises.<a name=455:10></a> It is in our initial stages that the promise and the oath become of especial importance; God intervenes then with two unchangeable things upon which the believer may rest with the utmost confidence, in order that we might have strong encouragement.<a name=455:11></a> The old ones never forget the value of

		<a name=456>[Page 456]</a>

		the promise and the oath, but having come to know God they require neither the one nor the other; in the language of another they can say, "I know whom I have believed" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:12">2 Timothy  1:12</a>.<a name=456:1></a> But the promise and the oath are, as I have said, of supreme importance to the believer in his initial stages.<a name=456:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so we have it in this passage in Corinthians, "God is faithful".<a name=456:3></a> As called into the fellowship of God's Son we may reckon unfailingly on the faithfulness of God.<a name=456:4></a> He is concerned about His Son, about the fellowship of His Son.<a name=456:5></a> Then again we have the assurance in chapter 10 that God is faithful and will not allow us to be tempted above that we are able.<a name=456:6></a> One has proved in one's experience how God orders things for young believers, so that they should not come into temptation beyond that they are able to bear.<a name=456:7></a> In fact it applies to all, for each one of us has his measure; the most advanced is exposed, and has to reckon on the faithfulness of God to keep him out of the way of temptation.<a name=456:8></a> And further in the second epistle the apostle speaks of God's faithfulness in regard to what is preached -- that the word preached to us, the gospel of the Son of God, is not yea and nay, but yea is in Him -- in the Son of God, Jesus Christ.<a name=456:9></a> For in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen, so that if you have not found out that what the word of the gospel proposes is verified in Christ, there is some want in your soul, for if God ministers His word in the gospel to us, and we believe it, He <i>confirms</i> it.<a name=456:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe in the principle of confirmation, not in the ecclesiastical sense, of course, but in the divine sense, and no young believer should be without it; he should see to it that he is confirmed.<a name=456:11></a> And so what the apostle preached found its verification in Christ; He is the divine Amen of every divine proposal.<a name=456:12></a> So Paul says to the Corinthians, He who "has anointed us is God" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:21">2 Corinthians  1:21</a>); he says also that God

		has "sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:22">2 Corinthians  1:22</a>.<a name=457:1></a> That is what I call confirmation.<a name=457:2></a> <i>God</i> does it.<a name=457:3></a> He anoints us, and seals us, and He gives us a portion for our own hearts in the Spirit.<a name=457:4></a> Thousands of believers are not confirmed, whereas confirmation is one of the most important features; we need to be <i>sure</i> of the things we have believed, and this is by the Spirit.<a name=457:5></a>

		That I am anointed means that I am set up in dignity here, and in the light of that I renounce all natural dignity, whatever it may be; secondly, I am sealed, which means that I am marked off as the property of God.<a name=457:6></a> In the power of that I deny all other claims.<a name=457:7></a> The world puts forth its claims, nature puts forth its claims, but the divine claim is paramount.<a name=457:8></a> "God must be obeyed rather than men" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:29">Acts  5:29</a>.<a name=457:9></a> Sealing is the token of divine <i>ownership</i>: "Ye have been bought with a price" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:20">1 Corinthians  6:20</a>), "ye are not your own" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:19">1 Corinthians  6:19</a>.<a name=457:10></a> And then finally I have something in my heart -- the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=457:11></a> I am not set up without the means of living accordingly, and those means lie in the Spirit, the earnest in the heart, and that is for myself.<a name=457:12></a> It is as if God says, I do not wish you to be in a dignified position without means of support.<a name=457:13></a> It is in these three things, beloved young people, that you are confirmed.<a name=457:14></a>

		Now I wish to connect the great principle of the faithfulness of God with the scriptures read in Genesis.<a name=457:15></a> Those who have been confirmed will understand (for they indeed are the only ones who can rightly do so) the covenant made with Noah, with every living creature and with the earth.<a name=457:16></a> It was a very wide covenant.<a name=457:17></a> Believers in Christ who have the Holy Spirit alone understand it.<a name=457:18></a> Every man and woman in the world have benefited by it, I may say, as much as believers have.<a name=457:19></a> The prodigal in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, as he went out from his father's house, used the

		We now touch on Colossians, we are touching ground that leads us outside this world, and so as Abraham is put to the test the voice from heaven is "Abraham, Abraham" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:11">Genesis  22:11</a>), meaning he is known there, and in this connection he is tested, and he answers to the test, for he is willing to part with all that he has on this side, he is willing to trust God.<a name=461:15></a> He had called upon the everlasting God; he can trust Him now, and he can give up Isaac.<a name=461:16></a> And so God enters into a fresh covenant with him, so that Beersheba is no longer the well of <i>his</i> engagement, it is the well of <i>God's</i> engagement, and Abraham goes and dwells there.<a name=461:17></a> He does not call upon the name of Jehovah now, he needs no help for God's engagement.<a name=461:18></a> It was an engagement, a covenant from God's side entirely, there is no mediator in it; God enters this engagement, and Abraham dwells under the shelter of it.<a name=461:19></a>

		My intention is to speak about the love of Christ, and I hope to be able to show that it is presented in Scripture in divine order and at the same time in a variety of settings.<a name=465:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In turning to Leviticus I wish to show from the type, well known doubtless to most of us, the greatness and reliability of the love of Christ.<a name=465:2></a> It has to be apprehended in its greatness in order to see its applicability to specific circumstances, and I think the chapter in Leviticus affords us, in type, the setting of the love of Christ from the standpoint of its magnitude and reliability, for the breast of the consecration offering alludes to the love of Christ in that character.<a name=465:3></a> The offering itself refers to Christ as giving Himself for the saints; it is the consecration offering, and so I connect it with Ephesians because it is in that epistle that things are seen in their fulness and in their greatness, and hence the love of Christ is treated from that point of view in that epistle.<a name=465:4></a> He loved the assembly, we are told there, and gave Himself for it.<a name=465:5></a> And so in the corresponding passage in the gospels -- John 13 to 17 inclusive -- we have the love of Christ presented particularly, and one is encouraged to speak of it from this point of view, believing that there is sufficient appreciation of it in the brethren.<a name=465:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not that the Ephesians understood the full bearing of the love of Christ, but they were ready for it, they had had a taste of it in a peculiar way in the apostle in his ministry amongst them.<a name=465:7></a> The apostle was sufficiently in the possession and enjoyment of the love of Christ to convey it in some degree; and

		so on leaving the Ephesians after his great service there, through which the assembly was gathered, he embraced them.<a name=466:1></a> I have no doubt that the embrace spoke of and conveyed more to them than they had hitherto experienced; <i>their</i> action is not referred to, it was a question of the energy of affection in the great vessel through whom the light had come, for an embrace is not simply a kiss.<a name=466:2></a> At the end of the chapter the Ephesian elders kissed Paul ardently.<a name=466:3></a> An embrace involves power, and so in dealing with Eutychus the apostle enfolded him in his arms.<a name=466:4></a> There was not only affection, but affection in power.<a name=466:5></a> The Ephesians, therefore, as I said, had a taste of it in a particular way.<a name=466:6></a> I do not say that they had not known love, for they had the Spirit; the Holy Spirit had come in at Ephesus through the laying on of Paul's hands, and He would shed abroad in the hearts of the Ephesians the love of God as it was in Christ, as He did elsewhere.<a name=466:7></a> But then there was this additional touch, so that in writing to them afterwards, they would be ready for an enlargement of the great subject of the love of Christ.<a name=466:8></a> Hence he said that he prayed for them, he bowed his knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=466:9></a> The prayer is one whole, it refers to power in the saints -- not light.<a name=466:10></a> "That ye may be fully able" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:18">Ephesians  3:18</a>), he says, "to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:18">Ephesians  3:18</a> - 19.<a name=466:11></a>

		Now I understand that the saints are viewed in Ephesians as consecrated, and that the breast of the consecration offering being Moses' portion, is that which the Lord in an authoritative way brings before them.<a name=466:12></a> It had already been waved.<a name=466:13></a> It was Moses who waved it; it belonged to him.<a name=466:14></a> The setting of the type is this; Christ is viewed in His personal dignity here, not as dying.<a name=466:15></a> Aaron was clothed in the presence of the whole congregation with his garments of glory

		and beauty, and then the tabernacle was anointed; that is to say, the ministry of Christ, the unfolding of the mind of God as it came out in Him, indicated that in which God would display Himself, that in which He would dwell; all that came out in the ministry of Christ in what He said.<a name=467:1></a> The divine thoughts in regard of the heavens and the earth were disclosed in that ministry, and then the anointing.<a name=467:2></a> The Lord is personally owned in this type as fit to serve in that holy system apart from dying; but the altar was anointed, as you will remember, seven times, meaning that the words -- the ministry of Christ -- burning as they were, as coming out straight from God in the Son, could only become effective through suffering.<a name=467:3></a> It could become systematised and made a living order of things only through the inclusion of men, and this necessarily involved the sufferings of Christ -- a theme, beloved, which the Holy Spirit would ever keep before us, as moulding us and giving us a tinge of colour that is after Christ.<a name=467:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, the altar being anointed, the sons of Aaron are brought in and are clothed with their garments, that is to say, the disciples come forward, and here I touch on John 13.<a name=467:5></a> It is a chapter which involves the ram of consecration, and so the breast -- the love -- comes into evidence.<a name=467:6></a> The Lord knew that He was about to depart out of this world to the Father; and "having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end" <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:1">John  13:1</a>.<a name=467:7></a> The breast is in evidence, it is in evidence in its durability.<a name=467:8></a> Love is in evidence in its durability.<a name=467:9></a> Over against that, it is said that the devil had put it into the heart of Judas to betray Him; over against the love that was there, the love that had been so expressed and was now to show itself in the wonderful actions and words at that supper table (covering these chapters I have mentioned), over against that was the heart of Judas.<a name=467:10></a> In Luke it is the <i>hand</i> of him who betrayed, it is a

		question of what Judas <i>did</i>; but in John it is the <i>heart</i> of him who betrayed, for John goes to the bottom of things, and so we read, "the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas" <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:2">John  13:2</a>.<a name=468:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may say in passing that it is one thing to have Satan put something into your heart and another thing to carry it out, Satan himself having entered into you.<a name=468:2></a> The order is that he introduces the thought into the heart, then he follows up the thought and finds a place there, and then the action -- a most serious matter in regard of our hearts, for if we are believers and thus related to Christ, it is our hearts that Satan is after, to suggest something there.<a name=468:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord knew that Satan had made the suggestion, He was perfectly aware of all that went on in Judas, for in John's gospel the Lord calls <i>him</i> a devil.<a name=468:4></a> The word for 'devil' usually in the New Testament is 'demon', but in regard of Judas he was himself a devil; such was the enormity of the crime, such was its far-reachingness and nature that he was called no less than a devil.<a name=468:5></a> John would expose him fully, and so the devil put it into his heart to betray Him, and then later Satan entered into him.<a name=468:6></a> I say this for the enemy is after the hearts of the saints.<a name=468:7></a> You may not have thought of that, but he seeks to get as near to Christ as he can, and to follow up a suggestion with his own presence in the doing of the thing.<a name=468:8></a> So when Judas received the sop from the Lord, Satan entered into him, and he went out, and it was night, and that night has continued.<a name=468:9></a> We have to do with the world into which Judas has gone -- it is a different world from the world that preceded it.<a name=468:10></a> The one who had been in the nearest companionship to Christ, <i>he</i> has gone out indwelt by the devil, by Satan, having carried with him, as it were, all the secrets and terms of affection that he was cognisant of inside.<a name=468:11></a> Such is the world with which we have to do!<a name=468:12></a>

		there is the consecration of the priests, and what comes to light, as I said, is the love of Christ -- the breast.<a name=469:1></a> And so John the writer, as it says, leaned on that breast, it was available to him.<a name=469:2></a> Now the secret of leaning on the breast is that one has been received into the bosom.<a name=469:3></a> There are two words; in verse 23 it is the bosom of Christ which signifies not that which is solid like the breast, but that which is receptive -- a receptive suggestion.<a name=469:4></a> The reading is not that John leaned on the bosom, but that "there was at table one of his disciples <i>in</i> the bosom of Jesus" <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:23">John  13:23</a>.<a name=469:5></a> Judas was at table too, and so the others were, but of John it is said that he was <i>in the bosom</i>.<a name=469:6></a> The thought conveyed is that he had a place in the heart of Christ and that he had come into it; he understood something of the breast of the ram of consecration.<a name=469:7></a> It was the scene of consecration; the Lord, in the midst of the darkness and the corruption, would have a circle in His bosom, He would have a circle of persons whom He had received into His affections.<a name=469:8></a> He was Himself in the bosom of the Father and known to be there.<a name=469:9></a> They had contemplated Him as an only-begotten with a father, that is not only had they seen Him, but they had contemplated Him there; they took account of how He was there.<a name=469:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is only thus, dear brethren, that we can rightly apprehend what contemplation means, what Jesus was as man here with the Father.<a name=469:11></a> The disciples were not simply passing spectators, they <i>contemplated</i>; the thing was brought within their range, and they took account of it with interest, and in taking account of it they <i>give</i> an account of it.<a name=469:12></a> It is one thing to apprehend what is of God -- a spiritual thing -- it is another thing to give an account of it.<a name=469:13></a> And so John says, "We have contemplated his glory" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>.<a name=469:14></a> And then he tells us what it was like.<a name=469:15></a> And so they laid hold of the idea that with Christ there

		In the last scripture that I read, 2 Corinthians 5, it is the love of Christ in its constraining power, constraining us to a right judgment of things.<a name=473:3></a> "The love of the Christ", says the apostle, "constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died".<a name=473:4></a> There is no one at all in view now; it is not a question of your life towards the world, and conflict, it is the way into new creation.<a name=473:5></a> We know very little about new creation; I feel that for myself, and hence the importance of understanding the constraint, the constraining power of the love of Christ, for He would lead us into it.<a name=473:6></a> He would support us in conflict in every circumstance so that we might be like Himself in it, that we might be in accord with the altar and the sufferings involved, but the other side is that He would lead us into new creation.<a name=473:7></a> There <i>is</i> such a thing.<a name=473:8></a> It is not here that I am a new creature exactly, for the word is not 'a new creature', but "new creation".<a name=473:9></a> "If any one be in Christ, <i>there is</i> a new creation", and that refers to the work of God.<a name=473:10></a> Sometimes we speak of the new man and new creation and say it is seen in Christ, but strictly it is not seen in Christ; it is a <i>creation</i>, and a creation is not seen in Christ, He is the Creator.<a name=473:11></a> The work of God in this sense is in the saints and it is never regarded as abstract.<a name=473:12></a> There is always some concrete expression of the work of God, something that can be taken account of, otherwise there is no Christianity; hence the new man is a creation; what you put on is a creation, it is what is seen in the saints that you put on.<a name=473:13></a>

		And so, beloved, the love of Christ constrains us with that in view.<a name=474:9></a> "All have died"; that is the judgment that flows from the constraining power of the love of Christ.<a name=474:10></a> If He died for all, then all had died.<a name=474:11></a> It is the reckoning of love, the reckoning of one who is under the constraining power of the love of Christ; so that all have died, all are out of the way, and those who live do not live unto themselves.<a name=474:12></a> They are not selfish; everything in regard of love is unselfish.<a name=474:13></a> And so you get in the gift of Christ, God gave His <i>own</i> Son, spared not His own Son.<a name=474:14></a> There was unselfishness!<a name=474:15></a> God is unselfish, Christ is unselfish; "himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:24">1 Peter  2:24</a>.<a name=474:16></a> Unselfishness marks love from the outset to the finish, and as it constrains us, what marks us is unselfishness; we do not live to ourselves but to Him who died for us and rose again.<a name=474:17></a>

		Then the apostle makes bold and goes further; he says, We henceforth know no one according to flesh.<a name=474:18></a> He is looking at the work of God in the saints.<a name=474:19></a> As regards Christ, He is no longer in the flesh, He is risen, having died; as regards the saints, they are the subjects of the work of God, and if you look on them

		In referring to it one is reminded of the Lord's words, "Reproach hath broken my heart" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:20">Psalm  69:20</a>.<a name=476:2></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69">Psalm  69</a>depicts His sufferings, particularly towards the end of His pathway of service here, and what comes out in it is repeated reference to reproach.<a name=476:3></a> He said to Jehovah, "The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:9">Psalm  69:9</a>.<a name=476:4></a> Thus we see how completely the idea of representation marked Christ; representation of God brought upon Him the reproaches that were directed against God.<a name=476:5></a> He was, as here, completely the representation of God.<a name=476:6></a> He is spoken of indeed as the "image of the invisible God" <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:15">Colossians  1:15</a>.<a name=476:7></a> It is well to bear in mind the invisibility of God, that God is invisible.<a name=476:8></a> Many statements in Scripture may seem to be contradictory to this, as, for instance, in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>, where it is said that Moses and the elders saw the God of Israel; and again in the Lord's own words, speaking of little ones, "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:10">Matthew  18:10</a>), and many like expressions, so that many have assumed that God is seen in some personal way, in spite of the repeated statement of Scripture that no one has seen Him.<a name=476:9></a> John says, "No one has seen God at any time" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>), and then even after the revelation of God in Christ, Paul says, "dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor is able to see" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:16">1 Timothy  6:16</a>.<a name=476:10></a> So that we must understand that God in His infinite Being -- His essential Being -- is far beyond our power of comprehension, in so far as the infinite is beyond the finite.<a name=476:11></a>

		How the scriptures which speak of His being seen can be explained, is a matter for patient inquiry; but we have to dismiss all idea of God being apprehended in any personal way, save as in Christ.<a name=477:1></a> There is a sense in which He may be apprehended attributively, that is, in the physical creation, for it is said that "the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:20">Romans  1:20</a>); but "the things that are made" are not personal, and so they do not present God in His essential Being.<a name=477:2></a> God is also seen in that world where everything is of Him -- the world of new creation, where all things are of God.<a name=477:3></a> We can understand how much there is to be seen that speaks of God there; but when we come to His essential Being it is in Christ only that He is seen, both now and in eternity.<a name=477:4></a> Nevertheless, although He is invisible, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no man hath seen or can see, there was, as I said, that which was known of Him among men.<a name=477:5></a> There was all His beneficence and goodness, first in the garden and then in the rain and fruitful seasons, then in the law; but in spite of all these things, God was in reproach in this world, and so the Lord says, "The reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:9">Psalm  69:9</a>), and that not partially so, but altogether so, for He was the complete representation of God, He was the image of the invisible God.<a name=477:6></a> Man discerned it, Satan discerned it, and so the reproaches fell upon Him in all their weight.<a name=477:7></a> He says in that psalm, "Reproach hath broken my heart" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:20">Psalm  69:20</a>; He was conscious of it.<a name=477:8></a>

		Now, as I say, I take it up in Moses, who is regarded as a great servant of God in the Old Testament; indeed, the first official servant, as we may say.<a name=478:4></a> As God begins anything we get certain features that mark it throughout, and this feature -- reproach -- as I hope to show, has marked the servants of the testimony from the outset, and it will mark them to the end.<a name=478:5></a> It is said of Moses, "when he had become great", that is to say, when he had arrived at a period of his life when he was capable spiritually of making a choice, "he .<a name=478:6></a>.<a name=478:7></a>.<a name=478:8></a> refused to be called son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God .<a name=478:9></a>.<a name=478:10></a>.<a name=478:11></a> esteeming the reproach of the Christ".<a name=478:12></a> Some of you may wonder how the reproach of Christ could be known by Moses.<a name=478:13></a> Sometimes we assume that Abraham, Jacob or Moses could address a company of Christians, but it is an entire mistake to think so.<a name=478:14></a> Their intelligence was only partial; it is the Holy Spirit who says that Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ.<a name=478:15></a> He never gave it that name.<a name=478:16></a> It is the Spirit of God who names the features of the Old Testament saints; hence in the long list in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>we have the Holy Spirit naming faith, naming certain incidents in the Old Testament servants by the designation -- 'faith'.<a name=478:17></a> If you look back to the Old Testament you will find the word is not used in this way in connection with these men, but the Holy Spirit speaks of it in the persons mentioned; the thing was there.<a name=478:18></a>

		I have been exercised in regard to this meeting to speak a little about the unity of the Spirit, and in thinking over it, it appears to me that in Scripture it is connected with the thought of princes.<a name=486:1></a> The unity of the Spirit is a universal thought; you may recall the word in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>in regard to the saints: "princes shalt thou make them in all the earth" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:16">Psalm  45:16</a>); without a goodly distribution of princes universally, we can scarcely look for the unity of the Spirit, in fact we shall be little better than nonconformist communities, which means that we are non-catholic and in a great measure local independencies.<a name=486:2></a> Hence the importance, as I have said, of a goodly distribution of princes according to God abroad among the saints.<a name=486:3></a> The means of establishing princes is here on earth, and the psalm I referred to indicates that it is a divine thought that they should be in <i>all</i> the earth, which means a general or universal distribution.<a name=486:4></a> The Levites of old as a levitical family were to be distributed throughout the land for the same reason that there should be an equalisation and a generalisation of heavenly influence, so that the same traits, the same feelings, and the same sympathies should mark all the people of God.<a name=486:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of princes is very old, for you will remember it is in Jacob that it is set out; as he was on his way back from Padan-aram God met him, and said that his name henceforth would be Israel, which means prince of God, and there can be no princely state or dignity apart from a transaction with God.<a name=486:6></a> The power of lifting up is with Him, it is He who makes princes, lifting up the beggar from the dunghill

		and setting him amongst princes; so that we have the idea set out in Jacob, and once an idea is set out in Scripture it is never lost sight of, it is carried through.<a name=487:1></a> We find in Numbers that it shows itself in the way of unity -- the twelve princes in Israel were all governed by the same estimate, typically, of Christ.<a name=487:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope to work out these thoughts in the passages in the Acts, but at the outset I want to make it clear how the princely feature shows itself in the wilderness.<a name=487:3></a> I refer now to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>.<a name=487:4></a> These twelve men, it says, came forward and offered on the day that the tabernacle was set up and anointed; they had the altar particularly in view; but first they came forward with their offering for the Levites, for the first evidence of princely means will appear in the way in which the Levites are provided for.<a name=487:5></a> But I am not concerned for the moment with the provision for the Levites, but with the unity that marked those who made the provision.<a name=487:6></a> There were the covered wagons, as you will remember, six of them, each one offered by two princes; two are always better than one, and certainly this is so in the expression of love.<a name=487:7></a> Two would convey the idea of unity in principle, so that however reduced the people of God may be, we have the means, if there are but two of the assembly, of exhibiting the idea.<a name=487:8></a> We could never hope to present the <i>complete</i> thought now of anything, but what we may do, we may present the thing in the principle of it, and we may do that even if there are only two of us according to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=487:9></a> The covered wagons (notice that they were <i>covered</i>) were to provide for the comfort of the Levites, they were in view of that; the Levites had to be considered, and we must not assume that <i>anything</i> will do for them.<a name=487:10></a> Certainly if we think of them in regard to God, anything that they presented to Him would not do; they were particular as to what they presented;

	<div class="paragraph">
		they were not to present the fag end, but their very best.<a name=488:1></a> And so we must ever remember that anything <i>will not do</i>; the comfort of the Levites has to be taken into account, and so the wagons were <i>covered</i>.<a name=488:2></a> I only just touch on that.<a name=488:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to point out briefly how the princely feature shows itself in the dedication of the altar; it is one of the finest features in the book of Numbers, because the altar itself has to be taken account of, as distinct from what is presented on it.<a name=488:4></a> The fire was to be kept burning continually there.<a name=488:5></a> It had been anointed seven times; it stood out therefore in the more public appurtenances of the tabernacle as the most distinct.<a name=488:6></a> It was a public thing, and referred to the fulness of suffering in Christ, and the princes come to light in this chapter as taking account of <i>it</i>; that is, they understood that the position they occupied had involved suffering.<a name=488:7></a> The greatest 'prince' in our dispensation wished to fill up that which was behind of the tribulations of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the assembly.<a name=488:8></a> He was not passing things on, although he called upon others to suffer as a matter of privilege, but he led the way himself.<a name=488:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>what we find is that these men offered three vessels, all of them filled, signifying that they themselves typically were filled with the things that the types represent.<a name=488:10></a> Two vessels were of silver and the third was of gold; the weight of one silver vessel was one hundred and thirty shekels and that of the other seventy shekels, but they were both full, and then the vessel of gold was filled with incense.<a name=488:11></a> The first two vessels full of fine flour point to a great apprehension by the believer of the humanity of Christ; the apprehension of what is set forth in the fine flour mingled with oil would become material for unity, but the incense was for the delight of God.<a name=488:12></a> It was contained in the smaller vessel -- the golden

		spoon; it is what is presented to God and it is in a convenient vessel, for what is to be presented to God must not be in great bulk; indeed, whilst scripture makes much of bulk for the priests and the people, the general idea is quality and not quantity.<a name=489:1></a> So that we have the golden spoon, a small vessel filled with that which is most precious, for if you speak to God, the point is not amount but quality.<a name=489:2></a> You are to pray with the spirit, but you are to pray with the understanding also; your spirit may be full of things, but your understanding qualifies and limits what you say, so that you present something definite that God can accept and which is a delight to Him; the incense was in a <i>golden</i> vessel.<a name=489:3></a> We do not worship simply as redeemed; as redeemed, we are to become worshippers -- vessels filled with Christ.<a name=489:4></a> We are not redeemed as men and women to live in the flesh; the vessels of silver are filled with fine flour and mingled with oil.<a name=489:5></a> Therefore, if we are redeemed, we are to be full of Christ viewed in the perfection of His humanity here, that is to say, Jesus Christ, as mentioned in the first part of Romans; it is <i>Jesus Christ</i>, meaning that kind of man -- the Man who did God's will, the kind of man that was brought here in Him.<a name=489:6></a> The first two vessels are full of that -- flour mingled with oil-the perfect holy humanity of Christ, energised by the Spirit.<a name=489:7></a> The gold refers to the divine nature.<a name=489:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides these vessels the princes offered sacrifices.<a name=489:9></a> The offerings all taken together denote youthful maturity; some are spoken of as a year old -- one yearling lamb -- others denote maturity -- one ram, but taken together they indicate that while these princes were in youthful energy they were not babes.<a name=489:10></a> The Corinthians were babes; they could not conform to order like this, it belongs to the epistle to the Ephesians, and denotes appreciation of man according to Christ -- humanity altogether above petty feelings,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now having said so much about princes characteristically, I want to show how these thoughts worked out in the Acts, because the Acts may be regarded not as a code for us, but as a book of precedents.<a name=490:3></a> We see there how things worked out in persons, and I wish to connect the thought of unity in Acts, first, with the work of God, secondly with universal need, or need anywhere amongst the people of God, then with the service of God, and finally with the maintenance of doctrine, or right principles universally.<a name=490:4></a>

		Barnabas is taken as a typical 'prince' of the New Testament.<a name=490:5></a> As I said, Scripture never loses sight of anything that is introduced, and as the great princely idea is introduced in Jacob, so it is followed up in the Old Testament and in the New.<a name=490:6></a> Barnabas comes on the scene in a princely way; in no sense did he appear as a liability on the company; he was an immense asset to the company, as a prince would be, and always is.<a name=490:7></a> Hence, the apostles were quick to discern it, and gave him his title, for every prince should have a title.<a name=490:8></a> They surnamed him Barnabas, which is, being interpreted, son of consolation.<a name=490:9></a> They were glad to see him; he appeared at an opportune time; he had lands, it says, and sold them.<a name=490:10></a> He did not give them away, he did not leave them, but exercised right judgment in the matter, for the more spiritual a man is, the more practical he is, and the less likely he is to be extreme or abnormal.<a name=490:11></a> So he did not leave his lands, and say they were of no value.<a name=490:12></a> They <i>were</i> of value, and he sold them, having in view that the price should be for the furtherance of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Trustworthiness is one feature of the apostles they are marked off in that way, and Barnabas recognised that they were so, and he could therefore entrust them with the money.<a name=491:4></a> There can be no assembly, no representation of the assembly, unless there is confidence, unless I have a sense that they are men that I can trust; and I cannot trust anyone save the one Christ trusts, for He is a better judge than I am.<a name=491:5></a> And it is so that the Lord entrusts His things to certain ones, and these things are infinitely greater than anything I have, and Barnabas recognised that; he recognised delegated authority, so he laid the money at the feet of the apostles.<a name=491:6></a> It is an expression of humility, but of marked wisdom, and discernment as to what would be fitting at that time; and so he gets his title, for as I said, every prince has his title, and therefore we can regard Barnabas as a representative prince, and he was such.<a name=491:7></a> Scripture does not need to bring them all forward, here is one, and he has "his day".<a name=491:8></a>

		You will remember in the chapter from which I read in Numbers that when the princes proposed to dedicate the altar, Jehovah says to Moses, referring to the presentation of their offerings, "each prince on his day".<a name=491:9></a> Each of you may depend upon it, that God will give you <i>your</i> day; much may enter into that day, and much depends upon how you may behave yourself in it.<a name=491:10></a> That each prince should have his day was the divine proposition, not that of Moses;

		In the case of the covered wagons, Jehovah says, "Take it of them" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7:5">Numbers  7:5</a>), and He told Moses what to do with them; but when you come to the dedication of the altar, the position is, as I said, that each prince has a day.<a name=492:4></a> The offerer is in the presence of God, where everything is naked and exposed, the hidden motives behind your offerings are perfectly known.<a name=492:5></a> Barnabas led the way and had his day; Ananias and Sapphira -- <i>would-be</i> princes -- come next; they have their day, but how do they figure in it?<a name=492:6></a> A terrible picture they present!<a name=492:7></a> "Why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?<a name=492:8></a>" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:3">Acts  5:3</a>.<a name=492:9></a> They had sold their lands, and pretended that they had brought the money, but they had kept back part, they had not brought it all.<a name=492:10></a> A terrible breakdown in would-be princes!<a name=492:11></a> Alas!<a name=492:12></a> the coasts are strewed with persons who would be princes of the congregation, but who keep back part of their wealth and lie to the Holy Spirit.<a name=492:13></a> Is God mocked?<a name=492:14></a> Not at all; they have had their day, but they were exposed; God had no delight in their offering, nor has He any pleasure in half-hearted people, nor any pleasure in those who lie; they will be put to the test; Ananias and Sapphira had to lie to try and cover themselves, but to no avail; they were exposed and came under the judgment of God.<a name=492:15></a> I need not go into the terrible results in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>; what I am occupied with is the prince that God brings forward early in the Acts -- Barnabas.<a name=492:16></a> We hear nothing of him again until the time arrives for him to shine; he <i>is</i> qualified as a prince, he has been given his title, but in chapter 11 the time has come for him to show his princely

		I want you to note that I am speaking of the unity of the Spirit; the work of God had taken effect outside of Jerusalem, for God is sovereign; He works where He will, and by whom He will, and it is for us to recognise the unity as to His operations.<a name=493:2></a> The danger was that Jerusalem would take offence, for they had no part in this movement.<a name=493:3></a> The apostles were in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit had come down there, and yet here is a work of God apart from Jerusalem, in which they had no part.<a name=493:4></a> A few scattered Christians, going down to Antioch, had preached the gospel there and got converts.<a name=493:5></a> What is Jerusalem going to do?<a name=493:6></a> What should <i>we</i> do?<a name=493:7></a> A work of God may take place near by us and we have no part in it; God is working without us.<a name=493:8></a> What are we going to do about it?<a name=493:9></a> Jerusalem is equal to the test; they select Barnabas to go as far as Antioch -- it is a fine expression of the endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit.<a name=493:10></a> They had already given Barnabas his title, and now they send him forth as representing them.<a name=493:11></a> Does he go down to Antioch as an ecclesiastical representative, as Saul had done earlier to Damascus with letters from the high priest?<a name=493:12></a> Barnabas had no such letters, he goes down to Antioch and seeing the grace of God he rejoiced.<a name=493:13></a> Jerusalem, under God, had selected the right man, and they in this way maintained the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.<a name=493:14></a> The work at Antioch was thus linked up livingly with Jerusalem and there was no rivalry; Ephraim, on the one hand, does not envy Judah, nor does Judah vex Ephraim; and so the work of God prospered, and thus there was a spiritual link between the two places; and then the Holy Spirit tells us what kind of man Barnabas was -- confirming his title, he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith -- that is, he was a prince of God.<a name=493:15></a>

		I come now to the close of the chapter; universal need existed and Jerusalem is in view as in the mind of God; certain <i>prophets</i> came down from Jerusalem, for it was no doubt the most spiritual assembly at the time.<a name=494:8></a> It had its Barnabas, its Peter, its James, and it also had its prophets -- men who had the mind of God, and these came down to Antioch.<a name=494:9></a> The mind of God is thus brought to the assembly there and one from among the prophets named Agabus, announced that there should be universal famine, and that announcement brought other princes to light -- disciples who were well off.<a name=494:10></a>

		I wish to convey in what I may say the dignity and elevation of the holy system with which we are connected, and I have selected these four scriptures as presenting these features as they are set out in Christ as having gone into heaven as Man.<a name=500:1></a> We have first in His setting Himself down on the right hand of the greatness on <i>high</i> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>) the idea, not only of greatness, but of elevation; then, secondly, we have in chapter 8 the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the <i>heavens</i>.<a name=500:2></a> In chapter 10 He has sat down on the right hand of <i>God</i>, and lastly in chapter 12 He is set down at the right hand of the <i>throne</i> of God.<a name=500:3></a> I wish to connect what I have to say with those four features of the Lord's position in heaven in order that we may see that the system evolved from Him necessarily takes on the dignity and elevation spoken of.<a name=500:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gospel of Luke corresponds in measure with this epistle, particularly from the standpoint of which I am speaking, for whilst it presents Christ as Man and as coming into the world in extreme lowliness, yet we have the idea of the "Highest" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:32">Luke  1:32</a>) from the outset.<a name=500:5></a> The angel says to Mary, "The power of the Highest overshadow thee" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>), and also, "He shall be called the Son of the Highest" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:32">Luke  1:32</a>.<a name=500:6></a> Elevation is seen in view of the extreme humiliation.<a name=500:7></a> Then, too we have the heavenly host praising God at the birth of Christ and saying, "Glory to God in the highest" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:14">Luke  2:14</a>.<a name=500:8></a> So the great thought is introduced at once in connection with the incarnation, and when we come to chapter 19 at the descent of the mount of Olives, the multitude of the disciples say, "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19:38">Luke  19:38</a>); and, in order to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the gospel which presents the Lord as Man here, coming in as He did in the lowliest circumstances, emphasises the idea of elevation, in order that the announcement, as supported in this narrative, should be accompanied by a heavenly calling.<a name=501:2></a> I am persuaded that, apart from the apprehension and hope of the heavenly calling, our testimony must be on a very low level indeed.<a name=501:3></a> In chapter 10 we find the seventy returning much engaged with their ministry, a ministry accredited by divine power, so that even the demons were subject, but the Lord says, "Rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:20">Luke  10:20</a>.<a name=501:4></a> So that, as I said, the record which supports the gospel as presented to Gentiles emphasises the idea of elevation and of the heavenly calling of the saints; and it is in the apprehension of the calling that our testimony takes on a heavenly and elevated character.<a name=501:5></a>

		Now in Hebrews 1, as we have observed, the Lord "set Himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>.<a name=501:6></a> The idea of elevation must proceed from Christ, indeed everything of God must proceed from Him, and hence chapter 1 brings out the truth of His Person.<a name=501:7></a> God had spoken earlier by prophets, but in the last days "in the person of the Son" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a>.<a name=501:8></a> It is of all moment that we should have a right apprehension of the Person of Christ.<a name=501:9></a> He is what He is, whether at the right hand of the greatness on high, or in the manger at Bethlehem.<a name=501:10></a> It is most important to have the thought of the Person in our souls; for the speaking has come in through One who is no less than God, through One who is indeed "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>) -- a word which we should scarcely have used, but the Holy Spirit applies it.<a name=501:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak from these scriptures about deliverance from the world, and of our being maintained as delivered from it.<a name=508:1></a> I have in mind particularly the religious world, for the religious world in Scripture is treated as representing the world generally.<a name=508:2></a> The rudiments of the world according to Colossians are what mark the current recognised religion of man.<a name=508:3></a> They are called rudiments of the world, for in truth, though they take on nominally the names of Christ and of God, they have their origin in the world and are essentially worldly; so that all the features of the world appear ultimately in Babylon.<a name=508:4></a> What in Colossians are called the "elements of the world" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:8">Colossians  2:8</a>), are in Galatians called "beggarly principles" <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:9">Galatians  4:9</a>.<a name=508:5></a> The Christians in the Galatian district were taking on these things in addition to what the gospel presented.<a name=508:6></a> They are called beggarly as meaning that they are utterly impoverished as set over against what is of God and the Spirit of God; however classical or ancient they may appear, they are in fact beggarly.<a name=508:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show from Matthew how the Lord indicated in His own path the way of deliverance from the religious world.<a name=508:8></a> Matthew is particularly occupied with the world as an organised system in opposition to God, having its centre in Jerusalem.<a name=508:9></a> Other scriptures refer to the world as the men in it.<a name=508:10></a> You will find that Matthew presents Christ as dealing with <i>twos</i>, meaning that He aimed at breaking up the world as an organised system, so we have two demoniacs, and two blind men; over against that, the ass and the colt, and "two of you" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>), that is, two of the assembly; God meets organisation by organisation.<a name=508:11></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=509>[Page 509]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord, in breaking up organised opposition to God, exposes it, and <i>leaves</i> it, for we should not leave anything without giving reasons, and the reasons, if according to God, are the exposure of the things we leave.<a name=509:1></a> If we thus expose something and abandon it, our object would be that others should abandon it also.<a name=509:2></a> A lead thereby is given, which is another great principle with God.<a name=509:3></a> The Lord in Matthew is seen leading.<a name=509:4></a> In chapter 12 the religious system is seen as a house; in chapter 16 I hope to show that the system is seen in its leaders, and in chapter 24 in its grandeur and finery.<a name=509:5></a> The believer is thus furnished by the Lord with what enables him to judge and to turn away from the system in all its features.<a name=509:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The house aspect of the system is perhaps the most attractive to the young; you find family gatherings there, social events, garden parties -- what you may regard as a 'living' state of things.<a name=509:7></a> You say, We have life in our church, we have social functions, happy gatherings, sewing classes and dancing classes, for they have even added these in our day, for they have in mind to hold the young, and it is true the young are held, but alas!<a name=509:8></a> it is in bondage to the world.<a name=509:9></a> You find enjoyable seasons and everything regarded as 'life'.<a name=509:10></a> You are thus in the system regarded from the family side.<a name=509:11></a> In chapter 12 the Lord views the whole Jewish system as a house, but He leaves it for the same reason as that for which you should leave modern religious systems, if you are in any of them.<a name=509:12></a> I do not enlarge on His word here, it has its own power, lest you should think that I am unduly attacking what is around.<a name=509:13></a> But the Lord definitely leaves the house.<a name=509:14></a> He had spoken about sinning against the Holy Spirit, about an unpardonable sin, and about their own <i>sons</i> casting out demons -- a family touch, then He went out of the house and sat by the seaside.<a name=509:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Young people, this word is for you, especially if you have not left that house; the Lord is indicating a lead that you should follow: "That same day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea".<a name=510:14></a> If He sat down, He is not going back again; you may be assured of that.<a name=510:15></a> Stephen saw Him standing -- it was an attitude of grace, and He would have gone back, if they had repented; but Paul sees Him sitting, for He is not going back; you may expect Him to, but He will not go back, and your wisdom is to find <i>where He is</i>.<a name=510:16></a>

		He sat by the sea to sow, for He will bring in another order of things; and then in verse 36 He goes into another house, for there is another house, and there are brethren and fathers and mothers; you will not be left orphaned, you will find these and you will be enriched.<a name=510:17></a> The disciples (verse 36) come to Him as He goes into the house and ask Him a question.<a name=510:18></a> It is a time for asking questions; one hears questions everywhere and one is glad of it, for the Lord delights to answer all our questions.<a name=510:19></a> He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the part we have spoken of is mainly for the young, but in chapter 16 we have something for those who are older.<a name=511:7></a> It is concerned with the Pharisees and Sadducees.<a name=511:8></a> As you grow up to manhood and womanhood you begin to think, and you will find these thinkers in the world, and they think according to their schools.<a name=511:9></a> The Pharisees are those who are orthodox, but they spin their theories out of their own minds; they recognise the Fathers and even the scriptures, but they take no account of what God is doing.<a name=511:10></a> They can discern the face of the sky; they can prognosticate accurately, as the Lord says in another place, "and so it happens" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:54">Luke  12:54</a>); they are correct in what they forecast.<a name=511:11></a> We are not to wonder at this, for the man of sin will say and do wonderful things; the second beast of Revelation will do great wonders.<a name=511:12></a> The Lord refers in chapter

		Then there is another class of thinkers; they think nothing of the Bible, they will tell you that it was all exploded long ago; they are Sadducees, they believe nothing they do not see.<a name=512:6></a> You hear these conflicting things and it may be you are bewildered -- many are.<a name=512:7></a> There are many who have taken refuge in the most ancient forms of religion, attracted by their grandeur and finery in order to escape the confusion and bewilderment of what the mind of man has evolved.<a name=512:8></a> These two great lines honeycomb Christendom, and the Lord in His lead and in His own withering way would say, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas".<a name=512:9></a> Note what follows, "And he left them and went away".<a name=512:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These men pay no attention to God and the work of God.<a name=512:11></a> If you read the books of the leaders of religion written during the last century, you will find no reference to the great current work of God.<a name=512:12></a> It is not that they do not know of it, but they entirely ignore what they know.<a name=512:13></a> To such the Lord says, "a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas".<a name=512:14></a> There is no need to pretend to have signs, for the Lord says there shall be none.<a name=512:15></a> There were signs at the beginning, but the present time is entirely in faith, not signs.<a name=512:16></a> Paul always taught his hearers to look at what was not seen.<a name=512:17></a> I am not denying that there will be signs, for there will be such -- real satanic workings which will head up in the man of sin with

		J.T.<a name=518:1></a> The object I have in mind in suggesting this scripture is not that we should dwell on the body of the epistle, that is, the teaching or doctrine of it, but that we might see as a principle the effect of the teaching on the teacher and on the taught -- as seen in Paul and in Titus.<a name=518:2></a> The apostle says more about himself in the epistle to the Galatians, as to his early history, than he does in any other of his epistles, and it is not indeed to occupy them with himself, but to call attention to the effect on himself of the truth that he intended to impress upon them.<a name=518:3></a> It occurred to me, in thinking of it, that the principle brought out, whilst simple as on the surface of the passage, is of all importance if ministry is to be effective; if it is to be catholic in its results, the minister must himself be governed by it and be an exponent of it.<a name=518:4></a> I suppose we are alive to the tendency there is with us of being influenced by what is of prestige on the earth, particularly what is of religious prestige (we are influenced at times more than we are aware of by what is of the earth), whereas what Paul says about himself in these chapters shows that what was on the earth, whatever its prestige, had no influence with him; that, in fact, knowing what his natural proclivities were as intensely Jewish, he made it a point that it should not have influence with him.<a name=518:5></a> So as a result we have what we may call catholic Christianity, for it was Paul's strenuous exercise as to himself first, and then in combating others, to secure this for the saints that they might stand in the liberty wherewith Christ had set them free.<a name=518:6></a>

		The great body of the Scriptures has to do with what transpired subsequent to the foundation of the world, with what occurred indeed since the present formation depicted in Genesis 1 and 2.<a name=573:4></a> But whilst the Scriptures have been engaged from that time with current occurrences, we can read certain parts as bearing on God's primary thoughts, particularly the formation of Adam and the formation of Eve.<a name=573:5></a> We can understand by reading these scriptures that God had His primary thoughts in mind.<a name=573:6></a> Thus in all the scriptures dealing with current events -- the incoming of sin and all its train -- God always had His eternal thoughts before Him, and that these must take form in due course.<a name=573:7></a> His righteousness, and His power, and His love have come to light in dealing with current developments, but His primary thoughts have ever been present, so that we can look back and see how glimpses of them were furnished.<a name=573:8></a>

		In chapter 22 Isaac is raised from the dead in figure, and then he is out of view so far as Scripture goes, until chapter 24, but as a type of Christ he is in the faith of Abraham.<a name=575:5></a> Although Abraham comes down from the mountain, there is nothing said about Isaac coming down.<a name=575:6></a> (See verse 19.<a name=575:7></a>) Abraham comes down to his young men and they go together -- a most interesting company, governed by the faith of Abraham; they go together to Beer-sheba, denoting spiritual history, and they dwell there, that is to say, you have a company in the light of the resurrection of Christ, and, I may say, of His ascension, for He went up.<a name=575:8></a> You have a company dwelling together at Beer-sheba -- the well of the oath -- and they are dwelling under the wing of divine faithfulness; that is the position opened up to us in the letters to Corinth.<a name=575:9></a> "God is <i>faithful</i>, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>.<a name=575:10></a> God is <i>faithful</i> "who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:13">1 Corinthians  10:13</a>.<a name=575:11></a> "God is faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay .<a name=575:12></a>.<a name=575:13></a>.<a name=575:14></a> but yea is in him.<a name=575:15></a> For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:18">2 Corinthians  1:18</a> - 20.<a name=575:16></a>

		The first great desire of the apostle was that the saints should be intelligent.<a name=581:4></a> The prophet Hosea speaks about the people of God being destroyed for lack of knowledge (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#4:6">Hosea  4:6</a>), and the same prophet says, "And we shall know, -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is assured as the morning dawn" <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:3">Hosea  6:3</a>.<a name=581:5></a> It is an apprehension of Christ as He is, risen and glorified, so that the great burden of the first prayer is that the saints should be spiritually intelligent, hence he says, "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling".<a name=581:6></a> It is a question of state.<a name=581:7></a> It is the Holy Spirit in relation to the upper affections and faculties; "being enlightened in the <i>eyes of your heart</i>".<a name=581:8></a> The affections are involved, but the higher affections, because it is a question of heaven, and what relates to God.<a name=581:9></a>

		It is not a question here of living water, but of the <i>higher</i> affections, and intelligence -- all that relates to God: "what is the hope of his calling".<a name=581:10></a> Have you ever thought, beloved, of what the hope of God's calling is?<a name=581:11></a> The emphasis is on <i>His</i> -- what His calling is, for it is wholly according to His mind, according to Himself.<a name=581:12></a> Everything that is connected with God in that way is according to Himself in the greatness of it.<a name=581:13></a> Then the next thing is "the riches of the glory of <i>his</i> inheritance in the saints" -- what <i>He</i> has in the saints.<a name=581:14></a> How differently they are

		I wish to speak about the faithfulness of God, and as in all else we have to apprehend the idea as it came out in Christ.<a name=585:1></a> God's faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds, we are told.<a name=585:2></a> It is its far-reachingness that is emphasised, and so it appears from the outset that He is a faithful Creator.<a name=585:3></a> We have about us every day the evidences of His faithfulness in the creation, particularly the creation as it existed after the deluge, for He had entered into an engagement with it through Noah and his sons, that while the earth remained there should be seed-time and harvest, day and night, summer and winter, cold and heat.<a name=585:4></a> Thus everything furnishes the evidence of His bounty, for under these conditions we have rain and fruitful seasons, through which men's hearts are filled with food and gladness.<a name=585:5></a> While seasons may vary, as they do, the general fact remains that God has been wonderfully true to His engagement in physical things.<a name=585:6></a> The Christian, the godly believer, recognises this daily, as he partakes of those divine bounties for the sustenance of his body, and glorifies God in it, for these things are given, and are sanctified by the word of God and prayer.<a name=585:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus from the very outset of our histories here, we are surrounded with the evidences of the faithfulness of God, and then as the gospel comes to us, it abounds with evidences of the same thing in a spiritual way; so that we have the idea emphasised in Romans and in the letters to the Corinthians, as well as elsewhere, but particularly in the epistles that take account of Christians in their early histories.<a name=585:8></a>

		But whether it be in an individual way, or in a collective way, we are led to understand that we can rely upon God.<a name=586:1></a> One has been made to feel of late, if we regard ourselves in a collective sense, how dependent we are on the faithfulness of God.<a name=586:2></a> As the enemy attacks in one way or another, and there are no rules by which to hold things together according to the principles of man, we are made to prove how dependent on God we are.<a name=586:3></a> It is a veritable miracle that men and women scattered throughout the world, without visible means of holding themselves together, are preserved, for we are preserved.<a name=586:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those of us who understand something of these epistles have learned to nestle in regard of what is collective under the wing of divine faithfulness.<a name=586:5></a> The apostle says to the Corinthians, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>) and again, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear, but will with the temptation make the issue also" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:13">1 Corinthians  10:13</a>), so that in the temptation what is of God in us is brought into evidence.<a name=586:6></a> Thus we are able to bear it; for what is of God in us is never overwhelmed.<a name=586:7></a> What at times might appear to engulf us melts away so that we are filled with power.<a name=586:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the apostle goes on immediately to say, "I speak as to intelligent persons" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:15">1 Corinthians  10:15</a>), and then he proceeds to speak of the Lord's supper.<a name=586:9></a> The Lord's supper is preserved on that principle -- under the wing of divine faithfulness.<a name=586:10></a> In the next epistle when Paul's veracity is questioned, he says, "Now God is faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay.<a name=586:11></a> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea is in him.<a name=586:12></a> For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:18">2 Corinthians  1:18</a> - 20.<a name=586:13></a> You see he advances in the subject as

		It is illustrated in Abraham in a very striking and simple way.<a name=587:6></a> No doubt all of you will have noticed the prominence given to Beersheba, especially in the book of Genesis.<a name=587:7></a> It appears in connection with an engagement by Abraham.<a name=587:8></a> He entered into an engagement with Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, and the requirement was that he should do no harm to the king or to his sons, or to his sons' sons, and Abraham accepted it and entered into a covenant according to that requirement, and the place of the covenant was called Beersheba.<a name=587:9></a> Beersheba means the well of the oath.<a name=587:10></a> Abraham dug the well there.<a name=587:11></a> It arose from the thought of Abraham being true to his engagement.<a name=587:12></a> The Philistines had evidently taken a well of water away, and Abraham had reproved the king on account of this; then he said to the king, "That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21:29">Genesis  21:29</a>.<a name=587:13></a> He gave him more, but he gave him particularly these seven ewe-lambs, and the king naturally inquired as to the meaning of this gift.<a name=587:14></a> Abraham answered, "That they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21:30">Genesis  21:30</a>.<a name=587:15></a> These seven ewe-lambs represented the spirit in which Abraham intended to live

		Now that was Beersheba, and following it, in the next chapter, Abraham is called upon to offer up Isaac, which he does, and in figure he received Christ from the dead.<a name=588:3></a> And now he has not only got the promise, but the oath, the confirmation, the two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie.<a name=588:4></a> He had strong consolation, and so he descends from the mount as having received Christ from the dead.<a name=588:5></a> He returned to his young men, for Isaac is not now in view; it is a question of Christ risen.<a name=588:6></a> He has gone up and every promise is thus sure; the promise and Christ risen go together.<a name=588:7></a> Below there is Abraham and his young men; and these go together.<a name=588:8></a> The latter is a hint of assembly formation -- the experienced old brother who has counted on God, and relied on His faithfulness, and who has the confirmation of the promise of God in the oath, thus having the consummation of everything in his soul, going along together with young men.<a name=588:9></a> It is, as I said, a hint at assembly formation, where the old and young are together, and so they dwell at Beersheba -- they dwell there.<a name=588:10></a> They are dwelling under the wing of known divine faithfulness, for God is faithful.<a name=588:11></a> It is known to Abraham, for he had proved the faithfulness of God.<a name=588:12></a> And so it is apparent that the understanding of 1 and 2 Corinthians from this standpoint enables us even now, in a day of brokenness and weakness, to dwell together under the wing of divine faithfulness, for God is faithful.<a name=588:13></a>

		Moses with the passages read in Timothy before I go to Matthew.<a name=591:1></a> I do that because of prophetic indications made at his birth.<a name=591:2></a> Prophecy brings in the mind of God before the thing comes to pass.<a name=591:3></a> I dwell on this for a moment, so that the young may understand the connection in which ministry is set.<a name=591:4></a> The delicate seed sown long before should mature, and develop, and correspond with the mind of God delivered by prophecy.<a name=591:5></a> I speak thus, so that we may not think lightly of divine service.<a name=591:6></a> Every servant is watched over not only from his birth, but long before; such is God's interest in the vessels that He uses in His ministry, and so, as Moses was born there was something for the parents to see, not much, no doubt, but long before God had foreseen Moses, so in the beginning of Exodus we have the record of the marriage of his parents.<a name=591:7></a> His sister was born before him, Aaron was born before him, but no reference is made to them.<a name=591:8></a> A son is born, and that son, according to the New Testament, was "exceedingly lovely" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:20">Acts  7:20</a>.<a name=591:9></a> "By faith Moses, being born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child beautiful" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:23">Hebrews  11:23</a>.<a name=591:10></a> There was a prophetic indication of what was in that child, what was there was potential.<a name=591:11></a> There may not have been much, but enough for the parents; and so it is, beloved, in regard of those who minister.<a name=591:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I particularly confine my remarks to those who minister.<a name=591:13></a> The apostle says to Timothy, "Be not negligent of the gift that is in thee, which has been given to thee through prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the elderhood".<a name=591:14></a> These are two things -- gift by prophecy, and the hands of the elderhood.<a name=591:15></a> Prophecy is the mind of God about Timothy; to whom it was indicated it is not said, but that it was indicated there is no doubt, and that the apostle Paul had an idea, a divinely given impression, of it when he took up Timothy as a young man, there can be no doubt.<a name=591:16></a>

		In Acts 16:3 we read, "Him [Timothy] would Paul have go forth with him" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:3">Acts  16:3</a>.<a name=592:1></a> The apostle sorely needed such a companion.<a name=592:2></a> He had lost Barnabas, and the Lord gave him Timothy.<a name=592:3></a> He found Timothy and there was prophetic indication of gift.<a name=592:4></a> The brethren look for these things, for these prophetic indications of gift.<a name=592:5></a> Something will come to light to indicate what is there potentially.<a name=592:6></a> It may be clouded later, as it was with Moses, for there was no evidence of it in the house of Pharaoh.<a name=592:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The life of Moses was divided into three parts, but what was potentially in that babe was indicated at the beginning.<a name=592:8></a> There was no evidence of it while he was in Pharaoh's court, but when he became forty years of age and went out to see his brethren, he knew something about it himself then.<a name=592:9></a> And every brother should know it as a secret between himself and God.<a name=592:10></a> What he did on his own initiative was the outcome of his links and relations with God.<a name=592:11></a> His brethren did not understand, and they forced him away.<a name=592:12></a> We have to endure that, brethren, we have to learn how to serve unsympathetic people, and it is a wholesome exercise.<a name=592:13></a> The prophecy had gone before, but now Moses knew it himself; he was conscious of his interest in his brethren, and of his power to help, but the elderhood, so to speak, was not ready.<a name=592:14></a> The prophecy indicated what Moses was, but Moses personally was not yet equal to the prophecy concerning him.<a name=592:15></a> That requires the formation of the vessel and takes time, and that is where we lack.<a name=592:16></a> We all do.<a name=592:17></a> We expect the elderhood to lay their hands on us too soon, but the elderhood will not do that.<a name=592:18></a> The true elderhood lay their hands on persons who are formed, and you cannot deceive them, for with them it is a question of experience; they know something of Christ, the Vessel that suits God, so they are not too ready to lay their hands upon you; you have to qualify.<a name=592:19></a>

		Now I proceed to the next epistle, and here Paul says, "I put thee in mind to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of <i>my</i> hands".<a name=593:2></a> This is an advance, as you might expect; remember, if we are not advancing we are retrograding.<a name=593:3></a> If you have passed the elderhood, you may expect Paul's hands, that is to say, you are qualified now for something special.<a name=593:4></a> The elderhood is a general idea, prophecy is a general idea, it is the mind of God about the vessel, but now there is something special.<a name=593:5></a> I do not know of anyone else spoken of in this way.<a name=593:6></a> Timothy had received gift through the laying on of Paul's hands.<a name=593:7></a> When there was a general drift away from Paul, there was a special man there to stand up firmly for his ministry.<a name=593:8></a> If we lose it, I may say, we lose all, for Paul's ministry is the heavenly thing.<a name=593:9></a> What the assembly is to Christ, as the heavenly Man must never be surrendered, and hence the apostle urges on Timothy to rekindle the gift of God which was in him.<a name=593:10></a>

		And this leads me to Matthew; I need not remind you of the importance of special service, for it is the idea of special service in that gospel.<a name=593:11></a> "Who then is a faithful and prudent bondman?<a name=593:12></a>" He is singled out.<a name=593:13></a> It is not, Who are these?<a name=593:14></a> It is one person in view.<a name=593:15></a> It is not that that person accredits anything to himself -- far otherwise but the Lord inquires, 'Who is he?<a name=593:16></a>' "Who then is the faithful and prudent bondman?<a name=593:17></a>" In Mark's gospel the Lord says, "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:1">Mark  9:1</a>.<a name=593:18></a> There were six days to prepare, and certainly if I value seeing the kingdom of God coming in power, I shall not be unprepared, I shall not fail in anything to fit me for it, and so here the challenge is, "Who then is the faithful and prudent bondman?<a name=593:19></a>"
