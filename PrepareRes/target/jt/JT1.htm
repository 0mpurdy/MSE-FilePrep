		I desire to call attention to a thought with which, I think, all will agree, and which has a prominent place in Scripture.<a name=1:3></a> It is this, that the privilege of being in the Lord's company is much more blessed and of far greater importance than the most honoured and successful service here.<a name=1:4></a> I feel rather pressed to remind saints of this, as I fear there is often a tendency to give too much prominence to outward activity in the Lord's work, where the blessedness of being in His company is little sought or known; and, not only so, but very often with those who do know something of the blessedness, the activity of a servant's path so beclouds and disturbs the soul's communion with Him that quiet moments with Himself, apart from all here, are but seldom, if at all, enjoyed.<a name=1:5></a> Now, great damage is caused by this, for not only is the soul impoverished and the affections dulled, but also the Lord is robbed of His portion.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not that I would make light of service, for it is most blessed in its place; as we find with the Lord, "I delight to do thy will, O my God".<a name=1:7></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:8">Psalm  40:8</a>.<a name=1:8></a> His pleasure was to do the Father's will.<a name=1:9></a> Here we get the true idea of service.<a name=1:10></a> I am sure the Lord found pleasure in the service itself, as such, but His supreme delight lay in the consciousness that He was doing His Father's will.<a name=1:11></a> But the great defect in a good deal of our service is that the Lord's will is not known.<a name=1:12></a> I do not now refer to divine guidance in detail, but to the purpose of God.<a name=1:13></a> I do not think there can be any true service until this is, in some measure, apprehended.<a name=1:14></a> When the Lord said, "Lo, I come to do thy will", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:9">Hebrews  10:9</a>) I believe He had in view the whole range

		of what God was going to accomplish in grace, and it is the privilege of every servant to be, in principle, in His position here.<a name=2:1></a> But for this we have to see, as I have intimated, that our place and portion with Him is "that good part".<a name=2:2></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:42">Luke  10:42</a>.<a name=2:3></a> When I lay hold of this I am in a position to know my Lord's will, and my pleasure will be to carry it out, in my measure.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we shall be helped as we arrive at the Lord's side of things and apprehend what His thoughts are.<a name=2:5></a> With this in view, reference has been made to this passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>, where we have a glimpse of what occupied the Lord's heart at that time, and, indeed, of what occupies it, we may say, at this moment.<a name=2:6></a> There are few passages more beautiful.<a name=2:7></a> It comes in at the turning point of His blessed life, at a moment when, as far as outward circumstances were concerned, there was plenty to discourage.<a name=2:8></a> He was there as the vessel of grace, as chapter 4 so clearly shows, anointed of the Spirit for the setting forth of all that there was in the heart of God towards man.<a name=2:9></a> What did He meet with in carrying out His mission of love?<a name=2:10></a> Rejection from the outset, and the cross at the end.<a name=2:11></a> At Nazareth they thrust Him out, and led Him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast Him down headlong, and at Jerusalem they led Him to Golgotha, where He was crucified.<a name=2:12></a> It is most touching to notice that in His private life, as seen in chapter 2, He is in favour with God and man; but when we come to chapter 4, where His public ministry begins, He becomes the object of their bitterest persecutions; and this, too, at Nazareth, where He was brought up.<a name=2:13></a> What brought about the change?<a name=2:14></a> Simply this, that in chapter 4 He begins definitely to set forth God to man.<a name=2:15></a> Thus the natural heart was fully exposed.<a name=2:16></a> The reproaches were really directed against His Father, but they fell upon Him.<a name=2:17></a> All this is very solemn.<a name=2:18></a>

		Now these are the circumstances under which we have this beautiful passage in chapter 10.<a name=3:1></a> Comparing the parallel passage in Matthew, we see that His complete rejection by the nation was fully manifested.<a name=3:2></a> John the Baptist, too -- the one above all others on earth to whom He might have looked for sympathy -- began to doubt.<a name=3:3></a> Was the Lord indifferent to all this?<a name=3:4></a> Not at all.<a name=3:5></a> He felt all most keenly.<a name=3:6></a> He could say, "The reproaches of them that reproached thee have fallen upon me".<a name=3:7></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:9">Psalm  69:9</a>.<a name=3:8></a> But look at the moral grandeur of what comes out here!<a name=3:9></a> "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight".<a name=3:10></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a>,26.<a name=3:11></a> His pleasure is found in the fact that His own are the subjects of the Father's teaching.<a name=3:12></a> How blessed is this!<a name=3:13></a> He turns away from the sufferings, rejection, and service here to another scene, which evidently opens up before Him; where the Father was to be all, and where He was to have companions, taught of the Father, with Himself.<a name=3:14></a> The nation was rejecting Him, and Jehovah, as a consequence, was about to reject it; He was going to hide His face from the house of Jacob.<a name=3:15></a> But Jesus had disciples, children given to Him of the Father, and these were precious to Him.<a name=3:16></a> Refused by His beloved, but faithless, nation, His heart and hand would from henceforth be devoted to them.<a name=3:17></a> His pleasure was found in ministering to them and in the consciousness that they were the objects of the Father's love and care.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is what we have at this moment.<a name=3:19></a> Through death and resurrection the Lord has entered, as Man, into that blessed scene of light and love, the circle of divine affections, from whence He came to make God known; and look!<a name=3:20></a> He wants us there.<a name=3:21></a> He "died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the great point for the moment.<a name=4:4></a> But are we prepared for it?<a name=4:5></a> Are we ready to respond to His blessed desire to have us with Himself?<a name=4:6></a> Or are we going to allow other things to rob Him of what His heart is set upon?<a name=4:7></a> The latter is just that of which the "seventy" stood in danger.<a name=4:8></a> They were truly servants.<a name=4:9></a> They had been sent out by the Lord and endued with needed power for their mission.<a name=4:10></a> Now they return flushed with victory, saying, "even the devils are subject unto us through thy name", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:17">Luke  10:17</a>.<a name=4:11></a> This was encouraging as far as it went, but from the Lord's reply we gather that they were making more of their success as servants than of their privilege as associated with Him.<a name=4:12></a> He ministers a mild rebuke by telling them to rejoice not that the spirits were subject to them, but rather to rejoice that their names were written in heaven.<a name=4:13></a> In principle He simply reminds them of their heavenly portion, and points out that this is greater and of more importance than the most successful service in this world.<a name=4:14></a>

		THE RESULT OF CHRIST'S MINISTRY ON EARTH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		THE words written in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49:4">Isaiah  49:4</a> are prophetically those of the Lord Himself: "I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for naught, arid in vain".<a name=5:1></a> This was true in so far as Israel after the flesh was concerned.<a name=5:2></a> It is not to be forgotten that Christ came to man <i>as he was</i>, bearing blessed tidings to him from God, and relieving him of all the many ills that followed in the train of sin; as it is said, "Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:23">Matthew  4:23</a>.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This ministry on the part of the Lord was perfect, and calculated, if indeed such were possible, to reach and recover the heart of man for God.<a name=5:4></a> But such was not possible It is true indeed that in many instances an outward and passing effect was produced by the words and works of Christ, but it was only where the Father had wrought beforehand that a real and eternal effect resulted from the Lord's testimony.<a name=5:5></a> There was no fruit whatever save where the seed fell upon good ground, and the good ground was unquestionably divinely prepared.<a name=5:6></a> There may be the most perfect presentation of divine light (whose presentation of truth could be more perfect than the Lord's?<a name=5:7></a>) and yet, apart from the work of God in the soul, it must be utterly in vain.<a name=5:8></a> John the Baptist had come in the way of righteousness, calling upon the people to repent; the Lord came in perfect grace to fulfil the promises, without a complaint or demand, and by His miracles showing that power was there to set up the kingdom; yet, as far as man himself was concerned, all was without avail.<a name=5:9></a> The doleful strains

		of the Baptist, and the heavenly music of the Son of man, were alike without any appreciation or response.<a name=6:1></a> Men were like "the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#58:4">Psalm  58:4</a>, 5.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the effect on our own service of entering into all this will be that what is merely human will be shunned in the setting forth of the testimony of God, and there will be constant dependence upon the Lord that what is presented may be in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, and that it may come in contact with those whose hearts the Lord may open to receive it.<a name=6:3></a> Thus, although there may be little in the way of outward show, the effect will not be a transient one, as that which is produced by human eloquence and the like, and the faith of those who are reached will stand not in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.<a name=6:4></a> It must be remembered that while God <i>commands</i> repentance, He also <i>grants</i> it.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If man would not have Christ, if His "report" was altogether unheeded, and if in this respect His strength was spent for nothing, yet the Lord accomplished a vast deal.<a name=6:6></a> I do not now refer to the cross, but to the result of His ministry in connection with the Father's work.<a name=6:7></a> It is of the deepest interest to see the Father and Son working conjointly with a view to the carrying into effect of divine counsels.<a name=6:8></a> In connection with this the ministry of Christ was of great importance; it was the beginning and groundwork of "the vast universe of bliss", which God had purposed for Himself.<a name=6:9></a> I speak of His gathering, and of His forming, after His own blessed pattern, those whom the Father, in eternal love, had given and drawn to Him.<a name=6:10></a> In following the Lord in His pathway of service, as it is presented in the gospels, great blessing lies in the soul being led into the secret of what was

		before Him in it; and entering into this, we see not only the perfection of the service, but also its unique character.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, what was the immediate result of this work of love?<a name=7:2></a> This, that upon the Lord's ascension to heaven He left behind upon earth a vessel which was morally suitable for the reception of the Holy Ghost.<a name=7:3></a> This was a mighty result.<a name=7:4></a> Who but He could have effected it?<a name=7:5></a> I take great pleasure in regarding the little band, from whom the Lord was taken up at Bethany, as His own handiwork, and forming as such a vessel suitable for the reception of the Holy Ghost.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will now turn to look at this company for a moment.<a name=7:7></a> Luke, at the end of his first narrative, gives a most touching description of them.<a name=7:8></a> At the cross they had been scattered.<a name=7:9></a> The Shepherd was smitten and the sheep were scattered; this was a terrible moment for them, but He had said that He would see them again, and their hearts should rejoice, and so it came to pass.<a name=7:10></a> Being risen He gathered them together, spoke to them the peace of victory, and filled their hearts with joy, bringing them into the resurrection atmosphere in company with Himself.<a name=7:11></a> Then He led them out as far as to Bethany, where He was taken from them.<a name=7:12></a> And now look at them!<a name=7:13></a> They worship Him, and return to Jerusalem with great joy, and are continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.<a name=7:14></a> Their hearts were truly gained <i>for God</i>.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same writer, in his second treatise, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>gives us another and not less beautiful view of them, and here I find two points, to call attention to which is the immediate object of this paper.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, they were gazing up into heaven, verses 10, 11.<a name=7:17></a> Lovely attitude!<a name=7:18></a> True, they could not have continued literally in this position, for He was coming

	<div class="paragraph">
		again, as the "two men in white apparel" told them, and there was testimony to be rendered to Him in the meantime; but this band of men looking steadfastly toward heaven is an affecting scene, and full of moral beauty.<a name=8:1></a> And what was the secret of it?<a name=8:2></a> No doubt they had much to learn as to what was to follow upon what they had just witnessed, but their hearts were charmed, fairly captivated by the blessed One who had been taken up from them.<a name=8:3></a> The world was a blank to them, and all their joys and hopes were centred in Him whom heaven was receiving.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second point to note is that having returned to Jerusalem which was to be the scene of their labour and conflict, they were marked by prayer and supplication, verse 14.<a name=8:5></a> If, on the one hand, their hearts were absorbed with the Lord, as going into heaven, on the other they had a sense of being utterly without strength in themselves to maintain His interests in a contrary and hostile world.<a name=8:6></a> This led to the expression of their dependence.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two traits in the disciples are of great importance as showing the effect of the Lord's ministry, and proving them to be morally qualified for receiving the Holy Ghost.<a name=8:8></a> The Spirit could not dwell upon earth without the formation of that in which He can reside.<a name=8:9></a> When the Son came a body was prepared for Him in which He tabernacled among men.<a name=8:10></a> The Spirit in coming did not in the same way become incarnate, but a company was formed as a vessel divinely prepared and morally suitable for His reception and dwelling place.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in all that has been before us, what I see of practical importance is this, that although we cannot have all that saints in early days had in the way of outward manifestation of power, yet we can surely count upon the Lord to produce in its those simple marks which characterised them, namely, occupation

		with Himself, and dependence, and where these are found there will be no lack of spiritual power.<a name=9:1></a> It is in getting to the simple state where human pretension and strength are entirely disclaimed, that we really get back to the Spirit's power, and prove the reality of His presence down here.<a name=9:2></a> May the Lord lead to it!<a name=9:3></a>

		There is nothing more interesting and more important than the introduction of the divine testimony.<a name=10:3></a> This is what is brought before the attention of men in the gospel of Luke.<a name=10:4></a> I say the attention of men, because Luke's platform is a wide one; humanity is in view.<a name=10:5></a>

		Luke was a companion of the apostle Paul, and the sphere of Paul's labours was humanity; he did not stop short of all men; his conception of God's mind was that it extended to the limits of humanity.<a name=10:6></a> There was no part of it that was not to be affected by the divine testimony.<a name=10:7></a> Paul's base was heaven, that of the twelve was Jerusalem.<a name=10:8></a> Their labours were connected with Jerusalem.<a name=10:9></a> Not so Paul's.<a name=10:10></a> He began with heaven, and you cannot restrict heaven.<a name=10:11></a> What is witnessed from heaven cannot be confined to any limited part of earth.<a name=10:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this is serious in the extreme, and is so regarded by every divinely taught person.<a name=57:3></a> The intelligent Christian is very serious about it.<a name=57:4></a> He instinctively looks for order and peace, but in quest of these his eye meets with but disappointment everywhere he turns.<a name=57:5></a> Happily for him he can retreat into the secret of God's purpose within the veil, and there his eye, by the Spirit, may rest with unwearied gaze on the <i>Prince of Peace</i>, the Blessed One by whom order and peace will so soon be established universally.<a name=57:6></a> This is the Christian's privilege, and his joy and strength, as well as his discernment, will be in proportion to the frequency of his visits there.<a name=57:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapters 1 and 2 the apostle establishes his complete independence of men and Jerusalem.<a name=83:1></a> The Lord had appeared to him outside of Jewish territory, and the revelation made to him was of the Son of God.<a name=83:2></a> This involved a new system of things, with another centre than Jerusalem altogether.<a name=83:3></a> Jerusalem had a very great prestige particularly as the seat of the twelve apostles, and the tendency was to make it a centre in connection with Christianity.<a name=83:4></a> The metropolitan idea set in early: when it is assumed that any given place is a centre God goes out of His way, as it were, to show that He does not so regard it.<a name=83:5></a> The revelation to Paul near Damascus, and the movement at Antioch, furnish an illustration of this; and moral principles do not change.<a name=83:6></a> This epistle was written 1800 years ago, but there are conditions to which it has direct application today.<a name=83:7></a> The Lord did not intend to make Antioch a centre, but He intended to show He could move elsewhere.<a name=83:8></a> Antioch was not formed by apostolic means.<a name=83:9></a> It was the consequence of the scattering of the saints from Jerusalem.<a name=83:10></a> The testimony moved westward.<a name=83:11></a> Judea and Asia Minor have long since given up Christianity.<a name=83:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul recognised the apostles and valued them: he went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter: he did not go up to learn from Peter.<a name=84:5></a> Later he went up by revelation to put before them what he taught.<a name=84:6></a> At Antioch he withstood Peter to the face -- there was no compromise.<a name=84:7></a> We think a great deal of Paul, but it must be borne in mind that Peter was more prominent than Paul at the beginning.<a name=84:8></a>

		People who are ecclesiastical always deal in goods from Jerusalem.<a name=84:9></a> But the tent of testimony had, so to speak, moved out of Jerusalem.<a name=84:10></a> Paul withstood Peter to the face, for he was to be blamed.<a name=84:11></a> When contending for the truth, and the liberties of the Lord's people, age and prestige must not play any part.<a name=84:12></a> Paul saw what was at issue, and it was most serious.<a name=84:13></a> It matters little whether it be Jerusalem or Rome, the principle is the same.<a name=84:14></a> It is the assumption of priority in connection with divine things, and the effect of it is to lead souls into bondage.<a name=84:15></a> The present condition of Christianity is very largely the fruit of it.<a name=84:16></a> Everything which we see around us has originated in Rome, where this baneful principle has had its full development.<a name=84:17></a> The antidote to all is Jerusalem above.<a name=84:18></a>

		The church stands in relation to all that has been in the past, even the thought of a <i>people</i> down here.<a name=85:4></a> God intended to have a people on the earth from among the Gentiles, and this has come to pass in the church.<a name=85:5></a> The gospel refers much more to what is down here than to what is in heaven.<a name=85:6></a> It is true that Christ is the theme, but it is Christ according to what He can do for men, and this involves what has been established down here.<a name=85:7></a> You could not have the gospel without the Holy Ghost down here; His presence down here involves the kingdom and the house of God.<a name=85:8></a> In virtue of the establishment of these in this world, salvation and the blessing of Abraham are brought close to men.<a name=85:9></a> It is remarkable that the first gospel address took the form of an explanation of what was down here, what was actually before the eye of man.<a name=85:10></a> I refer to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=85:11></a> Peter explains the <i>this</i> which had attracted the attention of the multitude.<a name=85:12></a> No one can read the early chapters of the Acts and not see that relief and blessing were brought close to men in the presence of the Holy Ghost among the saints; and the great theme of the apostles was that these wonderful things had come to pass through the humble Nazarene, whom the Jews had crucified, but whom God had raised up and exalted to His right hand.<a name=85:13></a> The existence of a great power for good down here, acting in the name of Jesus was the great point, and anything less would not have been suitable or effectual.<a name=85:14></a> The king might express the very best intentions in regard to Canada, but in case of an invasion his proof of it

		In connecting Christians from among the Gentiles with Abraham, the apostle places our position on the broad platform of faith, and hence on the righteousness of God.<a name=90:1></a> Abraham was father of all believers, and had this place before circumcision and law came in at all.<a name=90:2></a> God's subsequent dealings were on narrower ground, that of law; and the object in this is explained in this epistle.<a name=90:3></a> The effect of law was to bring in bondage; hence, in order to extricate those who were under it, the Lord came under law.<a name=90:4></a> He bore its curse, and now He has a free hand to bring in the blessing of Abraham.<a name=90:5></a> It is called the blessing of Abraham, but really it has come in through Abraham's seed that is, it has taken form in Christ risen from the dead.<a name=90:6></a> It is an immense thing to apprehend the liberty in which Christ is as risen from among the dead.<a name=90:7></a> In love He underwent the consequences of human guilt, whether under the law or otherwise, and now He is the Vessel through which the blessing of Abraham is effectuated; and this has all the families of the earth in view.<a name=90:8></a> In a coming day He will usher the nations into the kingdom, and eternal life.<a name=90:9></a> Who could do this but the One who had annulled death and brought to light life and incorruptibility?<a name=90:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader may be aware that the following "Notes", as they primarily appeared, were the occasion of much difficulty.<a name=108:2></a> They had unfortunately been allowed to go into circulation in type-written form without being properly revised and as such they became the subject of comment and adverse criticism.<a name=108:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The explanation of this is twofold
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) As the object of sending out the Notes, in the first instance, was that those in America who could not be present at the meetings, might get the benefit of what it seemed the Lord gave, and as most of these were acquainted with the speakers, and did not suspect them of bad doctrine (the speakers themselves being utterly unconscious of holding any, or even of having said anything very different to what was currently accepted), it was not anticipated that there would be much objection taken; hence the need of <i>guarding</i> was not apparent.<a name=108:4></a> The statements of the different speakers were left pretty much as reported by the stenographer.<a name=108:5></a> In this way many expressions were allowed to stand which, although well understood when given out orally, were capable of misconstruction by a reader unacquainted with these who gave utterance to them.<a name=108:6></a> This weak point was felt keenly by those responsible when it was discovered that the Notes were becoming a subject of public criticism, and accordingly sorrow has been elsewhere expressed on this account.<a name=108:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not understood by many that the point of view taken in the Notes had reference to what is

		connected with the Holy Ghost down here, rather than to the heavenly side of the truth.<a name=109:1></a> This latter was <i>affirmed</i>, but because it was not made prominent, it was assumed by some that it was denied.<a name=109:2></a> But this was not the case (God forbid that it should be!<a name=109:3></a>), the heavenly side was affirmed, as said above, but the necessity for <i>pressing</i> it did not exist, whereas the necessity for calling attention to the church, as established at the beginning in the power of the Holy Ghost, as a practical sphere of protection and blessing for man, <i>did</i> exist.<a name=109:4></a> Hence the thought of the house of God predominated all through.<a name=109:5></a> The spirit of <i>popular</i> revivalism (that in which God is flippantly connected with manifest disorder), which prevailed at that time, led to serious concern as to how little the revealed mind of God was adhered to in the announcement of the glad tidings; and on this account it was thought needful to call attention to the order and conditions which attended the first preaching by the apostles.<a name=109:6></a> The in-coming of the Holy Ghost from an ascended Christ, was the advent of a new order of things; it was an order of things in which the light of God was maintained in power, and in it were found practically, as they are to be known at the present time, the things (salvation, life, etc.<a name=109:7></a>) which the gospel announced as having come to pass through Christ.<a name=109:8></a> Although heavenly, as vitally linked up with Christ in heaven by the Spirit, yet this new and blessed sphere was actually here on earth, and so (although absolutely apart from the world in the sanctification of the Spirit) was available to men.<a name=109:9></a> (Compare <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>).<a name=109:10></a> It may be remarked that it is not necessary that things should be in heaven in order that they may be in Christ.<a name=109:11></a> It is true, as said before, that the church is linked with Him in heaven (her <i>place</i> is there), in all her peculiar privileges and blessings, but at the same time salvation, although in Christ, is said to be in His <i>name</i>

		Although it is confidently hoped the Notes will be found by many both instructive and edifying, yet the chief intent in printing them at the present time is not alone to this end, but rather that saints may have before them <i>substantially</i> that which has been called in question, so as to be in a position to judge for themselves in regard to it, as before the Lord.<a name=110:2></a> Hence it is hoped it will be clearly understood that they are in no sense to be regarded as dogmatic; that is, no one is expected to bow to them; they are simply to be read for what they may be worth, and if there be those who differ, and yet cannot prove the existence of fundamental error, it is hoped that they will leave the Notes, and those responsible for them, in the hands of the Lord, who will not fail to make everything manifest in time.<a name=110:3></a>

		A word may be added as to "living water".<a name=110:4></a> What was in the minds of the speakers was that the living water refers to the Spirit as in <i>man</i> (in Christ, and <i>now</i> also in the saints), and so adapted to the thirst of men.<a name=110:5></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>and <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>Christ is seen as the Giver of living water, but in both chapters what He gives is also seen as in the believer: in chapter 4 it becomes in the one who drinks a "well of water springing up into everlasting life", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>) and in chapter 7 (where the Spirit is identified with the living water), it flows as rivers <i>out</i> of the belly of the believer.<a name=110:6></a> This is in view of thirst in <i>others</i>.<a name=110:7></a> The believer is not the source: Christ is this, but still the living water is said to flow out of the believer.<a name=110:8></a> We are bound to connect <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>with <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>in order to see the historical fulfilment of the Lord's promise; and in doing this we must introduce the collective idea, which the latter chapter supplies -- no believer could in <i>himself</i> contain the Spirit.<a name=110:9></a> Peter alluded to the Spirit in his address in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=110:10></a> He was in the believers as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought I have, beloved friends, is to seek to engage your hearts with the Lord in relation to <i>His own</i> sphere of things and for this I have chosen this scripture in Matthew.<a name=243:1></a> I might have taken up a parallel passage in either Mark or Luke, and spoken from it, but I have chosen Matthew's account of the transfiguration because of the way he puts it "There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the <i>Son of Man coming in his kingdom</i>"<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:28">Matthew  16:28</a>.<a name=243:2></a> It is the Son of man viewed in relation to the kingdom in perfection and glory; and because of this it has a peculiar charm.<a name=243:3></a> Not that the others are not very blessed; they <i>are</i>; but I think, if you will consider it, that you will admit that Matthew's account has a very peculiar charm -- at least to those who love the Lord.<a name=243:4></a> I think every Christian heart would say, I should like to see the Son of man coming in His kingdom.<a name=243:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, I might have taken up a parallel passage in Mark or Luke, but it is not quite the same thought in either.<a name=243:6></a> In Mark it is the kingdom of God in power.<a name=243:7></a> Now I should like to see the kingdom of God in power; but in a certain sense one might see the kingdom of God in power, and not see the Son of man at all.<a name=243:8></a> To give you an idea of what I mean: I have seen the power of Great Britain oftentimes, and proved it.<a name=243:9></a> I lived in Great Britain, and in the colonies of Great Britain, and in both places I had abundant evidence of the power of the kingdom; but there are a great many British subjects who have never seen the king.<a name=243:10></a> I, for one, saw the king but once, but, as I said, I have oftentimes seen demonstrated the power of the <i>kingdom</i>.<a name=243:11></a> It is one thing to see the power of the kingdom, and quite another to see the <i>king in state</i>.<a name=243:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=244>[Page 244]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the point in Mark is the kingdom of God come in <i>power</i>, and in Luke it is the kingdom in <i>itself</i>, and that is another thought.<a name=244:1></a> I am sure there is wonderful instruction in each presentation of the kingdom.<a name=244:2></a> It is one thing to see the <i>kingdom</i>, and another to see the kingdom <i>in power</i>; and another, to see <i>the Son of man coming</i> in His kingdom.<a name=244:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will find you have to ascend, as it were, in order to get a glimpse of the kingdom, especially if you are to see it from the point of view last mentioned.<a name=244:4></a> I think the kingdom does come down to the valley; and if you are in the valley, where the power of Satan is, you are exceedingly thankful if the kingdom of God <i>in power</i> comes down there.<a name=244:5></a> It is just what you need: I think it is just what is required in the valley.<a name=244:6></a> When I speak of the valley, I refer to what comes out in the latter part of this chapter (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>).<a name=244:7></a> What you come in contact with in the valley is the power of evil.<a name=244:8></a> That is where man is: man is <i>in</i> the valley, where Satan dominates, and the kingdom of God has come in power into the valley.<a name=244:9></a> There is no possible hope for man in the valley unless the kingdom descends into it and that is, I think, the idea of the gospel: it is that it has pleased God to come down in power into the domain of Satan, where man is, and to establish His kingdom in power there, for the deliverance and protection of man.<a name=244:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, before I proceed to call your attention to what is in the passage I have read, I should like to say just a word about the way things are presented in the gospel of Matthew.<a name=244:11></a> I think Matthew gives you the entire history of the kingdom, but more particularly as connected with human responsibility: the different phases of it are presented in a series of parables.<a name=244:12></a> But there is not only the responsibility but also the inevitable accompaniment of it -- failure.<a name=244:13></a> Failure is seen in each, but you will find that in

		result things are adjusted by a divine hand.<a name=245:1></a> Now I think there is great encouragement in that.<a name=245:2></a> It is an immense comfort to see that whatever confusion may arise in what God has set up here in connection with man's responsibility, in the end all is divinely adjusted.<a name=245:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The parables I refer to begin with chapter 18 and end with chapter 25.<a name=245:4></a> Much confusion is detailed in the history, but in the end all is perfectly adjusted; the Lord relegates everything to <i>its own place</i>.<a name=245:5></a> Now, it is an immense encouragement in a day like this, to know that the Lord has foreseen all that would come in; He knew what things were coming to in the hands of men, but He has never given up the reins; hence every parable that He sets forth here ends with a perfect adjustment of affairs.<a name=245:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take, for instance, the parable of the labourers.<a name=245:7></a> Did not the Lord vindicate Himself?<a name=245:8></a> Did He not adjust matters?<a name=245:9></a> Did He not show clearly that He was perfectly right in what He did?<a name=245:10></a> Then in chapter 22 (I only speak of these as illustrations) you get the man who came in to the feast without a wedding garment.<a name=245:11></a> The Lord adjusted that: the king saw to it.<a name=245:12></a> I do not know how the guests felt about it, whether they were offended at the man coming in unsuitable attire, whether they were in sympathy with the king or not.<a name=245:13></a> It does not say how they were affected, but certainly the man was entirely out of accord with the scene, and the king was quick to discern this.<a name=245:14></a> He says, "How camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?<a name=245:15></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:12">Matthew  22:12</a>.<a name=245:16></a> The king very quickly removed him.<a name=245:17></a> "Bind him", he says, "hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth".<a name=245:18></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:13">Matthew  25:13</a>.<a name=245:19></a> The man found his own place.<a name=245:20></a> In this way there was divine adjustment.<a name=245:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 25 you get the parable of the virgins.<a name=245:22></a> The wise virgins did not seem to be much

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is as you proceed.<a name=246:12></a> Take the parable of the talents.<a name=246:13></a> The Lord adjusted matters in regard to those who had received the talents.<a name=246:14></a> Each man got his reward.<a name=246:15></a> Each entered into the joy of his lord except one, and he was incapable of entering into it.<a name=246:16></a> He got what was due to him morally; that is to say, what he had was taken away from him.<a name=246:17></a> He judged the lord to be an austere, hard man; a hard taskmaster such as Pharaoh had been.<a name=246:18></a> His state was demonstrated by this; he really did not know the lord at all, and his talent is taken away from him.<a name=246:19></a> He is cast into outer darkness.<a name=246:20></a> The same principle comes out later on in the chapter.<a name=246:21></a> There are the nations, and when you come to the end, everything is perfectly adjusted by the Lord.<a name=246:22></a> I have no doubt all the parables, including the one just mentioned, refer to the present moment, which I might call the church period.<a name=246:23></a> But the Lord is not content only to adjust matters in regard to the present period: He goes right on to the end.<a name=246:24></a> The Son of man sits on the throne of His glory, and all the nations are brought before Him.<a name=246:25></a> Statesmen in every country of the world are at their wits end to know just what to do, but the Lord will not fail to adjust matters in regard to the nations.<a name=246:26></a> It is not arbitrary.<a name=246:27></a> The Lord has a

	<div class="paragraph">
		perfect right to assign the nations to any place He pleases, but He assigns them to the place they belong to morally.<a name=247:1></a> There is nothing arbitrary about God: everything is adjusted according to the nature of God, Each finds his own place.<a name=247:2></a> Take Judas, for instance.<a name=247:3></a> What place belonged to him morally?<a name=247:4></a> He got to the place to which he belonged.<a name=247:5></a> No other place would suit him, and he would suit no other place; hence that is the place he reaches.<a name=247:6></a> Every nation will find its place.<a name=247:7></a> The Lord regulates the place of the nations according to their treatment of His brethren.<a name=247:8></a> The wicked "shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal".<a name=247:9></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:46">Matthew  25:46</a>.<a name=247:10></a> Now, that is a very great encouragement in a day like this.<a name=247:11></a> Most of us, if we are concerned about divine things, are affected by the conditions prevailing in what we call the church.<a name=247:12></a> But the Lord will adjust it all.<a name=247:13></a> You cannot adjust them, neither can I, but the Lord can and will.<a name=247:14></a> The Lord knows all that is going on, and He will assign everything to its own place.<a name=247:15></a> You may depend upon it you will find your place wherever you are, or whatever your state is, you will find your own place.<a name=247:16></a> We shall all find our own places.<a name=247:17></a> In a certain sense we are all creating our own places, and to say that is not at all trenching upon the authority or rights of Christ.<a name=247:18></a> The Lord will designate each one's place, but the place He designates will be the one to which we <i>belong</i>.<a name=247:19></a> The Lord Jesus Christ will give the place which belongs to each morally.<a name=247:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have only referred to these parables in order to show you the present state of things, but I wish to dwell upon the thing in perfection.<a name=247:23></a> As I said before, and as you can see from the parables, every

		J.P.<a name=315:1></a> Our previous readings led us to the end of chapter 3.<a name=315:2></a> What would be the connection in chapters 4 - 6?<a name=315:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=315:4></a> I suppose that in these chapters the priesthood is seen in relation to our need down here; this is especially so in chapters 4 and 5, while at the end of chapter 6 the Lord is viewed as having entered within the veil, as <i>Forerunner</i> for us.<a name=315:5></a> As Forerunner Christ is there representatively, and this lays the ground for chapter 7.<a name=315:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=315:9></a> Hence the necessity for such a <i>great</i> Priest.<a name=315:10></a> "For such an high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens".<a name=315:11></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:26">Hebrews  7:26</a>.<a name=315:12></a>

		J.P.<a name=315:13></a> In chapter 2 there was what <i>became God</i>, what was suitable to Him, "For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>) but is it not wonderful that the saints have such a marvellous calling that the Spirit of God can say it <i>became them</i> to have such a High Priest?<a name=315:14></a>

		suppose the gospel of Matthew is the King; the gospel of Mark would be the Prophet; the gospel of John is the <i>Person</i> of the Lord Jesus Christ, but the gospel of Luke is the Priest.<a name=316:1></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=316:5></a> Very much.<a name=316:6></a> If you consider the opening of the gospels, you get an idea as to the point of view taken in each.<a name=316:7></a> Take the gospel of Matthew: it opens with "The generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham".<a name=316:8></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:1">Matthew  1:1</a>.<a name=316:9></a> That is to say, the point in view is the Heir, arid evidently the <i>male</i> line comes into evidence, reaching to Joseph.<a name=316:10></a> Much more is said in this gospel of Joseph than of Mary.<a name=316:11></a> The male is more prominent, but when you come to the gospel of Luke, you are struck with the greater prominence of the woman.<a name=316:12></a> The woman being so prominent gives an idea that it is humanity and Christ in relation to it, that is in view.<a name=316:13></a> The gospel opens with the priest, whose wife, Elizabeth, is of the daughters of Aaron; then you get Mary, and Anna.<a name=316:14></a>.<a name=316:15></a> Of course John the Baptist and Simeon appear, but it is very remarkable how prominent the women are.<a name=316:16></a> Christ is seen as the Priest in connection with man according to his state; not man in responsibility, but man in dire necessity.<a name=316:17></a> The idea of a priest is more to meet man in his need.<a name=316:18></a> All the parables in the gospel of Luke support that line.<a name=316:19></a> It is in this gospel we get the widow at the gate of Nain, and she, to my mind, represents the point of view taken in Luke.<a name=316:20></a> Her only son is dead, and she is a widow.<a name=316:21></a> Here the priest comes into view -- the Lord sees her, and has compassion on her.<a name=316:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=316:23></a> So the Samaritan in chapter 10 had compassion on the man who fell among the thieves.<a name=316:24></a> The priest, who passed by on the other side, had the title, clothes, and all that, but there was nothing of the real priest about him, or he would never have passed by on the other side.<a name=316:25></a> When the real Priest came He

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=317:2></a> Is that what He is anointed for in chapter 4?<a name=317:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=317:4></a> I think so.<a name=317:5></a> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted", etc.<a name=317:6></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:18">Luke  4:18</a>.<a name=317:7></a> I think the picture we get in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>is most interesting.<a name=317:8></a> It says, "All bear him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth".<a name=317:9></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:22">Luke  4:22</a>.<a name=317:10></a> All this speaks of the true Priest.<a name=317:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i> Would the throne of grace be connected with the Priest?<a name=317:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=317:13></a> Yes.<a name=317:14></a> In the apprehension that such a Priest has passed through the heavens, you come boldly to receive mercy and find grace.<a name=317:15></a> If you consider Christ down here, you have no difficulty in regard to God: you go to God with the utmost liberty, because when the Lord was down here He always relieved people <i>on the part of God</i>, and there is no change.<a name=317:16></a> Then further, as the passage before us states, the Priest is able to sympathise with our infirmities, having been tempted as we are, sin apart.<a name=317:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may notice that it is not simply a question of meeting our need: the ultimate end is that we should not let go the confession, "Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, <i>let us hold fast the confession"</i>.<a name=317:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=318:5></a> It illustrates the mode of divine action.<a name=318:6></a> Where officialism comes into view, God acts through One who had no recognised function at all.<a name=318:7></a> He was the Samaritan who journeyed, and came where he was.<a name=318:8></a> <i>Ostensibly</i> He had no commission when He was here, but He was the One who could relieve the man, and that is the true Priest.<a name=318:9></a> All the true priestly habiliments could be seen in Christ if you had eyes to see them, but to the natural eye He was the Samaritan who journeyed.<a name=318:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i> Why was He represented by a Samaritan?<a name=318:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=318:12></a> Because the Samaritans were under reproach.<a name=318:13></a> He was inferior to the Jew: he was not even one of the common people: he had no standing at all.<a name=318:14></a> He was not a priest, a levite, nor even one of the common people, but One who was outside altogether.<a name=318:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=318:16></a> It is wonderful to see how Christ forces that lawyer to acknowledge that the Samaritan was the true neighbour.<a name=318:17></a> It makes clear what the word "neighbour" really implies.<a name=318:18></a> It links it with the Lord as Priest.<a name=318:19></a> Christ is the true Neighbour, the One who takes account of the need of man, and in perfect priestly compassion and grace meets that need.<a name=318:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=318:21></a> It is wonderful to take things up as the Spirit has presented them to us in Luke's gospel.<a name=318:22></a> It is a question of following up what is in the heart of Christ, coining near to man to relieve him.<a name=318:23></a> If we are to receive benefit from the Priest, it is in relation to the confession.<a name=318:24></a> The Lord never deals with us simply as so many units: He supports us in relation to the confession.<a name=318:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=416:23></a> Yes, and we must bear in mind that the initial thought of the priesthood is that it is to be <i>for God</i>.<a name=416:24></a> "That they may minister <i>unto me</i> in the priest's office".<a name=416:25></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:41">Exodus  28:41</a>.<a name=416:26></a> It seems to me that is what we should keep clearly before us.<a name=416:27></a> There is that which God presents to us in the way of testimony, and there is that which is for God, which is the answer to it; so the priesthood is brought in here and the habiliments in which Aaron and his sons were to appear before God.<a name=416:28></a> All this, I think, refers to man as appearing before God in Christ and the church.<a name=416:29></a> There were garments made for the sons of Aaron,

		as well as for Aaron himself.<a name=417:1></a> The garments of Aaron differed very materially from those of his sons, nevertheless the sons had garments of glory and beauty; they were garments that were suitable for the presence of God.<a name=417:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=417:3></a> I notice that while Aaron's sons are mentioned in verses 1 and 4, almost the whole chapter is occupied with Aaron and his garments.<a name=417:4></a> In verse 41 the sons are spoken of again: "That they may minister unto me in the priest's office".<a name=417:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel that we have been really defective as to priesthood.<a name=417:6></a> We have thought of our part, but I do not think the thought of what God desired for Himself, and what is really secured for Him in connection with the priesthood, has had its place before us.<a name=417:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=417:8></a> It is clear that although the church has its part in the service, Christ personally is mainly before the mind of the Spirit in these types.<a name=417:9></a> As was said, most of the chapter is occupied with Aaron and his garments.<a name=417:10></a> It is Christ that is presented to us here; the garments, etc.<a name=417:11></a>, refer to the affection and grace which manifested themselves in Him in relation to His people in the carrying out of His service before God.<a name=417:12></a> This includes His going into heaven, for the bells and pomegranates on Aaron's robe represent the testimony and fruitfulness seen in the saints here on earth by the Spirit, which they received from Christ as exalted.<a name=417:13></a> Following on this Aaron's sons appear.<a name=417:14></a> They are also clothed, but their garments are not so elaborate and magnificent as those of the high priest.<a name=417:15></a> Aaron's sons typify the members of the church as clothed by the Spirit in the beauty and grace of Christ, and appearing before God in association with Him in service.<a name=417:16></a>

		In undertaking to say a word about the Father I feel that I have to own to a very meagre apprehension of what the name signifies; but I wish that our hearts should be directed to it, in order that we might prove something of the reality of what is spoken of in the passage in chapter 14 of this gospel; that is, that the Father comes to us: He comes to those who, as loving the Lord, keep His word.<a name=425:1></a> The Father and the Son come to us, and make their abode with us.<a name=425:2></a> In what I shall have to say, however, I shall dwell largely on names under which God revealed Himself previously, with the hope that it may be seen that all the goodness and blessedness of these names are necessarily included in the name He takes in relation to Christians.<a name=425:3></a>
