		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> Feeling that the Lord would remind us that this subject is to be approached in an intelligent and sympathetic manner, I thought it would be helpful, by reading the verses in chapters 16 and 17, to call attention to the Lord's preparatory instruction to His disciples in view of His suffering.<a name=1:2></a> It is to be dealt with in no sense academically, but reverently, sympathetically and feelingly, for it concerns a Person known to us and whom we love and adore.<a name=1:3></a> The verses in chapter 16 call attention to the Lord's thought for His own in view of His sufferings, so that they might be able to enter into them in some measure.<a name=1:4></a> He looked for sympathy from those that were with Him, and therefore instructed them as to His sufferings and death beforehand.<a name=1:5></a> In entering Gethsemane He made provision that there should be <i>selected</i> ones near Him in His agony.<a name=1:6></a> He says to the disciples, "Sit here until I go away and pray yonder;" then He takes the three known and trusted ones to be nearer to Him.<a name=1:7></a> It seems to me that the Lord would press upon us that the subject is to be considered by us as being feelingly interested, sobered, and holy.<a name=1:8></a> The apostles Paul and Peter would be representative of the saints in this sympathetic way, especially Paul who shared more than anyone in the sufferings of Christ.<a name=1:9></a> Peter refers to them very touchingly as a witness of them.<a name=1:10></a> The Spirit tells us in chapter 17 that the disciples "were <i>greatly grieved</i>".<a name=1:11></a> There were two instrumentalities of suffering: first, He must "suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be

		killed"; then in chapter 17, "The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him"; that is, you have the Jews and their leaders, and then <i>men</i>, so that the race, as well as the Jews, is brought into responsibility for the killing of Christ.<a name=2:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8">Mark  8</a>, He <i>teaches</i> them about it as if to fix it in their minds; and in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:22">Luke  9:22</a>, He says, "The Son of man <i>must</i> suffer"; and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:14">John  3:14</a>, "thus <i>must</i> the Son of man be lifted up".<a name=2:2></a> All these statements are to impress upon us the character of the sufferings of Christ, and to draw us in accord with them.<a name=2:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B-w.<a name=2:4></a> Is chapter 16 the first reference He makes to His sufferings?<a name=2:5></a> It says, "from that time Jesus began to shew".<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:7></a> Yes.<a name=2:8></a> After the truth of His Person and of the assembly came out, He began to speak of His sufferings.<a name=2:9></a> That subject stands peculiarly in relation to the assembly.<a name=2:10></a> In chapter 17 He is seen as coming in His kingdom, then as descending from the mount He says, "Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer".<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=2:12></a> Is it as the Son of man you view His sufferings here?<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:14></a> The Lord uses that designation of Himself as over against His special relation with Israel.<a name=2:15></a> He stands related to the whole race of mankind, which would include Israel as well as ourselves.<a name=2:16></a> It ought to touch every man, woman, and child, that <i>the Son of man</i> had to suffer.<a name=2:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:21></a> Yes, He is the only hope of the human family; the light that shone in Him was the light of men.<a name=2:22></a> The race must have gone into utter oblivion apart from the Son of man taking on its obligations.<a name=2:23></a> This should touch every one in the world.<a name=2:24></a>

		C.A.<a name=3:1></a>M.<a name=3:2></a> In chapter 16 the Lord refers to the religious element.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Yes; it is in keeping with Matthew, to call attention to Jerusalem in this way.<a name=3:5></a> "He must go away to Jerusalem", it says, as though it had become the place of opposition to Him, and consequently the place of suffering.<a name=3:6></a> It <i>had</i> become that -- a terrible fact.<a name=3:7></a> Elsewhere He says, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:37">Matthew  23:37</a>).<a name=3:8></a> It is called "the holy city" even as Satan takes the Lord to the temple, in chapter 4:6; it is also called "the city of the great King", in chapter 5:35.<a name=3:9></a> These are abstract thoughts, but the murder of the Son of man in that city is all the more dreadful in view of its place in the counsels of God.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=3:11></a>L.<a name=3:12></a> Is there any significance in the elders being mentioned first in chapter 16?<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:14></a> I suppose the elders represent the <i>responsible</i> element in the people; the chief priests have the official place with the scribes, and would represent the <i>religious</i> side.<a name=3:15></a> The whole system was thus embodied in these three classes; so that there is no escape for that nation in the day of judgment when this crowning guilt of Jerusalem, and of that nation, will come up.<a name=3:16></a> This crime of murder was done after full deliberation; the leading classes of the nation were all in it, and since the crucifixion of Christ was accomplished by their united and determined decision, what must have been the terrible state of these heads of the nation!<a name=3:17></a> You see the chief priests and scribes taking a judicial attitude, in formally <i>condemning</i> Him to death, but in verse 22 of chapter 17, it says, "The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of <i>men</i>, and they shall kill him".<a name=3:18></a> The killing would be the act of the nations of chapter 20:19, but here it is <i>men</i>.<a name=3:19></a> The race is guilty.<a name=3:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:4></a> I think so.<a name=4:5></a> One Man only is in the Spirit's mind, whether the title occurs in the Old or New Testament.<a name=4:6></a>

		Referring again to Gethsemane the pressure would be dreadful, as the facts show: "Then all the disciples left him and fled", (chapter 26:56).<a name=4:7></a> These were the Lord's own picked men, but they all forsook Him and fled!<a name=4:8></a> The pressure was so dreadful that man, aside from the possession of the Spirit of God, could not stand it.<a name=4:9></a> No creature under any circumstances could endure Gethsemane and the cross.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=4:11></a>M.<a name=4:12></a> Would you please distinguish for us the sufferings of Gethsemane from those of the cross?<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> The sufferings in Gethsemane were anticipatory, occasioned by the pressure of Satan -- "the power of darkness".<a name=4:15></a> He was bringing to bear on the Lord anticipatively the terribleness of death as the judgment of God, of which he had the power; it was the penalty of sin, and Satan pressed it on the Lord.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=4:17></a>M.<a name=4:18></a> Do you think the reference in Matthew to "a place called Gethsemane", and not to a garden as in John, would be significant?<a name=4:19></a> The name itself would have some meaning.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:21></a> It is possibly meant to convey the idea of pressure.<a name=4:22></a> He "comes with them to a place called Gethsemane".<a name=4:23></a> It was deliberate; He had been accustomed to go there.<a name=4:24></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:39">Luke  22:39</a> says, "he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives", and <a href="../bible/John.htm#18:1">John  18:1</a> says, "beyond the torrent Cedron, where was a garden, into which he entered".<a name=4:25></a> But the point here is in the word "Gethsemane".<a name=4:26></a> It is found only in the "pressure" gospels, Matthew and Mark.<a name=4:27></a> The instruction is in the word "Gethsemane", suggesting the pressure the Lord went through with His Father beforehand, all that the cross would mean.<a name=4:28></a> Satan's power, as we

		have said, entered into it -- Satan bringing this to bear on Him; not through human instrumentality, but <i>direct</i>, as in the beginning, after He was baptised, when He was driven into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.<a name=5:1></a> Here the devil comes back again, as the Lord said, "the ruler of the world comes" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:30">John  14:30</a>), which alludes to this particular time.<a name=5:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=5:3></a>T.<a name=5:4></a> "My soul is very sorrowful", He says.<a name=5:5></a> Would this refer to His inward feelings?<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:7></a> Yes; whereas, verse 47 looks at the external instrumentality: "while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people".<a name=5:8></a> Swords and sticks are weapons to affect Him externally; but Gethsemane was not that.<a name=5:9></a> The battle there was spiritual and inward.<a name=5:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:16></a> Yes; to divert Him, if possible, from the path before Him of God's will; that was the enemy's intent; which if he had succeeded would have been a great triumph; it was what he looked for, having failed in his first effort to turn the Lord aside from the path of obedience.<a name=5:17></a> Satan, at that time, had offered Him all the kingdoms of the world if He would worship him, but now he endeavours to divert Him by pressing upon Him what He was about to suffer at the hands of God.<a name=5:18></a> Hence the Lord's terrible anticipatory agony.<a name=5:19></a> It says here, "taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed".<a name=5:20></a> The word "depressed" should be specially noted.<a name=5:21></a> Being truly Man, He was capable of that here, for He could not but recoil from the judgment of God.<a name=5:22></a> What unspeakable pressure was brought to bear upon Him, causing Him to be deeply depressed!<a name=5:23></a> The <i>power of darkness</i>

		<i>was there</i>!<a name=6:1></a> Satan was pressing the thought of death as the judgment of God.<a name=6:2></a> The causes of judgment had accumulated; besides the wrath of God on account of sin, there was also before His soul the special wrath on Israel on account of a broken law, which He was about to bear.<a name=6:3></a> All that could but profoundly affect Him.<a name=6:4></a> The more we think of who He was, the more we understand how these things would affect Him.<a name=6:5></a>

		A.F.<a name=6:12></a>M.<a name=6:13></a> Was all that of which you have spoken, condensed into the form of a cup?<a name=6:14></a> The Lord says, "My Father, if it be possible, let this <i>cup</i> pass from me; but not as <i>I</i> will, but as thou wilt".<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:16></a> Yes; it was not to be extended over months or years, but, as it were, compressed to the period of an "hour".<a name=6:17></a> In Gethsemane, He is not undergoing the actual suffering.<a name=6:18></a> It is what He went through spiritually there, Satan bringing the judgment to bear upon Him, and the awfulness of what He would have to face.<a name=6:19></a> He Himself knowing, as no mere creature could know, what it meant.<a name=6:20></a> He went through it anticipatively with the Father, taking the cup in infinite obedience from <i>His</i> hands.<a name=6:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=7:2></a>M.<a name=7:3></a> It would almost look as though Satan had anticipated another season to tempt Him when he left Him as stated in chapter 4; having in his mind another occasion when the Lord would perhaps be under more oppressive circumstances than mere hunger.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:5></a> After the first temptations he had departed from Him "<i>for a time</i>", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:13">Luke  4:13</a>).<a name=7:6></a> He had now come back in other circumstances with suitable and dreadful weapons.<a name=7:7></a> According to Luke, He was forty days in the wilderness, tempted; apparently the temptation covered the whole forty days.<a name=7:8></a> It was an extended period and afterwards He hungered; but here the temptation is very short.<a name=7:9></a> It is like the Jordan as compared with the Red Sea, it is condensed, Satan bringing every bit of pressure he was capable of bringing upon His spirit.<a name=7:10></a> It was not a question of mere physical death, but <i>the judgment of God</i>, which the Lord understood infinitely and from which He could not but recoil.<a name=7:11></a> His perfection involved this.<a name=7:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:16></a> Yes.<a name=7:17></a> We see here how the Lord disposes of His forces.<a name=7:18></a> He told certain ones to "Sit here".<a name=7:19></a> He was not calling upon them to do much, but they were to be there.<a name=7:20></a> Then He takes with Him the three selected ones and began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed; but He went a stone's throw from them.<a name=7:21></a> So that there were three distinct steps, for finally He is alone, although they are regarded as near, and were to be a support to Him as there.<a name=7:22></a> He was looking for their sympathy as Man, and even their presence would be a comfort.<a name=7:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:8></a> On the principle, I think, of "two or three witnesses"; there is <i>full testimony</i>, in these three prayers, to what was in His heart, feeling tested in the presence of God as to the work He had undertaken.<a name=8:9></a> On the one hand, He could not but shrink from the forsaking of God, and on the other, He would be absolutely obedient to His Father.<a name=8:10></a> It was infinite perfection in man.<a name=8:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:20></a> It is the expression of His <i>extreme</i> grief, the pressure extending as a complete test; death itself was being tasted anticipatively.<a name=8:21></a> All was felt extremely in the most perfect way.<a name=8:22></a> The experience affected Him physically, but He speaks of what was inward: "My soul is very sorrowful even unto death".<a name=8:23></a> He tasted death literally on the cross.<a name=8:24></a> Here, He is touching death in anticipation.<a name=8:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=67:1></a> The sufferings of Christ as worked out in the first days of the assembly's history, in relation to the twelve <i>apostles</i>, would, I thought, be instructive for our consideration at this time.<a name=67:2></a> What is seen in this respect in the Acts may be profitably connected with the heavenly city in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, where the twelve foundations of the wall were adorned with every precious stone.<a name=67:3></a> Paul alludes to such sufferings as the sufferings of Christ; he says, "even as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:5">2 Corinthians  1:5</a>); they may therefore be regarded as characteristic.<a name=67:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may look at the sufferings of the apostles from the beginning of Acts, extending on to chapter 12.<a name=67:5></a> Later we may have opportunity to consider the sufferings begun in Stephen, who introduces the <i>heavenly</i> thought as seen in the expression of his countenance.<a name=67:6></a> It drew forth the most bitter opposition; for when he said that he saw the heavens opened and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, they stopped their ears!<a name=67:7></a> Saul, who was present at Stephen's martyrdom, took the lead in the persecution, ravaging the assembly; so that the assembly itself is formally seen as suffering in the most excruciating way.<a name=67:8></a> Saul went into the saints' houses one after another and dragged them before tribunals.<a name=67:9></a> The attack is now on the assembly.<a name=67:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		Another thing that is instructive is the kind of persons that were employed by the devil in these persecutions.<a name=67:11></a> Firstly, we have the Sadducees, who were fitted for such opposition as was designed to set aside, if possible, the truth of resurrection; for as a sect they did not believe in the resurrection.<a name=67:12></a> Satan thus secures instrumentalities suitable for his purposes.<a name=67:13></a> <a name=68>[Page 68]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 12 we have in Herod a second feature of the persecution; he represents the <i>political</i> side of it -- a man having no conscience.<a name=68:1></a> Such persecute, not because they hate the saints, but in order to serve their own ends.<a name=68:2></a> Then, thirdly, those who attacked Stephen; they are more general in character.<a name=68:3></a> They are of the <i>synagogue</i>, and are inclusive of many from distant lands.<a name=68:4></a> It is a purely religious opposition and becomes notorious in its able champion -- that very religious man, Saul.<a name=68:5></a> He was an out-and-out religious man, and in his zeal he carried on a bitter persecution against the assembly as <i>such</i> -- to exterminate, if possible, that which was dearest to the heart of Christ.<a name=68:6></a> If the persecution, under these three heads, is kept in mind we may be helped in the subject before us.<a name=68:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=106:1></a> Having covered in a general way the great subject of the sufferings of Christ, as seen in the New Testament, it seems to be in order that we should look into the Old Testament to see the amplification in detail of all that we have been engaged with.<a name=106:2></a> We should begin with Abel, who is the first sufferer mentioned.<a name=106:3></a> The Lord Himself refers to him in this way speaking of "the blood of righteous Abel", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:35">Matthew  22:35</a>).<a name=106:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=106:8></a> It is a question if any <i>sufferings</i> are foreshadowed there.<a name=106:9></a> It took place before sin came in.<a name=106:10></a> The deep sleep of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>in itself hardly suggests suffering.<a name=106:11></a> What had you in mind?<a name=106:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=106:13></a>W.<a name=106:14></a> I wondered whether it might not be seen in the epistle to the Ephesians: "Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a>).<a name=106:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=106:16></a> Yes.<a name=106:17></a> Eve being taken out of Adam in such a remarkable way is evidently to call attention to the fact that God would have life of <i>that</i> kind -- life out of death.<a name=106:18></a> God intended that the life that should enter into eternity should not be what Adam had by God breathing into his nostrils, but a life derived from Christ as having entered into death -- that <i>kind</i> of life.<a name=106:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=107:5></a> It is a similar thought; not the idea of suffering, but the state that was reached -- falling into the ground and <i>dying</i> -- a state was reached without which there could be no fruit.<a name=107:6></a> <i>How</i> the state is reached is not given in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>.<a name=107:7></a> It is simply that God caused the deep sleep; there is no suggestion of suffering in that.<a name=107:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=107:11></a> Yes.<a name=107:12></a> Faith was needed for the reflection of what should come out later.<a name=107:13></a> Peter says "Concerning which salvation prophets, who have prophesied of the grace towards you, sought out and searched out; searching what, or what manner, of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these", (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:10">1 Peter  1:10</a>,11).<a name=107:14></a> Faith laid hold of what should come out in Christ.<a name=107:15></a> Hence: "By faith Abel", and so throughout <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>.<a name=107:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=109:4></a> Yes; this is clearly the beginning of the great sacrificial order of things that comes out in Exodus and Leviticus.<a name=109:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=109:6></a> So that Adam and Eve were clothed as a result of suffering and sacrifice; Abel followed this.<a name=109:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=109:8></a> That is the thought.<a name=109:9></a> As the required and voluntary offerings were made at the tabernacle or temple, the court would be a regular shambles; a constant stream of blood flowed.<a name=109:10></a> Naturally we do not like that, but the divine thought was sacrifice, that <i>death</i> should be in evidence; testimony to the judgment of God marked the whole scene.<a name=109:11></a> Cain did not consider that, nor think there was anything wanting in the offering he brought.<a name=109:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=109:15></a> Because "the sufferings of Christ" is our subject.<a name=109:16></a> Abel was killed, but by the hand of his brother, who rose up against him.<a name=109:17></a> There would be that awful feeling of a murderous attack, which would involve suffering, before the actual death.<a name=109:18></a> Cain rose up against him when they were in the field.<a name=109:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=109:20></a> With regard to the verse, "He shall crush thy head" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:15">Genesis  3:15</a>), does it not give the idea of a <i>man</i> coming in?<a name=109:21></a> Faith would look for him.<a name=109:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=109:23></a> Quite.<a name=109:24></a> I have no doubt that is why Eve called Cain "a man" when he was born.<a name=109:25></a> "I have acquired a man with Jehovah", (chapter 4:1).<a name=109:26></a> She undoubtedly took up the thought of the previous chapter -- that her seed would bruise the head of the serpent.<a name=109:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However much Abel understood instinctively, the features of Christ were beginning to show themselves in him.<a name=109:28></a> I think that Cain failed Eve; she said, "I have acquired a man <i>with</i> Jehovah" (not <i>from</i>

		but <i>with</i>, meaning that God helped her); she linked Cain with the promised seed, undoubtedly.<a name=110:1></a> She is the first person, as far as Scripture records, to name the name of Jehovah, and she connects Him with Cain.<a name=110:2></a> But in the time which elapsed between the births of the two children, she changed her judgment of him.<a name=110:3></a> Eve had "acquired" Cain, as though he were of great importance, but the next child was regarded as just a breath -- a vanity.<a name=110:4></a> It was undoubtedly the result of a judgment based on what Cain was; the parents at the time of Abel's birth would have come to a truer understanding of their own state.<a name=110:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=110:6></a>M.<a name=110:7></a> You would connect Eve's name -- "life" -- with Abel, not with Cain?<a name=110:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=110:9></a> The life line is in Abel; so that Seth comes in instead of Abel in chapter 5, and the life line is in Seth.<a name=110:10></a> According to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:25">Genesis  4:25</a>, Eve evidently had the mind of God in naming Seth.<a name=110:11></a> "God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him".<a name=110:12></a> It is another <i>seed</i>, not "son" or "man".<a name=110:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Seth calls his son Enosh, that is, "man as weak, mortal".<a name=110:14></a> "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah".<a name=110:15></a> Light thus broke in for man.<a name=110:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=110:17></a>M.<a name=110:18></a> In naming Enosh, Seth seemed to have the same kind of intuition that Eve had, that man was a passing creature.<a name=110:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=110:20></a> That is right.<a name=110:21></a> It should be noted with regard to Abel that he was just a passing breath -- transitory.<a name=110:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=110:23></a> In naming Cain, was Eve still acting on the line of sight?<a name=110:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=110:25></a> I think so; there may have been some light in her soul, but her words as to Cain were not spoken in faith.<a name=110:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=110:27></a> Did not the Jews expect things to be set up here in the flesh when the Lord Jesus was here?<a name=110:28></a> It is much like Eve's naming of Cain.<a name=110:29></a>

		J.T.<a name=111:7></a> Yes.<a name=111:8></a> The mind immediately goes to the man that is identified with these offerings.<a name=111:9></a> He saw that there must be a new line, a new world really, which Cain did not see.<a name=111:10></a> He did not accept God's judgment on man, showing he "was born according to flesh" merely, and hence had no divine instincts.<a name=111:11></a> "He that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit", (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:29">Galatians  4:29</a>).<a name=111:12></a> Abel was, in principle, born according to the Spirit, he had spiritual instincts, and hence understood what was suitable to God.<a name=111:13></a> "Cain was of the wicked one", (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:12">1 John  3:12</a>).<a name=111:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=111:18></a> Yes.<a name=111:19></a> Abel is the first martyr.<a name=111:20></a> The Lord calls attention to the blood of <i>righteous</i> Abel.<a name=111:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=111:28></a>M.<a name=111:29></a> Do you think that as Abel brought these offerings to Jehovah, they had a formative effect upon him, so that he would not only see Christ there objectively, but that his walk was to be according to what they expressed?<a name=111:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=111:31></a> Quite so.<a name=111:32></a> Indeed, divine formation was already there, for the Lord calls him "righteous", and John says his works were righteous.<a name=111:33></a> The offerer is merged in his offering.<a name=111:34></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=112:16></a> That is the way John works it out in his first epistle.<a name=112:17></a> He deals with things radically and shows that these two men are the heads of two families, as already noted.<a name=112:18></a> So he says the devil sins from the beginning, and this goes right through.<a name=112:19></a> Cain, Balaam, and Core are seen as three great leaders in sin.<a name=112:20></a> The Lord says, "Ye are of the devil, as your father", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:44">John  8:44</a>).<a name=112:21></a> The Jews as putting Him to death were brothers of Cain.<a name=112:22></a> So today, hatred of a brother, as God views it, is murderous.<a name=112:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=222:2></a> In taking up this subject of war, we have, as in all others, to learn from God.<a name=222:3></a> This chapter, it seems to me, affords a good beginning, because in it we have God presented as in war.<a name=222:4></a> We learn from God as to everything, through Christ, and in this chapter God is definitely called a "<i>Man</i> of war" -- not a God of war.<a name=222:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=222:8></a> I think it is to bring the thought down to our understanding.<a name=222:9></a> Exodus is a foundational book in which the young believer is contemplated.<a name=222:10></a> The earlier chapters have young believers in view, and so in this section the children of Israel are led away from war; that is, from war with <i>certain</i> enemies, such as the Philistines; they are deliberately led of God away from these out of consideration for His people.<a name=222:11></a> In the first conflict the young believer is contemplated as being fought for -- somebody is fighting for him.<a name=222:12></a> But in chapter 17 he is attacked, and is called upon to fight.<a name=222:13></a> Here he is deliberately kept out of it by God's wise leadership, until he is equal for war.<a name=222:14></a> Therefore it seems to me that the book is foundational as to this subject, as it is to other subjects, but to this one particularly, as indicating how young believers are fought for by God in delivering them out of Egypt.<a name=222:15></a> He overthrows our enemies in our sight, and in that way we learn war objectively.<a name=222:16></a> Numbers will bring out how we are brought into it formally, we are enrolled as we reach manhood.<a name=222:17></a> But this book shows what God does <i>for</i> us in a military sense and <i>how</i> He does it.<a name=222:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=247:1></a> It came before us at our last reading that the children of Israel were not called upon to fight in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#14">Exodus  14</a>.<a name=247:2></a> Jehovah would fight for them.<a name=247:3></a> They were to learn war from what they saw, and inasmuch as we learn everything from God in Christ so they would see how <i>God</i> led in war; this is the first great lesson in this respect to be learnt by us.<a name=247:4></a> Israel had part in it, in the sense of being present, but the word was, "Jehovah will fight for you", and they celebrated in their song that He did fight for them.<a name=247:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought before us on this occasion is that we should see how the <i>people</i> are brought into the conflict.<a name=247:6></a> Moses directed Joshua: "Choose us men, and go out, fight with Amalek".<a name=247:7></a> The people are now brought into conflict formally, although not yet ordered militarily.<a name=247:8></a> They are under Joshua, chosen by him, but in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1:3">Numbers  1:3</a> we have the statement, "all that go forth to military service;" not all that <i>should go</i>, but all that <i>go</i>; that is, the principle of going forth in military service is now acknowledged.<a name=247:9></a> I think that if we keep these thoughts before us we shall see, by the Lord's help, how the saints come into the conflict and how they are numbered militarily from twenty years old and upward.<a name=247:10></a> Each is to take his place, as it says in chapter 2, "every one by his standard, with the ensign of their father's house; round about the tent of meeting".<a name=247:11></a> Numbers contemplates that we are set in relation to the testimony; not yet in aggressive warfare, but defensive warfare.<a name=247:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=350:1></a> Attention was called to a statement in this book, namely, the wars of Canaan.<a name=350:2></a> It says, "And these are the nations that Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, all that had not known all <i>the wars of Canaan</i>; only that the generations of the children of Israel might know war by learning it, at the least those who before had known nothing thereof", (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#3:1">Judges  3:1</a>,2).<a name=350:3></a> It is therefore important that we keep this passage in mind in considering the subject before us.<a name=350:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The wars of Canaan have a peculiar place, and those who did not experience them were at a certain disadvantage; hence the book of Judges has in view a great change of circumstances in relation to war.<a name=350:5></a> Correspondingly, unless we understand something of the wars of Canaan, we too are at a disadvantage, and if God allows subsequent wars, it is that we might <i>know</i> war by learning it.<a name=350:6></a> To this end certain Canaanitish families were left in the land for Israel's and our profit.<a name=350:7></a> The principal battles, as we saw last time, were Jericho, Ai, Gibeon, and Merom.<a name=350:8></a> The battle of Gibeon (chapter 10), is outstanding in the sense that heaven directly intervened, God hearkening to the voice of a man.<a name=350:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=350:12></a> That is right.<a name=350:13></a> As partakers of the heavenly calling we dispute his right to be in heaven; hence the Canaanites who were in the land of promise had to be overthrown.<a name=350:14></a> This anticipates the war in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>, in which we learn that Satan and his angels are to be <i>literally</i> cast out.<a name=350:15></a> At the present

		J.T.<a name=390:1></a> We closed our last reading with the consideration of Samson, who slew a thousand men with the fresh jawbone of an ass.<a name=390:2></a> Another great incident in his warfare is the fact that he slew at his death more than those whom he had slain in his life.<a name=390:3></a> It is thought we should now go on to David, so as to pursue the subject as far as it appears in the Scriptures.<a name=390:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=390:5></a>W.<a name=390:6></a> Is there any link between Samson and David, in the fact that they both had much to do with the Philistine enemy?<a name=390:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=390:8></a> There is.<a name=390:9></a> What is said of David is that he <i>subdued</i> the Philistines.<a name=390:10></a> This is not said of Samson; his conquests were not so regular and persistent as David's.<a name=390:11></a> In <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#8">2 Samuel  8</a>it is said that David took Methegammah, or the power of the capital, out of their hand.<a name=390:12></a> It is a very great matter for the people of God, that such a position of advantage is taken out of the enemy's hands.<a name=390:13></a> Isolated victories over the enemy, of course, helped to weaken their power, but their subjugation awaited David's military service.<a name=390:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=390:17></a> Well, one thing to be noticed before we proceed is, that David is not to be regarded as consecutive to what preceded.<a name=390:18></a> In a certain sense he may be consecutive as applied to our experience, but he is, properly speaking, collateral with Moses and Aaron as a type.<a name=390:19></a> Moses and Aaron represent the ministry, that is, they represent Christ more in His official capacity as Apostle and High Priest;

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=391:8></a> Well, it is important to have in our minds the distinction mentioned, because the time arrives in the history of the believer when the personal attractiveness of Christ affects him.<a name=391:9></a> Earlier, what he needs is authority.<a name=391:10></a> Of course, the king has authority, but what precedes this is authority in Moses.<a name=391:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=391:15></a> Yes.<a name=391:16></a> It is through the failure of the priesthood, viewed officially, that the personal side becomes effective.<a name=391:17></a> In the twelve apostles we have that which is representative of Christ's authority, so that the apostles' doctrine is stressed in the early Acts, but afterwards it is Paul who brings in Christ from the standpoint of His personal attractiveness as the Son.<a name=391:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=408:1></a> At out last reading we considered the conflicts in the early part of David's history, leading up to the capture of mount Zion, the city of David.<a name=408:2></a> It was thought that we should reflect upon the further wars of David, but considering the extensive ground to be covered, we can only touch on a few scriptures.<a name=408:3></a> Chapter 8 gives a general account of the conquests of David; then in chapter 18 we have the war with Absalom, affording special instruction in our subject; and finally, we have the mighty men of David, who should come under our consideration because they are an outcome of his spirit and skill in these wars.<a name=408:4></a>

		We noticed last time, that when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up to seek him, but we did not enlarge on that incident.<a name=408:5></a> Chapter 5:17 to the end, indicates the character of the Philistine opposition, that is, the anointing in those who serve draws out their opposition, and it says that they spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.<a name=408:6></a> It says this twice, (verses 18 and 22).<a name=408:7></a> That is, in attacking, what is remarked by the Spirit of God here, this class of enemies <i>spread</i> themselves, they make as much show of strength as possible.<a name=408:8></a> Here it is in the valley of Rephaim, which would allude to human power.<a name=408:9></a> And another thing that comes out, which is especially to be noted, is that David inquired of Jehovah in regard of these two attacks.<a name=408:10></a> It is to bring out his dependence, as we saw earlier in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#23">1 Samuel  23</a>.<a name=408:11></a> During the attack at Keilah he prayed for guidance.<a name=408:12></a> It seems as if that is one of the most important lessons to be learnt in our consideration of David's service -- his dependence upon God in conflict.<a name=408:13></a> And another

		The second scripture in chapter 2 shows that priestly conditions were wanting where they should have been peculiarly, for in truth they did exist in Mary His mother, but they had lapsed, which is often the case with us.<a name=464:4></a> There is no opposition seen, but a great want of priestly care and consideration for Christ.<a name=464:5></a> Then in the third scripture we have actual opposition in the temple.<a name=464:6></a> But He is now seen in fulness of strength as a Man, having scope and power in Himself to deal with conditions in the temple; and He <i>does</i> deal with them.<a name=464:7></a>

		Now I come to these points in the order in which I read the scriptures, first in regard of priestly conditions where things are small in the testimony.<a name=464:8></a> I use the word <i>testimony</i> because Christ is seen in this way in all these scriptures.<a name=464:9></a> It is a question of testimony in every instance.<a name=464:10></a> How essential are priestly conditions when the testimony is in a small way, meaning perhaps that it has just begun or had a small effect!<a name=464:11></a> How incongruous it would have been to heaven and all who are spiritual if the Lord Jesus had come in as a Babe into the temple without finding priestly hands there!<a name=464:12></a> How wanting the whole scene would have been!<a name=464:13></a> How utterly out of keeping with what had been divinely intended, that, coming in as a Babe, as He did, He should find coldness and opposition!<a name=464:14></a> God would speak to us, now, I believe, as to this point, for where things are small, where the work of God has just begun, or has not had a very great effect, aside from priestly conditions the work must cease; it must, as it were, die out.<a name=464:15></a> I am not speaking of Christ personally; I am speaking of Him in a way that is figurative of conditions that may be found, and are being found, at the present time.<a name=464:16></a>
